On 17 June 2010, they faced Pre-Trial Chamber I, which ruled that there are reasonable grounds for their prosecution. Just as in the case against Abu Garda, the Prosecutor has not made a request for warrants of arrest against them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{warrant for}} his {{apprehension}} was sent out on Sunday night, 29 September. At {{the suggestion of}} Danby, Colman's papers were to be searched for thoroughly. William Bedloe carried the warrant to apprehend Colman and search for his papers; Oates, in an inspired bluff, had already suggested that if Colman's letters were opened, and in particular his letters to Father La Chaise, they would contain treasonable matter, [...] "which might cost him his neck". Whether this was his own notion, {{or whether it was}} suggested to him by someone else, is unclear. Colman's papers were found, some of recent date in paper bags; incriminating letters of earlier years were in a deal box, slightly nailed down. The Government expressed its surprise that after several days warning Colman should have made so little effort to hide them properly: a new pavement had recently been laid in the house, though it is not clear if it was intended as a hiding place. Inexplicably, Colman continued to deny having written the letters for several weeks after they were discovered. It is possible, as Kenyon suggests, that after a lapse of four or five years he had actually forgotten writing them, or perhaps he did not recall how incriminating their contents were. [...] The letters were carried off, but Colman's wife declared him to be absent, and to the Government's later embarrassment she persuaded the searchers to let her keep several bundles of letters which she claimed were personal. His sister also removed a trunk full of documents from his house a week later, rousing further suspicions about what her brother was concealing. On Monday morning he came forward voluntarily, and offered himself to the Secretary of State, Sir Joseph Williamson. In the afternoon he was heard before Sir Robert Southwell, and others of the Privy Council, in the presence of Oates, who was unable to recognise him. He made so [...] "voluble and fair a defence", urging his <b>voluntary</b> <b>appearance</b> as proof of his innocence, that the Council, exhausted by the long day's proceedings, decided not to order his arrest. He was only committed to the care of a messenger, and his papers were not searched carefully till a week later.|$|E

This is elementary and fundamental, {{and goes to the}} essence of the judgment. And such jurisdiction must be secured through the actual service of process upon the defendant against whom the judgment is sought or through his <b>voluntary</b> <b>appearance</b> in the action...|$|E

They were {{unsealed}} on 15 June 2010, immediately {{before the two}} suspects' <b>voluntary</b> initial <b>appearance</b> before the Court. They were charged with three counts of war crimes: violence to life, pillaging and attacking peacekeepers.|$|R

In this study, {{we found that}} onset of elderly men in voluntary movement tasks were significantly slower and greater equipotential than young men. Those was suggested that the movement continuance years and the experience before the senile state influence the movement preparation stage according to the movement problem accomplishment {{to say nothing of}} the influence by aging. These findings suggested that not only the cortical activity of the motor area corresponding to the movement but also for the senior citizen to precede <b>voluntary</b> movement <b>appearance,</b> to begin the cortical activity for the movement preparation at the early stage at MRCP, and to improve the cortical activity in the entire area related to the movement, and to maintain the action appearance by the interaction of the activation of a time factor and the cortical activity...|$|R

Drie verordening en zijn op dit moment van kracht: · de verordening betreffende de rechterlijke bevoegdheid, de erkenning en de tenuitvoerlegging van beslissingen in burgerlijke en handelszaken (de Brussel I-vo); · de verordening betreffende de bevoegdheid en de erkenning en tenuitvoerlegg ing van beslissingen in huwelijkszaken en inzake de ouderlijke verantwoordelijkh eid (de Brussel IIbis-vo); · de insolventieverordening (insolventie-vo). De thesis vertrekt van het perspectief van derde staten. Vier hoekstenen worden geïdentificeerd: · de woonplaats van de verweerder; · exclusieve bevoegdheidsgronden; · forumbedingen; · procedurele regels die een nauw verband vertonen met de internationale bevoegdheid. In de laatste plaats bestudeert de thesis de externe bevoegdheden van de Europese Gemeenschap en of deze bevoegdheid exclusie f is dan wel gedeeld wordt met de lidstaten van de Europese Unie.
