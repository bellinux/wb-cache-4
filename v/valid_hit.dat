5000|$|The {{acknowledgement}} of <b>valid</b> <b>hits</b> received by a combatant {{is one of}} the most controversial aspects of SCA armoured combat. The first issue is that the judgment of a hit is entirety subjective. A fighter's perception of a hit is affected by armour type and location, the normal variation in human perception to pressure and pain, fatigue, battle focus, hits taught as acceptable during training and warm-up ("calibration"), and personal opinion. The result is an identical blow thrown with identical force will be taken as valid by one fighter, but not another. While some regions develop noticeable patterns on the amount of force required for a blow to be considered valid, there is still considerable variance between fighters. The typical solution within the society is to have fighters warm up before a formal bout by mutually exchanging hits and providing feedback, called [...] "calibrating". However, this still does not establish a meaningful standard, and there are still great variations between fighters.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : We perform fast screen-space {{ray tracing}} through single- and multi-layered depth representations. Because we {{efficiently}} obtain <b>valid</b> <b>hits</b> from occluded geometry, our approach can address many problems of traditional screen-space methods. Examples: (a) Reference view color+depth buffers {{for the first}} (top) and second layer (bottom). (b) Large camera motion produces extensive disocclusions (top, red), which are difficult to inpaint by forward warping (bottom). (c) Our compressed depth representation lowers the required ray-AABB intersection count (top, black corresponds to 0 and white to 9 intersections) and allows for an efficient reprojection with only two depth+color layers (bottom). (d) Our ray-tracing approach generalizes well to other real-time applications, including depth-of-field rendering (top) and light-field rendering (bottom). We propose an efficient acceleration structure for real-time screen-space ray tracing. The hybrid data structure represents the scene ge-ometry by combining a bounding volume hierarchy with local pla-nar approximations. This enables fast empty space skipping while tracing and yields exact intersection points for the planar approx-imation. In combination with an occlusion-aware ray traversal our algorithm is capable to quickly trace even multiple depth layers. Compared to prior work, our technique improves {{the accuracy of the}} results, is more general, and allows for advanced image trans-formations, as all pixels can cast rays to arbitrary directions. We demonstrate real-time performance for several applications, includ-ing depth-of-field rendering, stereo warping, and screen-space ray traced reflections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCSIRO {{has been}} collaborating with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and Melbourne-based {{engineering}} companies to develop an automated scoring and performance analysis system for amateur boxing. The system comprises sensors built into boxing gloves, head guards and vests. The wearable components transmit data wirelessly to a computer for real-time ringside scoring. The introduction of an automated scoring system can only be justified if it outperforms {{the current system of}} judges. Determining a valid score automatically from a number of impact sensors and accelerometers embedded into vests, gloves and head guards requires novel data fusion and analysis. Techniques for combining the multiple wireless data streams and discriminating <b>valid</b> scoring <b>hits</b> from non-scoring hits, such as blocked hits, are presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Priority {{or right}} of way is the {{decision}} criterion used in foil and sabre fencing to determine which fencer receives the point if both fencers land a <b>valid</b> <b>hit</b> at the same time. In épée fencing, if both fencers land valid hits at the same time, they each receive a point. Because of this foil and sabre are considered conventional weapons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second issue}} with self {{acknowledgement}} of blows is that fighters {{are expected to}} have an uniform appraisal for hits received. Because of potential ambiguities, it is possible within the SCA's rules for some fighters to lapse into a [...] incentive that could underestimate or reject a <b>valid</b> <b>hit</b> in order to win a bout. While bouts are overseen by [...] "marshals" [...] who act as referees, they are prohibited from judging if a blow was valid from their perspective, though they can and on rare occasions have stopped bouts to provide descriptive information of past hits to the combatants and reaffirm the concepts of the honour system before the bout is resumed. This timely pause is very helpful in restoring a balance of judgement between combatants. However, there is currently no remedy under the rules for refusing to accept a <b>valid</b> <b>hit.</b> If an individual fighter demonstrates a blatant hit judgment problem then the offending individual acquires a reputation for being a dishonorable combatant, with the attendant social stigma. The slang term [...] "rhinohide" [...] was coined to refer to such fighters who have an obvious problem judging valid hits.|$|E
50|$|In sabre, the {{inadequacy}} of existing sensors has made it necessary to dispense with the requirement that a cut must be delivered with either the leading or the reverse edge of the blade and that, once again, it must arrive with sufficient force to have caused an injury had the blade been sharp (but not so forcefully as to injure your opponent with a blunt weapon!) At present, any contact between the blade and the opponent's target is counted as a <b>valid</b> <b>hit.</b> Some argue that this has reduced sabre to a two-man game of tag; others argue that this has made the game more sophisticated.|$|E
40|$|Time {{constraints}} in ball sports encourage {{players to}} take advantage of any relevant advance information available to prepare their actions. Advance information, therefore, can serve to prime movement parameters (e. g. movement direction) and reduce the amount of time required to prepare the upcoming movement. Regularly, however, players face situations in which the information used to prepare the action turns out to be outdated just prior to movement initiation and the prepared action needs to be changed as soon as possible. The aim of the experiment presented here was to determine whether the priming effect, generally reported for reaction time tasks, could be generalised to interceptive actions. A secondary aim was to examine the strategies employed by the participants to cope with valid, invalid, or no advance information. The results indicate that, when available, the participants used advance information to prepare their movements. More specifically, in comparison with <b>valid</b> advance information, <b>hit</b> rate and spatial accuracy were reduced when the participants had no advance information and were even smaller when the information conveyed was invalid. The results also suggest that in the absence of valid advance information, the strategies employed to intercept the moving target were tuned to the time remaining until the interception was due to occur.

5000|$|The foil {{is a light}} {{thrusting}} weapon with {{a maximum}} weight of 500 grams. The foil targets the torso, but not the arms or legs. The foil has a small circular hand guard that serves to protect the hand from direct stabs. As the hand is not a valid target in foil, this is primarily for safety. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with {{the side of the}} blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). Touches that land outside of the target area (called an off-target touch and signaled by a distinct color on the scoring apparatus) stop the action, but are not scored. Only a single touch can be award to either fencer {{at the end of a}} phrase. If both fencers land touches within a close enough interval of milliseconds to register two lights on the machine, the referee uses the rules of [...] "right of way" [...] to determine which fencer is awarded the touch, or if an off-target hit has priority over a <b>valid</b> <b>hit,</b> in which case no touch is awarded. If the referee is unable to determine which fencer has right of way, no touch is awarded.|$|E
5000|$|When the batsman {{successfully}} {{hits the}} ball, they drop the bat {{and make their}} way around the four bases (usually counter-clockwise), while {{the players in the}} catching team catch and throw the ball back to the designated catcher positioned by the outing base (brännplatta), who announces the end of the batting round with [...] "out" [...] (bränd, [...] "burned") when the catcher has made contact with the outing base whilst holding the ball. If a player from the batting team is caught between two bases {{at the end of the}} batting round, they move back to either the last visited base or first base (depending on the local rules) and the catching team scores a point. If a batsman is unsuccessful at batting after the three attempts allowed, they move to the first base and will run when the next batsman bats a <b>valid</b> <b>hit.</b> There are no restrictions on the number of players at each base. If all players on the batting team fail to reach the fourth base (and thus rejoin the queue) and no batsmen remain in the queue, the inner team is caught out ("utebrända"), and depending on local rules extra points may be awarded to the opposing team in return for the safe passage on the players to the queue. Alternatively, the inner team gets to switch sides as batting is often more lucrative for scoring points.|$|E
