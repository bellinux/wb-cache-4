40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of a combined <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency</b> and perceptual-motor training programme on the handwriting performance of Chinese children aged 6 to 9 years with handwriting difficulties (HWD). Methods: Twenty-six children with HWD were assigned randomly and equally into two groups. The training programme was provided over eight consecutive weeks with one session per week. The perceptual-motor group received training only on perceptual-motor functions, including visual spatial relationship, visual sequential memory, visual constancy, visual closure, graphomotor control and grip control. The combined training group received additional training components on <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency,</b> including accommodation, ocular motility, and binocular fusion. <b>Visual</b> <b>efficiency,</b> visual perceptual skills, and Chinese handwriting performance were assessed before and after the training programme. Results: The results showed statistically significant improvement in handwriting speed after the training in both groups. However, the combined training gave no additional benefit on improving handwriting speed (ANCOVA: F= 0. 43, p= 0. 52). In terms of <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency,</b> participants in the combined training group showed greater improvement in amplitude of accommodation measured with right eye (F= 4. 34, p< 0. 05), left eye (F= 5. 77, p< 0. 05) and both eyes (F= 11. 08, p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Although the additional <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency</b> training did not provide further improvement in the handwriting speed of children with HWD, children showed improvement in their accommodation amplitude. As accommodative function is important for providing sustainable and clear near vision in the process of reading and word recognition for writing, the effect of the combined training on handwriting performance should be further investigated.

Participants responded to {{the presence or absence}} of a singleton arrow that was presented among multiple nontargets. When the singleton arrow was present, observers pressed a button with their right index finger, when it was absent they pressed with their left-index finger. SR-compatibility depended on the relation between the identity of the target and the present response: Even though the identity of the target singleton arrow (whether it was pointing to the right or left) was irrelevant to the task, the direction could be corresponding (right arrow) or noncorresponding (left arrow) with a target present response (the right hand). To examine the time-course of performance target-distractor similarity was varied to increase or decrease <b>visual</b> search <b>efficiency</b> and accordingly response latency. There were three main findings. First, the results of Experiment 1 showed that observers were no faster to respond 'present' when the singleton arrow pointed to the right (corresponding to the right hand) than when it pointed left (noncorresponding to the right hand) in a simple present-absent detection task. Second, only when observers were encouraged to process the identity of the arrow singleton, an effect of an SR-compatibility effect was found which developed over time. Third, the time-course of SR-compatibility was not influenced by <b>visual</b> search <b>efficiency.</b> The results of the present work suggest that visual selection and response selection occur in different stages. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{recent study}} found that, across individuals, gray matter volume in the frontal polar region was {{correlated}} with visual metacognition capacity (i. e., how well one's confidence ratings distinguish between correct and incorrect judgments). A question arises {{as to whether the}} putative metacognitive mechanisms in this region are also used in other metacognitive tasks involving, for example, memory. A novel psychophysical measure allowed us to assess metacognitive efficiency separately in a visual and a memory task, while taking variations in basic task performance capacity into account. We found that, across individuals, metacognitive efficiencies positively correlated between the two tasks. However, voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed distinct brain structures for the two kinds of metacognition. Replicating a previous finding, variation in <b>visual</b> metacognitive <b>efficiency</b> was correlated with volume of frontal polar regions. However, variation in memory metacognitive efficiency was correlated with volume of the precuneus. There was also a weak correlation between <b>visual</b> metacognitive <b>efficiency</b> and precuneus volume, which may account for the behavioral correlation between visual and memory metacognition (i. e., the precuneus may contain common mechanisms for both types of metacognition). However, we also found that gray matter volumes of the frontal polar and precuneus regions themselves correlated across individuals, and a formal model comparison analysis suggested that this structural covariation was sufficient to account for the behavioral correlation of metacognition in the two tasks. These results highlight the impor tance of the precuneus in higher-order memory processing and suggest that there may be functionally distinct metacognitive systems in the human brain.

40|$|M. Phil. Tinted {{spectacle}} lenses {{have long been}} worn to provide ocular protection from harmful electromagnetic radiation during recreational activities. Controversy exists surrounding the colour of the spectacle tints and the environmental conditions under which these tints are worn. There is little scientific evidence to substantiate the many opinions of authors {{on the effects of}} tinted {{spectacle lenses}} on visual skills and, ultimately, on overall performance in recreational situations. This study serves to provide scientific data concerning the effects of tinted lenses on static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour vision, stereopsis and visual evoked potential (VEP). These results are related to the visible spectrum transmission curve for each experimental lens. recommendations are then made concerning the environmental conditions under which each lens tint should be worn. The HOYA ULT- 2000 Light Transmission Metre was used to establish the percentage of visible light being transmitted through each of the experimental lenses. The DMS 80 / 90 Visible Spectrophotometer was used to generate a visible spectrum transmission curve for each of the 8 experimental lenses used in this study. 30 subjects (Group A) were randomly selected from the RAU student population for the assessment of the effects of tinted lenses static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour vision and stereopsis. 10 students (Group B) were then randomly selected from the RAU student population for the assessment of the effects of tinted experimental lenses on visual evoked potential (VEP). The ametropic subjects in Groups A and B all wore their habitual spectacle or contact lens corrections throughout the testing procedure. The following lens tint colours were used: clear, black, grey, yellow, green, blue, red and pink. The subjects were evaluated binocularly without any tinted lens being worn, then through each of the 8 tinted experimental lenses (randomly presented). Results of the visual skills and VEP testing were analysed as follows: Group A: An average score was calculated for the results achieved on the static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour vision and stereopsis tests when no experimental lenses were worn. This average was then compared to the average static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour vision and stereopsis scores for each of the 8 experimental lenses. Group B: An average score was calculated for each of the amplitude and latency components of the VEP waveforms generated when no experimental lenses are worn. This average was then compared to the average amplitude and latency components generated when each of the 8 experimental lenses (as for Group A) are worn. Static visual acuity was assessed using a Snellen visual acuity letter chart at 6 m. Contrast sensitivity was assessed using a Vistech VCTS 6500 Contrast Sensitivity Chart at 3 m. Colour vision assessment was performed using the lshihara Colour Vision Test and the City University Colour Vision Test. The Random Dot Near Stereo Test was used to assess stereopsis. The Nicolet Pathfinder II was used to assess visual evoked potentials (VEPs). The results of this study show that the black, grey, yellow, green, blue, red and pink tinted lenses have a statistically significant influence on <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency</b> only when subjective methods (i. e. static visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour -vision and stereopsis) of <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency</b> assessment are used. The tinted lenses had little effect on <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency</b> when an objective means (i. e. VEP) of assessment was used, as there were no statistically significant differences between the lenses. The results of this research project indicate that the colour of the lens tint has little real effect on <b>visual</b> <b>efficiency,</b> when measured objectively. The effect of the lens tint is shown to be highly subjective. Tinted lens selection would therefore be based on personal preference and the amount of protection that the lens provides from harmful electromagnetic radiation. It can be concluded that no single lens tint is therefore suitable for all individuals under the same environmental conditions...|$|E

30|$|On mobile touch devices, {{efficiency}} {{refers to}} quick access to apps {{with a minimum}} of resources spent on the search. However, the increasing number of available apps forces users into a complex and inefficient visual search task. The complex search dynamic arises from factors such as the available screen size of mobile devices, similarity of app icons, the need to swipe through several smartphone pages, diverse use-environments (e.g. on a train, while walking), differing goals and use cases leading to altering target apps, and the need for complex motoric responses (e.g. touch displays with little or no haptic feedback). The search for an app icon is even further complicated because phone manufacturers often implement the possibility to adjust (“individualize”) the spatial icon array. Even though personalization can allow quicker access to certain apps, most phone manufacturers limit the degrees of freedom offered to arrange app icons and personalized arrangements can be altered by updates. Hence, human-centered app icon design faces the challenge of facilitating the complex visual search task on mobile touch devices. Our goal was to transfer knowledge from basic research on visual search to the field of human–computer interaction and app icon design, with the aim of providing mobile touch device users with a fluent experience when searching for an app. We first examined <b>visual</b> search <b>efficiency</b> for app icon selection by similarity grouping with universally applicable colored icons (Study 1). <b>Visual</b> search <b>efficiency</b> was then further investigated with regard to the appeal of these colored icons and their effect on the perception of the interaction qualities in terms of UX (Study 2).

This technique combines adjacency matrices readability of large graphs and flow diagrams <b>visual</b> design <b>efficiency</b> for weighting depiction. Associated to Big Data computing and lightweight web rendering, our tool allows to depict and interact in real time on huge dataset and supports user multi-scale exploration and analysis. To show the efficiency of Adjasankey, we present a case study on the analysis of a Customer to Customer website...|$|R
50|$|The third theory {{contends that}} there is greater {{interference}} of object-based attention when any flanking distractors (e.g., visual scene crowding or noise) are present. Particularly, if these distractors {{belong to the same}} object or object-group as that being attended (noise similar), as opposed to coming from different objects (noise dissimilar) — irrespective of the distinguishing characteristics of the objects themselves (e.g., colour, motion direction, shape, orientation). An influencing element is that an object-like representation can engage attention even when it is not the intended target of a visual search. Therefore, an important consideration is that the perceptual resemblance between distractors and a target object influences the <b>efficiency</b> of <b>visual</b> search; increases in similarity among the distractors, increases search <b>efficiency.</b> Similarly, <b>visual</b> search <b>efficiency</b> increases the less similar the target is to the distractors.|$|R
