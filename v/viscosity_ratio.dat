The oil viscosity depends on temperature as, μ_o=exp(B/T), where B is a physico-chemical parameter {{depending on the type of}} oil, and T is the temperature. A temperature gradient is applied across the medium in the flow direction. Initially, the porous medium is saturated with oil and, then, another fluid is injected. We have considered two cases representing different injection strategies. In the first case, the invading fluid viscosity is constant (finite <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio)</b> while in the second one, the invading fluid is inviscid (infinite <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio).</b> Our results show that, for the case of finite <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio,</b> recovery increases with Δ T independently on strength or sign of the gradient.

The experimental results are first {{compared with the}} predictions of the model by Maffettone and Minale [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 78, 227 - 241 (1998) ] for bulk flow. For all <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios,</b> deviations from the Maffettone and Minale model start to occur at a droplet diameter to gap spacing ratio {{of the order of}} 0. 4.

In the Stokes regime, the dominant wavenumber for most <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios</b> increases with the elasticity number; for filament to matrix <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios</b> ranging from about 0. 03 to 0. 4, the dominant wavenumber decreases when the elasticity number increases.

40|$|The linear {{stability}} of a steadily moving bubble or {{a finger in}} a Hele–Shaw cell is considered in the case when gravity and the ratio between the viscosities of the less and more viscous fluids are nonzero. The effect of gravity is easily incorporated by a transformation of parameters introduced previously by Saffman and Taylor [Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. A 245, 312 (1958) ] for the steady flow, which makes the time-dependent flows with and without gravity equivalent. For the nonzero <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio,</b> the transformation of parameters introduced by Saffman and Taylor also makes steady finger and bubble flows with nonzero and zero viscosity ratios equivalent. However, for the unsteady case, {{there is no such}} equivalence and so a complete calculation is carried out to investigate the effect of the nonzero <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio</b> on the {{stability of}} fingers and bubbles. The incorporation of the finite <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio</b> is found not to qualitatively alter the linear stability features obtained in earlier work for the zero <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio,</b> although there are quantitative differences in the growth or decay rate of various modes. For any surface tension, numerical calculation suggests that the McLean–Saffman branch of bubbles [Phys.

The previous analytic theory for the stability of the finger in the limit of zero surface tension is extended to include the case of the finite <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is found that, {{as in the case of}} bubbles, the finite <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio</b> does not alter qualitatively any of the features obtained previously for the zero <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E

The full Navier-Stokes equations are solved by a finite difference/front tracking method that allows a fully deformable interface between the drop and the suspending medium and {{the inclusion of the}} surface tension. In the limit of a small Reynolds number (1 <), the direction of motion of the drop depends on the ratio of the viscosity of the drop fluid to the viscosity of the ambient fluid. At finite Reynolds numbers, the drop migrates to an equilibrium lateral position about halfway between the wall and the centerline (the Segre-Silberberg effect). Results are presented over a range of capillary number, Reynolds number, <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio</b> and drop size. As the Reynolds number increases or capillary number or <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases, the equilibrium position moves closer to the wall.

40|$|The {{creeping}} motion {{through a}} circular tube of neutrally buoyant Newtonian drops which have an undeformed radius {{comparable to that}} of the tube was studied experimentally. Both a Newtonian and a viscoelastic suspending fluid were used {{in order to determine the}} influence of viscoelasticity. The extra pressure drop owing to the presence of the suspended drops, the shape and velocity of the drops, and the streamlines of the flow are reported for various <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios,</b> total flow rates and drop sizes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLaboratory {{models have}} been {{conducted}} to improve {{our understanding of the}} role that the resistance of the slab to bending and its coupling to the ambient mantle play in subduction dynamics over geological time scales. Our models are set up with a viscous plate of silicone (lithosphere) subducting under negative buoyancy in a viscous layer of glucose syrup (mantle). For our study, the lithosphere/upper mantle viscosity contrast has been systematically varied, from similar to 10 to similar to 10 (5) in order to explore the parameter space between weak and strong slab dynamics. We found that subduction is characterized by a retreating mode for <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios</b> > 10 (4), by the coexistence of a retreating mode and an advancing mode for <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios</b> between similar to 10 (4) and similar to 10 (2), and quasi-stationary, Rayleigh-Taylor like behaviour for ratios < 10 (2). By combining our experimental results and kinematic data from current subduction zones in four reference frames which differ in the amount of net rotation, we infer that a lithosphere/upper mantle viscosity contrast of 150 - 500 is necessary to obtain realistic trench/subducting plate velocity ratios as well as the variability of subduction styles observed in nature...|$|R
40|$|We have {{presented}} a multiphase incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics method with an improved interface treatment procedure. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of}} the interface treatment which can handle multiphase flow problems with high density and <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios,</b> we have modeled several challenging two phase flow problems; namely, single vortex flow, square droplet deformation, droplet deformation in shear flow, and finally the Newtonian bubble rising in viscous and viscoelastic liquids. The proposed interface treatment includes the usage of (i) different smoothing functions (in this work, cubic spline kernel function for discretizing equations associated with the calculation of the surface tension force while the quintic spline for the discretization of governing equations and the relevant boundary conditions), and (ii) a new discretization scheme for calculating the pressure gradient. It is shown that with the application of the improved interface treatment, it becomes possible to model multiphase flow problems with the density and <b>viscosity</b> <b>ratios</b> up to 1000 and 100 respectively while using standard projection method. The utilization of cubic spline for the continuum surface force model significantly improves the quality of the calculated interface, thereby eliminating the interphase particle penetrations, and in turn leading to the calculation of more accurate velocity and pressure fields...|$|R
