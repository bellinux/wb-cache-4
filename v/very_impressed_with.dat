5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme music}} was {{composed}} by Peter Davis (who {{after the second}} series composed {{the rest of the}} series alone as principal composer), John Mealing and John G. Perry. The opening titles show the main characters striking a pose, with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Steven Moffat and Julia Sawalha were not <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> the opening titles when discussing them for a DVD commentary in 2004.

25|$|Clark {{had been}} <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Gerhard Bersu's {{excavation}} of the Iron Age settlement of Little Woodbury in Wiltshire in 1938 and 1939. After the war, {{he decided to}} excavate an Iron Age settlement nearer to Cambridge using the same techniques as Bersu had used. An amateur archaeologist had found early Iron Age pottery on Micklemoor Hill near West Harling in Norfolk, and Clark began an excavation of the site in 1948. However, before Clark could finish the excavation, he was distracted by a new project.|$|E
25|$|In 189, {{when the}} {{regional}} official Zhang Miao was rallying an army {{to join the}} campaign against Dong Zhuo, Dian Wei answered the call and became a subordinate of Zhao Chong (趙寵), a Major (司馬) in Zhang Miao's force.

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Shu, Zhang Wen received {{a warm welcome}} and was invited to the imperial court to meet the Shu emperor, Liu Shan. He praised Liu Shan for having many talents in his imperial court, and compared him to the Shang dynasty ruler Wu Ding and King Cheng of the Zhou dynasty. He then explained that Wu actually wished to maintain friendly ties with Shu, but had to unwillingly submit to Wei because it lacked the military power to resist Wei. He also expressed his gratitude {{to the people of}} Shu for their hospitality. The Shu court was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> him and regarded him highly.|$|E
25|$|Sometime before 208, {{when the}} warlord Cao Cao wanted to recruit him {{to serve in}} the government, Sima Yi lied that he {{suffered}} from paralysis and stayed at home. One day, while Sima Yi was drying his books under the sun, there was a sudden downpour, so he immediately rushed out to collect his books. One of his maids saw what happened. Zhang Chunhua was worried that the maid would leak out news that Sima Yi was well and get their family into trouble, so she killed the maid to silence her. She then personally prepared meals for the family. Sima Yi was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> her.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Army {{had been}} <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> the {{performance}} of the 25cm experimental sets and became interested in using it as a range finder in a Gun Laying radar. Operators would point the radar at targets indicated to them by search radars, and from then on the radar information would be fed to the analogue computers that aimed the guns. Power was not a serious concern in this case as the range would be relatively short. The Air Defence Experimental Establishment (ADEE) of the Army was working on this using the klystron design from Birmingham and British Thomson-Houston (BTH) as their industrial partner.|$|E
60|$|Pyrrhus {{was not at}} all displeased {{with this}} answer, blunt as it may seem. On the contrary, he seems to have been <b>very</b> deeply <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> a sense of the stern and incorruptible virtue of Fabricius's character, and he felt a strong desire to obtain the {{services}} of such an officer in his own court and army. He accordingly made new proposals to Fabricius, urging him to use his influence to induce the Romans to make peace, and then to go with him to Epirus, and enter into his service there.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas was a Detroit {{teenager}} who had entered {{some of his}} songs into a local radio talent show, which record producer Frank Wilson happened to tune into.

60|$|<b>Very</b> greatly <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> {{what had}} taken place, the little band marched {{out from the}} church, {{surrounded}} by their friends. Jean Martin then presented hatchets or light picks to each, and a waist belt in which the tools should be carried. As a rule, the peasants carried leathern belts over the shoulders, in which a sword, hatchet, or other weapon was slung; but Jean thought the waist belt {{would be much more}} convenient for getting rapidly through hedges or thickets, and it had also the advantage that a long knife, constituting in itself a formidable weapon, could also be carried in it.|$|R
25|$|In 1935, Watson-Watt {{was asked}} to judge recent reports of a German radio-based death ray and turned the request over to Wilkins. Wilkins {{returned}} a set of calculations demonstrating the system was basically impossible. When Watson-Watt then asked what such a system might do, Wilkins recalled the earlier report about aircraft causing radio interference. This revelation led to the Daventry Experiment of 26 February 1935, using a powerful BBC shortwave transmitter as the source and their GPO receiver setup in a field while a bomber flew around the site. When the plane was clearly detected, Hugh Dowding, the Air Member for Supply and Research was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> their system's potential and funds were immediately provided for further operational development. Watson-Watt's team patented the device in GB593017.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Cao Ren followed Cao Cao on {{a campaign}} against the warlord Zhang Xiu, and was authorised to lead a separate force to raid the counties around Zhang Xiu's base in Wan (宛; or Wancheng, present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan) and he captured over 3,000 civilians. Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao initially, but rebelled later and launched a surprise attack, {{which led to the}} Battle of Wancheng. Cao Cao was defeated and he retreated after his forces succeeded in repelling further attacks by Zhang Xiu. However, as they were withdrawing, Zhang Xiu attacked again and Cao Cao's men were unable to drive the enemy away. The morale of Cao Cao's army started falling but Cao Ren helped to raise the soldiers' spirits by encouraging and inspiring them. Cao Cao was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Cao Ren, and he managed to defeat Zhang Xiu later in a counterattack.|$|E
25|$|In 207, Zhang Liao {{followed}} Cao Cao on {{a campaign}} against Yuan Shang, who had allied with the Wuhuan tribes in northern China. When Cao Cao was preparing to attack the enemy in Liucheng (柳城; present-day Xingcheng, Liaoning), Zhang Liao warned him that Jing Province's Governor Liu Biao take advantage of his absence from Xu to send Liu Bei to attack Xu and {{take control of the}} capital. However, Cao Cao felt that Liu Biao would not send Liu Bei to attack Xu because he did not trust Liu Bei, so he proceeded with the campaign against Yuan Shang and the Wuhuan. When they encountered the enemy, Zhang Liao displayed great fervour and strongly urged Cao Cao to launch an attack. Cao Cao was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Zhang Liao and he passed him his personal signal flag. Zhang Liao led the assault on the Wuhuan at White Wolf Mountain (白狼山; near present-day Lingyuan, Liaoning), defeated them and executed the Wuhuan chieftain Tadun.|$|E
50|$|The Zebra was {{the third}} ship after the Bengalee and Prince George that brought Prussian Lutheran {{migrants}} to South Australia.

5000|$|Narayanrao Babasaheb Ghorpade, the Ruler of [...] Ichalkaranji State, {{which is}} near Sangli, {{requested}} Goheen to administer the Ichalkaranji State while Ghorpade was visiting Europe.

25|$|Thereafter, the Grants {{returned}} to Italy, arriving in Rome and departed Vandalia {{where they were}} promptly approached by an emissary from Pope Leo XIII and invited to attend a ceremony with King Umberto after their visit to the Vatican. While they were visiting the Holy See Julia's cross was blessed by the Pope. During their visit to the Vatican, the Pope chatted for a while with Grant in French, while Grant's son, Jesse, translated. Among other things, the Pope expressed his regrets that religious instruction was not allowed in public schools. While in Rome, Grant visited the Colosseum, the Arch of Titus and Arch of Constantine. However, he quickly walked by Rome's famous marble statuary almost ignoring it completely and did not seem <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> the many paintings, much to the disappointment of Adam Badeau, who later remarked that Grant seemed blind to the beauties of art. While in Venice, Grant made remarks about the canals, noting {{that they needed to}} be cleaned.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Volume V of the History, which covered {{the years between}} 1881 and 1915, {{appeared}} in 1981, Clark had increasingly withdrawn from political controversy. The retirement of Whitlam after his defeats at the 1975 and 1977 elections removed {{the main focus of}} Clark's political loyalty – he was not <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> Whitlam's pragmatic successor, Bill Hayden, and even less impressed with Hayden's chief rival, Bob Hawke, whom Clark had known since his student days at ANU and regarded as lacking in principle. In addition, Clark, although only in his mid 60s, was in poor health, already suffering from the heart problems that were to overshadow his final years. In any case, Clark made it clear in this volume that his enthusiasm for Whitlam had not changed his views of the Labor Party as a party: Labor's founding leaders, Chris Watson and Andrew Fisher, he wrote, were dull and unimaginative men, who wanted no more than that working men should have a modest share of the prosperity of bourgeois Australia. The real hero of Volume V was Alfred Deakin, leader of enlightened middle-class liberalism, and (like Clark) a product of Melbourne Grammar and Melbourne University.|$|E
25|$|After {{his third}} pilgrimage to Mecca, Ibn Battuta decided to seek {{employment}} with the Muslim Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq.

He crossed the Red Sea and the Eastern Desert to reach the Nile valley and then headed north to Cairo. From there he crossed the Sinai Peninsula to Palestine and then travelled north again through some of the towns that he had visited in 1326. From the Syrian port of Latakia, a Genoese ship took him (and his companions) to Alanya on the southern coast of modern-day Turkey. He then journeyed westwards along the coast to the port of Antalya. In the town he met members of one of the semi-religious fityan associations. These were a feature of most Anatolian towns in the 13th and 14th centuries. The members were young artisans and had at their head a leader with the title of Akhis. The associations specialised in welcoming travellers. Ibn Battuta was <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>with</b> the hospitality that he received and would later stay in their hospices in more than 25 towns in Anatolia. From Antalya Ibn Battuta headed inland to Eğirdir which was the capital of the Hamidids. He spent Ramadan (June 1331 or May 1333) in the city.|$|E
