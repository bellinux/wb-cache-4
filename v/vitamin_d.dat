5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b> Not only does the T-cell extend a <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E

5|$|Over 50% of MS {{patients}} may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly {{depending on the}} definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplementation is that studies show an association between <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hypoparathyroidism {{may present}} with {{symptoms}} associated with decreased calcium, and is generally treated with <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> analogues.|$|E
5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2016 {{there has}} been one large trial {{studying}} the use of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> to prevent pneumonia in children, which found no effect.|$|E
5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|Phosphate. PTH is {{the major}} {{regulator}} of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Through activation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> the absorption (intestinal) of Phosphate is increased.|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the heart, the blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b>|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), and <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> (rickets). In much of {{the developed}} world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in the genes for the <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but {{this may be due to}} confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{toxicity}} {{is treated}} by discontinuing <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplementation and restricting calcium intake. Kidney damage may be irreversible. Exposure to sunlight {{for extended periods}} of time does not normally cause <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> toxicity. The concentrations of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> precursors produced in the skin reach an equilibrium, and any further <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> produced is degraded.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> can be {{synthesized}} {{only by a}} photochemical process, so land vertebrates had to ingest {{foods that}} contained <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> or had {{to be exposed to}} sunlight to photosynthesize <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> in their skin to satisfy their <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> requirements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{deficiency}} causes osteomalacia (called rickets when {{it occurs}} in children). Use of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> in children with normal <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels {{does not appear to}} improve bone density. Beyond that, low serum <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels have been associated with falls, and low bone mineral density. Taking extra <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> however, does not appear to change the risk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{deficiency}} is {{more common}} in people with rheumatoid arthritis than in the general population. However, whether <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency is a cause or a consequence of the disease remains unclear. One meta-analysis found that <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels are low in people with rheumatoid arthritis and that <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> status correlates inversely with prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> is an {{essential}} regulator of the <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> receptor that controls gene transcription during development. The <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> receptor is strongly expressed in the substantia nigra. Accordingly, <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency can disrupt neurogenesis leading to altered dopamine signaling and increased exploratory behavior in rats. This is considered a rodent model of the schizophrenia phenotype and <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency has been proposed as {{an explanation for the}} increased incidence of schizophrenia among children that were conceived during winter months. A Finnish study found that <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplement use is associated with reduced risk of schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{differences}} in the <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> receptor in West African, Gujarati and Chinese populations have been noted to affect susceptibility to tuberculosis, {{but there is no}} data available in any population that shows <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplementation (that is, giving extra <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> to people with normal <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels) has any effect on susceptibility to TB.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{deficiency}} {{is widespread}} in the European population. European research is assessing <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake levels in association with disease rates and policies of dietary recommendations, food fortification, <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplementation, and small amounts of sun exposure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> is {{produced}} in the skin by ultraviolet light. Thus, higher UVB exposure raises human <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> in those deficient in it. Recent research (primarily since the Montreal Protocol) shows that many humans have less than optimal <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels. In particular, in the U.S. population, the lowest quarter of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> (<17.8nbsp&ng/ml) were found using information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey {{to be associated with}} an increase in all-cause mortality in the general population. While blood level of <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> in excess of 100nbsp&ng/ml appear to raise blood calcium excessively and to be associated with higher mortality, the body has mechanisms that prevent sunlight from producing <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> in excess of the body's requirements.|$|E
25|$|Dark-skinned {{people living}} in {{temperate}} climates {{have been shown to}} have low <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels but the significance of this is not certain. Dark-skinned people may be less efficient at making <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> because melanin in the skin hinders <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> synthesis.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, after {{studying}} nuclear fragments of intestinal cells, a specific binding protein for <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> called the <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> Receptor was identified by Mark Haussler and Tony Norman. In 1971–72, the further metabolism of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> to active forms was discovered. In the liver, <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{was found to}} be converted to calcifediol. Calcifediol is then converted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b> Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. The <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> metabolites, calcifediol and calcitriol, were identified by competing teams led by Michael F. Holick in the laboratory of Hector DeLuca and by Tony Norman and colleagues.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{deficiency}} {{correlates with}} cognitive impairment and dementia; however, {{the value of}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> substitution in cognitive impairment remains doubtful.|$|E
25|$|Insufficient {{evidence}} exists to recommend <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplements {{for people with}} cancer, although some evidence suggests that low <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{may be associated with}} a worse outcome for some cancers, and that higher 25-hydroxy <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels at the time of diagnosis are associated with better outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{content in}} typical foods is reduced variably by cooking. Boiled, fried and baked foods {{retained}} 6989% of original <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b>|$|E
25|$|With its <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> content being {{related to}} post-harvest treatment, the vitamin is not {{included}} in the listed nutritional content of mushrooms in the USDA nutrient database. However, when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light even after harvesting, natural ergosterols in mushrooms produce vitamin D2, a process now used to supply fresh <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> mushrooms for the functional food grocery market. In a comprehensive safety assessment of producing <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> in fresh mushrooms, researchers showed that artificial UV light technologies were equally effective for <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> production as in mushrooms exposed to natural sunlight, and that UV light has a long record of safe use for production of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> in food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency: Low {{circulating}} <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{is common}} {{among the elderly}} worldwide. Mild <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> insufficiency is associated with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. PTH increases bone resorption, leading to bone loss. A positive association exists between serum 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels and bone mineral density, while PTH is negatively associated with bone mineral density.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> needs {{can be met}} via {{the human}} body's own {{generation}} upon sufficient and sensible exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight. Products including milk, soy milk and cereal grains may be fortified to provide a source of <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D.</b> For {{those who do not}} get adequate sun exposure or food sources, <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplementation may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|While some meta-analyses {{have found}} a benefit of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{supplements}} combined with calcium for fractures, they did not find a benefit of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplements alone.|$|E
25|$|Dark-skinned {{people who}} live in high latitudes with mild {{sunlight}} are at an increased risk – especially in the winter – of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency. As a consequence of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency, they are at a higher risk of developing rickets, and numerous types of cancers, and possibly cardiovascular disease and low immune system activity. However, some recent studies have questioned if the thresholds indicating <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency in light-skinned individuals are relevant for dark-skinned individuals, as they found that on average dark-skinned individuals have higher bone density and lower risk of fractures than lighter-skinned individuals with the same levels of <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D.</b> This is attributed as possibly due to lower presence of <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> binding agents (and thus higher bioavailability) in dark-skinned individuals.|$|E
25|$|There are {{not many}} foods that {{naturally}} have <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b> Examples are cod liver oil and oily fish. If people cannot get sunlight, then they will need 1,000 IU of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> per day to stay healthy. A person would have to eat oily fish {{three or four times}} per week in order to get enough <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> from that food source alone.|$|E
25|$|Because {{most human}} cells and tissues have receptors for <b>vitamin</b> <b>D,</b> {{including}} T and B cells, adequate levels of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> can {{aid in the}} regulation of the immune system.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increase}} of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> synthesis, there is a decreased incidence of conditions {{that are related to}} common <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> deficiency conditions of people with dark skin pigmentation living in environments of low UV radition: rickets, osteoporosis, numerous cancer types (including colon and breast cancer), and immune system malfunctioning. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> promotes the production of cathelicidin, which helps to defend humans' bodies against fungal, bacterial, and viral infections, including flu. When exposed to UVB, the entire exposed area of body’s skin of a relatively light skinned person is able to between 10 - 20000 IU of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D.</b>|$|E
25|$|The UK National Health Service {{recommends}} {{babies and}} young children aged six months to five years, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and sun-deprived elderly people should take daily vitamin supplements to ensure sufficient <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> intake. In July 2016, Public Health England recommended that everyone consider taking a daily supplement containing 10µg of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> during autumn and winter because of inadequate sunlight for <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> synthesis.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{association between}} low <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> levels and a poor response to treatment has been reported. In vitro work {{has shown that}} <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> {{may be able to}} reduce viral replication. While this work looks promising the results of clinical trials are awaited. However, it has been proposed that <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> supplementation is important in addition to standard treatment, in order to enhance treatment response.|$|E
