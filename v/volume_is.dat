5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The <b>volume</b> <b>is</b> then encrypted as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the <b>volume</b> <b>is</b> considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E

5|$|HD 209458 b, {{also given}} the {{nickname}} Osiris, is an exoplanet that orbits the solar analog HD 209458 {{in the constellation}} Pegasus, some 150 light-years from the Solar System. The radius of the planet's orbit is 7 million kilometres, about 0.047 astronomical units, or one eighth the radius of Mercury's orbit. This small radius results in a year that is 3.5 Earth days long and an estimated surface temperature of about 1,000°C (about 1,800°F).

5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble <b>volume</b> <b>is</b> the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke <b>volume</b> <b>is</b> not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
