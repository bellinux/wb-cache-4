5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and South <b>Vietnamese</b> units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> claimed to have captured large numbers of South <b>Vietnamese</b> prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South <b>Vietnamese</b> government officials and employees, who reported to the North <b>Vietnamese</b> military authorities. The South <b>Vietnamese</b> military in Huế also surrendered vast quantities of weaponry, which included 140 tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Field {{research}} {{carried out}} by ethnologists such as Stefan Ehrentraut shows that {{only a minority of}} <b>Vietnamese</b> children attend public schools, with figures varying across different provinces. In Kampong Chhnang and Siem Reap where the <b>Vietnamese</b> live along the river banks, enrolment into public schools fare below 10%, whereas in other provinces such as Kampot and Kratie the proportion are higher. As the majority of <b>Vietnamese</b> do not carry citizenship papers, they were unable to enrol their children into public schools. For those who send their children to schools, most of them only attend school for a few years and seldom complete Grade 12 as <b>Vietnamese</b> parents were unable to afford school fees. <b>Vietnamese</b> students also faced difficulties in academic work, as classes are taught exclusively in the Khmer language, and <b>Vietnamese</b> children that grew up speaking <b>Vietnamese</b> at home have limited competency in Khmer. In some <b>Vietnamese</b> communities based in the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, there are private schools that are run by <b>Vietnamese</b> community associations and Christian organisations. The private schools cater the teaching of the <b>Vietnamese</b> language, and are mostly attended by children of impoverished families.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{it was the}} {{ordinary}} South <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers and their families who paid the ultimate price, as North <b>Vietnamese</b> artillery heavily destroyed much of the South <b>Vietnamese</b> military convoy on Route 7.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Vietnamese</b> {{as a whole}} exhibit {{varying levels}} of fluency in the Khmer and <b>Vietnamese</b> languages. <b>Vietnamese</b> that live in {{self-contained}} fishing communities along the Tonle Sap use <b>Vietnamese</b> in their day-to-day conversations and have individuals that have limited Khmer language skills {{and those that are}} bilingual in both languages. On the other hand, <b>Vietnamese</b> that live in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children to public schools, and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of <b>Vietnamese.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} which {{contributed to the}} {{destruction}} of the ARVN 2nd Brigade, II Corps Tactical Zone, was the inability of South <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of South <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of South <b>Vietnamese</b> civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families. Unfortunately for the South <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element of secrecy, which South <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders had hoped would enable them to pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North <b>Vietnamese.</b> It is hard to fathom how South <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders hoped to move 400,000 civilians in utmost secrecy. So when North <b>Vietnamese</b> forces attacked the South <b>Vietnamese</b> column along Route 7, there was little South <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vietnamese</b> Cambodians {{refer to}} ethnic <b>Vietnamese</b> living in Cambodia. They mostly reside in southeastern parts Cambodia {{bordering}} Vietnam or on boathouses in the Tonlé Sap lake and Mekong rivers. The first <b>Vietnamese</b> came to settle modern-day Cambodia {{from the early}} 19th century during {{the era of the}} Nguyễn lords, and most of the <b>Vietnamese</b> came to Cambodia during the periods of French colonial administration and the People's Republic of Kampuchea administration. During the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge governments in the 1970s, the <b>Vietnamese</b> were targets of mass genocides; thousands of <b>Vietnamese</b> were killed and many more sought refuge in Vietnam. Ethnic relations between the Khmers and <b>Vietnamese</b> are poor, and the <b>Vietnamese</b> have been the main target of xenophobic attacks by political parties since the 1990s. Most of the <b>Vietnamese</b> are stateless residents of Cambodia, and as a result they face difficulties in getting access to education, employment and housing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vietnamese</b> {{settlers}} {{began to}} settle in modern-day Cochinchina and Ho Chi Minh City from the 1620s onwards. To the Cambodians, these lands were known as Kampuchea Krom and traditionally {{under the control of}} the Khmer Empire. From the era of Chey Chettha II onwards, they came {{under the control of the}} Nguyễn lords. In 1813, Emperor Gia Long sent 10,000 <b>Vietnamese</b> troops into Phnom Penh and some members of the Cambodian royal family came under the control of the <b>Vietnamese</b> court. The Nguyen court imposed <b>Vietnamese</b> customs upon the Cambodian populace, and names of towns and provinces were changed to <b>Vietnamese</b> ones. <b>Vietnamese</b> settlers were encouraged {{to settle in}} Cambodia and official documents from the <b>Vietnamese</b> court recorded an average of 5,000 <b>Vietnamese</b> settlers coming into Cambodia in the 1830s. The policies imposed by the Nguyen court stirred resentment among the Cambodian populace and provoked occasional rebellions.|$|E
5|$|When Lon Nol assumed {{power in}} 1970, the Khmer Republic {{government}} launched a propaganda campaign {{to portray the}} ethnic <b>Vietnamese</b> as agents of the Vietcong. About 30,000 <b>Vietnamese</b> were arrested and killed in prison, while an additional 200,000 were repatriated to Vietnam. Five years later in 1975, some 200,000 to 250,000 <b>Vietnamese</b> remained in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge seized power. About three quarters of them were expelled to Vietnam, and the remaining 20,000 who remained {{are those who are}} of mixed-Vietnamese and Khmer descent. Those who remained were either killed or massacred by the regime. By the time <b>Vietnamese</b> troops entered Cambodia in 1979, virtually all of Cambodia's <b>Vietnamese</b> population were either displaced or killed. Vietnam established a new regime known as the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), and <b>Vietnamese</b> advisers were appointed in the new government administration. In 1983, the PRK government formulated an official policy to encourage former <b>Vietnamese</b> residents of Cambodia to return and settle down. <b>Vietnamese</b> immigrants who had no family ties to Cambodia also came to settle in the country, as there was little border control to limit <b>Vietnamese</b> migrants from entering the country. The <b>Vietnamese</b> were recognised as an official minority under the PRK regime, and Overseas <b>Vietnamese</b> Associations were established in parts of Cambodia with sizeable <b>Vietnamese</b> populations. The PRK government also identity cards were issued to them until the withdrawal of <b>Vietnamese</b> troops in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Across the Central Highlands of Vietnam, the South <b>Vietnamese</b> {{military}} {{enjoyed a}} numerical superiority of about 78,300 soldiers against North Vietnam’s 65,141 soldiers. However, within {{the vicinity of}} Ban Me Thuot, the South <b>Vietnamese</b> were actually outnumbered by a ratio of 5:1. The North <b>Vietnamese</b> had more tanks, armoured vehicles, and heavy artillery, with a ratio of about 2:1. North <b>Vietnamese</b> General Van Tien Dung believed his tank and artillery units in the Central Highlands were the key factors that guaranteed a quick victory, because South Vietnam simply lacked the capability to withstand such large numbers of heavy weaponry.|$|E
5|$|Almost 90% {{of ethnic}} <b>Vietnamese</b> are {{stateless}} residents of Cambodia, {{and do not}} carry citizenship papers such as identity cards or birth certificates. The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits <b>Vietnamese</b> residents born in Cambodia to take up citizenship, but faced resistance from mid-ranking interior ministry officials who generally refrain from registering <b>Vietnamese</b> residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if citizenship were to be granted. A minority of <b>Vietnamese</b> residents were able to obtain citizenship only after paying bribes to interior ministry officials, or were married to Khmer spouses. The minority of <b>Vietnamese</b> residents who hold citizenship reported of interior ministry officials confiscating their citizenship papers. As a result, the <b>Vietnamese</b> faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do not carry Cambodian citizenship. Stateless <b>Vietnamese</b> built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require citizenship papers. According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, interior ministry officials would confront <b>Vietnamese</b> fishermen in the Tonle Sap and demand bribes {{in order to allow}} them to carry out fishing.|$|E
5|$|Although the reaction, which {{included}} punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer <b>Vietnamese</b> serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, {{military and civilian}} authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening {{in the wake of}} the mutiny. A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic <b>Vietnamese</b> to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. This demonstrated French distrust of <b>Vietnamese</b> troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers – and thereby the <b>Vietnamese</b> population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Angkor, {{the seat}} of the Khmer Empire was {{subjected}} to <b>Vietnamese</b> influence as early as the 13th century. <b>Vietnamese</b> influence spread gradually and indirectly, and {{it was not until the}} early 19th century that Vietnam exercised direct control. In 1813, Nak Ong Chan gained the Cambodian throne with the help of Vietnam, and under his rule Cambodia became a protectorate. Following his death in 1834, Vietnam colonised Cambodia; it was governed under a <b>Vietnamese</b> administration and termed a <b>Vietnamese</b> ‘province’. Throughout the 1830s, Vietnam attempted to erase Khmer culture, which had derived the basis of Cambodian society, dress and religion from India rather than China. The trend of <b>Vietnamese</b> dominance continued during French colonization, under which Cambodia was forced to cede much of its southern cone (which would later be Saigon, the Mekong Delta and Tây Ninh) to the <b>Vietnamese.</b> The Khmer Rouge later justified their incursions into Vietnam as an attempt to regain the territories which Cambodia had lost during the previous centuries.|$|E
5|$|As most <b>Vietnamese</b> are {{stateless}} residents, {{they seek}} a living through ad-hoc various {{industries such as}} the construction, recycling and prostitution industries or as street pedlars. <b>Vietnamese</b> that live along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong rivers are subsistence fishermen. A sizeable number of these stateless <b>Vietnamese</b> consisted of migrants that came to Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 during the UNTAC administration. The majority of <b>Vietnamese</b> still {{live below the poverty}} line, although {{a very small number of}} <b>Vietnamese</b> are represented in the Cambodian business sector. One example is Sok Kong, the head of the business conglomerate Sokimex which owns state concessionaires in the country's petroleum, tourism and entrepot industries.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 on 29 January 1968, South <b>Vietnamese</b> forces began a 36-hour ceasefire {{in celebration}} of {{the arrival of the}} Year of the Monkey. Earlier, the communists had {{declared}} a seven-day ceasefire as part of the Tet festival, that was normally a period of truce and for community gatherings and family reunions in <b>Vietnamese</b> society. However, unbeknown to the South <b>Vietnamese</b> and their allies, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> leadership had decided to use the cease-fire to launch a large offensive in the south in order to break the deadlock that had developed in the conflict—despite the reluctance of Democratic Republic of Vietnam President Ho Chi Minh and Defence Minister General Vo Nguyen Giap.|$|E
5|$|At 2am on March 10, 1975, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> army {{began their}} assault on South <b>Vietnamese</b> forces at Ban Me Thuot. The North <b>Vietnamese</b> 198th Special Forces Regiment spearheaded the attack by hitting the Hoa Binh Airfield, the {{district}} of Mai Hac De, and {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The initial North <b>Vietnamese</b> attack, which was marked by heavy artillery bombardment and actions initiated by the 198th Special Forces Regiment, had shocked ARVN Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang, both subordinates of Major General Pham Van Phu. Despite the strength of the initial assault, Quang believed the North <b>Vietnamese</b> only wanted to cause disruption and would withdraw their forces by daybreak. By 3:30am, the 4th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment, had successfully secured Phan Chu Trinh Road and the southern part of Hoa Binh airport, and they waited there for the regular infantry and tank units to arrive.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00am on March 10, North <b>Vietnamese</b> {{soldiers}} of the 368th Artillery Regiment dragged 12 pieces of artillery which included 85mm, 105mm and 122mm guns onto the top of Nui Vu and Han Thon, and aimed their guns directly on Hill-211 and the administrative centre of Tien Phuoc, to support the 31st Regiment attacking those areas. At 1:30pm, following two failed counter-attacks, South <b>Vietnamese</b> units in Phuoc Lam deserted from the battlefield. In the mean time, however, South <b>Vietnamese</b> troops in Tien Phuoc could bare held their ground with support from two A-37 bombers, after South <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders on the ground had called for reinforcement from Chu Lai. By 4:00pm, Tien Phuoc was captured by the VPA 2nd Division.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three North <b>Vietnamese</b> PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From point blank, North <b>Vietnamese</b> tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the North <b>Vietnamese</b> troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the North <b>Vietnamese</b> overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the North <b>Vietnamese</b> tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South <b>Vietnamese</b> special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1928, the VNQDD {{attracted}} substantial <b>Vietnamese</b> support, provoking {{increased attention}} from the French colonial administration. This came after a VNQDD death squad killed several French officials and <b>Vietnamese</b> collaborators who {{had a reputation for}} cruelty towards the <b>Vietnamese</b> populace.|$|E
5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North <b>Vietnamese</b> field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders concluded that the South <b>Vietnamese</b> army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South <b>Vietnamese</b> units were not tied up elsewhere, North <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|By April 1975, morale in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{had sunk}} {{so low that}} some of their {{personnel}} simply defected to the Communist side. In a well-known incident, South <b>Vietnamese</b> pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung used his F-5E fighter-bomber to attack the Presidential Palace in Saigon instead of North <b>Vietnamese</b> troops. Shortly afterwards, Trung joined the Communist forces and he was ordered to train a group of North <b>Vietnamese</b> pilots to operate the U.S.-made A-37 Dragonfly fighter-bomber, in order to support the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. On the afternoon of April 28, 1975, Trung led a flight of five A-37 fighter-bombers against Tan Son Nhut Air Base, which temporarily stopped U.S. and South <b>Vietnamese</b> evacuation efforts.|$|E
5|$|Chinese and North <b>Vietnamese</b> {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A <b>Vietnamese</b> document claimed that China hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents {{claimed that the}} source of the conflict was <b>Vietnamese</b> policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification.|$|E
5|$|During the French colonial administration, educated <b>Vietnamese</b> were {{employed}} in the civil service administration as secretaries, clerks and bureaucrats. When Cambodia gained independence in 1953, the Sihanouk-led government phased {{out most of the}} <b>Vietnamese</b> civil servants with Cambodians, and they sought employment in banks and commercial enterprises as secretaries and other office-based positions. In the 1960s, urban-dwelling <b>Vietnamese</b> with lower education backgrounds also worked as mechanics in car repair and machine shops owned by Chinese businessmen. <b>Vietnamese</b> immigrants that settled in the countryside worked as fishermen along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong river, and also as rubber plantation workers in Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War, <b>Vietnamese</b> and Khmer Rouge communists {{had formed}} an {{alliance}} to fight U.S.-backed regimes {{in their respective}} countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the <b>Vietnamese,</b> the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that the <b>Vietnamese</b> communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to pre-empt {{an attempt by the}} <b>Vietnamese</b> to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the <b>Vietnamese</b> island of Phú Quốc. In spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as <b>Vietnamese</b> expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978, the <b>Vietnamese</b> military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved—the Khmer Rouge remained unwilling to seriously negotiate.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of March 17, General Tat {{organised}} a counter-attack against the enemy's 9th Battalion with support from fighter-bombers, tanks and artillery, but his troops were repeatedly beaten back {{in their attempt to}} keep the road open. By the early hours of March 18, the entire North <b>Vietnamese</b> 64th Regiment had blocked all the routes around Tuna Pass, while the 48th Regiment and elements of the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 968th Infantry Division began closing in on Cheo Reo from three directions. In the afternoon, Phu sent the 25th Ranger Battalion and the 2nd Armoured Cavalry Brigade to reopen Route 7. At the same time the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 675th Artillery Regiment began shelling the main South <b>Vietnamese</b> column in Cheo Reo as three infantry regiments attacked the convoy from all sides. Unfortunately for the South <b>Vietnamese,</b> all their attempts to organise strong resistance were stifled by the chaos created by North <b>Vietnamese</b> artillery bombardments. At 3pm, General Tat was ordered to destroy all heavy weaponry so the North <b>Vietnamese</b> could not make use of it. About 30minutes later, a UH-1 helicopter landed on the grounds of Phu Bon primary school to pick up Tat and flew off to Nha Trang. At 9am on March 19, all South <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers in the district of Cheo Reo stopped fighting. The 6th Ranger Battalion and the 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron became the only units to arrive at their destination at Cung Son with only light casualties.|$|E
5|$|During the {{fixed-wing}} evacuation 50,493 people (including 2,678 <b>Vietnamese</b> orphans) {{were evacuated}} from Tan Son Nhut. Marine pilots accumulated 1,054 flight hours and flew 682 sorties throughout Operation Frequent Wind. The evacuation of personnel from the DAO compound had lasted nine hours and involved over 50 Marine Corps and Air Force helicopters. In the helicopter evacuation {{a total of}} 395 Americans and 4,475 <b>Vietnamese</b> and third-country nationals were evacuated from the DAO compound and a further 978 U.S. and 1,120 <b>Vietnamese</b> and third-country nationals from the Embassy, giving a total of 1,373 Americans and 5,595 <b>Vietnamese</b> and third country nationals. In addition, Air America helicopters and RVNAF aircraft brought additional evacuees to the TF76 ships. Many of the <b>Vietnamese</b> evacuees were allowed to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} season of 1975, the Vietnam People's Army High Command in Hanoi made the {{decision}} to seize the major South <b>Vietnamese</b> cities of Huế and Da Nang, and also destroy the various South <b>Vietnamese</b> units in I Corps Tactical Zone, led by ARVN General Ngô Quang Trưởng. Originally, the campaign was planned to take place over two phases; during the seasons of spring-summer and autumn. However, as the North <b>Vietnamese</b> and Viet Cong forces rolled over South <b>Vietnamese</b> defences on the outskirts of Huế and Da Nang, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu ordered General Trưởng to abandon all territories under his control, and pull his forces back to the coastal areas of I Corps. However, the South <b>Vietnamese</b> withdrawal quickly turned into a rout, as the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 2nd Army Corps picked off one South <b>Vietnamese</b> unit after another, until Huế and Da Nang was completely surrounded. By March 29, 1975, North <b>Vietnamese</b> troops had full control of Huế and Da Nang, while South Vietnam lost all territories in I Corps and most of the units belonging to the ARVN 1st Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in the day, {{at about}} 2:30pm, South <b>Vietnamese</b> Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, {{discovered}} that the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 316th Infantry Division had moved into positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos. To stop them from advancing any further, Phu ordered his soldiers to destroy every bridge connected to Highway 14. By the time Phu’s order was carried out, elements of the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 316th Infantry Division had engaged in clashes with the South <b>Vietnamese</b> for more than 10 hours. By 5pm the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 8th Battalion, 149th Regiment, {{in combination with the}} 198th Special Forces Regiment, tried but failed to capture Hoa Binh airfield, which was defended by one South <b>Vietnamese</b> ranger battalion.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the <b>Vietnamese</b> community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of <b>Vietnamese</b> rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their <b>Vietnamese</b> classmates with suspicion. Relations between the <b>Vietnamese</b> and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take <b>Vietnamese</b> wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and <b>Vietnamese</b> communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between <b>Vietnamese</b> have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E
5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North <b>Vietnamese</b> General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South <b>Vietnamese</b> forces away from the main objective. For the element of surprise to be successful, North <b>Vietnamese</b> forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South <b>Vietnamese</b> reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failed}} counter-attack, South <b>Vietnamese</b> forces in I Corps was further {{weakened}} when President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu pulled the Airborne Division back to Saigon. Now that the South <b>Vietnamese</b> 2nd Infantry Division and the 12th Ranger Group was overstretched between Quảng Ngãi and Hội An, with Tam Kỳ only defended by the ARVN 5th Infantry Regiment and one battalion from the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment, North <b>Vietnamese</b> General Chu Huy Mân decided to utilise the advantage to capture Tam Kỳ. Beginning at 5:30am on March 21, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 2nd Division attacked Suoi Da, the last South <b>Vietnamese</b> outpost outside Tam Kỳ. At around 12:00pm, ARVN General Trần Văn Nhựt ordered {{the rest of}} the 4th Infantry Regiment out from Quảng Ngãi in an attempt to hold Tam Kỳ, so South <b>Vietnamese</b> defences in that province was further weakened. Again, taking advantage of the situation, General Chu Huy Mân ordered the 52nd Independent Brigade and the 94th Local Force Regiment to attack Quảng Ngãi. By 7:00am on March 24, the cities of Tam Kỳ and Quảng Ngãi were simultaneously attacked by North <b>Vietnamese</b> and Viet Cong forces. In Tam Kỳ, the ARVN 4th and 5th Infantry Regiments were destroyed after two hours of heavy fighting, while the 37th and 39th Ranger Battalions (from the ARVN 12th Ranger Group) in {{the outskirts of the city}} simply fled from the battlefield. At 10:00am on March 24, North <b>Vietnamese</b> and Viet Cong soldiers of the 2nd Division, the ‘Ba Gia’ Regiment, and the 31st Regiment successfully captured Tam Kỳ.|$|E
5|$|For North <b>Vietnamese</b> field {{commanders of}} the Tay Nguyen Front, the {{withdrawal}} of South <b>Vietnamese</b> military forces from II Corps Tactical Zone came as a surprise, {{but it was not}} totally unexpected. What surprised the North <b>Vietnamese</b> the most was the speed of the withdrawal. Indeed, {{it was not until the}} evening of March 15, when the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron reached Cheo Reo, that the North <b>Vietnamese</b> began to receive information of Saigon’s decision to abandon the Central Highlands. At 8pm on March 16, the Tay Nguyen Front Command issued the first orders to pursue the South <b>Vietnamese.</b> The North <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment, part of the 320A Infantry Division, was the first unit to be mobilised to intercept the South <b>Vietnamese</b> column south of Cheo Reo district. Subsequently, the entire North <b>Vietnamese</b> 320A Infantry Division was sent to destroy the South <b>Vietnamese</b> column along Route 7, with the 2nd Tank Battalion of the 273rd Armoured Regiment, the 675th Regiment, and the 593rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment in support. By the early hours of March 17, tanks from the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion clashed with the North <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment at Tuna Pass, about 4kilometres away from the district of Cheo Reo.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, South <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders never {{realized}} that Hanoi had given its field commanders the full flexibility {{to respond to}} the changing circumstances on the battlefield and had supplied North <b>Vietnamese</b> units with weaponry that was required to achieve their objectives. Ultimately, the average South <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers would {{have to pay for the}} miscalculation of their commanders.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh {{gained control}} of the South <b>Vietnamese</b> {{government}} after General Dương Văn Minh was overthrown in a military coup. Although General Khánh was able {{to gain control of}} the military junta, he failed to garner support from the civilian population when he implemented various laws which limited the freedoms of the South <b>Vietnamese</b> people. He then had a falling-out with the Catholic faction within his own government, when he became increasingly reliant on the Buddhist movement to hold on to power. Consequently, on February 20, 1965, General Khánh was ousted from power and was forced to leave South Vietnam forever. The political instability in Saigon gave North <b>Vietnamese</b> leaders in Hanoi an opportunity to step up their military campaign in the south. They believed the South <b>Vietnamese</b> government was able to survive because it still had a strong military to combat the growing influence of the Viet Cong. With the summer campaign of 1965, North <b>Vietnamese</b> and Viet Cong forces aimed to inflict significant losses on the South <b>Vietnamese</b> military. In Phước Long Province, the Communist summer offensive culminated in the Đồng Xoài campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Vietnam was {{estimated}} to have about 100,000 troops in Kampuchea, but, sensing that a diplomatic settlement was within reach, the <b>Vietnamese</b> Government began withdrawing forces in earnest. Between April and July 1989, 24,000 <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers returned home. Then, between 21 and 26 September 1989, after suffering 15,000 soldiers killed and another 30,000 wounded during the 10-year occupation, Vietnam’s commitment to Kampuchea was officially over, when the remaining 26,000 <b>Vietnamese</b> soldiers were pulled out. However, armed resistance groups opposed to the Vietnamese-installed PRK regime claimed that <b>Vietnamese</b> troops were still operating on Kampuchean soil long after September 1989. For example, non-communist groups engaging in land-grab operations in western Kampuchea after the withdrawal reported clashes with elite <b>Vietnamese</b> Special Forces near Tamar Puok along Route 69. Then, in March 1991, <b>Vietnamese</b> units {{were reported to have}} re-entered Kampot Province to defeat a Khmer Rouge offensive. Despite such claims, on 23 October 1991, the <b>Vietnamese</b> Government signed the Paris Peace Agreement, which aimed to restore peace in Kampuchea.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, the National Assembly of Cambodia {{introduced}} an immigration law which authorises the deportation of illegal immigrants. The UNHCR perceived {{the law as}} targeting <b>Vietnamese</b> migrants in Cambodia, and the Cambodian government later stepped in to assure that no mass deportations of <b>Vietnamese</b> refugees would be implemented. The Khmer Rouge continued to carry out sporadic attacks on <b>Vietnamese</b> civilians until they surrendered in 1999. Ethnic <b>Vietnamese</b> continue to face discrimination from Cambodian society, and encountered physical intimidation from society and government authorities especially during the general elections or when disputes between Cambodia and Vietnam arise.|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, {{during the}} midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a North <b>Vietnamese</b> deserter {{surrendered}} himself to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the North <b>Vietnamese</b> soldier revealed the whereabouts of North <b>Vietnamese</b> units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were gearing up for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, North <b>Vietnamese</b> artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North <b>Vietnamese</b> would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South <b>Vietnamese</b> military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of {{about two or three}} North <b>Vietnamese</b> combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum during the month of February were designed by the North <b>Vietnamese</b> Tay Nguyen Front to fool South <b>Vietnamese</b> military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E
