5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a <b>volatile</b> <b>chemical</b> attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to continuing descriptive {{studies of the}} effects of infection by defense mutualist endophytes, there has been a sharp {{increase in the number of}} studies which delve further into the ecology of plant-fungus associations and especially their multi-trophic impacts. The processes by which endophytic fungi alter plant physiology and <b>volatile</b> <b>chemical</b> levels are virtually unknown, and limited current results show a lack of consistency under differing environmental conditions, especially differing levels of herbivory. Studies comparing the relative impacts of mutualistic endophytes on inducible defenses and tolerance show a central function of infection in determining both responses to herbivore damage. On the whole, molecular mechanisms behind endophyte-mediated plant defense has been an increasing focus of research over the past ten years.|$|E

2500|$|The uses of KI include as a {{nutritional}} supplement in animal feeds {{and also the}} human diet. For the latter, {{it is the most}} common additive used to [...] "iodize" [...] table salt (a public health measure to prevent iodine deficiency in populations that get little seafood). The oxidation of iodide causes slow loss of iodine content from iodised salts that are exposed to excess air. The alkali metal iodide salt, over time and exposure to excess oxygen and carbon dioxide, slowly oxidizes to metal carbonate and elemental iodine, which then evaporates. Potassium iodate is used to add iodine to some salts so that the iodine is not lost by oxidation. Dextrose or sodium thiosulfate are often added to iodized table salt to stabilize potassium iodide thus reducing loss of the <b>volatile</b> <b>chemical.</b>|$|E

40|$|Air {{emissions}} from manufacturing operations and waste treatment plants often {{consist of a}} combination of odors and <b>volatile</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Odors are inorganic or organic compounds, which are present in low concentrations, typically 20 ppmv or less, which have an unpleasant odor. <b>Volatile</b> <b>chemicals</b> are often present at higher concentrations than odors, but {{may or may not have}} any odors associated with them. The major problem with emission of <b>volatile</b> <b>chemicals</b> is the detrimental impact on the environment and adverse human health effects. While several U. S. EPA and OSHA regulations govern the emission of hazardous <b>volatile</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the ambient air and in the workplace, odor emissions are often a major nuisance to the plant workers and surrounding communities. In recent years, biological treatment has emerged as a major contender for in-process or end-of-pipe treatment, as compared with other treatment technologies, such as chemical oxidation, adsorption, gas absorption, or thermal oxidation. Major advantages of biological treatment are ambient temperature and pressure operation, no generation of toxic by-products requiring disposal or further treatment, and favorable economics. Disadvantages associated with biological treatment are upsets due to inactivation of active microbial cultures, and lack of adequate knowledge to operate the process at peak capacity and performance level. In this paper, the application of biotreatment for controlling emissions of odors and volatile organics will be addressed...|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} of <b>volatile</b> <b>chemicals</b> by flowers is targeted towards insects. Some {{evidence shows that}} there is significant overlap between the chemicals produced by plants and those used by insects for their communications, especially for mating. In the classic case of orchids in the genus Ophrys, the volatiles mimic the female sex pheromone of bees which attempt to copulate with the flower and thereby pollinate them. A study {{of the evolution of}} <b>volatile</b> <b>chemicals</b> in scarab beetles and flowers that attract them in the family Araceae showed that the insects had evolved the chemicals in the Jurassic Period while the plants evolved the attractants later in the Cretaceous Period.|$|R

50|$|WFNA as an {{oxidizer}} has {{somewhat less}} performance than red {{fuming nitric acid}} (RFNA) but is considerably safer (though extremely corrosive), as it has little to no dissolved nitrogen tetroxide, which is an extremely toxic and <b>volatile</b> <b>chemical.</b> If not inhibited, it will form nitrogen tetroxide on contact with most metals and some organic materials.

50|$|Upon mating, {{the female}} A. dawsoni {{will begin a}} {{chemical}} shift to indicate that {{she is no longer}} receptive to mating attempts. Then she will begin the nesting phase of her life cycle. This shift takes some time. Therefore, recently mated females are still attractive to patrolling bees, and must actively resist copulation. The shift involves actively repressing the production of the receptivity chemicals, and creating a chemical called tetramethylhexadecatrienol, which is unique to nesting females. Additionally, other <b>volatile</b> <b>chemical</b> agents potentially produced in the Dufourâ€™s gland have been implicated in male repulsion signaling.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} twenty-first century, the {{effectiveness}} of the Haber process (and its analogues) is such that more than 99 percent of global demand for synthetic ammonia, a demand which exceeds 100 million tons annually, is satisfied thereby.
