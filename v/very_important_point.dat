Since most weeds are C3 plants, {{they are likely to}} compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that weedkillers could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.|$|E

In private, it is common for women to wear Western-style clothing, and the proliferation within OIC member states of global fashion retail chains from Zara to Victoria's Secret – both of which have branches even in Wahabbi Saudi Arabia – is testament to this.|$|E

The [...] "invasion" [...] theme begins very softly in the strings, pianissimo. It eventually becomes a howling monster, but only gradually.

2500|$|After {{moving back}} to California, Emery pursued {{a career as a}} film {{producer}} and editor in comedy-related films and TV shows. In 2005, he gained national attention as the editor of The Aristocrats, a documentary about the eponymous dirty joke as told by various comedians. In an interview, he said of the film [...] "he imagery and descriptions that appear in the film are far beyond offensive by conventional standards but not for the sake of shocking the viewer, but to entertain the entertainer. That is one <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> that The Aristocrats makes." [...] His friend Paul Provenza, who directed the movie, praised Emery's editing work, crediting it with shaping the style and shape of the film. Emery in turn said in an interview [...] "The Aristocrats was the film that put me on the map, so it holds a very special place in my heart. I feel I owe my entire career to the generosity of Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{summary of}} the POPC {{simulations}} described above shows that the POPC system's initial area per lipid value was initially [...]65 ± [...]01 but it increases by more than 70% to 1.09 ± [...]03 at 10nbsp&mol% of ethanol which indicates the membrane begins to swell and expand as ethanol permeates through its exterior region. Due {{to the expansion of}} the membrane, the membrane thickness decreases from 3.83 ± [...]06 to 2.92 ± [...]05 which relates to the distance between the phosphorus atoms {{on opposite sides of the}} membrane. The study also supports the fact that ethanol prefers to bond just below the hydrophilic region of the phospholipids near the phosphate groups. The location of the ethanol creates a strong hydrogen bond between the water molecules. The results are depicted in the simulations and supported by mass density profiles as well. The mass density profiles show the location of the POPC lipids, water, and ethanol relevant to the hydrophobic core of the membrane and the concentration of ethanol. The mass density of ethanol increases as the concentration increases which indicates ethanol is moving towards the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The membrane becomes partially destroyed. The simulations also support that the interior of the membrane starts to become more hydrophilic due to the presence of water molecules in the interior region once the membrane is partially destroyed. The presence of ethanol also induced the formation of non-lamellar phases (non-bilayer) within the interior region (hydrophobic cored) of the phospholipid membrane. The results are supported by the simulations which show that at approximately 12nbsp&mol% of ethanol the membrane was no longer able to tolerate and adapt to the presence of the ethanol resulting in non-lamellar phases. The formations of the non-lamellar phases are described as being irreversible inverted-micelles. This irreversibility of the inverted-micelles are supported by mass density profiles which display an overlapping of leaflets from opposite membranes that interact forming a strong interlocking between the acyl chains or hydrophobic region with and without the presence of ethanol. Snapshots of the simulations are produced at 100 ns which compared the phospholipid membrane system in the presence of ethanol and in the absence of ethanol which continues to support ethanol's preference to bind near the hydrophilic region of the phospholipid. The researchers also added monovalent ions as salt ions (NaCl) to the phospholipid membrane system which formed non-lamellar phases (micelles) as well. This phenomenon is important because they predict that in the presence of ethanol the micelles can serve as transporters for hydrophilic structures across the membrane. Overall, in this study it shows that ethanol is able to penetrate throughout the membrane. I <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> that was revealed in this study is the fact that ethanol can destroy epithelial tissues (lips, throat, stomach, mouth) in humans. Therefore, one must consider some of the damaging effects of some alcoholic beverages that can contain up to 40% of ethanol (v/v).|$|E
