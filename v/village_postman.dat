60|$|But {{during those}} {{two days of}} his first wild vassalage to his {{original}} sensations, Pierre had not been unvisited by less mysterious impulses. Two or three very plain and practical plannings of desirable procedures in reference to some possible homely explication of all this nonsense--so he would momentarily denominate it--now and then flittingly intermitted his pervading mood of semi-madness. Once he had seized his hat, careless of his accustomed gloves and cane, and {{found himself in the}} street, walking very rapidly {{in the direction of the}} Miss Pennies'. But whither now? he disenchantingly interrogated himself. Where would you go? A million to one, those deaf old spinsters can tell you nothing you burn to know. Deaf old spinsters are not used to be the depositaries of such mystical secrecies. But then, they may reveal her name--where she dwells, and something, however fragmentary and unsatisfactory, of who she is, and whence. Ay; but then, in ten minutes after your leaving them, all the houses in Saddle Meadows would be humming with the gossip of Pierre Glendinning engaged to marry Lucy Tartan, and yet running about the country, in ambiguous pursuit of strange young women. That will never do. You remember, do you not, often seeing the Miss Pennies, hatless and without a shawl, hurrying through the <b>village,</b> like two <b>postmen</b> intent on dropping some tit-bit of precious gossip? What a morsel for them, Pierre, have you, if you now call upon them. Verily, their trumpets are both for use and for significance. Though very deaf, the Miss Pennies are by no means dumb. They blazon very wide.|$|R

5000|$|Britmovie noted [...] "several {{promising}} satirical {{opportunities are}} sadly lost beneath {{a welter of}} frenetic slapstick"; while David McGillivray described the film in the Radio Times as [...] "one of two comedies (the other is Invasion Quartet) created for Spike Milligan by John Briley and Jack Trevor Story, talented writers not noted for their eccentric humour (Briley went on to script Gandhi and Cry Freedom). Consequently the brilliant Goon flounders in the conventional, happy-go-lucky tale of a <b>village</b> <b>postman</b> who is transferred to London." ...|$|E
50|$|The Good Postman is a 2016 {{documentary}} film directed by Tonislav Hristov. The film offers a tragicomic {{perspective on the}} 'refugee crisis' of 2015 from a small Bulgarian village located near the Turkish border. The village has suffered decades of economic and demographic decline. The handful of remaining residents observe refugee families from Syria and elsewhere as they cross the border, and ponder inviting them to settle in the vacant village houses. This proposal, advocated by the <b>village</b> <b>postman</b> and main protagonist Ivan, polarizes opinions and brings into focus the local people's own fears, hopes and disappointments.|$|E

5000|$|Lille Skutt ("Little Hop") is Bamse's and Skalman's best friend. He is a {{very fast}} but {{notoriously}} frightened white rabbit with a red bow tie. However, his ability to run quick and jump far (not to mention braving his fears whenever someone he cares about is in danger) has saved his friends' skins {{on more than one}} occasion. Lille Skutt is the <b>village</b> <b>postman,</b> albeit on a part-time basis. He also works part-time as the head chef of the local restaurant. Like Bamse, Skutt ended up marrying his girlfriend; Nina Kanin ("Nina Rabbit"), best friend with Brummelisa. Nina and Skutt became parents to a son Mini-Hopp ("Mini-Hop"), a hyperactive kid with an apparent lack of fear.|$|E
50|$|Harold Petts (Spike Milligan) is a {{conscientious}} <b>village</b> <b>postman</b> who receives a promotion that takes him to London, {{to be trained}} at London's busiest post office. However, after his first day {{in the big city}} he is soon in trouble. In the main sorting office he succeeds in beating the new mail sorting machine at pigeonholing letters for delivery (the machine blows up in the process). As a result he is placed safely out of the way in the parcels department, but sorts parcels at such speed that he puts everyone else in the department out of work. This leads him to a meeting with the staff psychiatrist, and then to Jean (Barbara Shelley), an ambitious art student, and the pair find themselves the main suspects in a mail theft ring, with the police and post office officials hot on their heels.|$|E

This time his work, The <b>Village</b> <b>Postman,</b> was noticed by John Ruskin as containing [...] "more than usual fidelity" [...] and [...] "immense labour". The Spectator also chose this painting as [...] "superior examples". The Athenaeum magazine commented on this painting and a view of Rydal which he exhibited the following year. The Atheneaum made no comment in 1859 but the following year they saw his picture of Nice in winter as a [...] "delight for all lovers of nature".|$|E
50|$|Tati's {{first major}} feature, Jour de fête (The Big Day), {{tells the story}} of an inept rural <b>village</b> <b>postman</b> who {{interrupts}} his duties to inspect the traveling fair that has come to town. Influenced by too much wine and a documentary on the rapidity of the American postal service, he goes to hilarious lengths to speed his mail deliveries aboard his bicycle. Tati filmed it in 1947 in the village of Sainte-Sévère-sur-Indre where he had found refuge during the war. Due to the reluctance of French distributors, Jour de fête was first successfully released in London in March 1949 before obtaining a French release on 4 July 1949, where it became a great public success, receiving the 1950 Le Grand prix du cinéma français. The film was intended to be the first French feature film shot in colour; Tati simultaneously shot the film in black and white as an insurance policy. The newly developed Thomson colour system proved impractical, as it could not deliver colour prints. Jour de fête was therefore released only in black and white. Unlike his later films, it has many scenes with dialogue, and offers a droll, affectionate view of life in rural France. The colour version was restored by his younger daughter, film editor and director Sophie Tatischeff, and released in 1995. The film won the Prize for Best Original Script at the Venice Film Festival.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} village I came into touch with some Baul singers. I had known {{them by their}} names, {{occasionally}} seen them singing and begging in the street, and so passed them by, vaguely classifying them in my mind under the general name of Vairagis, or ascetics. The time came when I had occasion to meet with {{some members of the}} same body and talk to them about spiritual matters. The first Baul song, which I chanced to hear with any attention, profoundly stirred my mind. Its words are so simple that it makes me hesitate to render them in a foreign tongue, and set them forward for critical observation. Besides, the best part of a song is missed when the tune is absent; for thereby its movement and its colour are lost, and it becomes like a butterfly whose wings have been plucked. The first line may be translated thus: 'Where shall I meet him, the Man of my Heart?' This phrase, 'the Man of my Heart,' is not peculiar to this song, but is usual with the Baul sect. It means that, for me, the supreme truth of all existence is in the revelation of the Infinite in my own humanity. 'The Man of my Heart,' to the Baul, is like a divine instrument perfectly tuned. He gives expression to infinite truth in the music of life. And the longing for the truth which is in us, which we have not yet realised, breaks out in the [...] "Ami Kothay Pabo Tare". The name of the poet who wrote this song was Gagan. He was almost illiterate; and the ideas he received from his Baul teacher found no distraction from the self-consciousness of the modern age. He was a <b>village</b> <b>postman,</b> earning about ten shillings a month, and he died before he had completed his teens. The sentiment, to which he gave such intensity of expression, is common to most of the songs of his sect. And it is a sect, almost exclusively confined to that lower floor of society, where the light of modern education hardly finds an entrance, while wealth and respectability shun its utter indigence. In the song I have translated above, the longing of the singer to realize the infinite in his own personality is expressed. This has to be done daily by its perfect expression in life, in love. For the personal expression of life, in its perfection, is love; just as the personal expression of truth in its perfection is beauty.|$|E
