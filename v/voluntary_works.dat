Findings from three {{waves of the}} European Values Study (EVS) from 1990 - 2010 are discussed in a theoretical and international context. The results show that around {{a third of the}} Icelandic population aged 18 years and older was involved in some kind of unpaid <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> in 2009 - 2010, a little fewer than in 1990. Around 75 % were members of voluntary organizations, about the same ratio as in 1990. Respondents were most likely to do <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> for sports- or recreation associations and {{were also more likely to}} belong to sports clubs than other associations or organizations. Although <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> for social welfare services was the second most frequent, that type of associations suffered the biggest decline in the number of volunteers between 1990 and 2009. Overall, there is not a significant difference in men and women‘s participation in voluntary organizations although men are much more likely than women to do unpaid <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> for associations involved in sports, recreation and youth work. Respondents over 50 years are more likely to do <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> than younger participants, especially in the field of social welfare. Respondents with higher education are the most likely to be involved in <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> Occupational status is also strongly linked to such work, mainly within sports and recreation. Married respondents are in all instances more likely than others to do <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> and people in rural areas are more likely than people in urban areas to engage in such activities.

40|$|To {{contribute}} to the debate as to whether volunteering is an outcome of democratization rather than a driver of it, we analyze how divergent democratization pathways in six countries of the former Soviet Union have led to varied levels of <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> Using data from the European Values Study, we find that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia - which followed a Europeanization path - have high and increasing levels of civil liberties and <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> In Russia and Belarus, following a pre-emption path, civil liberties have remained low and <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> has declined. Surprisingly, despite the Orange Revolution and increased civil liberties, <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> rates in Ukraine have also declined. The case of Ukraine indicates that the freedom to participate is not always taken up by citizens. Our findings suggest it is not <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> that brings civil liberties, but rather that increased civil liberties lead {{to higher levels of}} volunteering...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS The thesis has {{a form of}} a {{theoretical}} study with significant relation to practice in professional volunteer supervision in Kladno Volunteer Center. The thesis is divided in 7 parts. Part One {{is focused on the}} definition of basic terms such as volunteer, <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> This part deals with the issue of awarding of volunteers. Part Two is devoted to the basic terminology of social pedagogy, including the definition of free time, the phenomenon, which is very important for both <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> and social pedagogy. Part Three is centered at history of social pedagogy and <b>voluntary</b> <b>work.</b> Key intersections of the two studied phenomena and their evolution are described. Part Four describes voluntary activities as a social phenomenon. Subparts are focused on the attitude of society towards <b>voluntary</b> <b>work,</b> the myths associated with it, as well as the volunteer work motivation. In part Five, I was trying to grasp volunteering as a tool of social pedagogy. The subparts combine my findings acquired from books and my own practical experience. Part Six is an analysis of a specific case of "Pět P" programme practice. Part Seven - the final one - includes a small scale empirical research.

40|$|A {{professional}} life {{of secondary school}} teachers of Czech gymnasiums (rough equivalent of British grammar schools) in so called normalization period is presented in this thesis using autobiographical recounting, contemporary documents and archival materials. The author mentions the choosing of their careers, their studies and ensuing start of their teaching practice {{that took place in}} late sixties. Author puts emphasis on mapping of the leading role of the Communist party of Czechoslovakia in the workplace during the so called normalization period and how it was perceived by the teachers themselves. Author shows the role of the communist party using teacher's reviews, entrance examinations and complex assessments. Later on, author elaborates the mechanisms used to keep school "socialistic" up to the year 1989 : controls, deliberations and meetings, schoolings, school phraseology, material provision, anniversary celebrations, <b>voluntary</b> <b>works,</b> skiing and defense courses, sister trips and teacher's role in society.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} issue of the global {{financial}} crisis and its impacts on philanthropy and civil society organisations (CSOs) in Malaysia. CSOs are popularly known as non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Malaysia. Financial crisis has caused NGOs in many countries to receive less funding. This situation may threaten and discourage <b>voluntary</b> <b>works.</b> Undoubtedly, these beneficial contributions from the NGOs are needful services to the society. This paper examines the impact of financial crisis through the lens of NGOs and philanthropy activities in Malaysia. It utilises primary and secondary data, employs a mixed method approach, and uses quantitative and qualitative data. While there are many influencing factors in this development, this paper presents several significant aspects in the Malaysian context, including the style and nature of giving, culture, religion, and political pressure. This study attempts to seek potential solutions, pathways and possible approaches beneficial to NGOs and philanthropy activities for their sustainability in facing the financial crisis and its consequences. Experiences and lessons learnt in Malaysia may well be useful and applicable to some extent in other countries...|$|E

40|$|The study {{originated}} {{with the assumption}} that the praxis of the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa (AFM) shows that pastors are possibly so busy with numerous duties, responsibilities and many demands made on them, that they have difficulty in mobilizing their assemblies for effective ministry (Eph. 4 : 12). The majority of assemblies in the AFM are functioning as institutional model assemblies. In these assemblies most of the ministries are primarily performed by the pastors, permanent staff members and a small group of the laity. The consequences are that such assemblies do not effectively fulfill the Great Commission (Matt. 28 : 19). Assembly mobilization implies a process whereby the laity is empowered to discover, develop and perform <b>voluntary</b> <b>works</b> of service (ministry). The study was undertaken based on the social sciences and implementing an analytical and critical approach, to develop an enhanced understanding of the way the church functions, as the body of Christ and as a living organism. The potential for growth in the body of Christ involves the mutual contribution of every member so that the whole might be built up and achieve maturity. Consequently the body of Christ metaphor was suggested as preferential for the future functioning and practice of assembly ministries, because:  The metaphor presents a principal expression of the Biblical will of God for the way in which an assembly functions in carrying out the Great Commission;  The disadvantages of institutionalism are counteracted and neutralized by this metaphor;  Both qualitative and quantitative assembly growths occur where this metaphor is implemented. The study seeks to emphasize the importance of the fact that equipping the laity has to be an ongoing process in local assemblies. With the aforementioned as point of departure, it is argued that:  All persons should be equipped to competent levels to enable them to contribute to the growth and development of the assembly through various ministries;  The fivefold ministry (Eph. 4 : 12) should accept the responsibility to equip the laity for their ministry;  Every lay person is gifted by God (Eph. 4 : 7) and should accept responsibility to minister using their gifts to build up and benefit the assembly;  Equipping and empowering the laity are crucial elements to accomplish the Great Commission. The objective was to develop the body of Christ metaphor for assemblies that focus on utilizing the gifts of the laity. This study argues that assemblies will not accomplish this objective until pastors see it as their primary responsibility to mobilize their assemblies. The challenge facing pastors lies in whether {{they will be able to}} make the following paradigm shifts:  Leadership shift from ministers to equippers;  A ministry shift from consumers to contributors. Creating a new culture and promoting the equipping and empowerment of the laity should therefore be given priority by pastors in local assemblies as a whole. These changes will enable the body of Christ to contribute to carry out the Great Commission. The program that was designed is suitable for the discovery, equipping and empowerment of the potential of the laity for <b>voluntary</b> <b>works</b> of service (ministry). The study seeks to create a general development strategy to empower the laity in assemblies. It purposefully engineers certain paradigm shifts, changes structures, creates a new management approach and introduces new processes. The spiritual growth and autonomy of any assembly depends partially on effective organization. In order to function effectively assemblies need to apply sound managerial techniques. Assemblies are to pay attention to the critical judgment of current theories. Lastly, the assembly is seen as an organization with a strong spiritual component consisting mainly of volunteers. An assembly structured according to the body of Christ metaphor will benefit greatly when it implements a “utilization of people” management theory. This thesis is a contribution aimed at assisting the leadership not only to create a culture for assembly mobilization, but also to assist them in restructuring to ensure that the process will be managed effectively.

40|$|Tezin basılısı İstanbul Şehir Üniversitesi Kütüphanesi'ndedir. In {{the late}} Ottoman Empire {{education}} {{was used as}} a means of training obedient and loyal subjects for the sultan. The number of foreign schools, which introduced nice facilities for all students, gradually increased in the provinces and it became a danger for the Ottoman Empire. The empire commenced to spread its own educational system by opening new schools and appointing directors of education to the Ottoman provinces. In this thesis roles of the directors of education {{in the development of the}} modern education in the empire are studied in terms of their responsibilities, academic backgrounds, and the problems they faced in the provinces. Documents from the Prime Ministry Archive formed the main source for the thesis. Also secondary sources concerning the modernization of education in the late Ottoman Empire were used. As a result it can be claimed that the biggest trigger for the empire to improve educational conditions was the growing number of foreign schools. The thesis shed light also on conditions, problems and advancement regarding education in the provinces. All these results can be regarded as part of the parameters of the transformation of the Ottoman Empire in the 19 th and 20 th centuries.

40|$|This article {{responds}} to Dominelli's contribution by mapping three lines of discussion. The first {{relates to the}} issue of how to understand <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> with regard to the realization of citizenship. The authors argue that this understanding depends on the way citizenship is conceived. Whereas a rights-based conception of citizenship focuses on issues of equal access to <b>voluntary</b> <b>work,</b> a duty-oriented notion of citizenship tends to see voluntarism as embedded in an educational strategy, alongside professionalized social work. The authors plead for an alternative understanding of <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> and social work as joined partners in practices of 'learning democracy'. The second line of discussion revolves around the relation between social and political dimensions of citizenship. With Dominelli, the authors point out how the obscuring of the political dimension risks to nurture societal discourses that put pressure on the welfare state. The third point relates to the difficulties in positioning <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> with regard to professional social work. One of these difficulties is the tendency to over-romanticize <b>voluntary</b> <b>work</b> as warm, informal, generous, while giving an exclusively technical reading of social work professionalization...|$|R
