50|$|The {{building}} {{has the potential}} to contribute significantly {{to our understanding of the}} development of 19th century passive ventilation features used in the construction and design of buildings in Queensland's hot dry areas. This building features a variation of Tobin Tube ventilation incorporated with high ceilings, part-height interior partitions, <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling</b> roses, operable fanlights, high-level windows and a large roof lantern with operable glazing.|$|E
50|$|A {{feature of}} the {{interior}} {{is the use of}} a ventilation system, likely to be a variation of the Tobin tube, developed in England in the 1870s and patented by Martin Tobin in 1873. Ventilation is achieved through the installation of horizontal tubes under the floor, connected to vertical tubes attached to the internal walls to a height of just over one metre, drawing fresh air into the room and circulating it. At the ED Miles Mining Exchange, the system was probably installed at construction. It complements the more traditional ventilation methods including <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling</b> roses, fanlights, operable high-level windows, and a large roof lantern with operable glazing that were included within the building.|$|E
50|$|The building's 1909 core {{comprises}} six {{rooms and}} a central hall leading off the east-facing front verandah {{to one of}} the rooms, a large laboratory, to the west. The hall has a decorative timber battened arch with moulded brackets and architrave. All rooms (except the laboratory) have pressed metal ceilings, pressed metal cornices, and decorative, <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling</b> roses some of which have evidence of gas pendant lights which are not extant. The ceiling of the former laboratory is lined with flat sheeting with no cornice. The other rooms, formerly laboratories and store rooms, have plastered walls with rounded corners which are stop-chamfered near the ceiling. The hall walls are timber, vertically-jointed boards. There are no skirtings or rails throughout and all walls and ceilings are painted. The floors are lined with non-original carpet or vinyl, coverings which are not of cultural heritage significance.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was enlarged in 1843 and 1847. In 1852, the South Wing (also {{known as the}} Tower Building) was added. The wing, {{which was in the}} Tudor Gothic style, fronted 30 feet on North Gay Street and extended 136 feet on Orange Street. The Egyptian Saloon was also remodeled. It was expanded, the windows were enlarged and the walls and ceilings were replastered to make the room brighter and better <b>ventilated,</b> and the <b>ceiling</b> was raised several feet.|$|R
50|$|Like the exterior, the {{interior}} of the building is simple and functional in design and finish. The first and second floors contain five classrooms separated by masonry walls and the floors are suspended reinforced concrete. The classroom interiors were rendered and the face brick corridors are now painted. The entrance foyer located on the first floor has large glazed entrance doors, sidelights and fanlights of silky oak. It has a <b>ventilated</b> plaster <b>ceiling</b> decorated with simple mouldings and a fluted cornice detail. Alterations to this floor in 1997 were extensive and included the conversion of the classrooms into offices by the introduction of an additional hallway down the centre and length of the classroom room wing and timber framed partition walls. Three of the five classrooms doors and windows to the northern corridor have been bricked in.|$|R
50|$|Facilities for {{undertaking}} post mortems were {{an essential}} part of the work of the Stock Experiment Station. The first detached post mortem building was erected in the 1920s and by the early 1930s a new one was required. This building, the Animal Morgue, was erected in 1934 to designs prepared by Department of Public Works architect DFW Roberts. It comprised a single room with a purpose-built concrete mortuary table in the centre and two concrete dissecting benches against the northern wall. As much as possible of the building was constructed of concrete for ease of cleaning and hygiene. It was well <b>ventilated</b> with <b>ceiling</b> vents and a Robinson's Patent ventilator on the roof. The joins between walls and floor were coved. The windows and doors were timber and fly-screens were provided to all openings. Taps operated by foot remain at the dissecting bench in the north-eastern corner.|$|R
40|$|The <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling</b> is a {{flexible}} solution for kitchen ventilation where heat loads are relatively low and aesthetics is a concern. By using a capture jet in the <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling,</b> {{it is possible}} to improve the total effectiveness of the ventilation system. This means better indoor air quality and thermal comfort. In addition, the energy consumption of a capture jet ceiling is lower than that of a traditional ceiling concept. This paper demonstrates that the supply air distribution strategy has a remarkable influence on pollution removal effectiveness and the thermal environment in kitchens. For a <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling,</b> the capture jet could improve the total effectiveness of the ventilation system by reducing the average contaminant level in the occupied zone by 40 %. In addition the estimated energy saving potential can be as much as 23 %. Key words: <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling,</b> kitchen ventilation, capture je...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an exhaust system {{is especially important}} in a kitchen {{environment in which the}} exhaust is located at ceiling level. The capture {{efficiency of}} the total system must be guaranteed so that the spread of impurities throughout the kitchen is prevented. A capture efficiency model is derived and it is used to estimate the efficiency of a <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling.</b> This paper demonstrates that a simple equation that includes the average contaminant level in the occupied zone and the exhaust concentration could be a suitable platform for capture efficiency analysis in both measurements and simulations. With a ceiling height of 2. 3 m, the capture and containment efficiency can be as high as 85 - 90 %; with a 2. 6 m ceiling height it is 80 – 85 %. These values are quite reasonable compared with the capture efficiency of a default hood in the German code of practice (VDI, 1984) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the performances of phase change materials (PCMs) coupled with a <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling</b> system in order to reduce summer cooling loads and improve the internal comfort in buildings, thus enhancing the positive effect of night ventilation. Object of the study is the numerical simulation of the thermal behaviour of a typical open space office located in three Italian cities during the summer. Indoor climate is only controlled by means of passive ventilation; a usual ventilation system configuration (i. e. the outdoor air is supplied directly inside the ambient) is compared with another characterised by the PCM activation by means of a ceiling air-PCM exchanger. Both systems provide daily and night ventilation and are aimed to maintain, as much as possible, thermal comfort conditions during the office working hours. The numerical simulations are performed using an explicit dynamical model, with a finite difference discretization, developed on the software Simulink®. The PCM is modelled with the equivalent heat capacity method. The results show the positive effect of PCMs, if activated by means of intensive night ventilation. This measure allows to appreciably reduce the peak cooling loads and to achieve a good indoor thermal quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of convective heat transfer at internal building surfaces {{has a significant}} impact on the simulation of heat and air flow. Accurate approaches for the range of flow regimes experi-enced within buildings (buoyant flow adjacent to walls, buoyant plumes rising from radiators, fan-driven flows, etc.) are required, as is the ability to select an appropriate method for the case at hand and to adapt modelling to changes in the flow. A new approach—drawing upon previously pub-lished methods—has been developed for modelling mixed convection within mechanically ventilated rooms. It is applicable for rooms <b>ventilated</b> with <b>ceiling</b> mounted diffusers and is appropriate for both heating and cooling. ESP-r simulations per-formed with the mixed flow model indicate that the prediction of heating and cooling loads is highly sensitive to the {{treatment of}} surface convection and that significant errors can result if an inappropriate model is employed. The results also reveal that the choice of convection algorithm can influence design decisions drawn from a simulation-based analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the exhaust system is especially emphasised with a <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling</b> system where the exhaust is located at ceiling level. The removal {{efficiency of}} the total system must be guaranteed {{and the spread of}} impurities throughout the kitchen should be prevented. At the moment, none of the existing calculation standards are specially tailored for a kitchen ceiling environment. In the normal design practice, empirical knowledge of the existing installations together with heat load based calculation has been used for airflow rate determination. The starting point for this research was to study the effect of the thermal plumes and supply air systems on the efficiency of a <b>ventilated</b> <b>ceiling.</b> A special consideration was to analyze the effect of a capture jet on the contaminant removal efficiency. In that capture air concept, the air jet is projected horizontally across the ceiling, which helps to direct heat and air impurities towards the exhaust. From the practical point of view, the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a design process to compute the required air flow rate more accurately. In this study, the measured convection flows of kitchen appliances during idle and cooking modes were compared with the generic plume equation in which the virtual origin is constant. The generic plume equation derived in the region of complete flow similarity is not fully valid in the intermediate zone (0. 8 - 2. 0  m from appliances). Still, it is possible to reach a reasonable accuracy for practical applications with the adjusted virtual origin. The cooking process does not have any significant effect on the velocity and temperature distribution of the convection flow. The reason for this is that the mass flow rate of water during boiling is small compared with the induced air flow rate and therefore does not have a significant effect on the convection flow. Thus, the actual convection load and the product specific virtual origin can describe the plume during the cooking process. In the previous studies of thermal plumes, the velocity and temperature distribution factors are much higher than in the present study. In addition, the entrainment factors of the previous studies are much smaller than in this study. The measurements indicate that the heat gain has a significant effect on the spreading angle and the entrainment factor close to the heat source. The plumes with high heat gains are narrower and the convection flow induces more room air than the previous studies have pointed out. The {{efficiency of the}} exhaust system can be improved with a small capture jet installed at the ceiling surface. Both the measurement and simulated data give lower contaminant levels when the capture jet was introduced. The plume equation gives a platform to calculate the air flow rate that is theoretically required to remove the convective heat output of the appliance block. In this study, the flush-out factor of the supply air on the theoretical plume equation was derived for the centralized capture jet concept. For practical design work, the target for the containment removal efficiency should be 85  %. To obtain 85  % containment removal efficiency requires to a flush-out factor of 1. 2. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDesign {{fires are}} often used to the {{evaluate}} performance based designs by fire protection engineers {{all over the world}} and can be an invaluable tool if used properly. One potential big issue however is the fact that the exact same design fire is recommended by authorities in similar building types despite the fact that some building characteristics, such as building material, can differ greatly. This paper focused on investigating several key characteristics of a building (building material, openings, room floor area size and ceiling height) and its effect on the design fire using computational fluid dynamics. When well to moderately insulating materials was used the design fire growth rate and maximum heat release rate was in many cases significantly increased, especially if the room was well <b>ventilated,</b> the <b>ceiling</b> height was relatively low and the room floor area was moderate. However, using thermally thin materials (steel sheet) or materials with large heat storing capacity (concrete) very little change was seen on the growth rate or maximum heat release rate. In conclusion it was recommended that one should take precaution when using recommended design fires in buildings with certain characteristics since it potentially can overestimate the safety in such case...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to design}} for low energy {{consumption}} dwellings has induced Malaysian architects to design naturally ventilated high-rise hostels (HH), near the capital, Kuala Lumpur. Objective and subjective measurements for thermal comfort investigations were conducted in two high-rise university hostels located in Universiti Malaya, Petaling Jaya (HH 1) and Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang (HH 2) from May 12 to June 19 in 2007. Eighteen rooms located at first, fifth, and top floor of each HH were measured for different orientations. The measured rooms were naturally <b>ventilated</b> with <b>ceiling</b> fans. Thermal comfort variables were measured prior to the subjective measurement. A total of 208 student occupants responded to the questionnaire. Subjects with 6 months and over living experience in those HH were selected randomly. This study was aimed: (1) to assess the indoor microclimate of each naturally ventilated HH, (2) to identify student occupants' thermal sensation during rainy and clear day, and (3) to simulate the neutral operating temperature for rooms in naturally ventilated high-rise hostels. Findings revealed that room in HH 1 which is located on high land and shaded has a more constant operating temperature distribution than rooms in HH 2 that is located on lower land and un-shaded. Operating temperature ranges for HH 1 and HH 2 were 27 — 31 °C and 26 — 41 °C, respectively. Results suggested that {{there is also a}} possibility that thermal comfort is achievable in shaded naturally ventilated hostels with a window-to-wall ratio of 0. 35 where the internal—external relative humidity is above 70 % RH, especially in south-facing rooms...|$|R
40|$|The airflow {{pattern and}} {{contaminant}} distribution under non-isothermal turbulent flow conditions in a swine growing/finishing building were investigated experimentally and numerically. In the test facility, the ventilation system consisted of discontinuous ceiling inlets with recirculation assisted slots. Air speed, dust and ammonia concentration at selected locations in the-building were measured {{during the winter}} ventilation season in a cold climate. The corresponding temperature distribution at one cross section within the air space also was measured. Experimentally {{it was found that}} both the ventilation rate and the recirculation rate had a limited effect on the dust concentration. The ventilation rate had a significant effect on the ammonia concentration in the air space, while the recirculation rate did not affect the ammonia concentration. The FLUENT computer code was used to simulate the air flow pattern and ammonia concentration in the swine building. The numerical simulation model used was the k-ε turbulence model which includes a buoyancy term. The predicted airflow pattern indicated that the flow structure in such a ventilated swine barn is a three-dimensional flow. The three-dimensional flow structure and the contaminant concentration and temperature at the human breathing line were highly affected by the combined behavior of ceiling inlet jets and recirculation slot jets. The presence of pigs in the swine building had three effects: the air stream near the pigs was deflected; the air speed above the pigs was increased; and the ammonia concentration in the air space was decreased. Both experimental and numerical results showed that temperature and ammonia concentration were uniformly distributed across most of the air space in a building <b>ventilated</b> with discontinuous <b>ceiling</b> inlets and recirculation slots. Numerical results also indicated that the heat generated by animals affected the airflow pattern. Increasing the heat load at the floor resulted in increased air speed, temperature, contamination level, turbulence kinetic energy, dissipation rate and effective viscosity along the breathing line. The placement of the ceiling inlet and the recirculation duct affected airflow patterns, but had only a slight effect on the distribution of temperature and ammonia concentration along the human breathing line. Increasing the flow rate of cleaned recirculation airflow resulted in lower ammonia contaminant level along the human breathing line. However, higher flow rates of cleaned recirculation air means there will be higher fan operation and air cleaning costs. The optimum ratio of ventilation rate to the cleaned recirculation air rate appeared to be approximately 1 : 4...|$|R
