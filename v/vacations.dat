40|$|Objectives: Medical {{emergencies}} occur increasingly {{outside the}} usual health care {{area as a}} result of increased leisure and professional travel. Acute coronary syndromes are the leading cause of mortality during <b>vacation.</b> <b>Vacation</b> activities include physical and emotional triggers for myocardial infarction (MI). This study examines character-istics of <b>vacation</b> travel as risk factors for MI. Methods: Patients diagnosed with MI during <b>vacation</b> abroad (N 92; age, 59. 5 10. 2; 79 men) were recruited through an emergency health insurance organization. Risk indicators for <b>Vacation</b> MI were examined and included: cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial measures, and specific de-mands and activities related to <b>vacation</b> (eg, lodging accommodations, unfamiliar destination, mode of transpor-tation, short-term planning). <b>Vacation</b> MI patients were compared with two reference groups: age-matched <b>Vacation</b> Controls with noncardiovascular medical emergencies (N 67) and Hospital MI Controls, admitted in their usual health care area (N 30). Results: <b>Vacation</b> MI occurred disproportionately (21. 1 %) during the first 2 days of <b>vacation.</b> Cardiovascular risk factors were more prevalent among <b>Vacation</b> MI patients than <b>Vacation</b> Controls (p values. 05) but not compared with Hospital MI Controls. <b>Vacation</b> MI occurred more often in patients with lower education (OR 2. 4, CI 1. 1 – 5. 2) and those living with a spouse (OR 2. 6, CI 1. 0 – 7. 1) than age-matched <b>Vacation</b> Controls.
