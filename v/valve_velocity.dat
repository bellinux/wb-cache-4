40|$|Echocardiograms showing {{mitral valve}} leaflets, {{interventricular}} septum, and posterior {{wall of the}} left ventricle simultaneously were recorded at a paper speed of 100 mm/s in 20 normal subjects. These records were manually digitized and a computer was used to derive mitral <b>valve</b> <b>velocity,</b> left ventricular dimension, and its rate of change continuously throughout a single cardiac cycle. The pattern of instantaneous mitral <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> with respect to time was similar in all subjects studied, showing a peak opening rate of 400 +/- 60 mm/s (mean +/- 1 SD), and continuously changing velocity throughout the period of mid-diastolic closure. The peak diastolic closure rate was 250 +/- 60 mm/s and thus appreciably higher than average velocities obtained by manually measuring the slope. A close time relation existed between mitral valve and left ventricular wall movement in early diastole. Forward movement of the anterior leaflet began 1 +/- 6 ms after the onset of outward wall movement, and peak velocity was reached 2 +/- 7 ms after the maximum rate of change of dimension. Later, a discontinuity in wall movement {{at the end of}} rapid filling preceded a corresponding discontinuity in the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> tracing by 5 +/- 10 ms. The technique, therefore, allows continuous measurement of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>velocity,</b> and demonstrates its close relation to left ventricular wall movement during diastole...|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of acute {{myocardial}} infarction on mitral <b>valve</b> diastolic <b>velocity,</b> echocardiograms were performed in 18 patients on admission, daily in the Coronary Care Unit, and at 3 -day intervals during the remainder of hospitalization. These patients were divided into three groups based on the time interval between onset of symptoms and initial echocardiogram. Five of six patients admitted within 5 hours of onset of myocardial infarction had a triphasic response of mitral <b>valve</b> diastolic <b>velocity</b> with a transient rise above initial values, followed by a fall to below initial values, and then a slow rise during recovery. Seven of eight patients admitted 1 - 2 days after onset of myocardial infarction had a biphasic response, i. e., a fall from ini-tial values and then a slow rise. Four patients admitted later in the course of myocardial infarction had a monophasic response, i. e. low initial velocity followed by a slow recovery. We conclude that in patients with myocardial infarction the mitral <b>valve</b> diastolic <b>velocity</b> following myocardial infarction shows a triphasic response which may appear biphasic or monophasic depending on the interval between myocardial infarc-tion and admission.

40|$|Objectives Trisomy 21 is {{associated}} with an increased nuchal translucency thickness (NT), abnormal ductus venosus (DV) flow at 11 - 14 weeks' gestation and congenital heart defects (CHD), and cardiac dysfunction has been hypothesized as the link between them. We therefore aimed to investigate whether cardiac function is altered in trisomy 21 fetuses. Methods Between December 2003 and June 2009, we performed echocardiography on 46 trisomy 21 fetuses (28 with structurally normal heart and 18 with CHD) and on 191 chromosomally/phenotypically normal fetuses with a confirmed normal heart (87 with normal NT and 104 with NT >= 95 (th) percentile), between 11 and 35 weeks' gestation. Measurements included: E-and A-wave peak velocity, E/A velocity ratio and E/time velocity integral (TVI) ratio over atrioventricular valves; myocardial performance index (MPI); semilunar <b>valve</b> peak <b>velocity</b> and acceleration time; stroke volume (SV); cardiac output; and DV pulsatility index for veins (PIV) at 11 - 14 weeks' gestation. Data were categorized into three different age groups for analysis (11 to 13 + 6, 14 to 21 + 6 and 22 to 35 weeks' gestation). Results The tricuspid <b>valve</b> (TV) A-wave <b>velocity</b> and aortic <b>valve</b> peak <b>velocity</b> were significantly reduced in trisomy 21 compared with normal fetuses. Other highly significant differences found in trisomy 21 fetuses at 11 - 14 weeks' were increased TV-E/A ratio and DV-PIV, and decreased pulmonary <b>valve</b> peak <b>velocity.</b> We also observed evidence of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, reduced SV and increased MPI. After 14 weeks' gestation, the mitral <b>valve</b> A-wave peak <b>velocity</b> and E/TVI ratio were significantly reduced in the trisomy 21 fetuses with normal hearts compared with the controls with increased NT. Conclusions In comparison with controls with normal or increased NT, cardiac function in trisomy 21 fetuses is abnormal irrespective of the presence of CHD. Evidence for cardiac loading (increased preload and afterload) and LV systolic (in the first trimester) and later diastolic dysfunction was observed. Copyright (C) 2011 ISUOG.

BackgroundRecent retrospective studies support the hypothesis that statins slow the progression of aortic stenosis. MethodsWe performed an open-label, prospective study evaluating 121 consecutive patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area ≥ 1. 0 cm 2; mean age 73. 7 ± 8. 9 years; 57 men and 64 women), treated with and without rosuvastatin according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Echocardiographic, serum lipid, and inflammatory markers were measured at baseline and every 6 months for 18 months. ResultsSixty-one patients (50. 4 %) with elevated LDL (159. 7 ± 33. 4 mg/dl), aortic <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> (3. 65 ± 0. 64 m/s), and aortic valve area (1. 23 ± 0. 42 cm 2) received rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), and 60 (49. 6 %) with a normal LDL (118. 6 ± 37. 4 mg/dl), aortic <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> (3. 62 ± 0. 61 m/s), and aortic valve area (1. 20 ± 0. 35 cm 2) received no statin. During a mean follow-up of 73 ± 24 weeks, the change in aortic valve area in the control group was − 0. 10 ± 0. 09 cm 2 /year versus − 0. 05 ± 0. 12 cm 2 /year in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0. 041). The increase in aortic <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> was 0. 24 ± 0. 30 m/s/year in the control group and 0. 04 ± 0. 38 m/s/year in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0. 007). There was significant improvement in serum lipid and echocardiographic measures of aortic stenosis in the statin group. ConclusionsProspective treatment of aortic stenosis with rosuvastatin by targeting serum LDL slowed the hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis.

Diastolic dysfunction was evaluated by echocardiographic indices of the ratio of the peak early diastolic mitral <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> and the peak late diastolic velocity (E/A ratio), left atrial diameter, and left atrial volume indexes. There was a significant (P< 0. 05) correlation between baPWV and E/A ratio with an inverse relationship indicating that higher arterial stiffness was associated with greater diastolic dysfunction. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between E/A ratio and cfPWV, PP, ABI, or AIx. After multivariate analysis, the relationship between baPWV and E/A ratio remained significant (P< 0. 05), independent of age and systolic blood pressure (BP). There were no correlations between any index of vascular stiffness and left atrial dimension or volume. In summary, baPWV correlates with diastolic dysfunction, independent of a patient’s age and BP and is a better indicator of diastolic dysfunction than other indicators of arterial stiffness. baPWV has the utility of infering the presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction...|$|E

Aim This cross-sectional {{study was designed to}} study the LV systolic and diastolic function in patients with β-TM using Pulsed Doppler (PD) and Tissue Doppler (TD) echocardiography. Methods All patients were evaluated clinically and by echocardiography, The study included patients with β-TM (n = 38, age 15. 7 ± 8. 9 years) compared with an age-matched control group (n = 38, age 15. 9 ± 8. 9 years). The pulse Doppler indices were normalized for age and heart rate. Results Compared with control patients, M-Mode showed that patients with β-TM have thicker LV septal wall index (0. 659 ± 0. 23 vs. 0. 446 ± 0. 219 cm, P ≤ 0. 001), posterior wall index (0. 659 ± 0. 235 vs. 0. 437 ± 0. 214 cm, P ≤ 0. 01), and larger LVEDD index is (3. 99 ± 0. 48 vs. 2. 170 ± 0. 57 mm.

The duration of Deceleration time (DT) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) were significantly shorter in patients with β-TM (150. 234 ± 20. 0. 23 vs. 167. 123 ± 19. 143 msec, P ≤ 0. 01) and (60. 647 ± 6. 77 vs. 75. 474 ± 5. 83 msec, P ≤ 0. 001), respectively. The ratio of transmitral E wave velocity to the tissue Doppler E wave at the basal septal mitral annulus E/Em – was significantly higher in β-TM group (14. 024 ± 2. 29 vs. 12. 132 ± 1. 82, P ≤ 0. 01). The Tissue Doppler systolic velocity (Sm) and the early diastolic velocity (Em) were significantly lower in β-TM group compared to control (4. 31 ± 1. 2 cm/s vs. 6. 95 ± 2. 1, P ≤ 0. 01 and 4. 31 ± 2. 7 cm/s vs. 5. 82 ± 2. 5, P ≤ 0. 01) respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV) is {{associated}} with increased risk of valvular degeneration and ascending aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. We sought to evaluate the roles of endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory activation in modulating these processes. METHODS: We performed a case-control study of patients with BAV together with a multivariate analysis within the BAV group to identify factors associated with: development of significant valvular disease; dilatation of the ascending aorta; differential valve relative to aortic disease. Endothelial function of patients and controls was evaluated via flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Correlations with inflammatory markers and endothelial progenitor cell counts were also examined. Morphological and physiological assessment of the valve and ascending aorta was performed with transthoracic echocardiography and MRI. RESULTS: Patients with BAV (n= 43) and controls (n= 25) were matched for age and gender. FMD was significantly lower in patients than controls (7. 85 ± 3. 48 % vs 11. 58 ± 3. 98 %, p= 0. 001), and these differences were age-independent. Within the BAV cohort, multivariate correlates of peak aortic <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> were plasma concentrations of ADMA and myeloperoxidase (MPO) (both p< 0. 01), while increasing age was an independent correlate of ascending aortic diameter (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, both low FMD and inflammatory activation were multivariate correlates of selectivity for valvular disease. CONCLUSIONS: BAV {{is associated with}} endothelial dysfunction. The extent of inflammatory activation (specifically MPO release) and that of endothelial dysfunction impact primarily on integrity of the valve rather than aortic structure.

Three {{of these cases}} had pathological findings at autopsy. BackgroundOnly {{a limited number of}} cases of valve dysfunction with rapid increase of transvalvular aortic gradients or aortic insufficiency post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have been described. This nonstructural valvular dysfunction has been presumed to be because of early pannus formation or thrombosis. MethodsThrough reviews of the published reports and 4 clinical cases, pathological and clinical findings of early valve thrombosis are examined to elucidate methods for recognition and identifying potential causes and treatments. ResultsThis paper presents 4 cases, 2 of which had increasing gradients post-TAVR. All 3 pathology cases showed presence of a valve thrombosis in at least 2 TAV leaflets on autopsy, but were not visualized by transthoracic echocardiogram or transesophageal echocardiogram. One case was medically treated with oral anti coagulation with normalization of gradients. The consequence of valve thrombosis in all 3 pathology patients either directly or indirectly played a role in their early demise. At least 18 case reports of early valve thrombosis have been published. In 12 of these cases, the early treatment with anticoagulation therapy resolved the thrombus formation and normalized aortic pressures gradients successfully.

MethodsA bicentric case–control study was performed about 207 patients with AoS, without symptoms, a peak aortic <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> 3 m/s, and LV ejection fraction (EF) > 50 % and 43 aged-matched normal controls. An echocardiogram was performed at rest and during a standardized exercise stress test. Tissue Doppler, 2 D-strain {{as well as}} conventional echocardiography was identically performed for every patients at rest and during an exercise at 120 ± 10 beats/min. ResultsFor patients with AoS, mean (SD) aortic valve area was 0. 87 (0. 19) cm 2. At rest, LVEF was similar for patients with AoS and controls, respectively (65. 6 (9. 1) vs 63. 3 (6. 6) %, p= 0. 1). However, S’ (tissue Doppler systolic peak) (6. 2 (2. 3) vs 7. 7 (1. 2) cm/s, p< 0. 001) {{and the increase in}} S’ during exercise (7. 5 (2. 6) vs 11. 6 (1. 3) cm/s, p< 0. 001) were lower in patients with AoS. The difference was even greater considering global longitudinal systolic strain (GLS) at rest (- 15. 4 (4. 0) vs - 20. 2 (2. 7)) and during exercise (- 16. 5 (4. 9) vs - 24. 6 (3. 5)).

ConclusionIn patients with similar LV EF, LV longitudinal deformation measured by 2 D-S is providing at rest and even more exercising a clinically relevant tool to distinguish subclinical LV dysfunction induced by the chonic overload due to severe AoS...|$|E
40|$|Reciprocating pumps with {{self-acting}} valves {{are commonly}} used for fluids with poor lubrication properties, high contamination levels or corrosive properties. A study {{has been made of}} the dynamic performance of these pumps, with particular regard to the self-acting valve characteristics. Using computer simulation, the effects of changes in the spring forces on the self-acting valves were investigated for a commercially available pump. The simulations predicted that modifications to spring forces could result in considerable improvements in performance, with increased volumetric efficiency and reduced <b>valve</b> impact <b>velocity</b> and flow ripple. These improvements were borne out experimentally. Vibration and air-borne noise were also greatly reduced.

40|$|Background: Monocusp {{reconstruction}} with a transannular patch (TAP) {{results in}} early improvement because it relieves residual volume hypertension during the immediate postoperative period. However, few reports have assessed the long-term surgical outcomes of this procedure. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to evaluate the mid-term surgical outcomes of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair using monocusp reconstruction with a TAP. Methods: Between March 2000 and March 2009, 36 patients with a TOF received a TAP. A TAP with monocusp reconstruction (group I) was used in 25 patients and a TAP without monocusp reconstruction (group II) was used in 11 patients. We evaluated hemodynamic parameters using echocardiography during t he f ollow-up p eriod in b oth groups. Results: At the most recent follow-up echocardiography (mean follow-up, 8. 2 years), the mean pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>velocities</b> of the patients in group I and group II were 2. 1 ± 1. 0 m/sec and 0. 9 ± 0. 9 m/sec, respectively (p= 0. 001). Although the incidence of grade 3 – 4 pulmonary regurgitation (PR) was not significantly different between the two groups (group I: 16 patients, 64. 0...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{establish}} gestation age specific reference intervals for Doppler indices of fetal cardiac function from 12 to 40 weeks of pregnancy. In a cross-sectional observational study of singleton pregnancies, examinations were performed in 221 women evenly distributed across each week of pregnancy. Blood {{flow through the}} four cardiac valves was examined with Doppler. For the atrioventricular <b>valves,</b> <b>velocity</b> and duration of early (E) and atrial (A) waves and the interval (a) between E/A complexes was recorded. For the outflow valves, the duration (b), peak and average velocity of flow in systole was measured. Myocardial performance index (MPI) was calculated as (a - b) /b. Outlet valve diameters were measured and cardiac outputs were calculated. Gestation age specific ranges were constructed for all these parameters. We demonstrated that the cardiac output, peak systolic and time-averaged velocity increase with advancing gestation. However the MPI and E/A ratios show little change across gestation. Fetal cardiac physiology can be studied and Doppler indices reliably measured {{as early as the}} late first trimester of pregnancy. Establishing gestation age specific ranges for various cardiac indices throughout pregnancy will help the study of development of fetal cardiac function. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} {{the normal range}} of Doppler-derived velocities and gradients, their relation to direct flow measurements {{and the importance of}} prosthetic valve design on the relation between Doppler and catheter derived gradients, five sizes of normal St. Jude bileaflet, Medtronic-Hall tilting disc, Starr-Edwards caged ball and Hancock bioprosthetic aortic valves were studied with use of a pulsatile flow model. A strong linear correlation between peak velocity and peak flow, and mean velocity and mean flow, was found in all four valve types (r = 0. 96 to 0. 99). In small St. Jude and Hancock valves, Doppler velocities and corresponding gradients increased dramatically with increasing low, resulting in velocities and gradients as high as 4. 7 m/s and 89 mm Hg, respectively. The ratio of velocity across the valve to velocity in front of the <b>valve</b> (<b>velocity</b> ratio) was independent of flow in all St. Jude, Medironic-Hall, Starr-Edwards and Hancock valves when the two lowest flow rates were excluded for Hancock valves. Although Doppler peak and mean gradients correlaied well with catheter peak and mean gradients in all four valve types, the actual agreement between the two techniques was acceptable only in Hancock and Medtronic-Hall valves. For St. Jude and Starr-Edwards valves, Doppler gradients significantly and consistently exceeded catheter gradients with differences as great us 44 mm Hg. Thus, Doppler velocities and gradients across normal prosthetic heart valves are highly flow dependent. However, the velocity ratio is independent of flow. Doppler and catheter gradients across prostheses show acceptable agreement in Medtronic-Hall and Hanccck valves, but Doppler gradients may significantly exceed catheter gradients in St. Jude valves and Starr-Edwards valves, especially at high flow rates. The discrepancy between Doppler and, catheter gradients in both St. Jude and Starr-Edwards valves is of potential clinical importance and suggests that localized high velocity jets and pressure recovery occur in these valves...|$|E
40|$|We {{were very}} {{interested}} in the article by Eleid et al 1 reporting a large population of 1704 patients with severe aortic stenosis (< 1 cm 2) and preserved left ventricular function and showing a low prevalence of patients (3 %) with low flow (stroke volume index < 35 mL/m 2) and low gradient (< 40 mm Hg). This prevalence is much lower than previously reported. 2 This discrepancy could be explained, at least in part, by the fact that peak aortic <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> is carefully measured (multiple imaging windows) to avoid underestimation and false clas-sification as a low gradient. As recommended, severe aortic stenosis is defined using a valve area < 1 cm 2 or an indexed valve area < 0. 6 cm 2 /m 2. In patients with obesity, the use of indexed values using body surface area should be avoided (0. 6 cm 2 /m 2), and the nonindexed threshold (1 cm 2) is applied. 3 Stroke volume index is the gold standard to define low flow. Interestingly, in the Eleid et al study, among the 53 patients with low flow and low gradient, a large proportion (47 %) were obese. It has been demonstrated that in overweight and obese subjects, these indexed values systematically underestimate stroke volume. 4 In this population, the derived relationship between resting cardiac output and body surface area was allometric with a scaling exponent of 0. 62. These findings suggest that the current use of the stroke volume index in overweight or obese patients may not be appropriate. To clas-sify these 25 patients, and more generally to be able to diagnose a low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis in obese patients, it would be necessary to evaluate and validate other index methods such as height or body surface area with a scaling exponent. 5 Thus, in our opinion, the definition of low flow used in the article by Eleid et al is not appropriate for obese patients. The 3 % prevalence of severe aortic stenosis with low flow and low gradient is probably overestimated...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the ability of a novel cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) real-time phase contrast (RT-PC) flow measurement technique to reveal the discordant respirophasic changes in mitral and tricuspid valve in flow indicative of the abnormal hemodynamics seen in constrictive pericarditis (CP). BackgroundDefinitive diagnosis of CP requires identification of constrictive hemodynamics with or without pericardial thickening. CMR to date has primarily provided morphological assessment of the pericardium. MethodsSixteen patients (age 57 ± 13 years) undergoing CMR to assess known or suspected CP and 10 controls underwent RT-PC that acquired simultaneous mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocities over 10 s of unrestricted breathing. The diagnosis of CP was confirmed via clinical history, diagnostic imaging, cardiac catheterization, intraoperative findings, and histopathology. ResultsTen patients had CP, all with increased pericardial thickness (6. 2 ± 1. 0 mm). RT-PC imaging demonstrated discordant respirophasic changes in atrioventricular valve inflow velocities in all CP patients, with mean ± SD mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocity variation of 46 ± 20 % and 60 ± 15 %, respectively, compared with 16 ± 8 % and 24 ± 11 % in patients without CP (p 0. 3 for both). Respiratory variation exceeding 25 % across the mitral valve yielded a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 100 %, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. 0 to detect CP physiology. Using a cutoff of 45 %, variation of transtricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>velocity</b> had a sensitivity of 90 %, a specificity of 88 %, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0. 98. ConclusionsAccentuated and discordant respirophasic changes in mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocities characteristic of CP can be identified noninvasively with RT-PC CMR. When incorporated into existing CMR protocols for imaging pericardial morphology, RT-PC CMR provides important hemodynamic evidence with which to make a definite diagnosis of CP...|$|E

40|$|Fast acting valves {{are often}} applied for quick safety {{shut-down}} of pipelines for liquids and {{gases in the}} chemical and petrochemical industry {{as well as in}} power plants and state water supplies. The fast deceleration of the liquid leads to water hammer upstream the valve and to cavitational hammer downstream the fast closing valve. The valve characteristics given by manufacturers are usually measured at steady state flow conditions of the liquid. In comparison, the dynamic characteristics depend on the initial liquid <b>velocity,</b> <b>valve</b> closing <b>velocity,</b> the absolute pipe pressure and the pipe geometry. Fraunhofer UMSICHT conducts various test series examining valve dynamic characteristics in order of the dynamic analysis of pressure surges in fast closing processes. Therefore a test rig is used which consists of two pipelines of DN 50 and DN 100 with an approximate length of 230 m each. In this paper the results of performed pressure surge experiments with fast closing and opening valves will be compared to calculations of commercial software programs such as MONA, FLOWMASTER 2. Thus the calculation software for water supply, power plants, oil and gas and chemical industry can be permanently improved...|$|R
