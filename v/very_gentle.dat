5|$|The BT19 was {{initially}} {{fitted with a}} Hewland HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally designed for use with less powerful 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine {{was more than the}} gearbox could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, with the result that Brabham normally made <b>very</b> <b>gentle</b> starts to avoid gearbox breakages. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at the request of both Brabham and Dan Gurney's Anglo American Racers team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{domestic}} {{peace was}} shattered when Hogg's stepdaughter Jane Rosalind became romantically involved with Henry Hunt, {{the son of}} Leigh Hunt. Hunt had no clear employment prospects, causing Thomas and Jane to doubt the wisdom of a union. Hogg was <b>very</b> <b>gentle</b> when discussing this with his stepdaughter, hoping to avoid treating her the way that Timothy Shelley had treated Percy Shelley years earlier, but Mary Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance. Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her, but she soon returned and married Hunt.|$|E

Montgomery believes Stephano is after a large viper in his museum, which despite its looks, is actually <b>very</b> <b>gentle.</b> He is discovered dead shortly after, and the orphans cannot prove that Stephano is responsible for Montgomery's death. They are almost taken back to him when Sunny proves the viper's innocence when it fondles and licks her, disproving its hostile nature. Stephano flees the scene, ridding all proof of his disguise as the police pursue him.|$|E
