5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The Destroying Angel was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its <b>vividness</b> and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talents. The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous works. In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E

25|$|She {{began to}} take opiates for the pain, {{laudanum}} (an opium concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use {{from an early age}} may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this may also have contributed to the wild <b>vividness</b> of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.|$|E
25|$|Fantasies {{that are}} {{concerned}} with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer. Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great <b>vividness.</b> This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.|$|E
25|$|As a writer, Hall contributed many {{articles}} upon health topics to {{the best}} magazines and other periodicals of the day. Her writings were characterized by a strength of thought, knowledge of her subject and a certain <b>vividness</b> of expression which held {{the attention of the}} reader. Some of her most important articles were: “Unsanitary Condition of Country Houses” (Journal of Social Science, December, 1888); “Inebriety in Women” (Quarterly Journal for Inebriety, October, 1883); “Prison Experiences” (Medico Legal Journal, March, 1888); “Physical Training for Girls” (Popular Science Monthly, February, 1885); “Wherewithal Shall We Be Clothed” (American Woman's Journal, May, 1895).|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare united {{the three}} main streams of literature: verse, poetry, and drama. To the versification of the English language, he {{imparted}} his eloquence and variety giving highest expressions with elasticity of language. The second, the sonnets and poetry, was bound in structure. He imparted economy and intensity to the language. In the third {{and the most important}} area, the drama, he saved the language from vagueness and vastness and infused actuality and <b>vividness.</b> Shakespeare's work in prose, poetry, and drama marked the beginning of modernization of English language by introduction of words and expressions, style and form to the language.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} {{from this period}} are most remarkable for the <b>vividness</b> of the extreme violence and even the human denigration that is often depicted. Such representations are however, also rich in a lyrical content that was to characterise the artist from then on. The juxtaposition of the international tendencies that formed Orellana took a more definite form in this period: his old Spanish inheritance, the input from America, the wealth of archaeological culture and Italy with Conceptualism and Arte Povera. The artist had a solo show at the stand of Juana Mordo at the FIAC 1978, Paris, France. These amalgamated into a whole that {{paved the way for}} new developments in Orellana's work.|$|E
25|$|The visuo-spatial sketchpad {{is part of}} Baddeley and Hitch’s {{model of}} working memory. It is {{responsible}} for temporarily storing visual and spatial information, which is currently being used or encoded. It is {{thought of as a}} three-dimensional cognitive map, which contains spatial features about where the person is and visual images of the area, or an object being concentrated on. It is used in tasks such as mental image manipulation where a person imagines how a real object would look if it were changed in some way (rotated, flipped, moved, change of colour, etc.). It is also responsible for representing how vivid an image is. A vivid image is one which you have a high potential for retrieving its sensory details. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for holding onto the visual and spatial qualities of a vivid image in your working memory, and the degree of <b>vividness</b> is directly affected by the limits of the sketchpad.|$|E

500|$|Pliny's writing style emulates that of Seneca. It aims less at {{clarity and}} <b>vividness</b> than at epigrammatic point. It {{contains}} many antitheses, questions, exclamations, tropes, metaphors, and other mannerisms of the Silver Age. His sentence structure is often loose and straggling. There is heavy {{use of the}} ablative absolute, and ablative phrases are often appended {{in a kind of}} vague [...] "apposition" [...] to express the author's own opinion of an immediately previous statement, e.g., ...|$|E

[...] throwback to Andy Warhol and all the colors and <b>vividness</b> and bright boldness that was in that artwork. I'm a big collector of pop art and graffiti art at this point, too — D*Face and Banksy, also Roy Lichtenstein ... and it's been very fun venturing off into that zone.|$|E

Like most reviewers, Chick highly praised the artistic design, as well as the game's atmospheric music and <b>vividness</b> of the environment: [...] "It's all ink and vellum and cursive script and layers of lovingly drawn facades drawn on plywood and stacked up for a 19th Century stage production." ...|$|E
500|$|Information {{regarding}} the contemporary reception to [...] "" [...] is scant. Reed relates that the song had [...] "immediate popularity", and that Schubert composing the Trout Quintet {{was evidence that}} [...] "" [...] "was already widely known" [...] by 1819. Newbould agrees, {{pointing out that the}} quintet was [...] "acknowledging the song's meteoric rise up early nineteenth-century Vienna's equivalent to the charts". Fischer-Dieskau takes a longer-term view of the song's popularity, writing that [...] "the <b>vividness</b> of the imagery, with the alternate troubling and smoothing of {{the surface of the water}} along with the exuberance of the melody itself, account for the song's universal appeal".|$|E
500|$|Grandma Moses {{died at age}} 101 on December 13, 1961 at the Health Center in Hoosick Falls, New York. She {{is buried}} there at the Maple Grove Cemetery. President John F. Kennedy memorialized her: [...] "The death of Grandma Moses removed a beloved figure from American life. The {{directness}} and <b>vividness</b> of her paintings restored a primitive freshness to our perception of the American scene. Both her work and her life helped our nation renew its pioneer heritage and recall {{its roots in the}} countryside and on the frontier. All Americans mourn her loss." [...] After her death, her work was exhibited in several large traveling exhibitions in the United States and abroad.|$|E
500|$|The {{fantasy of}} She {{received}} particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in The Academy on 15 January {{was impressed by}} the [...] "grown-up" [...] vision of the novel, declaring [...] "the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain vraisemblance [...] makes the most impossible adventures appear true". This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this is a tale {{in the hands of a}} writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much <b>vividness</b> and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.|$|E
500|$|CG director, Takayuki Chiba studied keren, a kabuki stagecraft {{technique}} using various props {{to surprise}} audiences and immerse {{them in the}} show. Chiba attempted to apply this technique with CG to reproduce a <b>vividness</b> associated with live actor productions. He aimed to produce a smooth 2D-3D product full of Japanese flavor, rather than something like a [...] "Disney production". The team scanned real objects and used them in the show. Rice seasoning powder and bird feed became the dust and rubble in scenes of collapsing structures. They also scanned Korean dried seaweed, gim for other scenes. The animation team drew frames interpolating the motion between key frames by hand, and digitally interpolated those frames to create slow motion sequences. Editing teams in the industry normally time stretch the sequence with repeated still frames to produce these shots. Ibira reflected that typical 30-minute anime episodes consist of approximately 300 key frames. The first episode of Karas, however, consisted of approximately 700 key frames.|$|E
500|$|The scene soon {{descended into}} chaos; the dancers shrieked in pain as they burned in their costumes, and the audience, {{many of them}} also {{sustaining}} burns, screamed {{as they tried to}} rescue the burning men. The event was chronicled in uncharacteristic <b>vividness</b> by the Monk of St Denis, who wrote that [...] "four men were burned alive, their flaming genitals dropping to the floor... releasing a stream of blood". Only two dancers survived: the King, thanks to the quick reactions of the Duchess of Berry, and the Sieur de Nantouillet, who jumped into an open vat of wine and remained there until the flames were extinguished. The Count de Joigny died at the scene; Yvain de Foix, son of Gaston Fébus, Count of Foix, and Aimery Poitiers, son of the Count of Valentinois, lingered with painful burns for two days. The instigator of the affair, Huguet de Guisay, survived a day longer, described by Tuchman as bitterly [...] "cursing and insulting his fellow dancers, the dead and the living, until his last hour".|$|E
500|$|In Arhanghelii, the {{implicit}} Christian lesson {{is about the}} love of money and its devastation of an Apuseni get-rich mining community. At {{the heart of the}} novel is a former notary, Rodean, whose gold claim appears to be endlessly productive and corrupting. As Șăineanu writes: [...] "with emotion and mounting interest, we witness here the ephemeral joys and disasters that this modern-day Moloch pours over this once-peaceful village." [...] The novel, Lovinescu argues, is overall [...] "awkward", but still interesting as a social fresco, called a [...] "frightening human torment" [...] by Iorga. Șăineanu deplores its [...] "prolixity" [...] and arcane mining terminology. As argued by Dragomirescu, the climax, where Rodean runs from the card table to see his mine collapsing, [...] "has remarkable qualities of literary <b>vividness</b> and vigor." [...] Nicolae Manolescu offers praise to the work, a [...] "solidly realistic novel" [...] that, although widely seen as a pastiche from Slavici, should still be taken into account for its [...] "originality and newness". He sees Agârbiceanu as an [...] "unlucky" [...] novelist, whose work was eclipsed by that of Rebreanu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Gala Galaction, which it only resembles coincidentally.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the film was the poor quality of its {{animation}}. Berardinelli called it {{some of the worst}} CGI animation in memory. He felt that the characters looked plastic, considered the backgrounds dull, and wrote, [...] "On more than one occasion, I thought I was watching something made for TV. When compared to today's visual standards for animated films, Hoodwinked is far below the curve." [...] Burr considered the film's surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to [...] "Teletubbieland reupholstered with Naugahyde." [...] Westbrook felt that the animation worked well for the animal characters, but wrote, [...] "the humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness, much like work done {{in the early days of}} CG... That art has come too far to embrace a throwback like Hoodwinked as lovably quaint. It's simply dated." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post compared the characters to rubber toys, and wrote, [...] "their faces are without nuance or <b>vividness...</b> In movement, especially, do they lack grace and conviction. It seems like the recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed the poor Edwards fellows, as it looks stuck somewhere in the 1970s, or maybe even earlier." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics admired Etty's unusual {{interpretation}} of apocalyptic religious imagery, {{his ability to}} give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the <b>vividness</b> of his imagination. The Morning Post particularly praised Etty's ability to convey [...] "creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration" [...] by combining the [...] "dauntless spirit of a sketch" [...] with the [...] "powerful impression of a finished picture". The prominent art critic William Paulet Carey (writing {{under the name of}} 'Ridolfi') championed The Destroying Angel, and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness. Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and The Destroying Angel as evidence of Etty's [...] "redeeming grace and spirit". Etty's long-standing adversaries at The Morning Chronicle found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that [...] "The upper part of the picture is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing." [...] The reticence of The Morning Chronicle prompted Carey to comment that they were in [...] "envious silence".|$|E
500|$|This {{scene is}} {{remarkable}} {{not only for}} its <b>vividness</b> but {{as one of the few}} parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content. The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society. For every [...] "I have not..." [...] in the Negative Confession, it is possible to read an unexpressed [...] "Thou shalt not". While the Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation, the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality. [...] Views differ among Egyptologists about how far the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute, with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife. John Taylor points out the wording of Spells 30B and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths, it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure. Ogden Goelet says [...] "without an exemplary and moral existence, there was no hope for a successful afterlife", while Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Negative Confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons, and that the success of the Weighing of the Heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased's moral behaviour.|$|E

Saturation refers to the <b>vividness</b> or brightness of the hue, and tone is the lightness to darkness of the hue. Blue sapphire exists in various mixtures of its primary (blue) and secondary hues, various tonal levels (shades) and at various levels of saturation (<b>vividness).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Van Gogh used complementary, {{contrasting}} {{colors to}} bring an intensity to his work, which evolved over the periods of his work. [...] Two complementary colors of {{the same degree of}} <b>vividness</b> and contrast." [...] Van Gogh mentioned the liveliness and interplay of [...] "a wedding of two complementary colors, their mingling and opposition, the mysterious vibrations of two kindred souls." [...] An example of use of complementary colors is The Sower where gold is contrasted to purple and blue with orange to intensify the impact of the work.|$|E
2500|$|Algis Budrys praised Dune for the <b>vividness</b> of its {{imagined}} setting, saying [...] "The time lives. It breathes, it speaks, and Herbert has smelt {{it in his}} nostrils." [...] But Budrys {{also found}} that [...] "Dune turns flat and tails off at the end. ... ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah." [...] He faults in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying [...] "you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek." ...|$|E

A series of monumental representations of secular male and female founders of the cathedral of Naumburg, the statues are characterized by startling <b>vividness</b> and by theatrical interaction″.

2500|$|Speaking {{during the}} late 1880s, the {{historian}} and politician Mihail Kogălniceanu, {{who was responsible for}} the 1855 abolition of slavery in Moldavia under Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, claimed that: [...] "aside from the [...] lăieşi Gypsies, who still live in part in Gypsy camps, and Ursari, who are presently working in the taming of wild beasts, but are nevertheless involved in working the land, almost all of the other classes of Gypsies have blended into the larger mass of the nation, and are only told apart by their swarthy and Asian-like faces and the <b>vividness</b> of their imagination".|$|E
2500|$|Red gape color {{has been}} shown in several {{experiments}} to induce feeding. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system with barn swallow nestlings showed the <b>vividness</b> of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell–mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape. Conversely, the red gape of the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) did not induce extra feeding in host parents. Some brood parasites, such as the Hodgson's hawk-cuckoo [...] (C. fugax), have colored patches on the wing that mimic the gape color of the parasitized species.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result was}} the contrast, which Parker describes, between the {{original}} 1857 act 2 finale, [...] "set in a large square in Genoa, [...] a conventional four-movement concertante finale, a grand ceremonial scene" [...] whereas, in the 1881 revision, [...] " [...] injected {{into the heart of}} the work an episode of enormous <b>vividness</b> and power, enriching the character of Boccanegra in such a way that his subsequent death scene gains considerably in impressiveness". And, as Budden puts it, [...] "Simone (sic) rises to spiritual greatness. [...] For the first time, his moral authority puts forth all its strength,... positively as in the appeal for peace..." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Austen scholar Norman Page explains, [...] "the first {{sentence}} is straight narrative, in the 'voice' {{of the the}} third sentence is normal indirect speech; but the second and fourth are what is usually described as free indirect speech." [...] In these two sentences, Austen represents the inner thoughts of the character and creates the illusion that the reader is entering the character's mind. She often uses indirect speech for background characters. However, Page writes that [...] "for Jane Austen... the supreme virtue of free indirect speech... that it offers the possibility of achieving something of the <b>vividness</b> of speech without the appearance {{for a moment of}} a total silencing of the authorial voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{architecture}} and other decorative arts, [...] diaper is applied as a decorative {{treatment of a}} surface with a repeat pattern of squares (chequers), rectangles, or lozenges. Diaper was particularly used in mediaeval stained glass to increase the <b>vividness</b> of a coloured pane, for example the field in a shield of arms. A stone wall may be decorated with such a pattern sculpted in relief; in brickwork the effect may be achieved by using bricks of [...] different colours, or by allowing certain bricks to protrude from the wall's surface to create a regular diamond-shaped pattern. In English flushwork, limestone and dark knapped flint are used. Windows may be set in a diamond-shaped lattice.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare {{helped to}} further develop style and {{structure}} to an otherwise loose, spontaneous language. Written Elizabethan English stylistically closely followed the spoken language. The naturalness gave force and freedom {{since there was}} no formalized prescriptive grammar binding the expression. While lack of prescribed grammatical rules introduced vagueness in literature, it also expressed feelings with profound <b>vividness</b> and emotion which created, [...] "freedom of expression" [...] and [...] "vividness of presentment". It was a language which expressed feelings explicitly. Shakespeare's gift involved using the exuberance of the language and decasyllabic structure in prose and poetry of his plays to reach the masses and the result was [...] "a constant two way exchange between learned and the popular, together producing the unique combination of racy tang and the majestic stateliness that informs the language of Shakespeare".|$|E
