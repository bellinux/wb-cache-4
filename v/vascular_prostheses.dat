40|$|ObjectiveWe have {{recently}} developed a thrombin-free fibrin-coated vascular prosthesis {{that has a}} high performance rate in producing graft antithrombogenicity. We hypothesized that autologous, compared with xenologous, fibrin coatings could improve the antithrombogenicity of grafts by reducing immunologic response. MethodsAutologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> and/or xenologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> (internal diameter, 2 mm; length, 2. 5 cm) were implanted in the bilateral carotid arteries of 50 Japanese white rabbits. They were classified into 2 groups by the selection of grafts in the individual: group I (autologous fibrin-coated vascular prosthesis and xenologous fibrin-coated vascular prosthesis); and group II (group IIa: both autologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses,</b> or group IIx: both xenologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses).</b> During a maximum of 180 days after implantation, we evaluated the thrombotic, inflammatory, and immunologic responses associated with both types of graft. ResultsAll grafts were patent at each end point. In group I, both platelet deposition and anti-graft antibodies in autologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> were significantly less than those in xenologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> until postoperative day 30. At postoperative day 10, there were significantly fewer CD 45 -positive infiltrating cells in autologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses,</b> and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, and nuclear factor-kappa B expression in autologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> were less than those in xenologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses.</b> The neointimal hyperplasia in autologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> was significantly decreased at postoperative day 180. In group II, serial changes of serum levels of immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G, interleukin- 1 β, and tissue-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 ratio in autologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> were significantly less than those in xenologous fibrin-coated <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses.</b> In both grafts, platelet deposition significantly correlated with serum immunoglobulin G level and tissue-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 ratio.

40|$|Vascular tissue {{engineering}} represents a new but rapidly growing field {{due to the}} need for better <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> for coronary or peripheral revascularization procedures.

40|$|Background—Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{is known}} to exaggerate coronary artery disease, sometimes leading to irreversible myocardial damage. In such cases, repetitive coronary revascularization including coronary artery bypass grafting is needed, which may cause a shortage of graft conduits. On the other hand, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is an attractive target of cardiovascular gene therapy. The <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses,</b> of which the inner surfaces are covered with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing eNOS, are expected to offer feasible effects of NO and angiogenic effects of MSCs on the native coronary arterial beds, as well as improvement of self-patency. Herein, we attempted to develop small caliber <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> generating the bioactive proteins. Also, we attempted to transduce eNOS cDNA into MSCs. Methods and Results—The MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and transduced with each adenovirus harboring rat eNOS cDNA and -galactosidase (-gal) (eNOS/MSCs and -gal/MSCs). The -gal/MSCs were impregnated into <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses,</b> then the expressions of -gal on the inner surfaces of them were evaluated by 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl -D-galactoside staining.

40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{a progressive}} {{disease of the}} arterial vascular system. A sclerosis of the vascular wall leads to to reduced perfusion of the supply area. After exploiting all possibilities of revascularization, a majoramputation is not unavoidable. To maintain the livability after the amputation rapid care of the stump with a prosthesis is desirable. A proper stump healing is therefore obligatory. However, due to the usually multi-morbid patients collective, a wound healing disorder with infection is not seldom. An alloplastic bypass prosthesis left in situ is an irritant factor in the healing process. The surgical therapy option for a complete bypass explantation {{in the case of}} wound healing of an amputation stump is up for discussion. Methodology A total of 303 patients were examined retrospectively at the Paul Gerhardt Stift in the Lutherstadt Wittenberg between 10 / 2003 and 10 / 2010, which received a PAVK-induced majoramputation. They were investigated for the characteristics of risk factors, age, sex and infection status of the stump postoperatively {{as well as on the}} characteristics of a post-traumatization and a <b>vascular</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> which remains completely explanted or remains in situ during the stump wound healing disorder. Results The risk of post-amputation increases significantly with <b>vascular</b> <b>prosthesis</b> (38. 38 % vs. 25. 15 %). Patients after alloplastic bypass with in-situ prosthesis have significant accumulation of deep stump infections in the presence of the infected vascular graft compared to patients without previous bypass surgery (23, 23 % vs 16, 16 %). A stump after the initially performed <b>vascular</b> <b>prosthesis</b> supply is significantly more frequently after-treated. A total of 40. 40 % of the bypasses are not fully explanted. The infected vascular graft is significantly more frequently explanted than an uninfected prosthesis. The mortality during the stationary treatment of the patients receiving the prosthesis is significantly lower than in the control group without a <b>vascular</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> In the subgroup analysis of the vascular prosthesis-treated patients there is an increased risk of mortality for the patients who have been treated with the prosthesis in situ. Conclusion Even if patients with a <b>vascular</b> <b>prosthesis</b> remaining in situ are frequently more frequently infected with the primary majoramputation and are frequently followed by post-amputation, it is possible to perform a blunt healing without complete <b>vascular</b> <b>prosthesis</b> explantation. Due to a lower mortality of the treatment without prosthesis exploration it is possible to avoid a complete explantation if possible. In the case of deep infection including the prosthesis, a consistent therapeutic approach is indicated despite the increased mortality with complete explantation of the alloplastic material and the subsequent autologous reconstruction with retention of the proundar perfusion. A recommendation for the regular complete explantation of the <b>vascular</b> <b>prosthesis</b> during the primary amputation can not be given...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThrombogenity of small-diameter <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> {{might be}} reduced by {{complete}} coverage of the luminal surface with vascular cells. We investigated cell seeding on polyurethane <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses.</b> MethodsThirty polyurethane <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> were divided into 3 groups of 10 each: group A, diameter of 20 mm and γ-sterilized; group B, diameter of 4 mm and γ-sterilized; and group C, diameter of 4 mm and ethylene oxide sterilized. Human smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells were isolated from saphenous vein segments and expanded in culture. Five polyurethane <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> of each group were seeded with endothelial cells alone (mean, 4. 8 ± 1. 2 × 106 cells), and the remaining 5 polyurethane <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> were preseeded with a mixed culture of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (mean, 7. 7 ± 2. 3 × 106 cells), followed by endothelial cell seeding (mean, 4. 4 ± 0. 9 × 106 cells). Seven days after cell seeding, the polyurethane <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> were perfused under a pulsatile flow (80 pulses/min, 140 / 80 mm Hg, and 120 mL/min) for 2 hours. Specimens were taken after each seeding procedure {{both before and after}} perfusion and then examined both with a scanning electron microscope and immunohistochemically. ResultsIsolated endothelial cell seeding revealed better initial adhesion in groups A and B than in group C (63 % vs 33 %). After 7 days, the cells had covered approximately 80 % of the luminal surface in groups A and B, whereas group C cells rounded up and lost adhesion. After perfusion testing of group A and B prostheses, only 10 % of the surface was still covered with endothelial cells. Preseeding with the mixed culture again revealed a better initial adhesion in groups A and B compared with that in group C (76 % vs 41 %). In groups A and B endothelial cell seeding (adhesion, 72 %) resulted in a confluent endothelial cell layer. The results of immunohistochemical staining were positive for collagen IV, laminin, CD 31, and Factor VIII. In group C only isolated cells were found after each seeding procedure, which rounded up and vanished during the next days. Perfusion testing of group A and B prostheses revealed that the confluent cell layer remained stable, with only small defects (< 10 % of the surface). The cells stained positivively for endothelial nitric oxide synthase. ConclusionSeeding of a mixed culture out of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells resulted in improved endothelial cell adhesion and resistance to shear stress. This outcome was caused by an increased synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins.

The prostheses were evaluated by means of routine light and scanning electron microscopy during a 6 -week period after implantation. All prostheses were patent at harvesting. On implantation, the control polytetrafluoroethylene <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> were only scarcely covered with platelets.

In contrast, both the alcohol-pretreated polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses and the polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses with a fibril length of 60 -mu-m were completely covered by a thin clot layer on implantation. At 6 weeks after implantation these prostheses had almost completely healed {{as a result of}} organization of the thin clot layer by ingrowth of both endothelial and smooth muscle cells. These results demonstrate that increasing hydrophilicity of polytetrafluoroethylene <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> by alcohol pretreatment or enlarging their fibril length improves their healing by induction of a thin luminal clot layer.

Therefore, the mechanical behaviour of commercial <b>vascular</b> <b>prostheses</b> is examined, as well as the behaviour of two rubbers. Quasi-static tests are performed on latex and silicone tubes, two different prostheses made of Dacron, and a Gore prosthesis. The compliance of the examined prostheses is much less than the compliance of the arteries. Silicone seems to be a promising material, considering its high compliance and good biochemical characteristics. It is found that the material parameters, defied in the uni-axial tests, can be used to predict the behaviour of the tubes in an inflation test. This is shown for the isotropic material latex. For the anisotropic Dacron prostheses a possible outline is given how to define the material parameters. ...|$|E
