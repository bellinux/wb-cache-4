Considering the increased demand in Northern India he opened another factory in Nagpur. The Nagpur unit was closed in the late 60's due to various problems faced by the company. The raw material for the leaf springs, spring steel flats used to be imported into the country.

40|$|The {{so-called}} {{secondary cooling}} zone {{is an important part}} of the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> In this zone, a breakout may occur because of an increase of the local and temperature heterogeneity of steel, resulting from an increase of the stress caused by bending of the slab and by high local concentration of nonmetallic slag inclusions. Changes of the chemical composition of steel during <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> are particularly dangerous. In the event that two melts are cast one after another, that is, if the melt of steel with chemical composition A ends and is immediately followed by the steel B, it may automatically stop the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> and an atypical breakout may take place.

40|$|The {{operation}} mode of <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machines</b> {{has a great}} influence on internal and surface defects of cast ingots. When a solidifying ingot passes along the process line of the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> stress and deformations arise in its solidifying skin, it leading to cracks formation and determining the quality of production. The contemporary investigations are devoted mainly to the existing {{operation mode}}s of <b>continuous</b> <b>casting,</b> in which the field of temperature distribution in ingot is stationary in the system of coordinates, linked with the crystallizer. Little attention {{has so far been}} paid to transition periods, due to difficulties of investigation and description of the processes happening during these periods. During the period of completion of <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> the rate of ingotâs drawing is reduced to the minimal possible value, thus ensuring trouble-free operation of <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machines,</b> the tail part of slabs being cooled down in a greater degree than the bulk of slabs. At this temperature reduction in the tail part the metal gets into the area of resilience, it greatly increasing the likeness of surface cracks formation and other defects. Due to this reason {{it is very important to}} know the ingotâs stress in its tail part. This problem can be solved by means of a mathematical model. This work presents a numerical simulation of a stressed state of a steel slab on a horizontal section of a curved continuous caster. The data, regarding temperature and stresses distribution were obtained for the surface of the bulk of continuously cast ingot and its tail part. The value of stress in ingotâs tail part can exceed its yield point, resulting in appearance of residual deformations and changes in ingotâs width. Unfavourable distribution of temperature stresses can be altered by correction of cooling in the tail part of continuously cast ingo...|$|R
