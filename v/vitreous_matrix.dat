40|$|The highly hydrated, almost {{acellular}} {{vitreous body}} of the human eye consists of only 0. 1 % macromolecules, of which collagens {{are the most important}} for its matrix structure. During embryological development, the human vitreous body is a highly dynamic matrix, in which the primary (vascular) vitreous is gradually replaced by the secondary (avascular) vitreous. With aging, the human vitreous undergoes a slowly progressive remodelling, characterized by the gradual formation of collagenous condensations and liquefied spaces in the gel structure. The former is probably the result of collagen synthesis and the deposition of newly formed collagen into the matrix, while the latter is probably due to collagen breakdown. Therefore, remodelling of the <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix</b> starts {{at a very early age}} and continues into old age, albeit at a slower pace. Older theories and concepts of a strict spatial separation between the primary and secondary vitreous during embryonic development, and morphological changes in the aging vitreous being due to a simple aggregation of collagen fibrils are questioned.

40|$|Silicate glass {{will be used}} to {{stabilize}} high-level radioactive wastes (HLW) for disposal in a geological repository. The chemical durability of waste glass in the repository will be determined by the nature and progress of the glass-water (underground water) reaction. Aqueous corrosion of HLW glasses is known to result in the chemical alteration of the glass surface and the formation of secondary phases. Accurate quantitative analysis the altered glass surface and the reaction products that form is important for understanding the reaction kinetics and mechanism of glass corrosion. SEM/EDS is a powerful tool to study the alteration of waste-disposal glasses through quantitatively characterizing the reaction products. It is able to detect trace elements at concentrations less than 1 wt. %: for example, Fig. 1 shows the uranium peaks detected by SEM/EDS of a typical simulated waste glass, which contains 0. 25 wt. % uranium in the matrix glass according to ICP/MS analysis. Nickel (0. 44 wt. %) and chromium (0. 47 wt. %) peaks are also clearly distinguishable in the spectrum. However, quantitative analyses of glass compositions are complicated by the lack of well-characterized reference samples having known and homogeneous compositions for candidate waste glasses, which may contain a combination of more than 20 different elements in one matrix. It has been proposed that unreacted glass with known compositions could satisfactorily serve as standards for quantitative analysis of waste-disposal glasses and the secondary phases. The main advantage of using such standards is that they contain all the elements to be analyzed in the homogeneous <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrices.</b> In this paper, we evaluate several reference waste glasses with respect to their suitability as standard samples for quantitative SEM/EDS analysis.

30|$|Linear and {{nonlinear}} {{optical properties}} of metal [1, 2] and semiconductor [3, 4] nanoparticles are now well-known, and numerous applications [5, 6] have been envisaged for ages. In the past decade, {{we have witnessed}} huge advances in chemical synthesis of nanoparticles (NPs), especially metal NPs that have found applications in plasmonics-based biosensors and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detectors [7, 8] and biological fluorescent labeling [9]. Up to now, the commercial use of NPs, still limited to colloidal solutions or thin films, is always based on the linear optical properties of metal clusters (the so-called surface plasmon resonance (SPR)) or of semiconducting nanocrystals (tunable exciton light emission). In order to exploit the now demonstrated nonlinear optical properties [10, 11] of such quantum dots and to go further towards photonics applications (lasers, optical fibers), we now need to embed the nanocrystal in <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrices,</b> if possible, in a localized manner. However, {{in the state of}} the art, when nanoparticles can be produced in glasses or other transparent matrices, it is essentially without space selectivity. Through photosensitivity effects, the laser techniques have been demonstrated for many years to be efficient in structuring the matter and more particularly in Bragg embodiment in optical waveguides [12]. Either isotropic or anisotropic linear refractive index changes (up to a few 10 − 3) have been obtained under laser irradiation, due to densification processes or stoichiometric defects in hydrogen-loaded germanosilicate glasses. Furthermore, where pulsed lasers are used with higher fluence or high peak power density, larger densification and even damaging can occur, yielding a large refractive index contrast, a seducing application of which could be imagined in the topical domain of data storage [13]. Finally, at the highest power density, the intense electric field may blast the matter, producing surface corrugation or microbubbles. With regard to the production of NPs using a laser, apart from the now well-known pulsed-laser deposition and laser pyrolysis techniques, a recent method based on laser-induced transfer of molten metal allowed to deposit one unique small gold particle (20 nm diameter) on a surface [14]. All of these techniques are however inappropriate for doping a bulk sample with NPs.|$|R

40|$|Using {{light and}} {{transmission}} electron microscopy, we observed novel {{structures in the}} rabbit vitreous body. They were found in 18 out of 27 eyes from rabbits 0. 5 - 36 months of age. These structures are scattered throughout the entire <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix.</b> By light and transmission electron microscopy, {{they appear to be}} made up of the same structural components. Based upon their morphological appearance. they call be subdivided into two groups which we provisionally named 'intravitreal structure type 1 and 2 ' or 'IVS- 2 ' and 'IVS- 2 '. IVS- 1 has a highly variable morphology (e. g. star-shaped, round, oval). whereas IVS- 2 is tubular. The dimensions of IVS- 1 vary in relation to the mesh diameters of the collagen matrix, while those of IVS- 2 do not. In adult rabbit eyes, we observed transitions between IVS- 1 and intravitreal ghost vessels (acellular remnants of blood vessels). and between IVS- 1 and IVS- 2. In very young rabbits (14 days) we observed intravitreal ghost vessels consisting of tightly-packed IVS- 1. Therefore, we concluded that IVS- 1 and 2 are related structures presumably of vascular origin. It appears that they represent fragmented and non-fragmented acellular remnants of hyaloid blood vessels. The presence of vascular remnants throughout the entire <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix</b> of adult rabbit eyes is in conflict with existing theories on the embryonic development of the vitreous body, which describe a strict spatial separation between the primary (vascular) and secondary (avascular) vitreous. However, it strongly supports an alternative theory that explains the formation of the secondary vitreous by a process of continuous remodelling of the primary vitreous.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the composition of ghost vessels and the newly identified intravitreal structures type 1 and 2 (IVS- 1 and 2) observed in the rabbit vitreous body. Rabbit eyes in = 10, 0. 5 - similar to 36 months of age were fixed and embedded in plastic. Post-embedding immune transmission electron microscopy and enzyme digestion methods specifically directed at vascular extracellular matrix components (collagen IV. elastin and hyaluronan) were used in order to confirm the postulated vascular origin of IVS- 1 and 2. In addition, markers of vitreous extracellular matrix components (collagen II, hyaluronan) were used. The postulated vascular nature of ghost vessels and IVS- 1 was confirmed by a positive labelling with anti-collagen IV. whereas the demonstration of elastin (by anti-elastin antibodies and elastase digestion) in IVS- 1 and 2 confirms their arterial origin. These vascular remnants were also labelled with a hyaluronan marker and with anti-collagen II. The presence of remnants of the hyaloid artery system throughout the <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix</b> is in conflict with a strict spatial separation between the primary and secondary vitreous during embryonic development as proposed in the literature. It strongly supports an alternative theory which suggests an interactive remodelling of this matrix. The presence of hyaluronan in remnants of the hyaloid system is inconclusive, since hyaluronan is a component both of the adult <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix</b> and of the vascular extracellular matrix. The presence of collagen II in vascular structures is highly interesting, since it supports another challenging theory, which suggests that lamellae develop alongside tracts formerly occupied by the larger hyaloid vessels.

40|$|Research is in {{progress}} to incorporate nuclear waste in new matrices with high structural stability, resistance to thermal shock, and high chemical durability. Interactions with water are important for materials used as a containment matrix for the radio nuclides. It is indispensable to improve their chemical durability to limit the possible release of radioactive chemical species, if the glass structure is attacked by corrosion. By associating high structural stability and high chemical durability, silica glass optimizes the properties of a suitable host matrix.

40|$|International audienceFundamental {{processes}} {{taking place}} in UV and IR laser ablation and their significance for LA-ICP-MS measurements were investigated with synthetic glassy materials. LA-ICP-MS experiments were conducted on several <b>vitreous</b> and crystallized <b>matrices</b> with different composition using two Nd∶YAG laser ablation systems operating at 1064 nm and 266 nm. Macro-scale effects of the laser factors and matrix properties were evaluated with ICP-MS detection. In-situ investigation of the laser ablation process was carried out at the micro-scale to assess physical and chemical transformations of the original material, based on electron probe microanalysis of ablation products collected on filters and laser impacts. Fragments and beads in the 1 – 10 µm range enriched in refractory elements (Ca, Al) were characteristic of IR laser ablation, whereas sub-microscopic particles with similar composition to the original matrix were found for UV laser ablation. LA-ICP-MS response factors for matrix and minor elements appeared {{to be dependent on}} both the chemical composition and structure of the matrix (up to 30 % and 60 % for the UV and IR laser, respectively) and were also different for the two lasers by a factor 10. The use of La, a refractory matrix element, as an internal standard could compensate for differences in the ablation yield and thus limit matrix effects. However, fractionation effects were observed for the IR laser and also, to a lesser extent, with the UV one for volatile elements (e. g., Pb, As, B, Cs). Elemental fractionation effects were correlated with the oxide melting point of the elements as the LA-ICP-MS response factors for the IR laser normalized by the UV ones showed a linear relation with this parameter. At the micro-scale, the samples underwent physical and chemical differentiation that could be explained in terms of fusion, vaporization and fragmentation, resulting in the recombination of the analytes in the ablation products...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBeside the {{continuous}} improvement of active ions-doped optical fibers, {{there is a}} growing interest in the development of optical fibers doped with nanostructures like metallic gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Such systems exhibit unique optical properties, dependent on their size and shape as well as on their dielectric surrounding. Hence, dense silica glasses containing GNPs are of significant interest in various fields including nonlinear optics[1]. However these potential technological applications require a controlled synthesis of metal-dielectric nanocomposites with well-defined and thermally stable NPs, compatible with fiber manufacturing. To obtain those NPs in pure silica glass, the sol-gel process has been successfully used for several years but essentially in thin films[2] or at least in porous structures. This lack of experimental achievements is particularly true for gold nanocrystals in <b>vitreous</b> silica <b>matrix.</b> In this work we report on a novel method based on the embedment of zirconia-coated GNPs in a silica sol, so as to prepare vitrified silica glasses doped with GNPs for photonic applications. The typical size of the GNPs synthesized in solution is about 5 nm at room temperature. Then the GNPs/ZrO 2 solution is incorporated in the SiO 2 sol to obtain a similar concentration of dopant in each part of the matrix. The obtained sample is dried at 120 °C and then annealed in air at 850 °C to eliminate the organic residues. In order to check an eventual influence of the GNPs insertion on the structure of the silica matrix and to follow the evolution of this structure under heat-treatment, Raman spectra of the doped xerogel are recorded. Such nanocomposite xerogels are then densified under air at 1100 °C. After this sintering step the low-wavenumber peak (Boson peak) appears around 50 cm− 1 which is commonly interpreted as a proof for the gel-to-glass transition, namely a complete densification of the silica network. The role of the zirconia is here to protect GNPs during this high temperature step thanks to its refractory properties. In this way pink and monolithic glass rods suitable for serving as optical fiber preforms are obtained. The persistent pink color suggests the conservation of GNPs inside the silica matrix during the xerogel-to-glass transition. TEM analysis confirms the presence of GNPs with diameters between 10 nm in the xerogel stabilized at 850 °C and around 30 nm after sintering at 1100 °C. The slight increase in the GNPs size between the two annealing temperatures is a normal behavior for nano-objects explained by the Ostwald ripening phenomenon in solid solutions. During the conference, we will detail the structure and morphology of the GNPs with inter reticular spaces in good agreement with the distance between the (111) planes of “cubic” gold. Presence of Zirconia in the surrouding of GNPs could not be clearly detected with TEM and EDX analysis. We will also detail the optical properties of the doped silica glass. Linear optical properties first with the report of a well-defined absorption band around 520 nm, doubtlessly attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of GNPs. In fact, the observed SPR band positions remain compatible with small spherical GNPs in a silica matrix. Even if the presence and the role of zirconia around GNPs is not clearly established, the present synthesis method seems to favor the conservation of smaller nanoparticles inside the glass with a better control of the size distribution, as compared with the GNPs synthesis in pure silica glass proposed in our previous work [3]. As regards the third-order optical nonlinear properties of sample, behavior of this GNP/ZrO 2 -doped silica glass is analyzed by Z-scan technique based on the conventional one. Closed-aperture Z-scan transmittance are numerically processed from the acquired images by a CCD camera [4]. The sample is moved in the focal region along the beam propagation direction (Z axis) and the incident intensity at 532 nm adjusted by a polarizing system at the entry of the setup. The experimental profile of the transmittance spectra recorded is characteristic of saturable absorption phenomena and the numerical fit gives a negative nonlinear absorption coefficient, β, of about - 13. 7 cm/GW close to the SPR wavelength. Then a linear optical absorption spectrum is recorded in the irradiated zone after the nonlinear measurements to check a possible photobleaching of the GNPs. Furthermore, a careful examination of the sample surface under microscope showed that it remained intact at the point the laser beam was focused on. It is a difficult to compare the obtained nonlinear absorption coefficient β with other values taken in the literature because of the strong dependence of this coefficient {{on the size of the}} GNPs, on their concentration and on the surrounding of GNPs, as well as on the experimental conditions. One can also note that only few works concern nonlinearities of GNPs inside a densified glass matrix. For example, a saturable absorption behavior with a dynamics in the picosecond scale has been reported about GNPs in a borosilicate glass[5] but the magnitude of the corresponding resonant nonlinear coefficient was not estimated. The case of highly doped Au:SiO 2 cermet films can also be mentioned, where giant negative β coefficients could be measured (up to - 2. 2. 107 cm/GW), but in nanosecond regime[6]. Thermal effects are known to artificially increase the nonlinear coefficients when nanosecond pulses are used for their measurement[7]. Our value of β, measured using ps pulses, normally includes only electronic effects. However, it is of the same order of magnitude as the value obtained in lanthanum borate glasses doped with very low concentration (10 ppm) of gold, but measured in nanosecond regime and in non-resonant condition[8]. In a conclusion, we have presented a new way for the synthesis of a GNP-doped dense silica glass via a sol-gel route. Comparison of the SPR absorption bands and TEM measurements showed the presence of GNPs in the bulk silica matrix, with a diameter increasing from 8 - 18 nm in the porous xerogel to 10 - 30 nm in the glass. Despite this moderate particle growth, zirconia seems to be useful to embed GNPs into silica and protect them during the densification high temperature treatment. Resonant nonlinear characterization using the Z-scan technique with ultra-short laser pulses allowed us to demonstrate a reversible NL saturable absorber behavior of the densified doped silica glass. The nonlinear absorption coefficient β of about - 14 cm/GW could not be strictly compared with other results from the literature because of the originality of our measurement and of our material. The saturable absorber may be exploited to induce Q-switching or mode-locking in a pulsed laser cavity. Fabrication of a nonlinear optical fiber with insertion of the obtained GNP-doped rod in a microstructure perform is being implemented.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} and numerical study {{devoted to the}} elastic behavior of a two-phase material is investigated in this work. Samples have been elaborated by incorporating andalusite inclusions with anisotropic mechanical and thermal properties in a <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix.</b> SEM observations show large unexpected fractures located inside inclusions despite the significant thermal expansion mismatch between the two components, normally leading to interfacial decohesions or multicracking of the matrix. These fractures are explained by a strong interfacial reactivity coupled to the weak stress to rupture of individual andalusite aggregates during the processing thermal cycle affected by a preexisting anisotropic damage. Young’s modulus vs. temperature was both measured by ultrasonic technique and calculated by a numerical simulation. The investigated models take into account individual anisotropic thermo-elastic properties of the dispersed phase. Numerical results show a modification of the stress distribution field depending on anisotropic properties of the dispersed phase, their arrangement and interactions. Increasing the number of inclusions and optimizing their shape and spatial distribution cancels the effect of anisotropy. Finally, the numerical values of Young’s modulus are in good tendency with experimental results vs. temperature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Disordered {{systems are}} {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} local conformational heterogeneity, which reﬂects the complex landscape of the potential energy of the vitreous state. Optical properties of defects embedded in a <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix</b> are also determined by the interaction with the surrounding environment; so the conformational disorder of the system induces spectral inhomogeneity. As a consequence, detailed experimental investigation of absorption and photoluminescence bands can give information on conﬁgurational substates around the chromophore. We focused our attention on B-type optical activity in silica glasses, characterized by a singlet emission and a triplet emission, connected via a phonon-assisted intersystem crossing (ISC) process. In particular, the ISC shows a strong dependence on excitation energy and a non-Arrhenius behaviour on varying the temperature. We take into account the observed thermal behaviour over a wide temperature range, assuming a distribution of the activation energies of the ISC process. This approach outlines the correlation between optical properties and conformational heterogeneity and indicates that the ISC process is driven by the entropic contribution, revealing the fundamental role of the dynamics of the surrounding matrix...|$|E

This composite exhibits interesting non-linear optical properties in the infrared region, in the range 10 - 20 000 A. The shape and size distribution of the nanocrystals and the kinetics of their growth were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) during in situ isothermal treatment at 923 K. The experimental results indicate that nanocrystals are nearly spherical and have an average radius increasing from 16 to 33 A after 2 h at 923 K, the relative size dispersion being time-invariant and approximately equal to 8 %. This investigation demonstrates that the kinetics of nanocrystal growth are governed by the classic mechanism of atomic diffusion.

Two archaeological glass productions opacified with calcium and lead antimonates are studied in this paper, in order to rediscover ancient opaque glass technologies: Roman mosaic tesserae (1 st cent. B. C. - 4 th cent. A. D.) and Nevers lampworking glass (18 th cent. A. D.). The fine examination of crystalline phases and of the <b>vitreous</b> <b>matrix</b> is undertaken using various and complementary techniques. Results are compared with a modern reference production, for which the technological process is well known. We demonstrate that Ca-antimonate opacifiers in Roman mosaic tesserae, as well as in Nevers lampworking glass, were obtained by in situ crystallization. Nevertheless, Roman and Nevers glass would have undergone different firing processes. We propose that the addition of previously synthesized crystals or the use of "anime" could be the process used to obtain Pb-antimonate opacified glass, for both productions studied. We demonstrate that CaO, PbO and Sb 2 O 3 concentrations in the bulk compositions and in the matrices, and their evolution with the crystallinity ratio, offer robust criteria for the distinction of the opacification process used.
