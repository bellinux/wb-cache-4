5000|$|Similarly, {{when water}} vapor condenses, heavier water {{molecules}} holding 18O atoms tend to condense and precipitate first. The water <b>vapor</b> gradient <b>heading</b> from the tropics to the poles gradually {{becomes more and}} more depleted of 18O. Snow falling in Canada has much less H218O than rain in Florida; similarly, snow falling in the center of ice sheets has a lighter [...] signature than that at its margins, since heavier 18O precipitates first.|$|R

Octavia’s <b>head</b> was cut off and sent to Poppaea. Her death brought much sorrow to Rome. According to Suetonius, years later Nero would have nightmares about his mother and Octavia.|$|R
40|$|A {{system and}} method for {{determining}} the condition of lubricating oil in an oil-utilizing mechanism, said system comprising: sensor means for sensing the chemical composition of oil <b>vapor</b> in the <b>head</b> space of the oil reservoir, or a holding reservoir; temperature probes for sensing {{the temperature of the}} oil and of the sensor means; microprocessor means connected to the sensor means and temperature probes for creating a vapor signature by means of a pattern recognition algorithm representing the chemical composition of the <b>vapor</b> in the <b>head</b> space; and display means for producing a discernable indication to an operator if the processor means determines that the vapor signature deviates from predetermined baseline parameters. The system is initiated when the oil-utilizing mechanism is shut off, or when a sample of oil is taken from the oil reservoir and placed in the holding reservoir, and senses conditions periodically during cool-down of the oil.

40|$|Biofuel {{is one of}} the {{renewable}} energy sources adapted by the Philippine government in order to lessen the dependency on foreign fuel and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Rain tree pods were seen to be a promising source of bioethanol since it contains significant amount of fermentable sugars. The study was conducted to establish the complete procedure in processing rain tree pods for village level hydrous bioethanol production. Production processes were done for village level hydrous bioethanol production from collection, drying, storage, shredding, dilution, extraction, fermentation, and distillation. The feedstock was sundried, and moisture content was determined at a range of 20 % to 26 % prior to storage. Dilution ratio was 1 : 1. 25 (1 kg of pods = 1. 25 L of water) and after extraction process yielded a sugar concentration of 22 0 Bx to 24 0 Bx. The dilution period was three hours. After three hours of diluting the samples, the juice was extracted using extractor with a capacity of 64. 10 L/hour. 150 L of rain tree pods juice was extracted and subjected to fermentation process using a village level anaerobic bioreactor. Fermentation with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) can fasten up the process, thus producing more ethanol at a shorter period of time; however, without yeast fermentation, it also produces ethanol at lower volume with slower fermentation process. Distillation of 150 L of fermented broth was done for six hours at 85 °C to 95 °C temperature (feedstock) and 74 °C to 95 °C temperature of the column <b>head</b> (<b>vapor</b> state of ethanol). The highest volume of ethanol recovered was established at with yeast fermentation at five-day duration with a value of 14. 89 L and lowest actual ethanol content was found at without yeast fermentation at three-day duration having a value of 11. 63 L. In general, the results suggested that rain tree pods had a very good potential as feedstock for bioethanol production. Fermentation of rain tree pods juice can be done with yeast and without yeast...|$|R
