5|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for VFR traffic that wishes to transit Class B airspace. This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> frequency if they are unable to immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided with traffic advisories if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E
500|$|Radar {{measurements}} show that, {{immediately before}} the crash, Lidle's aircraft was flying at 112mph (180km/h) at [...] altitude in the East River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor,</b> an area which former NTSB official Peter Goelz described as [...] "very tricky" [...] {{due to its}} narrow width and frequent congestion. The <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> ends abruptly at {{the northern tip of}} Roosevelt Island. Aircraft must receive an air traffic control clearance to proceed beyond the boundaries of the corridor, or else make a sharp U-turn and return the way they came. Lidle's plane flew north along the corridor almost to the end before executing a turn and hitting the north face of the building along the river.|$|E
500|$|The NTSB {{issued a}} [...] "Safety Recommendation" [...] to the FAA on August 27, 2009. Because of the {{accident}} airplane's intended flight path, the NTSB believes that the pilot may have wanted {{to climb out of}} the uncontrolled <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> into the controlled Class B airspace above. However, for reasons unknown as yet, he was not in communication with any air traffic controllers after he switched frequencies from Teterboro tower. He also apparently was not communicating on the Corridor's self-announce frequency.|$|E
500|$|Reaction from {{government}} officials, aviation industry groups, and individuals has been widespread. The FAA convened a [...] "New York Airspace Working Group" [...] on August 14, 2009. The group will solicit comments from helicopter and aircraft operators, and {{will review the}} operating procedures of the Hudson and East River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridors.</b> They will report to FAA administrator Babbitt on August 28. A NOTAM issued on August 11, 2009 advises pilots flying {{in the area to}} turn on their lights, use the designated self-announce radio frequencies, and fly at a speed of 140 knots or less.|$|R
50|$|Non-towered {{airports}} may lie {{inside or}} underneath controlled airspace. In that case, {{some or all}} aircraft arriving and departing require clearances from a remote air traffic control unit, such as terminal or center control, {{even though there is}} no control tower managing landings and takeoffs. Pilots may be able to obtain those clearances by radio, by phone, or through a company dispatcher or local Flight Service Station; in some cases, departing aircraft (IFR or VFR) take off and level out below the floor of controlled airspace, then radio for a clearance before climbing further. Some countries establish low-altitude <b>VFR</b> <b>corridors</b> for non-towered airports in large urban areas so that VFR arrivals and departures can avoid controlled airspace altogether.|$|R
50|$|All {{aircraft}} entering class B airspace must obtain ATC clearance {{prior to}} entry {{and must be}} prepared for denial of clearance. Aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio for communications with ATC and an operating Mode C transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying the upper limit of any class B airspace must have an operating Mode C transponder. Visual flight rules (VFR) flights may proceed under their own navigation after obtaining clearance but must obey any explicit instructions given by ATC. Some class B airspaces include special transition routes for VFR flight that require communication with ATC but may not require an explicit clearance. Other class B airspaces include <b>VFR</b> <b>corridors</b> through which <b>VFR</b> flights may pass without clearance (and without technically entering the class B airspace).|$|R
500|$|Because of {{the heavy}} {{commercial}} air traffic into Newark, LaGuardia, and Kennedy airports, an {{air traffic control clearance}} is required to operate in much of the airspace around the city. Since ATC is often unwilling to grant this discretionary VFR clearance because of traffic volume, many airplanes that need to transit the New York metro area use the <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> as an alternative to going east of the city (over water) or west (toward Pennsylvania). The corridor is also heavily used by helicopter tour companies, which take passengers on sight-seeing tours of the New York skyline.|$|E
500|$|In a {{press conference}} on August 8, 2009, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (an {{airplane}} and helicopter pilot himself) stated that [...] "Until the National Transportation Safety Board makes a determination, nothing is a fact" [...] and stressed that the investigation will take weeks or months before those facts are known. Representatives from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), including AOPA President Craig Fuller, have appeared on numerous news programs and collaborated with news sources to explain {{the workings of the}} Hudson River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> and the safety record of flights in that area.|$|E
500|$|On September 2, 2009 the FAA {{announced}} {{a plan to}} improve safety of flights in the corridor. The proposed changes include standardizing {{the height of the}} <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> to [...] In addition, many existing procedures that have been treated as [...] "Suggested" [...] items for flying the corridor will now be mandatory, including operating landing lights; maintaining a speed of [...] or less while flying in the corridor; monitoring and announcing on the area Common Traffic Advisory Frequency; and travelling along the west shore when southbound and along the east shore when northbound. Pilots will be required to have appropriate charts available, and to familiarize themselves with the applicable rules before flying in the corridor. Additionally, pilot training courses for both transient pilots and charter helicopter pilots will be developed. An implementation timeline was not initially announced.|$|E

50|$|The {{clock is}} a {{mandatory}} reporting point for flights below Class B airspace in the Hudson River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Regulations are {{in effect}} in the {{airspace}} where flight is permitted under visual flight rules (VFR), the East River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> and the Hudson River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor.</b> The southern end of both begins at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The corridor along the Hudson River allows VFR flight along the entire length between Manhattan and the New Jersey Hudson Waterfront north to the Alpine Tower, while that along the East River ends southwest of LGA airspace at {{the northern end of}} Roosevelt Island.|$|E
5000|$|Radar {{measurements}} show that, {{immediately before}} the crash, Lidle's aircraft was flying at 112 mph (180 km/h) at 700 ft altitude in the East River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor,</b> an area which former NTSB official Peter Goelz described as [...] "very tricky" [...] {{due to its}} narrow width and frequent congestion.

50|$|On November 19, 2009, the FAA {{effected}} an SFRA in the New York City Class B airspace, motivated {{largely by}} the mid-air collision of a private general aviation aircraft and a sightseeing helicopter ride along the Hudson River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> {{in the summer of}} 2009.|$|E
50|$|After a 2006 plane crash, the FAA {{imposed a}} Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) {{requiring}} all pilots of fixed-wing aircraft to obtain permission from LaGuardia's {{air traffic control}} tower for flight in the East River <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> between {{the southern tip of}} Governors Island and the northern tip of Roosevelt Island. The pilot must remain in contact with air traffic control while in the exclusion. An exception is granted for seaplanes landing or departing from the New York Skyports seaplane base located in the East River. Technically, this area remains a <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor</b> and outside of Class B airspace. However, the TFR imposes many of the requirements of entering Class B airspace. Significantly, cloud clearance and visibility requirements are not changed.|$|E
50|$|Published VFR routes are for {{transitioning}} around, under, {{or through}} some complex airspace. Terms such as VFR flyway, <b>VFR</b> <b>corridor,</b> Class B airspace VFR transition route, and terminal area VFR route {{have been applied}} to such routes. These routes are generally found on VFR terminal area planning charts.|$|E
