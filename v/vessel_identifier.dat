40|$|The Queensland {{east coast}} trawl fishery {{is by far}} the largest prawn and scallop otter trawl fleet in Australia in terms of number of vessels, with 504 vessels {{licensed}} to fish for species including tiger prawns, endeavour prawns, red spot king prawns, eastern king prawns and saucer scallops by the end of 2004. The vessel fleet has gradually upgraded characteristics such as engine power and use of propeller nozzles, quad nets, global positioning systems (GPS) and computer mapping software. These changes, together with the ever-changing profile of the fleet, were analysed by linear mixed models to quantify annual efficiency increases of an average vessel at catching prawns or scallops. The analyses included vessel characteristics (treated as fixed effects) and <b>vessel</b> <b>identifier</b> codes (treated as random effects). For the period from 1989 to 2004 the models estimated overall fishing power increases of 6 % in the northern tiger, 6 % in the northern endeavour, 12 % in the southern tiger, 18 % in the red spot king, 46 % in the eastern king prawn and 15 % in the saucer scallop sector. The results illustrate the importance of ongoing monitoring of vessel and fleet characteristics and the need to use this information to standardise catch rate indices used in stock assessment and management...|$|E
40|$|Vessel {{monitoring}} systems (VMS) automatically collect positional data from fishing vessels. The VMS {{data can be}} linked to catch data from logbooks to provide a census of spatially resolved catch-and-effort data. We explore and validate the most appropriate and practical method for integrating Irish VMS and logbook data. A simple speed rule is applied to identify VMS records that correspond to fishing activity. These data are then integrated with the catch data from logbooks using date and <b>vessel</b> <b>identifier.</b> A number of assumptions were investigated, and the resulting distribution maps of catch and effort appear to be unbiased. The method is illustrated with an example of a time-series of spatially explicit catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) estimates. The proposed method is relatively simple and does not require specialist software or computationally intensive methods. It will be possible to generalize this approach to similar datasets that are available within the EU and many other regions. Analysis of integrated VMS and logbook data will allow fisheries data to be analysed on a considerably finer spatial scale than was possible in the past, which opens up a range of potential applications.

5000|$|A ship {{identifier}} {{refers to}} one of several types of identifiers used for maritime <b>vessels.</b> An <b>identifier</b> may be a proper noun (La Niña); a proper noun combined with a standardized prefix based {{on the type of}} ship (eg. [...] ); a serial code; a unique, alphanumeric ID (eg. A123B456C7); or an alphanumeric ID displayed with flags (eg. , representing U6CH). Some identifiers are permanent for a ship while others may be changed at the owners' discretion although regulatory agencies will need to approve the change. Modern ships will usually have several identifiers.|$|R
50|$|A recent IMO {{regulation}} requires AIS transponders aboard <b>vessels,</b> which transmit <b>identifier,</b> {{name and}} position of vessels not limited to fishing.Another approach might involve either AIS, or the more finely grained VTS, agreements that use coastal radar to monitor ships in and beyond coastal waters. This allows a transport vessel, for example, to be tracked in the small sea.|$|R
