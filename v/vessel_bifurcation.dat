40|$|CYR 61 (CCN 1) is {{a member}} of the CCN family of {{secreted}} matricellular proteins that includes connective tissue growth factor (CCN 2), NOV (CCN 3), WISP- 1 (CCN 4), WISP- 2 (CCN 5), and WISP- 3 (CCN 6). First identified as the product of a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene, CYR 61 is an extracellular matrix-associated angiogenic inducer that functions as a ligand of integrin receptors to promote cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Aberrant expression of Cyr 61 is associated with breast cancer, wound healing, and vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. To understand the functions of CYR 61 during development, we have disrupted the Cyr 61 gene in mice. We show here that Cyr 61 -null mice suffer embryonic death: ∼ 30 % succumbed to a failure in chorioallantoic fusion, and the reminder perished due to placental vascular insufficiency and compromised vessel integrity. These findings establish CYR 61 as a novel and essential regulator of vascular development. CYR 61 deficiency results in a specific defect in <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcation</b> (nonsprouting angiogenesis) at the chorioallantoic junction, leading to an undervascularization of the placenta without affecting differentiation of the labyrinthine syncytiotrophoblasts. This unique phenotype is correlated with impaired Vegf-C expression in the allantoic mesoderm, suggesting that CYR 61 -regulated expression of Vegf-C plays a role in <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcation.</b> The genetic and molecular basis of <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcation</b> is presently unknown, and these findings provide new insight into this aspect of angiogenesis...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the blood flow {{behaviour}} in the microvessel bifurcation using variety of blood parameters. There are two situations for the analysis which normal mircovessel and abnormal microvessel bifurcations. The objectives of this thesis are to investigate the effect of bifurcation on blood flow distributions and predict flow abnormalities due to blood properties. The thesis describes the finite volume technique to predict the abnormalities and identify {{the effect of the}} bifurcation. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of normal and abnormal blood vessel were developed using the computer-aided drawing software. The strategy of validation of finite volume model was developed. The finite volume analysis was then performed using COSMOS Flow in Solidwork software. From the result,it is observed that bifurcation give an effect to the blood flow behavior. For normal and abnormal case, using the different pressure for same diameter of blood <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcation,</b> the pressure result shown an increment when blood flow into the bifurcation.

As {{is the case with}} many diseases, early detection can help reduce further progression or enable physicians to take counter measures early on. Hence, accurate analysis techniques are needed for processing these angiogram data sets.

Therefore, this article describes an improved segmentation algorithm based on a hybrid approach between isovalue and image-gradient segmentation and a center line extraction method utilizing 3 D vector field topology analysis.

Computed {{tomography}} (CT), which can provide detailed images of lung structure, makes it possible to detect lung cancer in its early stage. Regular clinical practice involves visual inspection of hundreds cross-sectional slices of a patient's CT scan for small pulmonary nodules that can manifest early lung cancer.

40|$|An {{automatic}} algorithm {{capable of}} segmenting the whole vessel tree and calculate vessel diameter and orientation {{in a digital}} ophthalmologic image is presented in this work. The algorithm {{is based on a}} parametric model of a vessel that can assume arbitrarily complex shape and a simple measure of match that quantifies how well the vessel model matches a given angiographic image. An automatic vessel tracing algorithm is described that exploits the geometric model and actively seeks <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcation,</b> without user intervention. The proposed algorithm uses the geometric vessel model to determine the vessel diameter at each detected central axis pixel. For this reason, the algorithm is fine tuned using a subset of ophthalmologic images of the publically available DRIVE database, by maximizing vessel segmentation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is then applied to the remaining ophthalmological images of the DRIVE database. The segmentation results of the proposed algorithm compare favorably in terms of accuracy with six other well established vessel detection techniques, outperforming three of them in the majority of the available ophthalmologic images. The proposed algorithm achieves subpixel root mean square central axis positioning error that outperforms the non-expert based vessel segmentation, whereas the accuracy of vessel diameter estimation is comparable to that of the non-expert based vessel segmentation.

40|$|Microvascular {{blood flow}} {{resistance}} {{has a strong}} impact on cardiovascular function and tissue perfusion. The flow resistance in microcirculation is governed by flow behavior of blood through a complex network of vessels, where the distribution of red blood cells across vessel cross-sections may be significantly distorted at <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcations</b> and junctions. In this paper, the development of blood flow and its resistance starting from a dispersed configuration of red blood cells is investigated in simulations for different hematocrit levels, flow rates, vessel diameters, and aggregation interactions between red blood cells. Initially dispersed red blood cells migrate toward the vessel center leading {{to the formation of}} a cell-free layer near the wall and to a decrease of the flow resistance. The development of cell-free layer appears to be nearly universal when scaled with a characteristic shear rate of the flow. The universality allows an estimation of the length of a vessel required for full flow development, lc ≲ 25 D, for vessel diameters in the range 10 μm < D < 100 μm. Thus, the potential effect of red blood cell dispersion at <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcations</b> and junctions on the flow resistance may be significant in vessels which are shorter or comparable to the length lc. Aggregation interactions between red blood cells generally lead to a reduction of blood flow resistance. The simulations are performed using the same viscosity for both external and internal fluids and the RBC membrane viscosity is not considered; however, we discuss how the viscosity contrast may affect the results. Finally, we develop a simple theoretical model which is able to describe the converged cell-free-layer thickness at steady-state flow with respect to flow rate. The model is based on the balance between a lift force on red blood cells due to cell-wall hydrodynamic interactions and shear-induced effective pressure due to cell–cell interactions in flow. We expect that these results {{can also be used to}} better understand the flow behavior of other suspensions of deformable particles such as vesicles, capsules, and cells...|$|R

To achieve this we investigated the time-course of the angiogenic response induced by gelatin sponges soaked in the cell suspensions and implanted on the CAM surface from day 8 to day 12 of incubation by evaluating the number of vessels, of the <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcation</b> and the intervascular distance at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after the implants. The results show that plasma cell suspensions obtained from patients with active MM induce a vasoproliferative response that was significantly higher than that induced by cell suspensions obtained from patients with non-active MM or with MGUS, which is also a function of the day of implantation. In fact, implants made from day 8 to day 10 induce a strong angiogenic response, whereas those made from day 11 to day 12 do not. This finding might depend on the fact that CAM endothelium exhibits an intrinsically high mitotic rate until day 10. Thereafter, the endothelial mitotic index declines rapidly, and consequently cell suspensions implanted on the CAM of successively older embryos are not able to induce a vasoproliferative response in parallel with the reduced rates of growth of the CAM's endothelial cells...|$|E

Therefore, highly accurate software for a 3 D model of vessel is required for an accurate diagnosis of patients. We have generated standard vessel because {{the shape of the}} arterial is different for each individual vessel, where the standard vessel can be adjusted to suit individual vessel. In this paper, we propose a new approach for an automatic 3 D model generation based on a matching of adaptive control points. The proposed method is carried out in three steps.

Second is matching the corresponding control points between the standard and individual vessels, where a set of control and corner points are automatically extracted using the Harris corner detector.

And then, the control points of corresponding individual vessel match with those control points of standard vessel. Finally, we apply warping on the standard vessel to suit the individual vessel using the TPS (Thin Plate Spline) interpolation function.

40|$|Purpose: We {{propose a}} new, fully {{automatic}} procedure for {{the extraction of}} the vascular structure and related features in retinal images. Methods: The procedure {{is based on a}} sparse tracking technique. Starting from a set of seed points, spread all over the image, the tracking procedure moves along the vessel by analyzing subsequent vessel cross sections (small green segments in figure). In each cross section, points belonging to the vessel are found by means of a fuzzy C–means classifier, and, from these points, the algorithm extracts the vessel center, caliber and direction. When tracking stops because of a critical area (e. g. a <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcation</b> or crossing, or an area with low contrast,), an innovative "bubble technique" module is run. It is able to draw and analyze multiple circular scan lines around the critical point (see figure), allowing the exploration of the region around it and thus to resume vessel tracking beyond the critical area. After the tracking step is completed, a search is run to recognize and eliminate possible false vessels, e. g. choroidal vessel segments identified as retinal vessels. Finally, to reconstruct the course of whole vessels, the sparse vessel segments are linked by a connection algorithm, taking into account similarity of caliber, direction and color of the pair of facing segments under examination. Bifurcations and crossings are then identified by analyzing specific features of vessel segments.

In particular, we infer from the model an optimization of both the designs and the reference trajectory to minimize the control efforts. Efficiency and robustness to noise and model parameters uncertainties are then illustrated through simulations results for a bead pulled robot of radius 250 μm in a small artery...|$|R
40|$|Non-rigid {{registration}} accuracy assessment is typically performed by evaluating the target registration error at manually placed landmarks. For 4 D-CT lung data, we compare {{two sets of}} landmark distributions: a smaller set primarily defined on <b>vessel</b> <b>bifurcations</b> as commonly described in the literature and a larger set being well-distributed throughout the lung volume. For six different registration schemes (three in-house schemes and three schemes frequently used by the community) the landmark error is evaluated and found to depend significantly {{on the distribution of}} the landmarks. In particular, lung regions near to the pleura show a target registration error three times larger than near-mediastinal regions. While the inter-method variability on the landmark positions is rather small, the methods show discriminating differences with respect to consistency and local volume change. In conclusion, both a well-distributed set of landmarks and a deformation vector field analysis are necessary for reliable non-rigid {{registration accuracy}} assessment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
