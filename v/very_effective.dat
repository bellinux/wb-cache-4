5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, {{with the amount of}} gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> in attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (<b>very</b> <b>effective</b> against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E

Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor a graph G=(V,E) {{and a set}} of {{vertices}} S⊆V, a vertex v∈S is said to be <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> if it is {{adjacent to}} more vertices in V∖S than in S. A bipartition π={S,V∖S} is called <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> if both S and V∖S are <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> sets. Not all graphs have a <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> bipartition, for example, the complete graphs of odd order do not. We characterize the cactus graphs having a <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> bipartition. Also, we show that if a graph G or H has a <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> bipartition, then so does the Cartesian product G□H...|$|R
40|$|Let Z_n be {{the finite}} {{commutative}} ring of residue classes modulo n and Gamma(Z_n) be its zero-divisor graph. The nilradical graph and non-nilradical graph of Z_n are denoted by N(Z_n) and Omega(Z_n) respectively. In 2012, Haynes et al. [5] introduced {{the concept of}} <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> graph. For a graph G = (V,E) {{and a set of}} vertices S subset of V, a vertex v in S is said to be <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> if it is adjacent to more vertices in V than in S. A bipartition Pi = S, V is called <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> if both S and V are <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> sets [5, 6]. In this paper, we investigate the <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> bipartition of Gamma(Z_n), where n = p_ 1 p_ 2 [...] . p_m, here all p_i's are distinct primes. In addition, we discuss the cases in which N(Z_n) and Omega(Z_n) graphs have <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> bipartition for different n. Finally, we derive some results for <b>very</b> cost <b>effective</b> bipartition of the Line graph and Total graph of Gamma(Z_n), denoted by L(Gamma(Z_n)) and T(Gamma(Z_n)) respectively.

5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also <b>very</b> <b>effective.</b> He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges.

By age 45, he had retired. In his last forty years, Very did very little. As biographer Edwin Gittleman wrote, [...] "Although he lived until 1880, <b>Very's</b> <b>effective</b> life was over by the end of 1840."

Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses due to the <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> sea blockade and the American firebombing campaign.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.

5|$|Fatigue {{from the}} South African tour {{affected}} Hobbs in 1910. He scored 1,982 runs {{at an average}} of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season. More effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter, Hobbs was consistently successful in a hot, dry summer which produced good batting pitches. He played few large innings, but was <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> in high-pressure games, and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets. Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.|$|E
