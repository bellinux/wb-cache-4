5|$|The {{legislative}} walkouts delayed {{progress on}} the budget passage for nearly two months, but the House of Representatives was able to begin working on it in committee in April. The body made several alterations to the bill, including a reapportionment of education funding based more heavily {{on the number of}} students at a school, and removing some public school funding to finance the new <b>voucher</b> system and charter schools.|$|E

5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves, or oversaw the slaughtering. Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice <b>voucher</b> in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an animal to be slaughtered {{in the name of}} God (Allah) on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically present. Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world. At {{the same time as the}} sacrifices occur at Mecca, Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices, in a three-day global festival called Eid al-Adha.|$|E

5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid <b>voucher</b> services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E

50|$|EdChoice, {{founded by}} Milton and Rose Friedman in 1996, is a {{non-profit}} organization that promotes universal school <b>vouchers</b> {{and other forms of}} school choice.

5|$|While Daniels {{supported}} the legislation, {{he believed the}} Republican lawmakers should drop the bill {{because it was not}} part of their election platform and deserved a period of public debate. Republicans subsequently dropped the bill, but the Democratic lawmakers still refused to return to the capital, demanding additional bills be tabled, including a bill to create a statewide school <b>voucher</b> program. Their refusal to return left the Indiana General Assembly unable to pass any legislation, until three of the twelve bills they objected to were dropped from the agenda on March 28. The minority subsequently returned to the statehouse to resume their duties.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash <b>voucher</b> was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school <b>voucher</b> program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{review the}} {{existing}} literature {{on the impact of}} school <b>vouchers</b> on student achievement. They conclude that expectations about the ability of <b>vouchers</b> to drastically improve student achievement, at least as measured by test scores, should be tempered by the results of the studies to date. Also, there is very little evidence about the potential for public schools to respond to increased competitive pressure generated by <b>vouchers.</b> Educational <b>vouchers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gift <b>vouchers</b> are an {{increasingly}} popular choice of gift and constitute {{a significant portion}} of the North American retail sales economy. However, many gift <b>vouchers</b> are lost or forgotten and expire unused – resulting in enormous profits to the retailers and corresponding losses to consumers. Many Canadian provinces and US States have enacted legislation prohibiting retailers from imposing expiry dates on gift <b>vouchers.</b> This article argues that it is unjust for retailers to accept consideration for gift <b>vouchers</b> and then refuse to deliver promised goods or services when the <b>vouchers</b> expire. It recommends amendments to Australian consumer protection laws along the lines of Canadian and US reforms to protect consumers from losing the benefit of unused and expired gift <b>vouchers...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the days}} {{before the start of the}} special session, it became clear that a major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition <b>voucher</b> proposal would undermine public education.|$|E

5|$|Daniels {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run in Indiana's 2004 gubernatorial election after leaving the Bush administration. He won the Republican primary with 67% of the vote, and defeated Democratic incumbent Governor Joe Kernan in the general election. Daniels was reelected to a second term, defeating former U.S. Representative and US Department of Agriculture undersecretary Jill Long Thompson, on November 4, 2008. During his tenure as governor, Daniels cut the state government workforce by 18%, cut and capped state property taxes, and balanced the state budget through budget austerity measures and increasing spending by less than the inflation rate. In his second term, Daniels saw protest by labor unions and Democrats {{in the state legislature}} over his policies regarding Indiana's school <b>voucher</b> program and the Indiana House of Representatives attempt to pass right to work legislation, leading to the 2011 Indiana legislative walkouts. During the legislature's last session under Daniels, he signed the right-to-work law; with Indiana becoming the 23rd state in the nation to do so.|$|E

On February 18, 2013 the first footage of the PlayStation Vita version of Final Fantasy X HD was released, showing off HD models of Tidus, Yuna, Bahamut and Yojimbo. On March 19, it was confirmed that the PS3 version of the game would also include its sequel X-2, {{and that it would be}} remastered in HD. The two HD remastered games for the PS3 were released under the title Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster on a single Blu-ray disc game, and was sold separately on game cartridges on Vita in Japan and sold together in North America, Europe & Australia as a set, with FFX being on a cartridge and FFX-2 being included as a download <b>voucher.</b> Downloadable versions are available for both systems. Square Enix launched an official website for the two HD remastered titles in March 2013. The games contain all the content found in the International version, including Eternal Calm and Last Mission. During the PlayStation China press conference that took place in Shanghai on December 11, 2014, Square Enix confirmed Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster would be released for the PlayStation 4 in Spring 2015. It was released in North America on May 12, Australia & Japan on May 14 and Europe on May 15, 2015. It included enhanced graphics in full HD (1080p), the option to switch to the original soundtrack and the ability to transfer save files from the PS3 & PS Vita versions.

40|$|AIMS: To {{conduct an}} {{economic}} {{evaluation of the}} first 6 months' trial of treatment <b>vouchers</b> and case management for opioid-dependent hospital patients. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial and evaluation of administrative data. SETTING: Emergency department, wound clinic, in-patient units and methadone clinic in a large urban public hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study randomized 126 opioid-dependent drug users seeking medical care. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized among four groups. These received <b>vouchers</b> for 6 months of methadone treatment, 6 months of case management, both these interventions, or usual care. FINDINGS: During the first 6 months of this study, 90 % of those randomized to <b>vouchers</b> alone enrolled in methadone maintenance, significantly more than the 44 % enrollment in those randomized to case management without <b>vouchers</b> (P < 0. 001). The direct costs of substance abuse treatment, including case management, was 4040 dollars for those who received <b>vouchers,</b> 4177 dollars for those assigned to case management and 5277 dollars for those who received the combination of both interventions. After 3 months, the <b>vouchers</b> alone group used less heroin than the case management alone group. The difference was not significant at 6 months. There {{were no significant differences}} in other health care costs in the 6 months following randomization. CONCLUSION: <b>Vouchers</b> were slightly more effective but no more costly than case management during the initial 6 months of the study. <b>Vouchers</b> were as effective and less costly than the combination of case management and <b>vouchers.</b> The finding that <b>vouchers</b> dominate is tempered by the possibility that case management may lower medical care costs...|$|R
