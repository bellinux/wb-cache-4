The stacking sequence for all panels was [00 / 902 / 0] 4 s. Fourteen cure cycles were designed to study {{a wide range of}} cure pressures, cure temperatures, and two different vacuum-application durations, including <b>vacuum</b> <b>vent</b> at recommended pressure and vacuum hold throughout the cure cycle. It was found that for panels cured at different temperatures and for panels cured at different pressures with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>vent</b> at recommended pressure, SBS strength did not vary significantly over a relatively wide range of cure temperatures and pressures. However, after a certain point, a decreasing trend in the average SBS strength for both H/W and RT/D was observed by reducing the cure temperature as well as the cure pressure. Panels with the same cure pressure and dissimilar vacuum-application durations showed different SBS strength, with higher properties associated with panels in which the vacuum was vented at the recommended pressure. For panels cured at various cure pressures and the vacuum hold throughout the cure cycles, C-scan results showed a cross-shaped high-porosity {{in the middle of the}} panels, which became larger as the cure pressure decreased. This defect is believed to cause higher variability of the SBS strength as the cure pressure is reduced. SBS strength was found to decrease with increasing void content in the test specimens. Theoretical models were compared to the experimental data of SBS strength vs. void content. Investigation of the failure mode for each panel revealed a change in both H/W and RT/D failure mechanism by lowering the cure temperature and cure pressure.

In this work, the effect of air evacuation on the mold/polymer temperature was experimentally investigated. A novel experimental setup is demonstrated to monitor the mold and polymer temperature during the micro injection molding process using a high speed infrared camera system, Ircam Equus 81 k SM, and sapphire window in the mold. A design of experiments (DoE) approach was applied to design and analyze of the experimental campaign.

Design/methodology/approach: Viscosity of mixtures based on epoxy resin that contain ferrite powders and pure epoxy resin using Hoeppler viscometer was measured. Procedures of viscosity measurements were performed for three temperatures and for three filler contents. Findings: Higher temperature of measurement resulted in lower values of viscosity while higher quantity of ferrite powder increased viscosity of mixtures.

40|$|Air {{entrapment}} during diecasting {{die filling}} {{is a major}} problem that causes most rejects, after quality inspection, due to unattended and dangerous gas porosity, especially in high performance and structural parts. In the past years, many technologies were developed in order to reduce air entrapment during filling; among them, optimal results were mainly obtained by active (vacuum) and passive (chill vents) air evacuation systems. Nevertheless, only small knowledge on how to optimize dies design for those technologies is available for the die maker. In the same way, at now, many casting simulation software lacks in this specific field and today ventings, vacuum channels and chill vents are designed according to proprietary formulas and, mainly, experience. In order to understand what happens to air inside a die cavity before and during metal injection, an analytical model was developed to calculate and forecast air pressure and flow through vents. This model takes into account, in a very detailed way, all the phenomena that occurs during injection, with particular relevance to process parameters (injection speeds and strokes, temperatures, vacuum pressures…) as well as flow-related phenomena that can impact on air escape, like premature vents clogging. This mathematical model was then validated and optimized through extensive casting trials in different <b>venting</b> simulation (with <b>vacuum,</b> only <b>vents,</b> chill vents, no air escape…) on different casting shapes and with different process parameters. The model allows to the die designer to optimize vents and related operating process parameters, simulate and compare different air evacuation solutions and forecast the mean gas porosity fraction in the casting with a calculation time of only few seconds. Calculations were useful to demonstrate the influence of process parameters on air trapping and the main result was that venting (with or without vacuum) is ineffective without an optimal setup of casting parameters and a correct air escape area calculation...|$|R

Conventional dewars are launched cold: the vacuum walls necessary for thermal isolation must also withstand the pressure gradient at sea level and are correspondingly thick and heavy. The pressure at 40 km is less than 0. 3 % of sea level: a dewar designed for use only at 40 km can use ultra thin walls to achieve significant reductions in mass. This innovation concerns new construction and operational techniques to produce a lightweight liquid helium bucket dewar. The dewar is intended for use on high-altitude balloon payloads. The mass is low enough to allow a large (3 -to- 5 -meter) diameter dewar to fly at altitudes above 35 km on conventional scientific research balloons without exceeding the lift capability of the balloon. The lightweight dewar has thin (250 - micron) stainless steel walls. The walls are too thin to support the pressure gradient at sea level: the dewar launches warm with the <b>vacuum</b> space <b>vented</b> continuously during ascent to eliminate any pressure gradient across the walls. A commercial 500 -liter storage dewar maintains a reservoir of liquid helium within a minimal (hence low mass) volume. Once a 40 -km altitude is reached, the valve <b>venting</b> the <b>vacuum</b> space of the bucket dewar is closed to seal the vacuum space. A vacuum pump then evacuates the dewar vacuum space to provide the necessary thermal isolation. Liquid helium may then be transferred from the storage dewar into the bucket dewar to cool the telescope inside the bucket dewar. By splitting the functions of helium storage and in-flight thermal isolation, the parasitic mass associated with the dewar pressure vessel is eliminated to achieve factor-of-five or better reduction in mass. The lower mass allows flight on conventional scientific research balloons, even for telescopes 3 to 5 meters in diameter...|$|R
40|$|Already in {{the early}} phase of a design for ITER, the {{maintenance}} aspects {{should be taken into}} account, since they might have serious implications. This paper presents the arguments in support of the case for the maintainability of the design, notably if this maintenance is to be performed by advanced remote methods. This structure is compliant to the evolving maintenance strategy of ITER. Initial results of a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and a development risk analysis for the ITER upper port plug # 3, housing the Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic, are employed for the definition of the maintenance strategy. The CXRS upper port plug is essentially an optical system which transfers visible light from the plasma into a fiber bundle. The most critical component in this path is the first mirror (M 1) whose reflectivity degrades during operation due to deposition and/or erosion dominated effects. Amongst other measures to mitigate these effects, the strategy is to allow for a replacement of this mirror. Therefore it is mounted on a retractable central tube. The main purpose of this tube is to make frequent replacements possible without hindering operation. The maintenance method in terms of time, geometry and spare part policy has a large impact on cost of the system and time usage in the hot cell. Replacement of the tube under vacuum and magnetic field seems infeasible due to the operational risk involved. The preferred solution is to have a spare tube available which is replaced in parallel with other maintenance operations on the vessel, as to avoid any interference in the hot cell with the shutdown scheduling. This avoids having to refurbish a full port plug and also allows for a more frequent replacement of M 1, as we can replace the mirror anytime the <b>vacuum</b> vessel is <b>vented,</b> estimated to be once a year.

40|$|The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory {{is being}} {{constructed}} {{as the latest}} in a series of high-power laser facilities to study inertial confinement fusion. In particular, the NIF will generate and amplify 192 laser beams and focus them onto a fusion fuel capsule the size of a BB. The energy deposited by the laser beams will raise the core temperature of the target to 100,OOO,OOO C, which will ignite the fusion fuel and produce a fusion energy output that is several times greater than the energy input. The ability to generate, condition, and focus 192 laser beams onto a target the size of a BB, requires precision optical hardware and instrumentation. One of the most critical pieces of optical hardware within the NIF is the Optics Module (OM), a mechanical apparatus which is responsible for optical focusing and frequency conversion of the laser beam to optimize the energy deposition at the fusion target. The OM contains two potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), frequency conversion crystals and a focusing lens. The functionality of the KDP crystals is extremely temperature sensitive. Small temperature changes on the order of 0. 1 C can significantly alter the performance of these components. Consequently, to maximize NIF system availability and minimize beam conditioning problems, accurate temperature control of the OM optical components was deemed a necessity. In this study, an experimental OM prototype, containing mock frequency conversion crystals and a focusing lens, was used determine the thermal stability provided by a prototype water temperature control system. More importantly, the OM prototype was used to identify and characterize potential thermal upsets and corresponding recovery times of the KDP crystals. The results of this study indicate that the water temperature control system is adequate in maintaining uniform steady-state temperatures within the OM. <b>Vacuum</b> pump-down and <b>venting</b> of the OM generated significant temperature changes in the optical components. However, the corresponding recovery times of the optical components were found to be less than three hours, well within the seven hour limit posed by NW operations. Simulated laser shots also were found to create thermal upsets within the OM's optical components over a range of heat deposition rates. However, the recovery times of these thermal upsets were found to be less than one hour. Finally, the use of non-contact infrared thermocouples was demonstrated as an effective means to track the temperature of the OM's optics...|$|R
