40|$|Complete feed is {{the process}} of {{converting}} ingredient raw materials into balanced diets to meet the nutrient requirements of the animal. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate animal feed produced in Khartoum State according to their feed tags and nutrient requirements for farm animals. Twenty seven random samples of feed for poultry, dairy and beef cows were obtained from seven factories (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) in Khartoum state. The chemical composition and estimated metabolizable energy (ME) varied significantly (p< 0. 05) among the different factories. The mean crude protein (CP) content ranged between 22. 56 to 30. 62 % was much higher than the recommended level for beef cows (13 %). The estimated ME values ranged between 9. 00 to 10. 98 MJ/Kg and this range is slightly lower than ME requirement (10 - 12 MJ/Kg). Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content ranged between 21. 88 to 54. 08 % and this range is within the optimal level for mature beef cows 3 - 57 %. CP recommended for dairy (14 - 18 %), factory F feed showed higher CP content (37. 96 %) and the lower <b>value</b> in <b>factory</b> D feed 19. 94 %. ME values ranging from 9. 95 MJ/Kg to 11. 17 MJ/Kg, this values within the recommended level of ME (10 - 11 MJ/Kg). The NDF values ranged from 42. 49 % to 72. 09 %, and this is higher than NDF requirement (25 - 33 %). the crude fiber (CF) values ranged from 6. 41 % to 9. 28 %. This value is higher than the CF requirement of (5 % maximum) for broiler starter. Factory G feed contained higher CP (33. 76 %) and the lower <b>value</b> in <b>factory</b> E feed (22. 39 %) for CP requirement (23 %) for broiler starter. The ME ranged between 2631 Kcal/Kg and 3078 Kcal/Kg. These values are slightly lower than ME requirement of (3200 Kcal/Kg) for broiler starter. The CF values ranged from 5. 92 % to 8. 08 %. This range is slightly higher than the CF requirement of (5 % maximum) for broiler finisher. Factory C feed contained higher CP (33. 59 %) and the lower <b>value</b> for <b>factory</b> D feed (24. 32 %) for CP requirement (18 %) for broiler finisher. ME ranged between 2741 Kcal/Kg to 3148 Kcal/Kg, all factories are slightly lower than the ME requirement of (3200 Kcal/Kg) for broiler finisher. Factory C feed reported higher CP content (30. 09 %) and the lower value of 20. 47 % was reported in factory G feed. This is higher than CP requirement of 18 % for layer chicks. The CF content ranged between 7. 41 % to 9. 10 % and this is higher than 5 % the maximum content of CF in layer chicks. Factory A feed showed high ME (2992 Kcal/kg) and the lower <b>value</b> in <b>factory</b> F feed (2940 Kcal/kg), this agreed with ME requirement for layer chicks of 2900 Kcal/Kg. The average CP content in factory E feed was 32. 18 % and in factory A feed was 20. 47 %, this values higher than the CP requirement of 16 % for layer. The CF values ranged from 6. 00 % to 8. 92 % compared to the maximum level of 5 % CF for layer. The lower value of ME in factory F feed (2629 Kcal/kg) and the higher <b>value</b> in <b>Factory</b> G feed (2945 Kcal/kg). Only factory A and G feed meet the ME requirement of 2900 Kcal/kg for layer. In conclusion, most Factories exceeded the recommended level of CP for all classes of animals. In contrast, ME is less than the recommended level in most Factories and this affect the metabolizable energy and crude protein valu...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine a}} {{situation}} where a firm chooses to locate a new factory in one of several jurisdictions. The <b>value</b> of the <b>factory</b> may differ among jurisdictions and {{it depends on the}} private information held by each jurisdiction. Jurisdictions compete for the location of the new factory. This competition may take the form of expenditures already incurred on infrastructure, commitments to spend on infrastructure, tax incentives or even cash payments. The model combines two elements that are usually considered separately; competition is desirable because we want the factory to be located in the jurisdiction that values it the most, but competition in itself is wasteful. I show that the expected total amount paid to the firm under a large family of arrangements is the same. Moreover, I show that the ex-ante optimal mechanism - that is, the mechanism that guarantees that the firm chooses the jurisdiction with the highest <b>value</b> for the <b>factory,</b> minimizes the total expected payment to the firm, and balances the budget in an ex-ante sense - can be implemented by running a standard auction and subsidizing participation. ...|$|R

The methodology that we have used is a case analysis, and its main aim is to study an unfamiliar situation.

The new regulation obliges automobile companies to deeply modify their process technologies and their relationships with their suppliers (toughening requirements and strengthening long-term relationships) and to require their workers to train in environmental matters. Complying with regulation by suppliers will be possible if product and process designs are modified.

50|$|Agriculture {{has long}} been the main source of income and {{sustenance}} for both Costa Ricans and Quakers in Monteverde. The original Creole populations were restrained by poor infrastructure, and relied mostly on subsistence agriculture. Initially they hunted tapirs, deer, pacas, monkeys, and birds, but diminished those populations and turned to pigs, corn, beans, vegetables, fruits, herbs and livestock. In the 1950s, both Quakers and Costa Ricans produced garlic, beef, flax, and homestead cheese. The Quakers took advantages of the infrastructure improvements of the 1960s and exported cheese and beef {{to the rest of the}} country. However, due to overgrazing, the dairy industry declined in the 1970s. This led the population to turn to coffee.

40|$|This chapter {{concerns}} {{itself with}} a garment factory in Trinidad, West Indies, producing brand-name clothing for the Eastern Caribbean market. Workers in this factory not only stitch garments for an hourly wage; but also stealthily operate a secondary assembly line, creating precise duplicates of the factory's products for themselves to take home and wear. Manufactured on the shop-floor alongside 'legitimate' production, the copied garments are identical in every way to the genuine ones they mimic. In this chapter, I argue that workers have created a 'loop' in the value chain: a simultaneous moment {{in which they are}} both producers and consumers of the factory's products. While 'genuine' garments circulate through market-capitalist networks of exchange, copied garments only circulate through social networks, thereby accruing and representing forms of 'value' that are distinct from market value. By looping the <b>value</b> chain, <b>factory</b> workers create non-market values alongside market-oriented ones, showing both sets of values to be interdependent.
