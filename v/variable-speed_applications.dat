There are {{a very large number}} of applications (e. g., fluid motion, materials handling, and materials processing) which would benefit, both in terms of process improvement and energy savings, through the use of speed control. Previous studies have shown that the variable-flow fluid motion applications (pumps, fans, and compressors) have the largest savings potential. In this paper, an ecodesign analysis of two different technologies for the flow regulation in pumping systems—constant-speed pump with an output throttle valve (motor directly fed from the line) and variable-speed pump without an output throttle valve (motor fed by a variable-speed drive) —is presented. A European standard methodology for the ecodesign analysis of energy-using products is used in this paper. This paper includes a comparative analysis of the environmental impacts and life-cycle costs. The identified large environmental benefits on top of the energy savings provide a strong argument for an increased use of VSDs.

The SyR technology represents a convenient solution to obtain high efficiency machines at reduced cost and high reliability. The manufacturing costs are comparable to other existing technologies such as induction motors. Different SyR and PM-SyR machines with different ratings and applications were designed, for comparison with induction motors having equal frame. An accurate comparison between Induction motors, SyR and PM-SyR machines is reported, with reference to the IE 4 and IE 5 efficiency specifications that could become mandatory in the next years. Three studies are classified under the term "Non-Conventional" machines: Line-Start SyR motor: is a special SyR machine designed for constant speed applications, line supplied. The rotor flux barriers are filled with aluminum, to obtain a squirrel cage that resembles the one of an induction motor. The manufacturing costs are comparable to those of the induction motor, and the efficiency is higher. Two prototypes were realized and tested. FSW-SyR: tooth-wound coils and fractional slot per pole combinations were investigated. They are of interest because they permit a simplification and higher degree of automatization of the manufacturing process. However, FSW-SyR machines are known for their high torque ripple, low specific torque and power factor. The number of slots per pole was optimized to maximize the torque density. Dealing with the torque ripple, a lumped parameters model was used together with optimization in SyRE. A design with minimized ripple was obtained, comparable to a distributed winding machine in this respect. This design was prototyped and tested. Mild Overlapped SyR: this study shows a new winding configuration applied to SyR and PM-SyR machines. The proposed case is in the direction to find a hybrid solution between distributed winding and tooth winding motors, that permits to reduce costs and improve performances.

40|$|Nowadays, due to {{excellent}} {{advantages of}} permanent magnet brushless (PMBL) motors {{such as high}} efficiency and high torque/power density, they are used in many industrial and <b>variable-speed</b> electrical drives <b>applications.</b> If the fabricated PMBL motor has neither ideal sinusoidal nor ideal trapezoidal back-EMF voltages, it is named nonideal (or nonsinusoidal) PMBL motor.

40|$|Most {{electrical}} machines {{available in the}} market utilise some form of silicon iron (SI) as the core material. Although SI based electrical machine manufacturing methods are well established and simple, SI has significant iron losses specifically in high frequency <b>variable-speed</b> motor drive <b>applications.</b> Two alternative magnetic materials have recently been developed: amorphous magnetic material (AMM) and soft magnetic composite, which can each offer unique characteristics that can be utilised to improve the performance of electric machines. AMM offers extremely low iron losses {{which makes it a}} good candidate for high-efficiency and <b>variable-speed</b> motor <b>applications.</b> However, due to handling and cutting limitations, AMM has not been utilised widely in rotating {{electrical machines}}. A commercially viable AMM cutting technique was recently developed by the industrial partner of this project. It is thus now practical to cut the AMM ribbon into a machine stator, particularly for axial-field stators which generally require less cutting than radial-field stators. This thesis investigates an innovative motor design based on applying the cut AMM in an axial-field permanent magnet (AFPM) machine for general drive applications. It includes a detailed review of the analytical approach, finite element analysis (FEA), iron loss investigation and prototype performance comparisons. Analytical analysis of the AFPM machine was performed and the key design variables were evaluated to optimise the design parameters based on the use of AMM. The AMM cutting constraints, design and performances trade-offs were also investigated in the design. The research study provides a design procedure to determine the basic physical size and configuration (e. g. combination of the number of slots and poles, slot width and depth, number of winding layers, air gap length, magnet thickness) based on certain basic specifications. In addition, a comprehensive investigation was conducted on the iron loss of various materials to compare these with AMM. Due to the three dimensional (3 D) nature of the AFPM structure, the theoretical design was validated using 3 D FEA and extensive simulation results are provided. A number of AMM AFPM prototypes were successfully designed and constructed. Due to limited available materials, the prototypes were built using uncoatedAMMribbon which has substantially higher iron loss characteristics. Nevertheless, it is believed that it would still provide a valuable understanding of the real machine characteristics and allow initial design validation. The prototype was tested in a custom-built test rig to validate the analytical and 3 D FEA predictions. Overall, a good correspondence between the results and predictions has been achieved. Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate and demonstrate the characteristics of the AMM prototype machines which are based on fractional-slot concentratedwinding single-sided AFPM machines. This includes comparisons against identical silicon iron and soft magnetic composite prototypes. In addition, the laboratory experimental results also highlighted the significant effect of the open-circuit losses on the overall machine performance. Therefore, the open-circuit loss components which includes bearing, windage, magnet and iron losses were separated based on 3 D FEA and experimental results. The above research studies demonstrated the potential and feasibility of cut AMM to produce highly efficient AFPM machines. In addition, the innovative cutting technique also has the potential for mass production of low-cost AMM machines. The research work in this thesis makes a significant contribution to the design of axial-field permanent magnet machines based on AMM. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Consequently, embedded electrical machines which are criticalcomponents of a vehicle power system have to be highly efficient and remain at anacceptable cost. In the HEV and EV markets, permanent magnet synchronous machine(PMSM) have now reached a major place thanks to their high torque/powerdensity, their high efficiency and their large constant power speed range capability(Z. Q. Zhu and D. Howe, ”Electrical Machines and Drives for Electric, Hybrid,and Fuel Cell Vehicles” in Proceeding of the IEEE, Vol. 97, No 4, 2007). Axialflux permanent magnet synchronous machines (AFPM) provide high compactnessand high torque capability, due to their particular disc-shaped geometry, and consequentlyappear as a relevant solution for HEV (A. Cavagnino, M. Lazzari, F. Profumo and A. Tenconi. ”A Comparison Between the Axial Flux and the RadialFlux Structures for PM Synchronous Motors”, in IEEE Transactions on IndustryApplications, Vol. 38, No. 6. 2002). However, 3 D aspects relative to an axial fluxmachine electromagnetic problem are {{to be considered for}} an accurate analysis. Therefore, 3 D-FEA is required though their computation is time consuming. For a <b>variable-speed</b> traction <b>application,</b> requirements usually comprise torque/powerversus speed profiles and voltage and current inverter rankings. FEA is then an efficientway to check these requirements and to know better the machine charactericsas well. At this point, it is not obvious to decide which simulation is necessary (e. g. magneto-static or magneto-dynamic application) and what are the interesting valuesto analyse each time. Moreover, it is important to choose a convenient configurationof the simulation and to determine an efficient simulation sequence. This problembecomes even more relevant when several machines are to be compared. In thisperspective, this paper proposes a methodology to deal with 3 D-FEA of an AFPMmachine using CEDRAT-Flux 3 DR commercial software.

A simple, rigid, non-linear turbine model was used to systematically perform trade-off studies between two performance metrics. Minimization of both the deviation of the rotor speed from the desired speed and {{the motion of the}} actuator is desired. The robust nature of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is illustrated, and optimal operating conditions are determined. Because numerous simulation runs may be completed in a short time, the relationship of the two opposing metrics is easily visualized. Traditional controller design generally consists of linearizing a model about an operating point. This step was taken for two different operating points, and the systematic design approach was used. A comparison of the optimal regions selected using the n on-linear model and the two linear models shows similarities. The linearization point selection does, however, affect the turbine performance slightly. Exploitation of the simplicity of the model allows surfaces consisting of operation under a wide range of gain values to be created. This methodology provides a means of visually observing turbine performance based upon the two metrics chosen for this study.
