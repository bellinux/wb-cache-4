40|$|Potato {{can be used}} as {{a source}} of {{modified}} starches for culinary and industrial processes, but its allelic diversity and tetraploid genome make the identification of novel alleles a challenge, and breeding such alleles into elite lines is a slow and difficult process. An efficient and reliable strategy has been developed for the rapid introduction and identification of new alleles in elite potato breeding lines, based on the ethylmethanesulphonate mutagenesis of dihaploid seeds. Using the granule-bound starch synthase I gene (waxy) as a model, a series of point mutations that potentially affect gene expression or enzyme function was identified. The most promising loss-of-function allele (waxy(E 1100)) carried a mutation in the 5 '-splice donor site of intron 1 that caused mis-splicing and protein truncation. This was used to establish elite breeding lineages lacking granule-bound starch synthase I protein activity and producing high-amylopectin starch.

We studied the seed exchanges of four rural communities in Candelaria district (Cochabamba department, Bolivia) at the international and local levels, emphasizing the spread of new sexually-produced genotypes through these exchanges. Interviews with 44 farmers generated socioeconomic, agronomic, crop diversity and seed exchange information, and data on the potential incorporation of new sexually-produced genotypes in the crop germplasm. We interviewed merchants to evaluate the input and output of genetic diversity in the communities studied. Results showed a positive effect of the farmers’ wealth on the diversity cultivated and on seed exchanges. Most seed exchanges occurred at market, creating a distinction between cash and self-consumption landraces. Cash landraces were intensively exchanged; self-consumption landraces were isolated at the farmer level and prone to genetic drift and complete loss. Merchants exported seeds of cash landraces across Bolivia and into Peru and Argentina. New sexually produced genotypes are less incorporated into cash landraces than in self-consumed landraces. However, new genotypes incorporated into cash landraces are diffused faster and better, being more intensively exchanged.

40|$|Abstract Sugarcane is a <b>vegetatively</b> <b>propagated</b> <b>crop</b> {{and hence}} the {{production}} of seed and its fate in the environment has not been studied. The recent development of genetically modified sugarcane, {{with the aim of}} commercial production, requires a research effort to understand sugarcane reproduc-tive biology. This study contributes to this understanding by defining the abiotic limits for sugarcane seed germination. Using seed from multiple genetic crosses, germination was measured under different light regimes (light and dark), tem-peratures (from 18 °C to 42 °C) and water potentials (from 0 MPa to − 1 MPa); cardinal temperatures and base water potential of germination were estimated based on the rates of germination. We found that sugarcane seed could germinate over a broad range of temperatures (from 11 °C to 42 °C) with optima ranging from 27 °C to 36 °C depending on source of seed. Water potentials below − 0. 5 MPa halved the proportion of seed that germinated. By comparing these limits to the environmental conditions in areas where sugarcane grows and has the potential to produce seed, water, but not temper-ature, will be the main limiting factor for germination. This new information can be taken into account when evaluating any risk of weediness during the assessment of GM sugarcane...|$|R

40|$|Oca (Oxalis tuberosa Mol.) is a {{tuber crop}} that is {{traditionally}} cultivated in the Andes where it {{plays an important}} role for food security. It is vegetatively propagated by the farmers but presents a fully functional, complex and poorly studied sexual reproduction system. Both reproductive systems act antagonistically on genetic diversity. On one hand, vegetative propagation allows farmers to fix and easily propagate agronomically valuable genotypes. On the other hand, sexual reproduction allows to recombine parental genotypes into new genotypes. Sexual reproduction of oca has never been observed in natural conditions and its use by farmers has never been reported. Modern plant breeding has never been attempted for oca. Oca is currently under the threat of genetic erosion. Obtaining {{a better understanding of the}} dynamics of its genetic diversity is crucial to the development of effective conservation strategies. The development of plant breeding programs would permit to renew the interest of farmers for this crop, which suffers from the competition of modern potato varieties. The present thesis investigates the effect of the sexual reproduction of oca and its management (both traditional and modern) on the genetic diversity of this crop trough a multidisciplinary approach combining genetics, biology and ethnobotany. In this thesis, the sexual reproduction of oca was shown to be functional under natural conditions. All the sexually-produced individuals showed unique genotypes, distinct from the parental landraces. Following interviews with farmers, an unconscious incorporation of sexually-produced new genotypes into the landraces traditionally cultivated by farmers was evidenced to be highly probable. SSR molecular markers studies showed that farmers grow complex landraces, showing important intra-landrace diversity and very distinct genotypes arising from different sexual reproduction events. A lot of seed exchanges are undertaken by farmers, which manage very differently self-consumed and cash landraces. Therefore, the introduced new genotypes can be propagated to farmers of other communities and regions very fast. Outbreeding depression was observed for the first time for <b>vegetatively</b> <b>propagated</b> <b>crops.</b> By measuring genetic distances between parental genotypes, plant breeders will be able to avoid this phenomenon. A pathway for effective plant breeding programs was proposed. It should involve participatory techniques that will allow a sustainable use of genetic resources.

Jaccard's genetic distance between accessions ranged from 0 to 0. 49 with an average of 0. 28 +/- 0. 08 (mean +/- SD). Dendrogram (UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averaging)) and factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) showed that the genetic structure was influenced by the collection site.

Analysis by country revealed that Peru presented the greatest genetic distances from the other countries and possessed the highest intra-country genetic distance (0. 30 +/- 0. 08). This suggests that the Peruvian oca accessions form a distinct genetic group.

40|$|Andean {{tuber crop}} species oca (Oxalis tuberosa Molina), ulluco (Ullucus tuberosus Caldas), and mashua (Tropaeolum tuberosum Ruiz & Pav.) play major roles in Andean communities. These species show high {{variability}} but are threatened with genetic erosion. To study {{the management of}} genetic resources of neglected <b>vegetatively</b> <b>propagated</b> <b>crop</b> species, we studied genetic diversity and structure of these species in an in situ diversity microcenter (Huanuco, Peru). A sample of 15 varieties of oca, 15 of ulluco, and 26 of mashua was analyzed with the inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) molecular markers. Mean genetic distances and global genetic diversities were high for the three species, with higher values for mashua than for oca and ulluco. Assignment technique divided both oca and ulluco samples into two genetic clusters; the mashua sample probably belongs to a single genetic cluster. Inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) technique showed intravarietal genetic variability for most varieties, suggesting an underestimation of the in situ genetic variability. These results are discussed considering how variation in breeding systems and farmers' practice influenced patterns of genetic diversity. Our findings confirm the hypothesis of {{a considerable amount of}} variability found in neglected Andean tubers and are essential to deserve adequate conservation strategies and to maintain genetic resources of neglected Andean tuber crop species under a threat of genetic erosion.

40|$|Genetic {{transformation}} with resistance (R) genes {{is expected}} to enhance resistance durability against pathogens, especially for potato, a <b>vegetatively</b> <b>propagated</b> <b>crop</b> with tetrasomic inheritance and a long-term breeding program. In this study, 128 potato transformants were analysed {{for the presence of}} vector T-DNA genes, borders and backbone sequences. They were harvested after transformation using a construct containing neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) and three R genes against potato late blight (Phytophthora infestans). Our analysis revealed that 45 % of the R gene-containing transformants possessed a low T-DNA copy number, without the integration of vector backbone and borders. The integration of vector backbone sequences was characterized using eight genes, and backbone gene tetA was selected for the early prediction of plants with backbone sequence integration. Three transformants, two plants harbouring one T-DNA copy and one plant harbouring three T-DNA copies, were crossed with susceptible cv. Katahdin. Based on our results, we conclude that all four T-DNA genes were inherited as one cluster and segregated in a Mendelian fashion. The three T-DNA inserts from the transformant harbouring three T-DNA copies were statistically proven to be un-linked and inherited into the offspring plants independently. All of the R genes were functionally expressed in the offspring plants as in their parental transformants. This functional gene stacking has important implications towards achieving more durable resistance against potato late bligh...|$|R
40|$|Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a triploid, <b>vegetatively</b> <b>propagated</b> <b>crop</b> {{introduced}} early {{during the}} colonization of Brazil. Turmeric rhizomes are ground into a powder {{used as a}} natural dye in the food industry, although recent research suggests a greater potential {{for the development of}} drugs and cosmetics. In Brazil, {{little is known about the}} genetic variability available for crop improvement. We examined the genetic diversity among turmeric accessions from a Brazilian germplasm collection comprising 39 accessions collected from the States of Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, and Para. For comparison, 18 additional genotypes were analyzed, including samples from India and Puerto Rico. Total DNA was extracted from lyophilized leaf tissue and genetic analysis was performed using 17 microsatellite markers (single-sequence repeats). Shannon-Weiner indexes ranged from 0. 017 (Minas Gerais) to 0. 316 (Sao Paulo). Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) demonstrated major differences between countries (63. 4 %) and that most of the genetic diversity in Brazil is found within states (75. 3 %). Genotypes from Sao Paulo State were the most divergent and potentially useful for crop improvement. Structure analysis indicated two main groups of accessions. These results can help target future collecting efforts for introduction of new materials needed to develop more productive and better adapted cultivars.
