25|$|A special form of {{boundaryless}} {{organization is}} virtual. Hedberg, Dahlgren, Hansson, and Olve (1999) consider the <b>virtual</b> <b>organization</b> as not physically existing as such, but enabled by software to exist. The <b>virtual</b> <b>organization</b> exists within {{a network of}} alliances, using the Internet. This means while {{the core of the}} organization can be small but still the company can operate globally be a market leader in its niche. According to Anderson, because of the unlimited shelf space of the Web, the cost of reaching niche goods is falling dramatically. Although none sell in huge numbers, there are so many niche products that collectively they make a significant profit, and that is what made highly innovative Amazon.com so successful.|$|E

40|$|The core {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to introduce the repertory grid technique as a powerful methodology into research on trust in <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations.</b> This technique is particularly capable of yielding insights into the subjective meaning of trust. <b>Virtual</b> <b>organizations</b> have been chosen as our empirical field because the literature shows a broad consensus that trust is one of the most important success factors for the initiation, development, and continuation of activities in these types of hybrid regimes. On the basis of a discussion of the literature on trust in networks and <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations,</b> we present our empirical case study of two Swiss <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations.</b> It reveals that the emergence of trust in <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations</b> depends strongly on personal bonds and shared experiences in the practical realization of projects, whereas generalized rules and contracts play only a supplementary role. Localized and experience-based commitments as well as the proactive behavior of the partners involved are identified as decisive denominators of trust...|$|R

This analogy led eventually to the formal definition presented in a paper that appeared in 1994 and elaborated in his book on <b>virtual</b> <b>organization</b> published in 2002. During the year 1979-1980, he was stimulated to develop and codify the idea of <b>virtual</b> <b>organization</b> through discussions with Professor Henk van Dongen {{and his colleagues at}} the Graduate School of Management in Delft, The Netherlands. In the course of elaborating the concept and its implications for society, he introduced the notion of information commodity to explain a key part of the economic foundation of <b>virtual</b> <b>organization</b> and developed mathematical models for pricing information commodities, both from the supply and the demand perspective.|$|E

40|$|Grid {{operations}} rely on monitoring services fed by {{a multitude}} of sources. These services provide relevant information {{about the status of}} the resources {{and the quality of the}} services in the infrastructure. In a Grid, they must disseminate this information across multiple administrative domains and heterogeneous technical platforms to users organized in different <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations.</b> In order to achieve this, data must be translated and homogenized dynamically. It must furthermore be tailored and processed in a controllable way, based on its allocation to <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations.</b> To resolve these requirements for the application of Grid resource monitoring, we propose functional modules, which conduct automated data migration and classification based on dynamic virtualization policies and define the composition of monitoring data related to <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations.</b> The resulting system enables an interoperable provisioning of specific monitoring data about the status of distributed Grid resources and services to dynamically changing <b>virtual</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R
