40|$|SummaryNeural activity-induced {{long-term}} potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission {{is believed to}} be one of the cellular mechanisms underlying experience-dependent developmental refinement of neural circuits. Although it is well established that visual experience and neural activity are critical for the refinement of retinal circuits, whether and how LTP occurs in the retina remain unknown. Using in vivo perforated whole-cell recording and two-photon calcium imaging, we find that both repeated electrical and <b>visual</b> <b>stimulations</b> can induce LTP at excitatory synapses formed by bipolar cells on retinal ganglion cells in larval but not juvenile zebrafish. LTP induction requires the activation of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and its expression involves arachidonic acid-dependent presynaptic changes in calcium dynamics and neurotransmitter release. Physiologically, both electrical and visual stimulation-induced LTP can enhance visual responses of retinal ganglion cells. Thus, LTP exists in developing retinae with a presynaptic locus and may serve for visual experience-dependent refinement of retinal circuits...|$|R

Positive modulation of the cortical swallowing network can have clinical ramifications in dysphagia due to central nervous system deficits. Our aim was to determine the effect of nutritive sensory input on the cortical swallowing network. In 14 healthy right-handed volunteers, we utilized a paradigm-driven protocol to quantify the number of activated voxels and their signal intensity within the left hemispheric cortical swallowing network by high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI) during five different swallowing conditions. Swallowing conditions included a dry swallow (saliva) and natural water-, lemon-, popcorn-, and chocolate-flavored liquid swallows. Each flavored liquid was presented simultaneously by its image, scent, and taste in random order and tested over three runs. fMRIs were analyzed in a blinded fashion. Average fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent signal intensity and number of activated voxels during swallowing concurrent with nutritive gustatory, olfactory, and <b>visual</b> <b>stimulations</b> were significantly increased compared with dry/natural water swallows throughout the cortical swallowing network (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 05, respectively).

40|$|The energy {{metabolism}} of cerebral cortex adapts {{to the increase}} in metabolic demand which occurs during enhanced cortical activity (e. g. sensory stimulation). This contributes to the generation of the imaging and spectroscopic signals that are utilized to monitor and appraise the function of the brain in situ. Importantly, the simple paradigm of “neuronal activity” is insufficient to interpret experimental outcomes, as what is observed depends on the balance between (i) activity patterns, whether excitatory or inhibitory; (ii) information processing mechanisms, specifically input/output or synaptic/spiking activity; (iii) stimulation of cell-specific (primarily neuronal and astrocytic) functional and metabolic pathways. Understanding the basis of the metabolic response of the cortical tissue to stimulation (i. e. neurometabolic coupling) is an important goal for neurosciences. 	In the present work, I studied the coupling between activity and {{energy metabolism}} of the human cerebral cortex by combining theoretical and experimental approaches. First, I adapted and used the information about the energy consumed by cortical signaling processes in order to develop a kinetic model of carbohydrate metabolism (Chapters 1 and 2). By encompassing the current knowledge about the regulation of energy supply and demand in cortical tissue, the model predicted that the metabolic response of the cerebral cortex might be strongly dependent on the balance between spiking and synaptic activity. Then, I designed an experiment for the measurement of vascular and metabolic response of the primary visual cortex to specific <b>visual</b> <b>stimulations</b> (Chapter 3). In particular, by acting on the temporal frequency of achromatic luminance and isoluminant chromatic flickering <b>visual</b> <b>stimulations,</b> I aimed at altering the balance between local input processing (synaptic activity) and output firing (spiking activity) through changes in intracortical inhibition. 	The modeling and experimental results support the hypothesis (discussed in Chapter 4) that spiking activity, which is identified by axonal action potentials propagation, hinges on fast metabolic pathways that do not depend on oxygen (i. e. anaerobic). This suggests that the up-regulation of anaerobic metabolism during enhanced cortical activity is primarily due to the long-range communication between different areas of the cerebral cortex, more than to local processing within an individual cortical area. Identifying the potential significance of this mechanism is the subject of my future research...|$|R

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{researched}} non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation. An apparent {{example is the}} act of voyeurism - a practice where an individual covertly watches another undress or engage in sexual behaviour. Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of ‘sexual deviation’, it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar industry that is pornography is yet another example. A common presumption in society and the media is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the Kinsey hypothesis that men {{are more prone to}} sexual arousal from <b>visual</b> <b>stimulation</b> than women and, arguably, can be seen depicted through the [...] "male glaze" [...] that dominates the pornography industry.

40|$|Background: Attention is used {{to enhance}} neural {{processing}} of selected parts of a visual scene. It increases neural responses to stimuli near target locations and is usually coupled to eye movements. Covert attention shifts, however, decouple the attentional focus from gaze, allowing to direct the attention to a peripheral location without moving the eyes. We tested whether covert attention shifts modulate ongoing neuronal activity in cortical area V 6 A, an area that provides a bridge between visual signals and arm-motor control. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed single cell recordings from 3 Macaca Fascicularis trained to fixate straighthead, while shifting attention outward to a peripheral cue and inward again to the fixation point. We found that neurons in V 6 A are influenced by spatial attention. The attentional modulation occurs without gaze shifts and cannot be explained by <b>visual</b> <b>stimulations.</b> <b>Visual,</b> motor, and attentional responses can occur in combination in single neurons. Conclusions/Significance: This modulation in an area primarily involved in visuo-motor transformation for reaching may form a neural basis for coupling attention to the preparation of reaching movements. Our results show that cortical processes of attention are related not only to eye-movements, as many studies have shown, but also to arm movements, a finding that has been suggested by some previous behavioral findings. Therefore, the widely-held view that spatial attention is tightly intertwined with—and perhaps directly derived from—motor preparatory processes should be extende...|$|R

Observers viewed a rapid stream of real-world object pictures overlapped by words (presentation duration per stimulus: 500 ms, interstimulus interval: 200 ms), with the instruction to attend to the words and detect word repetitions, without knowing that their memory would be tested later.
