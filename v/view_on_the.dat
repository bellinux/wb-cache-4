40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science and to investigate the relationship between their <b>views</b> and decision-making <b>on</b> socio-scientific issues (SSI). In this study, 27 university students attending a science course were asked to discuss four controversial issues: the Toyota recall, the green car, the global warming and swine influenza (influenza A (H 1 N 1)). The study was comprised of two stages. At the first stage, we examined students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of science and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science with the open-ended questionnaire based on VNOS and VOSTS. While they held relatively similar <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of science, their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science were distinct as pragmatic, intrinsic, communal and ethical views. At the second stage, to examine the role of their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science in decision-making, we selected four students who had similar <b>views</b> <b>on</b> NOS but different <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science. The four students were selected from each group of <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science and their decision-making processes were analyzed following grounded theory. Across SSIs, they relied upon their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science as the strategies for decision, though considered different perception, and causal and contextual conditions. This study indicates that understanding students’ <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orientation of science would be helpful for achieving scientific literacy for informed decision...|$|R

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> History's literary worth, modern {{scholars such as}} Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E
5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of <b>view,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> position of Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis}} of several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from its one feature of a shortened frill. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state of the German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E

5|$|When the LM voted {{narrowly}} in May 1976 {{to rejoin}} the Liberals (222 to 211), Millhouse immediately created the New LM, and became its only parliamentary representative.

5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} does offer a socio-political <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> origins and inevitability of such {{criminal}} types in society. The tenements {{in which the}} youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, proper role models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} days tourism was a {{relatively}} new concept, but grew slowly before exploding {{with the advent of}} air travel around 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations, and Kīlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less constant state of moderate eruption, is {{a major part of the}} island's tourist draw. Today, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offers the best sheltered <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest lodging, and the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access. In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in Kalapana on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E
5|$|Nadya joined Lenin in Munich, {{becoming}} {{his personal}} secretary.

To evade Bavarian police, Lenin moved to London with Iskra in April 1902, there becoming friends with fellow Russian Marxist Leon Trotsky. In London, Lenin fell ill with erysipelas {{and was unable to}} take such a leading role on the Iskra editorial board; in his absence, the board moved its base of operations to Geneva.|$|E
