40|$|Vectoring enables {{cooperative}} crosstalk mitigation in wideband wireline systems. A sudden termination {{change within}} a <b>vectored</b> <b>group</b> alters the entire perceived channel matrix and thus disturbs the vectoring operation since the precoder, which is {{tuned to the}} channel before the change, is no longer up to date. We analyze the resulting residual crosstalk {{and its impact on}} performance degradation during showtime for both linear and non-linear precoding systems. To cover, a new channel matrix must be estimated to update the precoder accordingly. We use a model-based approach to track a vector instead of estimating the full matrix. Based on this vector, simplified precoder updating methods for both precoding systems are presented accounting for a sudden line deactivation or (re) activation in a <b>vectored</b> <b>group.</b> As an alternative to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed procedures significantly reduce the complexity of both channel estimation and precoder updating and minimize the disturbed period for active users...|$|R

40|$|USA. Vector {{quantization}} is {{a classical}} quantization technique from signal processing {{which allows the}} modeling of probability density functions by the distribution of prototype vectors. It was originally used for data compression. It works by dividing a large set of points (<b>vectors)</b> into <b>groups</b> having approximately {{the same number of}} points closest to them. Each group is represented by its centroid point, as in clustering algorithms. Vector Quantization is a technique of compressing data based on grouping blocks having similar data. These blocks are called Code Vectors and all the code <b>vectors</b> <b>grouped</b> together is called a Codebook. The key to VQ data compression is a good codebook. In order to reduce bandwidth overhead it is necessary to generate Global Codebook for a particular class of images. Otherwise local codebook has to be transferred every time before the transmission of image. In this paper various global codebook generation algorithms for vector quantization for color images are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The next digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) generation, called G. fast, extends the frequency band up to 212 MHz and achieves Gigabit data-rates. Vectoring technology cancels the performance-limiting crosstalk among DSL lines on a signal level, but requires co-located line termination. Differently, dynamic spectrum management level 2 (DSM-L 2) coordinates the transmit power spectra among interferers and thus, does not require all line termination units to be co-located. In this work we analyze the data-rates of G. fast under full vectoring, partial <b>vectoring</b> restricted to <b>groups</b> of users, and non-vectoring scenarios. We also propose interference alignment (IA) as an alternative method to DSM-L 2 {{for dealing with the}} interference in G. fast and show that IA is superior to DSM-L 2 in non-vectoring scenarios. Furthermore, we also propose time division multiple access (TDMA) for coordination of multiple <b>vectoring</b> <b>groups</b> in partial <b>vectoring</b> scenarios. I...|$|R
