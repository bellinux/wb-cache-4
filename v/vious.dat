40|$|A modernized device {{intended}} for diagnosing the temperature-dependent activity of cells is described. The activity of cells {{was determined by}} finding the correlation coefficient of optical signals in speckle patterns recorded at different moments of time. It is shown that, as the temperature increases from 26 to 36 Y°C, variations in the optical paths in cells increase from 16 to 26 nm. This is probably associated with the physiological activity of cells-trapping of large molecules or their conglomerates. In contrast to the pre- <b>vious</b> variant of the device design, instead of a lipid membrane, a cell monolayer was used, which was culti- vated on a plane-parallel glass plate.

Efficient generation of multi- level tiled code is essential for maximizing data reuse in systems with deep memory hierarchies. Tiled loops with parametric tile sizes (not compile-time constants) facilitate runtime feedback and dynamic optimizations used in iterative compilation and automatic tuning. Previous parametric multi-level tiling approaches have been restricted to perfectly nested loops, where all assignment state- ments are contained inside the innermost loop of a loop nest. Pre- <b>vious</b> solutions to tiling for imperfect loop nests have only handled fixed tile sizes.
