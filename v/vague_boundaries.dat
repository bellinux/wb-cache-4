Keate awarded ownership to the Griquas. Waterboer, fearing conflict with the Boer republic of Orange Free State, subsequently asked for and received British protection. Griqualand then became a separate Crown Colony renamed Griqualand West in 1871, with a Lieutenant-General and legislative council.|$|E

5000|$|Dosage forms (also {{called unit}} doses) are {{pharmaceutical}} drug {{products in the}} form {{in which they are}} marketed for use, with a specific mixture of active ingredients and inactive components (excipients), in a particular configuration (such as a capsule shell, for example), and apportioned into a particular dose. For example, two products may both be amoxicillin, but one is in 500 mg capsules and another is in 250 mg chewable tablets. The term unit dose can also sometimes encompass non-reusable packaging as well (especially when each drug product is individually packaged), although the FDA distinguishes that by unit-dose [...] "packaging" [...] or [...] "dispensing". Depending on the context, multi(ple) unit dose can refer to distinct drug products packaged together, or to a single drug product containing multiple drugs and/or doses. The term dosage form can also sometimes refer only to the pharmaceutical formulation of a drug product's constituent drug substance(s) and any blends involved, without considering matters beyond that (like how it is ultimately configured as a consumable product such as a capsule, patch, etc.). Because of the somewhat <b>vague</b> <b>boundaries</b> and unclear overlap of these terms and certain variants and qualifiers thereof within the pharmaceutical industry, caution is often advisable when conversing with someone who may be unfamiliar with another person's use of the term.|$|E
40|$|Structurally, Loitering with Intent by Muriel Spark {{presents}} the typical frame of metafiction, hav-ing complicated “fiction within fiction ” and mise en abyme {{as well as}} texts from other genres. The exposure of artificiality in the novel is mainly carried out in three aspects: Fleur’s comments on the “novel within the novel ” titled Warrender Chase; the <b>vague</b> <b>boundary</b> between fiction and real-ity; the imitation of fiction by reality. The metafictional feature in content is that Spark generalizes her viewpoints on issues {{with regard to the}} writer, the work, and the reader. The reviews of the creation in the novel itself demonstrate Spark’s self-reflexiveness and self-consciousness in the process of writing. Loitering with Intent is a connecting link between Spark’s present works and fu-ture ones, for it expresses her concepts of art creation and serves as a guide for her future creation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{reliability}} of objective measurements on digital laryngeal images was investigated. METHODS: The {{magnitude of the}} error of measurement of surface areas by visually tracing the outline was determined for three different areas: {{the area of the}} lesion and, during vibration, the glottal area on maximal opening of the vocal folds and the glottal area on maximal closing of the vocal folds. RESULTS: The errors in these areas were 10 % to 30 %. The results suggest that the error is mainly due to the uncertainty of the real outline of areas with a <b>vague</b> <b>boundary.</b> Correction for differences in magnification between two images (posttherapy and pretherapy) is of importance in about 25 % to 65 % of cases, depending on the area measured.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} variety of {{definitions}} proposed for "resilience" within sustainability science and suggests a typology according to the specific degree of normativity. There is a tension between the original descriptive concept of resilience first defined in ecological science and a more recent, vague, and malleable notion of resilience used as an approach or boundary object by different scientific disciplines. Even though increased conceptual vagueness can be valuable to foster communication across disciplines and between science and practice, both conceptual clarity and practical relevance {{of the concept of}} resilience are critically in danger. The fundamental question is what conceptual structure we want resilience to have. This article argues that a clearly specified, descriptive concept of resilience is critical in providing a counterbalance to the use of resilience as a <b>vague</b> <b>boundary</b> object. A clear descriptive concept provides the basis for operationalization and application of resilience within ecological science...|$|R
50|$|The Central Plateau {{is divided}} into several {{distinctly}} different regions (though with very <b>vague</b> <b>boundaries),</b> {{largely as a result}} of the rainfall distribution across South Africa: wet in the east and increasingly drier and more arid in the west. The wettest and most fertile portion of the Central Plateau is the Highveld, which occupies the central eastern portion of the Plateau. It is generally between 1500 - 2100 m above sea level, highest on the edge of the Escarpment to the east (the Mpumalanga Drakensberg), and sloping downwards to the south and west. Its southern boundary is often taken to be the Orange River, from where the continuation of the plateau is known as the Great Karoo, except for a small strip just south of Lesotho which is often included in the Highveld. To the west the Highveld fades into the dry savannah of Griqualand West, beyond which lies the Kalahari desert. This boundary is very vague. The Highveld therefore encompasses the entire Free State, and an adjoining strip of the Provinces to the north of it. It receives between 400 and 1200 mm of rain annually, and is largely a flat grassland plain. Much of the area is devoted to commercial farming, but it also contains South Africa’s largest conurbation in Gauteng Province, the centre of the gold mining industry. But there are also important coal mines on the Highveld which are associated with South Africa’s major electricity generating power stations. The land is generally flat or gently undulating. Only a few rocky ridges protrude from this flatness: the Vredefort Dome, the Witwatersrand Ridge and the Magaliesberg just north of Pretoria, from where the Highveld gives way to the Bushveld to the north.|$|E

50|$|The Confederation League (which {{included}} such figures as Amor De Cosmos, John Robson, and Robert Beaven) led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, {{which had been}} created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). Several factors motivated this drive—fear of annexation by the United States, overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused {{by the end of}} the gold rush. With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the Canadian Pacific Railway to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join Confederation on 20 July 1871.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore what {{branding}} strategy constructs socially in an organisational setting. To this end we approach brands from a geographical perspective as epistemic objects that organise the spatial relationship between brand strategy and everyday work-life. Through an empirical case of discussions and contradictions related to branding in a university research centre, we explore how branded space-times are constituted through stories-so-far, individual and collective narratives that intersect in an online discussion mail list concerning the possible need for formulating a proper branding strategy. Our narrative analysis reveals that the <b>vague</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions of these space-times, allowing for multiple inclusions and exclusions, turns branding into an effective mode of governance that is met with very little resistance. However, our case suggests that branding gives rise to branded space-times of faith in and through which the organisation’s academic identity and image are negotiated. In this context branding emerges as a possible source for alignment in a deeply disjointed try to simultaneously find something in common and to set apart...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel human action recognition method {{based on the}} sequences of depth maps, which provide additional body shape and motion information for action recognition. First, the authors divide each depth sequence {{into a number of}} sub-sequences. All these sub-sequences are of uniform length. By controlling <b>vague</b> <b>boundary</b> (VB), they construct a VB-sequence which consists of an original sub-sequence and its adjacent sequences. Then, each depth frame in a VB-sequence is projected onto three orthogonal Cartesian planes, and the absolute value of the difference between two consecutive projected maps is accumulated to form a depth motion map (DMM) to describe the dynamic feature of a VB-sequence. Finally, they concatenate the DMMs of all the VB-sequences in one video sequence to describe an action. Collectively, they call them VB division of depth model. For classification, they apply robust probabilistic collaborative representation classification. The recognition results applied to the MSR Action Pairs, MSR Gesture 3 D, MSR Action 3 D, and UTD-MHAD datasets indicate superior performance of their method over most existing methods...|$|R

30|$|To begin with, Lopes (2007) has {{maintained}} that while according to standard Western ontology an architectural work is an object token and, more specifically, a material building, in traditional Japanese ontology architectural works are event tokens, which may also include {{one or more}} round of reconstruction. 5 This explains {{how it is possible}} that tourists visiting today the goshoden (the main sanctified structure) of the Ise Jingu, {{one of the most important}} and most visited Shinto shrines in Japan, do visit the same architectural work “launched” in the eighth century CE although the goshoden itself has been rebuilt about every twenty years, each time in one of two adjacent lots, introducing numerous changes in material and spatial specifications from one rebuilding to the next. 6 Also consider not only that events—differently from objects—are commonly conceived as having temporal parts, that is, parts corresponding to the intervals or moments through which they perdure (Simons 2000), 7 but also that, while objects are supposed to have relatively crisp spatial <b>boundaries</b> and <b>vague</b> temporal <b>boundaries,</b> events, by contrast, would have relatively <b>vague</b> spatial <b>boundaries</b> and crisp temporal boundaries (Casati and Varzi 2015). Thus acknowledging that in traditional Japanese ontology architectural works are event tokens would account for traditional Japanese vernacular architecture’s employing ephemeral building materials (because there is nothing wrong with events ending), and even for Japanese modernism’s putting up works for a very brief lifespan (think of Toyo Ito’s Nomad Restaurant, 1986).|$|R
