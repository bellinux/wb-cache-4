40|$|The {{motion of}} an {{electromagnetic}} wave, through a classically-forbidden region, has recently attracted renewed interest {{because of its}} implication {{with regard to the}} theoretical and experimental problems of superluminality. From an experimental point of view, many papers provide an evidence of superluminality in different physical systems. Theoretically, the problem of a passage through a forbidden gap has been treated by considering plane waves at oblique incidence into a plane parallel layer of a medium with a refractive index smaller than the index of the surrounding medium, and also confined (Gaussian) beams, still at oblique incidence. In the present paper the case of a Bessel beam is examined, at normal incidence into the layer (Secs. II and III), in the scalar approximation (Sec.

40|$|Abstract Background Apyrases are {{divalent}} ion dependent tri- and dinucleotide phosphatases {{with different}} substrate specificity. The intracellular lysosomal apyrase LALP 70 is also {{expressed as a}} splice variant (LALP 70 v) lacking a VSFASSQQ motif {{in the center of}} the molecule (aminoacids 287 – 294). However, the functional significance of this motif is unknown. In this report we used a thin layer chromatography approach to study separately the UTPase and UDPase activity of the two LALP-enzymes. Results We show, that LALP 70 and LALP 70 v cleaved UTP to UDP in a calcium independent manner. In contrast, the cleavage of UDP to UMP was strongly calcium dependent for LALP 70, but calcium independent for LALP 70 <b>v.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The VSFASSQQ motif not only influences the substrate specificity of LALP 70, but it confers calcium sensitivity to LALP 70 during the UDP cleavage. Whether this is due to direct binding of calcium to this motif or to a conformational change of the enzyme, remains to be elucidated. </p...|$|R

Several {{national}} organizations endorse screening for diabetes by physicians, but actual practice is poorly understood. Our objectives were {{to measure the}} rate, the predictors {{and the results of}} glucose testing in primary care, including rates of follow-up for abnormal values. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 301 randomly selected patients with no known diabetes who received care at a large academic general internal medicine practice in New York City. Using medical records, we collected patients' baseline characteristics in 1999 and followed patients through the end of 2002 for all glucose tests ordered. We used multivariate logistic regression to measure associations between diabetes risk factors and the odds of glucose testing.

40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) by Latin American companies has increased sharply {{since the beginning}} of the 2000 s. While most investment flows correspond to firms from large economies (i. e. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Colombia), small economies have also witnessed the increasing internationalisation of their domestic companies. This study examines the strategies followed by multinational enterprises (MNEs) from Latin America when they decide to invest in other countries, highlighting differences by sector and issuer-country size. To that end a new database, which comprises quantitative information on the main operations abroad of Latin American enterprises (both greenfield, and mergers and acquisitions) was constructed, based on fDi Markets and Thomson Reuters Datastream. It also investigates the home-country effects of outward foreign {{direct investment}} (OFDI) by conducting a case study of Costa Rica through a representative sample of firms investing abroad.
