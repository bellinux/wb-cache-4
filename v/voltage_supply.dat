The propulsion system was also found to be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect <b>voltage</b> <b>supply</b> to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E
5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a <b>voltage</b> <b>supply</b> initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E

The gate overdrive variation with temperature plays an increasingly important {{role in determining the}} speed characteristics of CMOS integrated circuits. The temperature dependent propagation delay characteristics, as shown in this paper, will experience a complete reversal in the near future. Contrary to the older technology generations, the speed of circuits in a 45 nm CMOS technology is enhanced when the temperature is increased at the nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> Operating an integrated circuit at the prescribed nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> is not preferable for reliable operation under temperature variations. A design methodology based on optimizing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is presented in this paper. The optimum <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> is 45 % to 57 % lower than the nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> in a 180 nm CMOS technology. Alternatively, the optimum <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> is 10 % to 54 % higher than the nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> in a 45 nm CMOS technology. The gap between the optimum and nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> increases in a low-power design. Deeply scaled low-power integrated circuits operating at ultra-low <b>voltage</b> <b>supplies</b> are, therefore, expected to be highly sensitive to temperature variations.

This style of plug/socket was used by university laboratories (from batteries) and the BBC, and is still in use on parts of the London Underground for 110 V AC <b>voltage</b> <b>supply.</b> In the 1960s they were used for 240 V DC in the Power laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department of what was then University College, Cardiff. Power was supplied by the public 240 V DC mains which remained available {{in addition to the}} 240 V AC mains until circa 1969, and thereafter from in-house rectifiers. They were also used in the Ministry of Defence Main Building on circuits powered from the standby generators to stop staff from plugging in unauthorised devices, e.g. kettles.

40|$|A design {{methodology}} based on optimizing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for simultaneously achieving {{energy efficiency and}} temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is presented in this paper. Circuits exhibit temperature variation insensitive delay characteristics when operated at a <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> 67 % to 68 % lower than the nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> At scaled <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> integrated circuits consume low power {{at the cost of}} reduced speed. The proposed {{design methodology}} of optimizing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is, therefore, particularly attractive for low power applications with relaxed speed requirements. The <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> that yield minimum energy and minimum energy-delay product are identified at two different temperatures for circuits in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The energy and speed at the <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> providing temperature variation insensitive propagation delay, minimum energy, and minimum energy-delay product are compared.

25|$|When {{the main}} {{electron}} gun writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the <b>voltage</b> <b>supply</b> to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.|$|E
25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high <b>voltage</b> <b>supply</b> to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.|$|E
