40|$|CrAlYN/CrN {{coatings}} {{represent a}} new generation Ti-free PVD coatings tailored to serve high temperature applications such as dry high speed machining and protection of special grades aerospace and automotive alloys against environmental attack. The novel High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HIPIMS) technique was used for substrate pre-treatment (etching) followed by coating deposition utilising Unbalanced Magnetron Sputtering (UBM). The employment of HIPIMS resulted in smooth (R-a = 0. 036 mu m) and well adherent films with typical scratch adhesion critical load values on M 2 high speed steel of L-C = 65 N. Low-angle XRD analysis showed that the coating has a nanoscale multilayer (superlattice) structure with a typical bi-layer thickness of 4 nm. XTEM observations confirmed this result and further revealed the dense, growth defect free structure of the coating due to the HIPIMS etching. CrAlYN/CrN combines high hardness of HK 0. 025 = 3320 with a low coefficient of friction of 0. 5 and an exceptionally low sliding wear coefficient of 3. 7 x 10 (- 17) m(3) N- 1 m(- 2), which is {{comparable to that of}} TiAlN/VN and Me-Carbon films. In dry high speed milling (<b>V-cutting</b> = 385 m min(- 1)) of hardened A 2 tool steel (HRC = 58), 8 min cemented carbide ball nosed end mills coated with CrAlYN/CrN outperformed TiAlCrYN, {{which is one of the}} market leading coatings dedicated to this application. When the test is carried out at the higher end of the cutting speed range of 500 m min(- 1) this difference in performance becomes even more pronounced (factor of 8 longer life time), which demonstrates the excellent quality of CrAlYN/CrN.

40|$|Flood-damaged {{trees along}} {{streams and rivers}} in 20 localities in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah were {{examined}} to assess the feasibility of reconstructing the frequency and magnitude of floods {{over the last several}} hundred years. Tree-ring dating of the flood damage produced evidence for 17 floods during the last 125 years, and for at least four floods prior to 1866. Most of the flood-scar dates from the historic period were found to coincide with the dates of major floods on the waterways from which they were collected, or from nearby streams. Flood damage to trees was found to be very abundant and accessible, with the most productive situation probably being that of seasonal streambeds in narrow deep canyons with relatively steep gradients. Amount of effort required to produce a flood chronology appears to be relatively small. Collections at most sites involved sampling from 1 to 5 trees, by extracting 3 to 6 increment cores from each visibly scarred tree, and 2 cores from undamaged trees to facilitate crossdating. At two sites larger collections were made, including 3 cross sections (<b>V-cuts),</b> which were very helpful in establishing dates of scars. For a given channel gradient, scars seem to develop only when the flood depth is above a particular threshold level. This threshold was defined by plotting scar height for scarred trees and flow depth for other floods not producing scars against the logarithm of channel slope. The scarred and unscarred individual points were separated into two well-defined fields, separated by a fairly straight line. Discriminant function analysis showed the separation to be highly significant, and classification of individual points as scarred or unscarred was usually correct. The implication of the scar threshold is that even in drainages with no gage or historical record at all, {{the presence or absence of}} flood scars on channelside trees would indicate the occurrence or nonoccurrence of floods of a certain depth over the lifetime of the trees. Basin analysis and field measurements of appropriate channel characteristics would allow this depth and the corresponding discharge to be calculated...|$|R
40|$|Two main {{species of}} dynastid or {{rhinoceros}} beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae: Tribe Oryctini) Oryctes elegans, and subspecies of Oryctes agamemnon, attack date palms causing significant and documented damage. Adults of O. elegans bore into the stalks of inflorescences and fruit bunches to feed, and oviposit in leaf axils where the larvae develop and may invade the trunk. Oryctes agamemnon larvae bore into frond bases, the trunk, and respiratory roots where their tunnelling may cause the palm to fall. It {{is difficult to}} distinguish the larvae of the two species in regions where both coexist. For control, annual servicing of palms includes cutting off old fronds at their bases using the correct technique which enables removal of larvae and their breeding places, {{and this may be}} integrated with light trapping for catching adults. Quarantine measures may hinder the spread of these pests to uninfested areas. In India, adults of a third species, O. rhinoceros, have been noted boring into the soft tissue of the growing point, and this species has also been reported from Yemen. Pheromone trapping is available for O. elegans but for effectiveness it requires the addition of fresh date palm tissue to the traps as a synergist. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae and the nematode Rhabditis sp. may have potential in integrated pest management but their possible natural occurrence in an area should be determined, prior to propagation and release. The pathogenic Oryctes Nudivirus, was successful against Oryctes rhinoceros in lowering its populations and damage to coconut palms when introduced into areas where this virus did not previously exist, and should be tested against date palm dynastids.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that the pressure pulsation excited by rotor-stator interaction in large pumps is strongly influenced by the radial gap between impeller and volute diffusers/tongues and the geometry of impeller blade at exit.

One impeller has a V-shaped cut at the blade&# 39;s exit, while the second has a straight exit (without the <b>V-cut).</b> The experimental findings showed that the high vibrations at the blade-passing frequency are primarily raised by high pressure pulsation due to improper gap design.

The density wedges were made by filling <b>V-cut</b> grooves in a high quality acrylic plastic with a carbon-epoxy dispersion. The density wedges have been produced at the frequencies of 0. 98. cy/mm and 0. 57 cy/mm. These wedges have effective diffuse density ranges between 0. 21 and 1. 18. Their density gradient has been varied from. 28 to 2. 58 density units per mm. The wedges were then tested for their practicality for use in image evaluation.

When the micro scale density wedges were imaged with a high surrounding density, the results were not significantly different from those obtained with the conventional step wedge. There are several drawbacks attributed to the V-groove design that are discussed. The results from the practical application tests, however, suggest that there is significant merit for the micro scale wedges for use in the study of chemical adjacency effects.

The presence of a <b>V-Cut</b> on the 2 nd land of the piston had beneficial and adverse effects on the general performance of the ring pack. The added volume decreased the 2 nd land pressure enough to avoid 2 nd ring radial collapse, but it also caused reverse flutter to occur at lower loads. Using a chamfer on the upper portion of the 3 rd land also had mixed results. Stability of the 2 nd ring was greatly improved with less radial collapse and an increase in average blowby flow. (cont.) The performance of the OCR design was primarily dependent on the gap area of the ring and the variation of groove clearances. The OCR groove drain holes were also deemed a necessity. This research, though theoretical in nature, brings together many ideas that offer solutions to common problems. Radial collapse, reverse flutter, OCR cost, and the use of drainage holes all are part of the attempts to improve the piston-ring-pack performance while driving down cost of production. Future experiments will put the theoretical conclusions to the test with the continuation of the pistons not installed in the engine due to the events previously explained. by Eric B. Senzer.

40|$|Synopsis Underground stone mining Is an {{emerging}} {{sector of the}} U. S. mining industry. As this expansion takes mines under deeper cover, and as more efficient mining methods are utilized, effective stone pillar design methods {{will become even more}} Important. Current design practices are examined and a discussion of safe mine layouts is presented as a first approach towards weighing the demands for increased production against increased risk. Risks to underground stone-mine workers include rib Instabilities, pillar failures and roof falls. Seventy-two stone-mine pillar designs were examined. Pillars with width to height ratios of less than 1. 5 appear more likely to fail when subjected to excessive stress levels. When width to height ratios fall below 1. 0 defects in the pillars, such as through-running discon 2, can have a significant influence on stability. Discontinuity persistence, dip, material properties and orientation are also important determining factors in pillar strength. During the past three years the number of active underground stone mines in the U. S. A. has ranged between 90 and 100. This number is expected to increase as the crushed stone industry responds to growing demands for its products. 1 As more of the industry moves to benefit from the advantages of underground mining production from underground stone mines is expected to increase above its current level of approximately 66 000 000 r/year. Parker 2 identified four advantages of underground mining operations: (1) surface developments, zoning laws and environmental concerns are often less of an issue; (2) stripping and restoration requirements are eliminated; (3) additional reserves are often available beneath the quarry floor, under pit slopes or under an adjoining property; and (4) space is created for secondary use. Underground mines enjoy the added benefits of work in a constant underground climate, rather than in the variable surface climate, minimization of community concerns by placement of the crushing, sizing and stowing operations underground and reduction of surface vibration concerns through smaller blasts. The drawbacks of underground mining include added health and safety hazards for the stone miners, whose health can suffer from increased exposure to falls of ground, airborne contaminants and fog in large underground openings. Injuries from falls of ground in stone mines have occasionally exceeded the incidence rates for other mineral resources mined underground. 3 Existing underground stone operations, by comparison with stone operations a decade ago, mine more stone at a faster rate and with larger equipment. Because of high demand mines face increased pressure to yield more stone per production blast. A majority of the miners use the <b>V-cut</b> blasting pattern, which limits the depth or pull for each shot to about 4 m. Therefore, to produce more stone, either the mines must work more faces or existing faces must be enlarged. The enlargement of underground openings poses problems in the maintenance o 22 ̆ 01 a strata stability, First, the widths of the mine entries partially control the amount of sag or deflection that any given roof beam can withstand before failure. This deflection can take pi ace quickly after an opening is excavated or much later as weathering processes form additional, thinner beams. Because increased deflection increases the potential for roof beam failure, {{there is a limit to}} how wide a room can safely be made. These limits depend on local geological and stress conditions and, to some extent, the cost effectiveness of roof-bolting. Given these room width limitations, underground stone mines have placed more attention on expansion of production through benching where mining thicknesses permit. The heights of rooms partially control the strength characteristics of adjacent pillars: as the room height increases for a given pillar width the pillar width-to-height ratio (w/h) decreases. In general, stone pillars are very...|$|E
