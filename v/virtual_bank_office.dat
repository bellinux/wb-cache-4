40|$|Abstract Background Advances in {{translational}} research {{have led to}} the need for well characterized biospecimens for research. The National Mesothelioma <b>Virtual</b> <b>Bank</b> is an initiative which collects annotated datasets relevant to human mesothelioma to develop an enterprising biospecimen resource to fulfill researchers' need. Methods The National Mesothelioma <b>Virtual</b> <b>Bank</b> architecture is based on three major components: (a) common data elements (based on College of American Pathologists protocol and National North American Association of Central Cancer Registries standards), (b) clinical and epidemiologic data annotation, and (c) data query tools. These tools work interoperably to standardize the entire process of annotation. The National Mesothelioma <b>Virtual</b> <b>Bank</b> tool is based upon the caTISSUE Clinical Annotation Engine, developed by the University of Pittsburgh in cooperation with the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid™ (caBIG™, see [URL]). This application provides a web-based system for annotating, importing and searching mesothelioma cases. The underlying information model is constructed utilizing Unified Modeling Language class diagrams, hierarchical relationships and Enterprise Architect software. Result The database provides researchers real-time access to richly annotated specimens and integral information related to mesothelioma. The data disclosed is tightly regulated depending upon users' authorization and depending on the participating institute that is amenable to the local Institutional Review Board and regulation committee reviews. Conclusion The National Mesothelioma <b>Virtual</b> <b>Bank</b> currently has over 600 annotated cases available for researchers that include paraffin embedded tissues, tissue microarrays, serum and genomic DNA. The National Mesothelioma <b>Virtual</b> <b>Bank</b> is a <b>virtual</b> biospecimen registry with robust translational biomedical informatics support to facilitate basic science, clinical, and {{translational research}}. Furthermore, it protects patient privacy by disclosing only de-identified datasets to assure that biospecimens can be made accessible to researchers. </p...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years (1973 – 1992), {{the total number}} of <b>banking</b> <b>offices</b> has grown from 40, 600 to 63, 900, an {{expansion}} of 57 percent. This exceeded the 21 percent growth in the adult (age 18 and older) population. The number of automated teller machines (ATMs) has grown even more rapidly, from fewer than 2, 000 to more than 90, 000 over the same period. As a total, there was one <b>banking</b> <b>office</b> or ATM for 3, 700 people in 1973. In 1992, there were three <b>banking</b> <b>offices</b> or ATMs for the same number of people. This increase effectively tripled the accessibility and convenience of bank-provided deposit services. In addition, ATMs are typically “open ” 24 hours a day, providing even more convenience than a traditional <b>banking</b> <b>office.</b> Ever since ATMs were first introduced in 1971, they have been touted as a potentially lower-cost alternative to the traditional branch <b>banking</b> <b>office.</b> The presumption of cost savings from expanded ATM use has in the past focused on scale economies. Substantial scale economies were indeed estimated for ATMs using special FDIC survey data for 1975 (Walker 1978, 1980). Thi...|$|R
