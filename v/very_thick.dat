5|$|A tulou is a large, {{enclosed}} and fortified earth building, rectangular or circular, with <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> load-bearing {{rammed earth}} walls {{between three and}} five stories high.|$|E
5|$|Despite harsh conditions, the {{vegetation}} {{on the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, vegetation has become <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> and has resulted in it becoming {{a breeding ground for}} waterfowl. There is large reed bed in the small lagoon area.|$|E
5|$|In {{mainland}} Europe (particularly Spain and Italy), {{hot chocolate}} is sometimes served <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> {{due to the}} use of a thickening agent such as cornstarch. Among the multiple thick forms of hot chocolate served in Europe is the Italian cioccolata calda.|$|E
6000|$|... "Forward!" [...] {{came the}} cry. [...] "Forward! We must drive them back! They must never reach the fort!" [...] And forward went our friends, {{and in a}} moment more Dave, Henry, and Barringford found {{themselves}} in the <b>very</b> <b>thickest</b> of the fray.|$|R
60|$|Caudal Appendages, very small, uniarticulate, {{blunt and}} rounded; tips bearing a few, <b>very</b> short, <b>thick</b> spines.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stop thief! Stop thief!' The cry {{is taken}} up by a hundred voices, and the crowd {{accumulate}} at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the <b>very</b> <b>thickest</b> of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, 'Stop thief! Stop thief!' ...|$|R
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, hot {{chocolate}} is consumed {{throughout the world}} and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America, the <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> cioccolata calda served in Italy and chocolate a la taza served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared {{hot chocolate}} can be purchased {{from a range of}} establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and cafes. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores.|$|E
5|$|Since 2012, Federal Cartridge Company {{produces}} a 5.7×28mm round under their American Eagle brand. Designated the AE5728A, this cartridge uses a 40-grain total metal jacket (TMJ) projectile, that is atypical {{in that it}} does not use a copper plated bullet; sectioned pictures show a <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> full copper jacket. The AE5728A casings are of FN manufacture, and the muzzle velocity is slightly lower than that of the SS197SR.|$|E
50|$|Hair: short, <b>thick,</b> <b>very</b> dense, {{smooth and}} rough.|$|R
60|$|In that {{encounter}} Sir Launcelot {{carried a}} spear that was wonderfully strong and tough. With it he ran with great fierceness into the <b>very</b> <b>thickest</b> of the press, {{and before he}} was checked he struck down five knights with that one spear. And likewise those three knights that were with him did such good service that all that flank of {{the party of the}} King of North Wales was thrown into great confusion and wist not what to do for to guard themselves against that fierce, furious onset.|$|R
60|$|At {{this offer}} of resistance, from {{all about him}} in the covert of the woods there went up the sound of laughter. A score of men, at least, for this was the <b>very</b> <b>thickest</b> of the ambush, joined in this cruel and {{untimely}} mirth. Then an arrow glanced over Selden's shoulder; and he leaped and ran a little back. Another dart struck quivering at his heel. He made for the cover. A third shaft leaped out right in his face, and fell short in front of him. And then the laughter was repeated loudly, rising and reechoing from different thickets.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> and robust; those close {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} <b>very</b> <b>thick,</b> sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the bottle}} of {{messages}} from the raft, on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore. Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the bottle on the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E
50|$|Knee roll: {{the padded}} part {{at the front}} of the English saddle's panel and sweat flap, helping to give the rider more leg support. It may be <b>very</b> wide and <b>thick,</b> <b>very</b> thin (a pencil-roll), or not present at all. Additional padding on the outside flap of the saddle is {{sometimes}} added for extra grip.|$|R
50|$|The coat is short, smooth, <b>thick,</b> <b>very</b> dense, {{and reaches}} the stomach.|$|R
30|$|Figure  8 B shows {{plots of}} the current {{intensity}} for the reduction reaction of the silver ions in the complex nanocrystals of Ag+-(DHQ) 2 AQN[*]→[*]Ag-(DHQ) 2 AQN to the scan rate and {{the root of the}} scan rate. Different from that observed in Figure  8 A for the reduction reaction of the ligands, here, the current intensity was not proportional to neither the scan rate nor the root of the scan rate. According to the theory of film-modified electrode[37, 38], this phenomenon could be attributed to that the electroactive thickness of the nanocrystals was not very thinner or <b>very</b> <b>thicker</b> as compared with that of the diffusion layer.|$|R
5|$|The British army {{began an}} unopposed landing {{at the north}} end of Lake George on the morning of July 6. Abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark, and found it {{recently}} deserted; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the French in their hasty departure. The bulk of the army landed, formed into columns, and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected Lake George to Lake Champlain, rather than along the portage trail, whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed. However, the wood was <b>very</b> <b>thick,</b> and the columns could not be maintained.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the mangrove whipray is <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> and oval in shape, measuring 0.9–1.0 times {{as wide as}} long. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at a broad angle on the snout tip. The medium-sized, widely spaced eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles. Between the long, thin nostrils is a short, broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The lower jaw is bow-shaped, and there are 0–5 papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth. The teeth are arranged in a quincunx pattern and number 40–50 rows in the upper jaw and 38–50 rows in the lower jaw. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the porcupine ray is evenly oval, almost {{as wide as}} long, and <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> at the center, giving it a domed appearance. The {{tip of the snout}} is rounded and barely protruding. The small eyes are closely followed by much larger spiracles. Between the narrow nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin; the posterior margin of the curtain is strongly fringed and overhangs the mouth. The mouth bears 3–5 papillae on the floor and prominent furrows at the corners. The area around the mouth, including the curtain, are heavily covered by more papillae. There are around 48 tooth rows in either jaw. The teeth are small and flattened. Five pairs of gill slits are located {{on the underside of the}} disc.|$|E
50|$|When struck, a ride cymbal makes a sustained, shimmering sound {{rather than}} the shorter, {{decaying}} sound of a crash cymbal. The most common diameter for a ride cymbal is about 20 in, but anything from 18 in to 22 in is standard. Smaller and thinner cymbals tend to be darker with more shimmer, while larger and thicker cymbals tend to respond better in louder volume situations, and conversely. Rides of up to 26 in and down to 16 in are readily available, and down to 8 in are currently manufactured. The <b>very</b> <b>thickest</b> and loudest tend to be about 22 inches, with larger rides restricted to medium and medium thin thicknesses.|$|R

5|$|Diamond-bearing rock {{is carried}} from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin {{volcanic}} eruptions. The magma {{for such a}} volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed— or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as volcanic pipes. The pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these pipes {{are open to the}} surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic pipes. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are <b>very</b> <b>thick,</b> and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes {{were built}} by eruptions of <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> light-coloured magma, {{including}} trachyte. Such magmas are typically too thick to move {{far from the}} vent it extrudes from, causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions, creating a characteristic dome-like shape. The thickness of the magma is attributed {{to high levels of}} silica, a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms. Edziza's domes reach heights of several hundred metres, and grew slowly and steadily for months to years. The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure, the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases, it can produce a pyroclastic flow, a super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice.|$|E
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E
60|$|From {{the very}} start, the Rough Riders {{were anxious to}} get into the fight, and the {{opportunity}} was not long in coming. From Florida the command was transported to Daiquiri, on the southern coast of Cuba, and then began the advance upon the city of Santiago, which brought on the engagement at La Guasima, followed by the thrilling battle of San Juan Hill, in which the Rough Riders distinguished themselves in a manner that will never be forgotten. In the <b>very</b> <b>thickest</b> of this fight was Colonel Roosevelt, urging his men forward to victory, regardless of the shot and shell falling upon all sides. A hero truly, and such heroes are not forgotten.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the numbers}} was a violin solo by a striking-looking man not much past forty, but with <b>very</b> gray <b>thick</b> hair. Not being afflicted {{with a taste for}} music, I let the system of noises drift past my ears while I {{regarded}} the man.|$|R
60|$|At length I beheld old Ready-Money Jack {{making his}} way into the <b>very</b> <b>thickest</b> of the throng; tearing it, as it were, apart, and {{enforcing}} peace, vi et armis. It was surprising to see the sudden quiet that ensued. The storm settled down at once into tranquillity. The parties, having no real grounds of hostility, were readily pacified, and in fact were a little at a loss to know why and how they had got by the ears. Slingsby was speedily stitched together again by his friend the tailor, and resumed his usual good-humour. Mrs. Hannah drew on one side, to plume her rumpled feathers; and old Christy, having repaired his damages, took her under his arm, and they swept back again to the Hall, ten times more bitter against mankind than ever.|$|R
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} has a <b>very</b> <b>thick,</b> distinctively wedge-shaped pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There {{is a short}} but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females. The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E
5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the upper edge of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or spots that run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
25|$|The fascia lata {{covering}} the TFL-muscle is <b>very</b> <b>thick,</b> {{which makes it}} a good donor site for closing defects. No need to turn the patient during surgery.|$|E
50|$|The {{ventral side}} of the abdomen is a uniform green. The epigynes of the females have unwrinkled, <b>very</b> short and <b>thick</b> scapes.|$|R
5000|$|The Spanish tortilla de patatas, or tortilla española {{in other}} Spanish-speaking countries, is a {{traditional}} and <b>very</b> popular <b>thick</b> omelette containing sliced potatoes sautéed in cooking oil. It often includes sliced onions (tortilla de patata con cebolla) and less commonly other additional fillings, such as cheese, bell peppers, and cooked diced ham.|$|R
