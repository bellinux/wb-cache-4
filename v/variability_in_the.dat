40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to present an {{efficient}} numerical strategy for studying {{the influence of the}} material parameters on problems involving 3 D assemblies of composite parts with contact and friction. This approach is based on the multiscale LATIN method with domain decomposition and its ability to reuse the solution of one problem (for a particular set of parameters) to solve many similar problems, each associated with another set of parameters. The presentation of the proposed calculation method will be followed by two sample applications, one with <b>variabilities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cohesive interface laws and <b>the</b> other with <b>variabilities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> damageable behavior laws, which characterize the composite material...|$|R
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{prospective study}} examined the relation between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and specific aspects of children's cognitive functioning at age five. Antenatal maternal state-anxiety was measured around the 16 th week of pregnancy. Children's neurocognitive functioning was examined using a simple reaction time (RT) task, and a choice RT task. Multiple regression analyses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> total sample (N?=? 922) showed that antenatal anxiety {{was positively related to}} children's intra-individual <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> RT <b>in</b> <b>the</b> simple task. <b>In</b> a subsample (n?=? 100) of women with state-anxiety scores above the 90 th percentile, antenatal anxiety was positively associated with mean RT and intra-individual <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> RT <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incompatible trials of the choice RT task. In addition, in this subsample of highly anxious mothers we found a significant positive association in boys but not in girls, between prenatal maternal anxiety and intra-individual <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> RT <b>in</b> <b>the</b> simple task.

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decompression outcome through the lung function. The first variable is individual susceptibility.

Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> degree of tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson {{due to lack of}} evidence.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight {{and reduced the}} solar energy reaching {{the surface of the}} Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly according to analysis of the strontium–niobium–palladium elemental ratios. The Emperor Seamounts were active for at least 46 million years, with the oldest lava dated to the Cretaceous Period, followed by another 39 million years of activity along the Hawaiian segment of the chain, totaling 85 million years. Data demonstrate vertical <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of strontium present in both the alkalic (early stages) and tholeitic (later stages) lavas.

5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E

40|$|Size and shape, {{although}} intuitively simple concepts, {{are difficult}} to define mathematically in a biologically meaningful way. Darroch and Mosimann (1985, Biometrika, 72 : 241 - 252) have proposed definitions of size and shape that incorporate the concept of geometric similarity, and have developed principal components of shape and total <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> shape based on these definitions. We adopt these definitions of size and shape. Using a related definition of the principal components of shape, we characterize the dependence on the size variable of the principal components of shape and total <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> shape.
