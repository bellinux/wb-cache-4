Davis Lab, located within the museum next to the Pulliam Great Hall, is a space where visitors can virtually browse the museum's collection and experiment with new technology. [...] In addition to its focus on technology and school outreach, the museum provides classes, lectures, and film series, as well as ongoing tours of the collections, historic properties, and grounds.

40|$|A less-frequently {{discussed}} parallel-linguistic {{issue is}} the parallel language of visuals and numerals: the diagrams, tables, models, mathematical signs and different symbols that students {{have to deal with}} in their reading and writing.

For new students, {{it can be difficult to}} grasp how visuals and numerals can have different meanings in different contexts, such as academic disciplines. For teachers, the disciplinary use of the visuals and numerals is often so ingrained that they may have difficulty seeing the problems that students face. Drawing on the theoretical framework of social semiotics and the neo-Vygotskian perspective, this article shows how new students of economics in Sweden encounter a multimodal academic literacy.
