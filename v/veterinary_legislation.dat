40|$|The {{sociology}} of professions literature would {{predict that the}} contemporary state would not allow groups to continue unregulated or unreformed. However, this is indeed {{the case with the}} UK <b>veterinary</b> profession, with <b>legislation</b> dating back to 1966. Using an interdisciplinary analysis of published literature and reports, this paper assesses whether wider social, political and ethical dynamics can better explain this intriguing anomaly. We conclude with critical implications for the {{sociology of}} the professions. Furthermore, we argue that continuing to ignore the veterinary profession, and animals more generally, in sociological research will result in an impoverished and partial understanding of contemporary healthcare and occupations...|$|R

40|$|Resumé v anglickém jazyce The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} and analyze <b>veterinary</b> care <b>legislation</b> in the Czech Republic, in the European Union and international law. The content of the thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter is brief and describes {{the historical development of}} veterinary care. The second chapter covers animal welfare. The third chapter deals with international law and veterinary care, which is dominated by agreements concluded by the Council of Europe, the intergovernmental organization. One of the parts of the third chapter focuses on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The fourth chapter tries to map the sources of law and the institutions of veterinary care in the European Union. One of the parts of this chapter deals with bird flu. The fifth chapter is comprehensive and provides veterinary care description in the Czech Republic. This chapter tries to approach a more detailed explanation of the Veterinary Act, the implementing rules and regulations related to veterinary care. Another section of the thesis consist of an introduction, conclusion, abstract and key words, list of abbreviations, list of sources and supplements...|$|R
50|$|The European Union (commission of European communities, 2008) has {{a number}} of {{directives}} such as the Directive of Plant Health (2000/29/CE) charged with the prevention of the introduction of invasive species; directives about protection of nature (79/409/CEE and 92/43/CEE) that prohibit the introduction of species that could constitute a threat to indigenous species; the directive setting the framework for water (2000/60/CE) that calls for the member states to maintain a good ecological state in the waters to which it applies; and the directive setting the framework for marine strategy (2008/56/CE). It has a <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> that can apply to the vectors of illness in animals. There also exists a law about the commerce of wild fauna and flora (CE) advice number 338/97, the law (CE) advice number 708/2007 about the use of exotic species. In addition the LIFE Program provides help to projects for the control and eradication of invasive species.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Compliance {{with animal}} welfare and {{environmental}} health principles and <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> {{has an impact on}} {{the quantity and quality of}} the animal products produced. The quantity and quality of livestock and livestock products influences demand and prices and has an effect on income from the livestock industry and ultimately on gross domestic product (GDP) and food security. Environmental health on the other hand influences either negatively (in poor) or positively (in good) environmental health situations thereby has impact on the quantity and quality of livestock and livestock products and the level of contribution to GDP and food security. Both animal welfare {{and environmental health}} principles are well adhered to when adequate <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> provisions are implemented and enforced. Good, enforceable <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> and good veterinary governance are prerequisites for ensuring secure sanitary conditions and food safety and preventing the spread of animal diseases, and ultimately they enhance incomes and ensure the availability of wholesome food, thereby contributing to GDP and food security. It is therefore important to integrate these three components, namely animal welfare, environmental health and <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation,</b> in livestock production and marketin...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the Law on the {{veterinary}} activities from 2005 and its amendments 2006 - 2016 In {{the second part}} of the report an analysis is made of the philosophic nature and the main principles regulated by the Law on the {{veterinary activities}} from 2005 in their antiepizootic part. The pros and cons of the approaches used in European and world practice in <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> drafting are highlighted. One of the approaches includes only basic and constant principles of <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation,</b> while the other presents all regulatory norms with dynamic character that require periodic updating of the legislative basis. An analysis also is made of the dynamics of the amendments and additions of certain articles and paragraphs of the Law on the veterinary activities for the period 2006 - 2016 and their adequacy to the antiepizootic activities is assessed. An attempt is made to analyze the interrelationship and interdependence between the legal regulations of additions and amendments to the LVA and the material-technical, organizational and structural conditions for their practical implementation. A necessity for elaboration of a new law on veterinary activities and its adoption by the National Assembly by the end of 2017 is motivated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The global dairy industry, the {{predominant}} pathogens causing mastitis, {{our understanding of}} mastitis pathogens and the host response to intramammary infection are changing rapidly. This paper aims to discuss changes {{in each of these}} aspects. Globalisation, energy demands, human population growth and climate change all affect the dairy industry. In many western countries, control programs for contagious mastitis have been in place for decades, resulting in a decrease in occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus mastitis and an increase in the relative impact of Streptococcus uberis and Escherichia coli mastitis. In some countries, Klebsiella spp. or Streptococcus dysgalactiae are appearing as important causes of mastitis. Differences between countries in <b>legislation,</b> <b>veterinary</b> and laboratory services and farmers' management practices affect the distribution and impact of mastitis pathogens. For pathogens that have traditionally been categorised as contagious, strain adaptation to human and bovine hosts has been recognised. For pathogens that are often categorised as environmental, strains causing transient and chronic infections are distinguished. The genetic basis underlying host adaptation and mechanisms of infection is being unravelled. Genomic information on pathogens and their hosts and improved knowledge of the host's innate and acquired immune responses to intramammary infections provide opportunities to expand our understanding of bovine mastitis. These developments will undoubtedly contribute to novel approaches to mastitis diagnostics and control. </p...|$|R
40|$|The project {{provided}} {{the assistance of}} an expert in ostrich production and marketing, who visited Namibia between 15 March and 11 April 1992. Following discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Veterinary Department, the Department of Wildlife, Conservation and Research, ostrich producers, processors and feed suppliers, and visits to ostrich farms, research stations, a tannery and an abattoir, a report was prepared analysing {{the current state of}} the industry, and the policy options open to your Government for its further development. Ostrich farming began in the early 1980 s and has expanded very rapidly. Government monitoring and control has developed piecemeal and involves three departments in two ministries. The collection and analysis of statistics in respect of the industry is, however, inadequate. The main product at the present time is fertile eggs for hatching, and the main market the USA. The inflated price paid for eggs - an egg for export is worth as much as a 14 -month old bird on the local market - is an incentive to increase production of eggs alone as rapidly as possible. The market for eggs will not, however, be unlimited and their export is helping create a situation whereby the purchasing countries will soon be able to provide their own stock. The inflated market for eggs is detrimental to the long-term future of the ostrich industry in Namibia. The ostrich industry is currently growing much faster than would be possible without egg exports, but it is developing without the equipment and expertise for incubating and rearing large numbers of chicks on which a long-term industry will need to be based. This concentration on the export of reproductive material has severely curtailed the operation of secondary industries and the development of product marketing. On the other hand, Namibia can anticipate a significant share of a long-term market if the industry in the country develops correctly in the next few years. It must, however, be ready to face competition from many other countries. Moreover, a collapse in prices, due to a falling demand for reproductive material, would have a severe effect on production, unless measures are taken to promote investment in long-term capacity for the production and processing of slaughter birds. The immediate challenge is to provide for the transition between egg export and such production. It is therefore recommended that your Government recognise the ostrich industry as part of a broader agricultural sector and allocate resources, particularly in the research and <b>veterinary</b> areas, accordingly. <b>Legislation</b> should be enacted to replace the present ad hoc arrangement of exemptions to laws and regulations, and a Species Management Plan needs to be prepared in order to avoid any problems with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is recommended that a policy be adopted to promote the gradual passage from the live export market to a rearing and processing industry, by the imposition of an export quota linked to the industry's annual reproductive capacity, thereby encouraging investment in incubation and rearing technology for the birds that are not exported. Great care needs to be taken in establishing the quota level...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{scientific}} analysis is to trace the genesis and development of <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> from 1881 to 2015, focusing on its anti-epizootic aspects. For this study the historical and dialectical and systematic approach and analysis were applied. The {{first part of the}} analysis covers the period until 2005 – the stage before the accession of the country to EU. There the first legislative acts from the post-liberation period 1897 - 1906 are analyzed, which {{marked the beginning of the}} regulated anti-epizootic activity, delegated as a primary duty of the state institutions. Special attention is paid to the Law on sanitary-veterinary service from 1924, elaborated by Prof. G. Pavlov, which laid down the foundations of the Public Veterinary Medicine in Bulgaria. An analysis is made of the basic principles in the legislative basis in the period of centralized planning (1945 - 1990) and the period of transition to market economy (1990 - 2004) before the accession of Bulgaria to the EU. The retrospective analysis of all laws from this 120 -year period shows that <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> has developed in line with the socio-political and economic conditions in the country, but it has always been in accordance with the international legal norms. The second part of the analysis, which includes the period following the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the EU, will interpret the organizational and legal, structural, professional, deontological, financial economic aspects and problems which occurred after the establishment of Bulgarian Food Safety Agency in order to improve the system related to animal health and food safety...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between the incidence of salmonellas in pigs and feeding stuffs in England and Wales and in Denmark. In Denmark there is <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> requiring the sterilization of imported and home produced feed ingredients of animal origin. There is no such legislation in England and Wales. In Denmark 0 · 3 % of resterilized imported meat and bone meal was contaminated with salmonellas. This compared with 23 % of meat and bone meal in England and Wales and 20 - 27 % of other ingredients of animal origin. In England and Wales salmonellas were isolated from 7 % of caecal samples and 6 % of lymph node samples, while in Denmark they were isolated from 3 % of caecal samples and 4 % of lymph node samples. In England and Wales 25 serotypes were found in both pigs and feeds and these included nearly all the most prevalent human pathogens. In Denmark {{four of the six}} serotypes in pigs had been found in resterilized feed. One notable difference between the two studies was the very wide range of serotypes found in pigs in England and Wales and the narrow range in Denmark. A second was that Salmonella typhimurium formed 15 % of all Salmonella strains isolated from pigs in England and Wales, and 60 % of those in Denmark...|$|E
40|$|After {{the signing}} of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the European Union and its {{ratification}} by all member states, Albania has made serious efforts towards the harmonization and approximation of its legislation, to align it more with the standards of the member countries. Setting of new game rules makes Albanian society walk safer in a process of integration, where the EU principles are inserted even better in domestic laws. Core legislation, food safety and veterinary fields, are some prerequisites that Albania should meet in its way towards full membership in the EU. For a long time now, Albania has been establishing new food and feed standards and all its actions are in full compliance with EU regulations and directives. In addition to adequate policies to enforce better the current legislation in respect with an effective consumer protection, it is worth mentioning full reforming and streamlining of functioning institutions in the framework of food safety. The <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> is a main discipline of veterinary medicine regulating veterinary service relations with food business operators. It establishes legal criteria and standards for animal health and welfare protection, public health, food safety and other related areas. ‘Acquis communautaire’ refers to the EU’s total body of legislation, i. e. everything from treaties to directives, the case-law of the Court of Justice, declarations and international agreements, etc. When a new member country is to be admitted to the EU, the point of departure is that it must satisfy the entire body of rules and regulations, i. e. the ‘acquis communautaire’ or the ‘acquis’ as it is also known, from the first day of membership. As a candidate country Albania should accept acquis communautaire before joining the European Union. Currently, Albania is undergoing the process of harmonization, approximation and transposition of acquis to the domestic legislation...|$|E
40|$|The South African {{food safety}} and animal food control systems are {{developed}} and enforced by three government departments: Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Animal health relies heavily on veterinary drugs for controlling pests and diseases. Movement of animals and animal products, is also a potential method of transmission of pests and diseases within and between countries. Human health is inextricably linked to animal health and production through zoonotic and foodborne hazards. By eating animal products (meat, milk, eggs, etc.), humans are exposed to microbiological hazards and chemical residues. This paper will describe and critically review the relevant legislation and regulations {{as well as their}} implementation, highlighting discrepancies and overlaps. Four working groups of eight key informants performed a gap analysis and defined actions and steps to remedy the gaps for: 1) Legislation for the registration for veterinary drugs and pesticides in animal feeds; 2) Animal health legislation, including veterinary public health, biosecurity and animal diseases; 3) Microbiological hazards and chemical residues in food of animal origin; and 4) Laboratory capacity for residues and animal diseases surveillance and monitoring. There is a shortage of academic institutions devoted to teach applied regulatory toxicology and aquatic animal health. Furthermore, due to duplication of activities from two authorities regulating the registration of veterinary medicines and stock remedies, there is poor utilization of scare skills for surveillance, monitoring and evaluators responsible for human food safety evaluation of drugs intended for food animals. Food safety of animal products is fragmented as a result of it not being under only one Ministry. Different aspects of legislations fall under the three departments. Lines of responsibility are not always well understood as they sometimes overlap and inconsistently applied. There are also a number of stakeholders involved at local, regional and international level. International standards in line with Codex, World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), are followed, in line with international obligations. National governments and private sector standards are applied by producers and processors of animal derived food. At local level there are provincial and municipal regulations for implementation of National directives, as well as private standards of supermarkets, butchers, dairies and other retailers of animal derived foods. In conclusion, South Africa needs to have one broad <b>veterinary</b> <b>legislation</b> which covers animal disease control, registration and control of veterinary drugs (including insecticides manufactured for administration to animals), food safety including food protection, prevention and elimination of zoonoses and aspects of laboratory animal facilities and diagnostic laboratories, health education and extension...|$|E
