50|$|A {{wheel speed}} sensor or <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> (VSS) {{is a type of}} tachometer. It is a sender device used for reading the speed of a vehicle's wheel rotation. It usually {{consists}} of a toothed ring and pickup.|$|E
5000|$|Auto start/stop: Various sensor inputs {{from around}} the <b>vehicle</b> (<b>speed</b> <b>sensors,</b> {{steering}} angle, air conditioning on/off, engine temperature) are collated via the CAN bus {{to determine whether the}} engine can be shut down when stationary for improved fuel economy and emissions.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{benefit of}} this {{approach}} is an integrated and factory-standard installation. Many original systems also contain a gyrocompass and/or an accelerometer and may accept input from the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> and reverse gear engagement signal output, thereby allowing them to navigate via dead reckoning when a GPS signal is temporarily unavailable. [...] However, the costs can be considerably higher than other options.|$|R
5000|$|A {{car on a}} {{slippery}} surface can slide a long way if the driver [...] "locks" [...] the wheels in stationary positions by pressing hard on the brakes. Anti-lock braking systems use wheel <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> and <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> to determine {{if any of the}} wheels have stopped turning. The ABS Module then briefly releases pressure to that wheel to allow the wheel to begin turning again. Anti-lock brakes can be much more effective than cadence braking which is essentially a non-automatic technique for doing the same thing.|$|R
5000|$|The SuperMID is an enthusiast/hobbyist trip computer, {{designed}} originally for the Toyota Prius, {{although it}} may be used in any vehicle which has an electric fuel injection system and digital <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor.</b> The SuperMID interfaces directly to the engine ECU or sensors, rather than using a standard OBDII connector.|$|E
50|$|The OBDuino {{project was}} started in 2008 based on the MPGuino project, {{with the desire to}} simplify wiring to the vehicle (i.e. using the {{standard}} OBD-II socket rather than directly wiring to the vehicle's fuel injection system and digital <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor)</b> and to access the wide range of engine management data available using OBD.|$|E
50|$|The TPS sensor {{along with}} the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> are the two main inputs for most TCUs. Older {{transmissions}} use this to determine engine load, {{with the introduction of}} drive-by-wire technology, this is often a shared input between the ECU and TCU. The input is used to determine the optimum time and characteristics for a gear change according to load on the engine. The rate of change is used to determine whether a downshift is appropriate for overtaking, for example, the value of the TPS is also continually monitored during the journey and shift programmes are changed accordingly (economy, sport mode, etc.). The TCU can also reference this information with the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> to determine vehicle acceleration and compare this with a nominal value; if the actual value is much higher or lower (such as driving uphill or towing a trailer) the transmission will change its gearshift patterns to suit the situation.|$|E
50|$|According to Mitsubishi, the Lancer Evolution {{uses its}} four-wheel drive system {{to improve the}} handling, rather than simply to {{increase}} traction. Super AYC acts like a limited slip differential to optimise the Lancer’s handling during hard driving. It improves cornering performance by transferring torque between the rear wheels. It also works harmoniously with the ACD, which was introduced on the Evolution VII. Mitsubishi's Sports ABS system is used to enhance the steering control during hard driving. The Sport ABS ECU uses inputs from steering angle, lateral G and <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensors</b> to individually apportion braking pressure {{to each of the}} four wheels.|$|R
50|$|In land vehicles, an IMU can be {{integrated}} into GPS based automotive navigation systems or vehicle tracking systems, giving the system a dead reckoning capability {{and the ability to}} gather as much accurate data as possible about the <b>vehicle's</b> current <b>speed,</b> turn rate, heading, inclination and acceleration, in combination with the <b>vehicle's</b> wheel <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> output and, if available, reverse gear signal, for purposes such as better traffic collision analysis.|$|R
30|$|If the {{interacting}} {{vehicle is}} overtaking the test <b>vehicle,</b> the relative <b>speed</b> {{is added to}} the test vehicle’s speed; else, it is subtracted from the test <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>speed.</b> V-box and <b>sensor</b> setup run independently and collect data at similar frequencies. Hence, initial readings (starting datum) of both the equipments are synchronized by matching with a global time.|$|R
5000|$|The mpguino {{is another}} Arduino-based trip computer, and is mainly limited to fuel usage measurement. It {{may be used}} in any vehicle which has an {{electric}} fuel injection system and digital <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor.</b> The mpguino links directly to these sensors so it doesn't require an OBD2 interface. It can report instant and tank MPG, remaining miles till the tank is empty etc. The mpguino is available in kit form from several suppliers.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003 Ford {{revised the}} 4R70W {{transmission}} with a stronger ring gear that had 24 lugs, {{as opposed to}} 6, for the output shaft sensor (OSS) to read off of, a new torque converter, a revised front pump assembly, and a <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor</b> (VSS) that compliments the OSS to improve shift quality and efficiency. These improvements allowed the 4R75W to handle more power while being more efficient and economical. While not used on all 2003 model year vehicles, the 4R75W/E transmissions eventually replaced the 4R70W/E.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} {{deployed}} with an earlier two-stage switch labeled “Auto-Sport”, with a later modification of “Auto-Soft-Mid-Hard”. Some variations used a dial to specifically select {{the level of}} hardness to the driver’s desires. For most driving situations, the “Auto” selection was recommended. When the system was activated, an indicator light reflected the suspension setting selected.The system components consisted of a control switch, indicator light, four shock absorbers, shock absorber control actuator, shock absorber control computer, <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor,</b> stop lamp switch, with a throttle position sensor and {{a steering angle sensor}} on TEMS three stage systems only.|$|E
30|$|But {{despite the}} {{application}} diversity, these sensors have some disadvantages. As an example, {{installation and maintenance}} of ILDs is expensive. Also ILDs cannot identify vehicles that are stopped or slow moving and only count the vehicles in the one point. Furthermore for measuring traffic flow or <b>vehicles</b> <b>speed,</b> several ILD <b>sensors</b> are needed [5].|$|R

5000|$|From {{at least}} 1991 onward, all S10 Blazers and Jimmies came with 4 wheel {{anti-lock}} brakes as standard equipment. The {{first two years}} of the ABS system had axleshafts with pressed-on ABS toner rings which was eliminated during {{the latter half of the}} 1993 model year (rear ABS control was done via the <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor).</b> The 2.8L V6 was dropped as an option on the S-10 Blazer and Jimmy in 1990, though it was offered as an option on the S-10 and S-15/Sonoma pickups through 1993). A 5-speed manual transmission remained standard through 1994, but only with the TBI engine. Only the two 262 cuin L engines were offered as options - the base TBI and the CPI (introduced in 1992 for the S-series and Chevrolet Astro minivans; the latter had the [...] "Vortec" [...] logo on the intake plenum).|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) is an automobile technology which electronically [...] "connects" [...] the accelerator {{pedal to the}} throttle, replacing a mechanical linkage. [...] A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain or engine control module (PCM or ECM). The ECM {{is a type of}} electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required throttle position by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the accelerator pedal position sensors, engine speed sensor, <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor,</b> and cruise control switches. The electric motor is then used to open the throttle valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a new {{application}} of vehicular sensing: detecting and reporting the slippery road conditions. We describe a system and associated algorithm to monitor vehicle skidding events using smartphones and OBD-II (On board Diagnostics) adaptors. This system, {{which we call}} the VehSense, gathers data from smartphone inertial <b>sensors</b> and <b>vehicle</b> wheel <b>speed</b> <b>sensors,</b> and processes the data to monitor slippery road conditions in real-time. Specifically, two speed readings are collected: 1) ground speed, which is estimated by vehicle acceleration and rotation, and 2) wheel speed, which is retrieved from the OBD-II interface. The mismatch between these two speeds is used to infer a skidding event. Without tapping into vehicle manufactures' proprietary data (e. g., antilock braking system), VehSense is compatible {{with most of the}} passenger vehicles, and thus can be easily deployed. We evaluate our system on snow-covered roads at Buffalo, and show that it can detect vehicle skidding effectively. Comment: 2017 IEEE 85 th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC 2017 -Spring...|$|R

40|$|The optical head is {{a linear}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>speed</b> <b>sensor.</b> Its action {{is based on}} image {{analysis}} of the moving road surface. A special algorithm converts it on the speed signal. Because {{the image of a}} road is analyzed, therefore the change in structure of the road surface causes change of the signal from the optical head. Therefore, for each type of surface, it is necessary to calibrate the optical head. Calibration consists of measuring, using an optical head, the length of the measurement distance, which was previously precisely measured with another reference device. Based on these two values the calibration factor is calculated, and entered afterwards in the optical head control software. This optical head is used in several the road tests, and its speed measurement function is used in the measurement of vehicle acceleration, braking distance, the total vehicle road load. This device, connected to the recorder, is also used in research on motion parameters of vehicle under real driving conditions. During these tests may occur the change of the road surface, therefore it is particularly important to know the influence of road surface structure on the signal from the optical head.

40|$|Vehicle {{communications}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular, propelled by navigation safety requirements and by the investments of car manufacturers and Public Transport Authorities. The primary VANET's goal is to increase road safety.
