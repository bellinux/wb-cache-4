This paper will present the results of aging the Improved Performance Space Motor-II/Payload Assist Module-Delta II (IPSM-II/PAM-DII) space motor components. Ballistic and mechanical properties of the space aged main propellant, igniter propellant, and ignition system were compared with similar data from preflight and ground aged samples. Mechanical properties of the composite materials and bonded joints used in the motor case, insulation, liner, nozzle, exit cone, and skirt were similarly evaluated. The space aging results will be compared to data collected in a ground based vacuum aging program on similar components. The operation of the vacuum actuated <b>venting</b> <b>valve</b> and pressure actuated resealing of the container will also be addressed. The materials tested showed no significant changes due to space aging.

40|$|Boric acid is a {{critical}} component in the reactivity control of pressurized water reactors generally being necessary to maintain a plant subcritical. In 1995, the B&W Owner's Group recognized a possible mechanism for the accumulation of low boron concentration coolant (deborate), potentially complicating recovery from certain small break LOCAs. The BWOG established a program to quantify concerns and determine prudent procedure or equipment adjustments. This report is the final report in a series dealing {{with the issue of}} boron dilution. Results of earlier studies and BWOG actions taken are reviewed. Analytical results, developed during the past year, on <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> performance and long-term SBLOCA recovery are presented. The potential for rapid core reactivity insertion, by restart or bump of the main coolant pumps forcing deborate into the core, is shown to be procedurally restricted to safe conditions. Natural circulation restart is shown to provide insufficient core reactivity insertion rates, removing concerns over core or plant damage. It is demonstrated that <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> remain open and flowing during both system refill and the restart of natural circulation. <b>Vent</b> <b>valve</b> operation mixes highly borated water with deborate at the downcomer entrance, again mitigating core reactivity insertion concerns. It is concluded that: issues regarding deborate accumulation within the reactor coolant system during small break LOCA are resolved; B&W-designed plants may operate without expectation of difficulties during SBLOCA recovery. iii 47 - 5006624 - 0...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{specifications}} {{of the components}} of the vent vale were optimally determined in order to enhance the performance of the <b>vent</b> <b>valve.</b> Design objective was to minimize fuel leakage while satisfying the design constraints on the performance indices. To obtain the optimum solution based on real experiments, several design techniques available in PIAnO, a commercial PIDO tool, were used. First, an orthogonal array was used to generate training design points and then real experiments were performed to measure the experimental data at the training design points. Next, Kriging metamodels for the objective function and design constraints were generated using the experimental data. Finally, a genetic algorithm was employed to obtain the optimization results using the Kriging models. Fuel leakage of the optimized <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> was found to be reduced by 95. 8 % compared to that of the initial one while satisfying all the design constraints.

40|$|A reduced {{dynamical}} model describing {{temperature stratification}} effects driven by natural convection in a liquid hydrogen cryogenic fuel tank has been developed. It accounts for cryogenic propellant loading, storage, and unloading in {{the conditions of}} normal, increased, and micro- gravity. The model involves multiple horizontal control volumes in both liquid and ullage spaces. Temperature and velocity boundary layers at the tank walls {{are taken into account}} by using correlation relations. Heat exchange involving the tank wall is considered by means of the lumped-parameter method. By employing basic conservation laws, the model takes into consideration the major multi-phase mass and energy exchange processes involved, such as condensation-evaporation of the hydrogen, as well as flows of hydrogen liquid and vapor in the presence of pressurizing helium gas. The model involves a liquid hydrogen feed line and a tank ullage <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> for pressure control. The temperature stratification effects are investigated, including in the presence of <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> oscillations. A simulation of temperature stratification effects in a generic cryogenic tank has been implemented in Matlab and results are presented for various tank conditions...|$|R
50|$|The Atlas rocket {{suffered}} a structural failure 58 seconds after launch. The vehicle {{at that time}} was at approximately an altitude of 30,000 feet (9.1 km) and 11,000 feet (3.4 km) down range when it was passing through Max Q and all telemetry signals suddenly ceased. Because the day was rainy and overcast with thick clouds, the booster had been out of sight from T+26 seconds and it was impossible to see what happened. A number of Mercury engineers had voiced their objection to launching on July 29 because of the weather precluding visual coverage of the flight. Some observers claim to have heard an explosion, but this could not be verified. The capsule continued transmitting until it impacted the ocean, approximately 6 miles downrange. Subsequent salvage attempts dredged it and the Atlas's booster engines and LOX <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> from the ocean floor.

40|$|Fuel leakage has {{the risk}} of being ignited by {{external}} ignition sources, and therefore it is important to detect any fuel leakage before the departure of the aircraft. Currently, there are no fuel leak detection systems installed on commercial aircrafts, to detect fuel tank leakage, while {{only a small number of}} more recent aircraft, have a fuel monitoring system, that generates a fuel leak-warning message in cockpit in the case of fuel imbalance between the tanks. The approach proposed in this paper requires the fuel vent ports on the wings to be replaced with fuel <b>vent</b> <b>valves,</b> which can be controlled to be in open or close position. The fuel <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> will be in close position, when certain conditions are fulfilled (all the related fuel valves closed, pumps not operating, etc.), the fuel tank ullage area is then pressurized to 4 psi and the rate of change of the pressure is measured over a period.

Further experiments show that if the fuel tank is pressurized to higher pressures, a fuel leak can be detected sooner...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of micro hydropower plant {{is intended for}} providing electricity at Alue Dua village in North Aceh. A problem associated {{with the implementation of}} the micro-hydropower plant in the village is that the water flowrate of the run-of-river is varied at 117 litres per second during the wet season and at 36 litres per second during the dry season. This variation affects the speed of the water turbine and the capacity of power generated by its generator. Therefore to stabilize the output power and voltage of the generator {{during the course of the}} year, this paper aims to regulate the intake water flowing into the water turbine by controlling the opening <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> from 0 % up to 100 % and controlling the electrical load connected to the generator.

40|$|The Advanced Shuttle Upper Stage (ASUS) concept {{addresses}} {{safety concerns}} associated. with cryogenic stages by launching empty, and filling on ascent. The ASUS employs a rapid chill and fill concept. A spray bar {{is used to}} completely chill the tank before fill, allowing the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> to be closed during the fill process. The first tests of this concept, using a flight size (not flight weight) tank. were conducted at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) {{during the summer of}} 2000. The objectives of the testing were to: 1) demonstrate that a flight size tank could be filled in roughly 5 minutes to accommodate the shuttle ascent window, and 2) demonstrate a no-vent fill of the tank. A total of 12 tests were conducted. Models of the test facility fill and vent systems, as well as the tank, were constructed. The objective of achieving tank fill in 5 minutes was met during the test series. However, liquid began to accumulate in the tank before it was chilled.
