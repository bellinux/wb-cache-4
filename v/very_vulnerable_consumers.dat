40|$|Research on <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> remains unfailing in macromarketing {{and social}} marketing. Yet {{it is unclear}} how to operationalize the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> by {{demographics}} and further to this it is rarely touched how the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> defined by different measures make decision when choosing the place to shop especially in pharmacy retailing sector. The authors conduct a comparative study of variously-defined <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> for their shopping store types in an urban Chinese city to investigate how people with distinct backgrounds develop their decision making rules and choose different types of retail pharmacies. This paper casts light on customer heterogeneity associated with different dimensions of vulnerability by using consumer demographics, and indicates that four dimensions of vulnerability exist as cognitive capability, social relations, behaviors, and the institutional protection in health-related sector. These four aspects of vulnerability {{play a significant role in}} identifying different shop selection patterns. Findings suggest that efforts to boost store patronage targeting on various consumer groups should have different strategies to reach consumers' mindsets. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> can be involved in transformative service design and how this approach may enhance the design of such services. The study also analyzes how co-design with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> differs from existing user involvement processes with the purpose of developing a co-design framework. Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach was employed, with six high schools in Australia identified as sites to conduct co-design sessions for a school-based alcohol education program. Adolescents were invited to review and (re) design an existing alcohol education program. Findings – The study indicates that co-design with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> cannot be approached in the same way as conventional user involvement processes. Based on the insights generated from six co-design sessions as well as the examination of user involvement and co-design literature, the authors propose a six-step co-design framework. The six steps comprise resourcing, planning, recruiting, sensitizing, facilitation and evaluation. Research limitations/implications – The co-design framework illustrates important differences to conventional user involvement processes. However, the generalizability of the research findings is limited to a specific study setting and a narrowly defined sample. Future research in a different setting is needed to further validate the presented findings. Practical implications – For service design practice, this study provides guidelines on how co-design activities with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> can be effectively resourced, planned, recruited, sensitized, facilitated and evaluated. The framework outlines how co-design may be applied so that <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> can become empowered participants during the design process. Originality/value – This research contributes to the knowledge in transformative service research – a priority in service research – and service design by extending the boundaries of our understanding of processes and tools for the involvement of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> in transformative service design...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to examine}} the service {{experience}} in an online support community of consumers {{to understand the nature}} of social support and how it is experienced and enacted by <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers.</b> Design/methodology/approach: A netnographic study was conducted to examine vulnerable consumers’ participation in an online support group for weight management. The Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) program was used, and additionally data were coded using open coding. A hybrid approach to data analysis was undertaken using inductive and deductive methods. Findings: The findings suggest online social support groups can be used as an online “third place” to support <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers,</b> with <b>vulnerable</b> groups engaging with the online support group differently than those in the normal weight group. Social support was also found to be bi-directional in nature. Research limitations/implications: This study only investigates one online support group. To gain deeper insights, other support groups should be examined over a longer period. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates that transformative services have the hidden capacity to optimize their services to enable <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> to co-create social support in a safe place, thus providing a non-judgmental environment with the end goal of improving their health and well-being. Social implications: Findings reveal how services can enable marginalization and stigmatization to be overcome and inspire social action through the use of online support groups. Originality/value: This research is unique in that it used a netnography approach to examine how <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> interact in an online service setting, reducing self-report bias and allowing for a natural research setting, thus allowing a unique understanding of how <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> experience and enact social support.

40|$|This is a {{paper about}} {{protecting}} <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> from over-indebtedness. The {{first part of}} this paper will outline what is meant by <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers,</b> over-indebtedness, and why these are the key concepts that this paper is framed around. As this paper is predicated on an assumption that <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> ought to be protected from over-indebtedness, the second part of this paper defends that assumption. The third part of this paper is an exploration of three of the main causes of over-indebtedness, and which causes ought to be the ones that are targeted to help prevent the over-indebtedness of vulnerable people. The fourth part of this paper briefly outlines ways that the systemic problems that can cause over-indebtedness can be addressed. This paper argues that government subsidised low-cost loans, or cash grants, for people who are over-indebted due to vulnerability are an appropriate direction for further research that may be more welfare enhancing than other ways to address over-indebtedness caused by vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|Effectively {{designed}} complaint {{handling systems}} {{play a key}} role in enabling <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> to complain and obtain redress. This article examines current research into consumer vulnerability, highlighting its multidimensional and expansive nature. Contemporary understandings of consumer vulnerability recognize that the interaction between a wide range of market and consumer characteristics can combine to place any individual at risk of vulnerability. While this broad definition of consumer vulnerability reflects the complex reality of consumers' experiences, it poses a key challenge for designers of complaint handling systems: how can they identify and respond to an issue which can potentially affect everyone? Drawing on current research and practice in the United Kingdom and Australia, the article analyses the impact of consumer vulnerability on third party dispute resolution schemes and considers the role these complaint handling organizations can play in supporting their complainants. Third party complaint handling organizations, including a range of Alternative Dispute Resolution services such as ombudsman organizations, can {{play a key role}} in increasing access to justice for <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> groups and provide specific assistance for individual complainants during the process. It is an opportune time to review whether the needs of consumers at risk of vulnerability are being met within complaint processes and the extent to which third party complaint handlers support those who are most vulnerable to seek redress. Empowering <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> to complain presents specific challenges. The article discusses the application of a new model of consumer dispute system design to show how complaint handling organizations can meet the needs of the most <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> throughout the process. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Public service {{deregulation}} is favoured for motivating {{providers to}} offer consumers better price-quality services. Consequently, consumers are enabled {{to make informed}} choices and choose for the best service provider. However, recent publications reveal that consumers are not capable of exercising optimal choice behaviour. Despite these concerns, evidence is lacking {{on the extent to}} which potentially <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> make use of the core element of deregulation—switching health plans. This article is meant to study whether potentially <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> do indeed switch less health plans in the deregulated Dutch health insurance market than regular consumers. In order to answer this question, we extract questionnaire data from the LISS panel, covering the years 2009 - 2012. A total of 16, 779 health insurance consumers were included in the sample. The average response rate was 78 %. Logistic regression results show that consumers being chronically ill, 60 and older, and without Internet access, do indeed switch less often. Intriguingly, non-working consumers and those living equal to or below the poverty line, turn out to switch more often than regular consumers. As a result, we conclude that the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumer</b> in the Dutch health insurance market is described by the following characteristics: chronically ill, 60 and older, and without Internet access. This specific group tends to get locked-in and suffers disproportion- ately from suboptimal choice behaviour...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of social enterprises in providing fair services to <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers,</b> focusing on the vulnerability of low-income consumers to high-cost exploitative credit {{as a result of}} a lack of access to mainstream financial services. It will be argued that both the state and the corporate sector have a role to play in providing the means with which <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> can overcome financial exclusion, through access to fair services. However, this cannot and should not be achieved through increased welfare provision or through reliance on corporate social responsibility initiatives alone. In rejecting solutions focused on increased welfare or voluntary corporate social responsibility initiatives, this article suggests that regulatory support for the development and growth of social enterprises, such as community development finance institutions, will most effectively give rise to a social framework in which vulnerability and unequal opportunity with respect to financial services is addressed.

40|$|Our {{climate of}} mass consumption, {{as well as}} the {{aggressive}} marketing techniques targeting <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers,</b> both entrench the false belief that ‘‘you’ve got to go into debt to get anywhere’’. Money may well be the last social taboo: people ﬁnd it difﬁcult to earnestly talk about, and objectively assess, their ﬁnancial situation, especially when they are borrowing more than they are earning. This unwillingness to communicate openly about debt makes it difﬁcult to address the issue with public education strategies. Extreme debt practices signify a revolving door to poverty because some people, like the welfare participants in this study, do not recognise they are in debt. Without identifying themselves as having a debt problem, <b>vulnerable</b> <b>consumers</b> will not seek an effective solution to help get themselves out of debt. The majority of {{the participants in this study}} did not seek ﬁnancial counselling because they had not yet become bankrupt.
