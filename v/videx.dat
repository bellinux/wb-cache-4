5000|$|Upon {{release from}} prison in 1979, Freeman set about {{exploiting}} the Obscene Publications Act, which didn't yet cover the new video format, and started producing hardcore pornography. While working at <b>Videx,</b> Honey starred in his first film as an actor in [...] "Truth or Dare" [...] with actress Paula Meadows. However, the law was soon changed to bring video under the Obscene Publications Act and Freeman's home was raided in 1981 by the OPS (Obscene Publications Squad), with all the <b>Videx</b> video equipment confiscated in the process. It was alleged that the raid was engineered by porn shop chain owner and publisher David Sullivan; Freeman had refused to deal with Sullivan by stocking <b>Videx</b> titles in his shops. Sullivan was also angered by articles in the Star newspaper that unfavourably compared his productions with those of <b>Videx</b> and allegedly paid someone {{to act as a}} member of the public to make a complaint in relation to the <b>Videx</b> film [...] "Sex Slave", to claim they had been shocked and appalled by what they had seen.|$|E

5000|$|Freeman {{was sentenced}} to 15 months in the case {{relating}} to the first raid in 1981 involving the video [...] "Sex Slave". He was persuaded to put the company into voluntary liquidation after {{he was told that}} this would help avoid a potential four-year prison sentence. While Freeman was incarcerated, Honey took over <b>Videx</b> and produced and directed his first film, [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Ransom", for the company which featured his bandmate Ian Mitchell. After serving ten months Freeman was released from prison and set about preparing for the case of the second raid in relation to the video [...] "The <b>Videx</b> Video Show". He represented himself in court {{in order to be able}} to call a famous witness, which his QC had refused to allow. Freeman was being charged under Obscene Publications Act and Protection of Children Act, as images of children taken at a naturist park were featured (although in a separate scene to any pornographic content). In case documents, while admitting to starring in the film [...] "The <b>Videx</b> Video Show", Honey refused to comment on or confirm his involvement in <b>Videx</b> and retained the services of Sullivan's solicitor, whom Sullivan paid for. Having called film critic Derek Malcolm as a witness who classed the film as [...] "harmless erotica" [...] and successfully demonstrating that the film was not obscene, Freeman, Honey, Freeman's girlfriend and company secretary Sara Bhaskaran, and silent business partner John Edward Currey were found not guilty under the Obscene Publications Act. However, Freeman was found guilty of Perverting the course of justice, despite having already been acquitted of the offence relating to the video, and sentenced to a further 15 months. He was then recalled by the Parole Board for his previous life sentence for murder under the false charge of crime of violence while on parole, despite not being charged for any such crime, let alone found guilty. It took Freeman two years to prove this.|$|E
5000|$|Although video {{had been}} brought under the Obscene Publications Act, Freeman {{continued}} openly producing hardcore pornographic videos, including two gay films. He was informed by his solicitor that if he withdrew the gay material the Home Office would drop their case, but he refused. The <b>Videx</b> offices were raided again in 1983 and Freeman was arrested {{in relation to the}} film [...] "The <b>Videx</b> Video Show" [...] under Obscene Publications Act and Perverting the course of justice. He was accused of destroying evidence with the motivation of denying producing the film after erasing the contents of one video copy of each film, despite his name being heavily featured in the credits of each film and never denying his involvement. By this time Honey was working as photographer and sales manager for the company, but managed to recover incriminating evidence from his car during the raid (and would later claim in court that he didn't work for the company).|$|E

50|$|The related pro-drug of didanosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), was {{initially}} synthesized by Morris J. Robins (professor of Organic Chemistry at Brigham Young University) and R.K. Robins in 1964. Subsequently, Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that ddA and ddI could inhibit HIV replication {{in the test}} tube and conducted initial clinical trials showing that didanosine had activity in patients infected with HIV. On behalf of the NCI, they were awarded patents on these activities. Since the NCI does not market products directly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a ten-year exclusive license to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.

5000|$|Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTIs) {{are considered the}} [...] "backbone" [...] of ART and 2 medications are generally used in combination. Due to its known safety profile and extensive use in pregnant patients, zidovudine-lamivudine (ZDV/3TC) is the preferred choice as the NRTI backbone. Zidovudine may worsen anemia, so patients with anemia are advised to use an alternative agent. For women who are coinfected with Hepatitis B, tenofovir with either emtricitabine or lamivudine is the preferred NRTI backbone. NRTI use may cause lactic acidosis in some women, so {{it is important to}} monitor patients for this complication. Deaths from lactic acidosis and liver failure have been {{associated with the use of}} two NRTIs, stavudine and didanosine (Zerit and <b>Videx,</b> respectively); therefore, combinations involving these drugs should be avoided in pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Honey {{began working}} as an actor for Mike Freeman's <b>Videx</b> Ltd. in 1980, a video {{production}} company based in Wimbledon. Freeman had produced softcore porn throughout the 1960s via his company Climax Films, and employed well known Soho gangster Gerald Patrick Joseph Hawley as a bodyguard. He was jailed in December 1969 {{for the murder of}} Hawley, reportedly after he tried to take over Freeman's business. Freeman alleged that Hawley had been contracted to kill him and had threatened to kill his wife and children,. During the court case, it was revealed that Hawley had starred in several films produced by a pornography ring in which Freeman was involved, and was murdered in May 1969 at 126 Stockwell Road, Brixton after attempting to extort further fees for his acting. He suffered 89 stab wounds during the attack and his body was dumped in Epping Forest.|$|E
50|$|Like the Apple II, the Apple II Plus has no {{lowercase}} functionality. All {{letters from}} the keyboard are upper-case, there is no caps lock key, {{and there are no}} lowercase letters in the text-mode font stored in the computer's ROM. To display lowercase letters, some applications run in the slower hi-res graphics mode and use a custom font, rather than running in the fast text mode using the font in ROM. Other programs, primarily those where both capitalization and text movement were important, such as word processors, use inverse text mode to represent text that would be uppercase when printed. Alternatively, users can install a custom ROM chip that contained lowercase letters in the font, or purchase one of several third-party 80-column cards that enable a text mode that can display 80-column, upper- and lower-case text. The <b>Videx</b> Videoterm and its many clones were especially popular.|$|E
50|$|AIDS activists, {{desperate for}} new treatments, were outraged {{at the cost}} of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the {{government}} and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. Even after this price concession, the 12-pill-per-day AZT regimen cost patients $6,400 a year. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of <b>Videx.</b> AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992.|$|E
50|$|The 1977 softcore sex comedy film Come Play with Me, {{which had}} been highly {{successful}} commercially at the cinema, {{became one of the}} first British films to sell in large numbers on the new VHS format. In 1979 Paul Raymond launched the Electric Blue series of softcore videos, a range which was produced until the mid 1990s. They were an extension of his magazine publishing into new media. An Electric Blue special VHS video, A Night at the Revuebar (1983), included extensive footage of the 1980s version of The Festival of Erotica show from the Raymond Revuebar. Meanwhile in the early eighties John Lindsay began selling compilations of his hardcore films on video through mail order, taking advantage of the then unregulated state of the British video industry. Another director to take advantage of this unregulated period was Mike Freeman, who in 1979 set up the hardcore video production company <b>Videx</b> Ltd. and employed Lindsay Honey as an actor. Honey went on run his own mail order hardcore video business with his partner Linzi Drew until the pair were convicted in 1992. During the 1990s and 2000s, Honey used the name Ben Dover to produce and direct gonzo pornography videos. Another successful producer of pornographic videos at this time was Viv Thomas. He began producing pornographic videos in the 1980s, moving into producing hardcore material exclusively once doing so became legal in 1999. Thomas has become known as an established producer of lesbian pornography and with a reputation for producing artistic pornographic films with an emphasis on high production values. Female directors include Tanya Hyde, who began as a hardcore actor in the mid-90s and since 2004 has been a prolific director of hardcore fetish titles for the British pornographic film production company Harmony Films.|$|E
40|$|Plants, {{including}} some lesser known vegetables (LKVs), have been implicated {{to be of}} several health benefits to mankind.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE. Antiviral hyper-activation-limiting {{therapeutic}} agents (AV-HALTs) are a novel experimental drug class {{designed to}} both decrease viral replication and down-regulate excessive immune system activation {{for the treatment}} of chronic infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. VS 411, a first-in-class AV-HALT, is a single-dosage form combining didanosine (ddI, 400 mg), an antiviral (AV), and hydroxyurea (HU, 600 mg), a cytostatic agent, designed to provide a slow release of ddI to reduce its maximal plasma concentration (C max) to potentially reduce toxicity while maintaining total daily exposure (AUC) and the AV activity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH. This was a pilot phase I, open-label, randomized, single-dose, four-way crossover trial to investigate the fasted and non-fasted residual variance of AUC, Cmax and the oral bioavailability of ddI and HU, co-formulated as VS 411, and administered as two different fixed-dose combination formulations compared to commercially available ddI (<b>Videx</b> EC) and HU (Hydrea) when given simultaneously.

40|$|AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC) is a {{frequent}} and devastating complication of HIV infection. There is evidence that zidovudine (ZDV) has an effect in alleviating the symptoms of ADC, and may {{have a role in}} its prevention. It is therefore important that new antiretroviral therapies be evaluated not only for the risk of neurologic side effects, but also for their relative efficacy to ZDV in the prevention of ADC. The present study reports the effects of 2 ' 3 'dideoxyinosine (DDI, didanosine, <b>Videx)</b> therapy on neuropsychological performance in the context of several large clinical trials targeting advanced systemic HIV- 1 infection.

40|$|Zidovudine (azidothymidine, Retrovir) and ddI (di-deoxy-inosine, <b>Videx)</b> {{interfere}} with the multiplication of HIV by incorporation into nascent DNA chains and interruption of the further linking of nucleotides. Zidovudine lowers early mortality in patients with Aids and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. However, much {{of the effectiveness of}} zidovudine is lost later on; the average prolongation of life in treated patients is estimated to be about 1 year. About two thirds of patients with Aids can be treated with zidovudine; in the others, the drug is ineffective or contraindicated. Frequent blood counts are necessary to monitor myelotoxicity, even at relatively low doses of 500 mg/day. In contrast, zidovudine is well tolerated by asymptomatic patients with 200 to 500 CD 4 lymphocytes/mm 3, in whom it diminishes the incidence of Aids from about 7 to 3 % {{during the first year of}} treatment, with less than 2 % severe anemia or leukopenia. For patients who do not tolerate zidovudine, ddI is an alternative. It is not myelotoxic but can cause neuritis and pancreatitis, especially at doses in excess of 10 mg/kg/day. Although its antiviral effect is excellent both in vitro and in vivo, there is still a lack of firm data on its clinical value, such as the decrease in opportunistic infections and increase in survival...|$|E

40|$|Ganciclovir {{is one of}} {{only two}} drugs {{licensed}} by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opportunistic cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. The combination of ganciclovir and zidovudine has been reported to be poorly tolerated because of dose-limiting hematologic toxicity; thus we retrospectively examined the tolerability of combination therapy with ganciclo-vir and didanosine in 32 patients with AIDS. These patients were receiving ganciclovir for CMV disease in addition to didanosine in the <b>Videx</b> ® U. S. Expanded Access Program. During the period of combined therapy, dose-limiting hematologic toxicity (absolute neutrophil count, < 500 cells/AL) developed in only 9. 4 % of patients and severe anemia (hemoglobin level, < 8. 0 g/dL) in only 12. 5 %. Rates of dose-limiting intolerance to didanosine were similar to those previously reported in the Expanded Access Program. Overall, 15 of 32 patients in the current study tolerated therapeutic doses of didanosine in combination with ganciclovir; in contrast, only 5 of 29 patients tolerated zidovudine (600 mg/d) in combination with ganciclovir in the largest trial of therapy with this combination whose results have been published to date (P =. 02, Fisher's exact test).

Since 1998 only three new antiretroviral agents have come to market, amprenavir (Agenerase), lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra) and tenofovir (Viread). In addition, re-formulations of existing drugs have been approved including the fixed dose combination of ZDV, 3 TC and abacavir (Trizavir) and enteric coated ddI (<b>Videx</b> EC), bringing the current tally of approved antiretroviral agents to 19.

The compound acted synergistically with β-l- 2 ′, 3 ′-deoxy- 3 ′-thiacytidine (also known as lamivudine) and β-l- 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxy- 2 ′, 3 ′-didehydro- 5 -fluorocytidine (also known as elvucitabine) and additively with 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxyinosine (also known as didanosine and <b>Videx)</b> and 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (also known as Retovir and zidovudine) against HIV. 4 ′-Ethynyl D 4 T is phosphorylated by purified human thymidine kinase 1 (TK- 1) from CEM cells with a faster relative Vmax and a lower Km value than D 4 T. The efficiency of TK- 1 in the phosphorylation of 4 ′-ethynyl D 4 T is fourfold better than that of D 4 T. While D 4 T is broken down by the catabolic enzyme thymidine phosphorylase, the level of breakdown of 4 ′-ethynyl D 4 T was below detection. Since 4 ′-ethynyl D 4 T has increased anti-HIV activity and decreased toxicity and interacts favorably with other currently used anti-HIV drugs, it should be considered for further development as an anti-HIV drug...|$|E
