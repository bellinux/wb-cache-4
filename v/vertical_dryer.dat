40|$|The {{ceramic tile}} {{manufacturing}} process consumes {{a great amount}} of energy, mainly thermal energy, which is obtained from natural gas combustion. The increased cost of this fuel and the current economic situation make cost a critical issue that can hurt company competitiveness. The ceramic tile firing process in roller kilns does not exactly stand out for its energy efficiency, because about 50 % of the energy input is lost through the kiln combustion flue gas and cooling gas stacks. With a view to improving the reuse of the energy consumed in the firing operation, two heat exchangers were installed in the stacks of a kiln. In these heat exchangers, the kiln gases transfer their sensible heat to a thermal oil that then passes this on, through two other exchangers, to the drying gases in the recirculation ducts of a <b>vertical</b> <b>dryer.</b> This study presents an experimental industrial plant in a fine-tuning test phase, in which the preliminary results indicate an energy efficiency improvement in a range of 60 – 90 %, depending on the operating conditions and processed material...|$|E
40|$|Para o presente estudo, foi analisada a desidratação parcial do tomate cereja ovalado, Lycopersicum sp. Mill., e utilizou-se de um secador de bandejas vibradas com reciclo até que o tomate atingisse 15 % do conteúdo de água inicial, o que representa 70, 19 % de umidade em base úmida ou 2, 35 kg de água/kg de massa seca em base seca. O secador estudado {{consiste}} basicamente de um túnel vertical de secagem com quatro bandejas perfuradas por onde escoam de maneira cruzada o tomate e o ar aquecido. Todas as bandejas estão conectadas a um sistema de vibração que auxilia no escoamento dos tomates, para que durante o processamento os frutos sejam conduzidos à uma esteira que auxilia na recirculação dos frutos. Um PCC foi desenvolvido para quantificar a influência das variáveis significativas do processo: vazão de ar, temperatura e massa de tomate alimentada. A resposta analisada foi a quantidade de tomate in natura processada em um dia. A condição ótima de operação foi reproduzida experimentalmente, validando os resultados obtidos no PCC, em que obteve-se 18, 729 kg de tomate processados/dia, com a temperatura ótima de 67, 6 °C, vazão de ar 6 kg/min e quantidade de tomate alimentado de 4, 025 kg. Na condição ótima do secador estudou-se a curva de secagem e a cinética de secagem. O processo de secagem iniciou-se com o secador operando em batelada sem recirculação dos frutos, até que se atingiu o teor de umidade de aproximadamente 85 %, seguindo-se a adição de esferas de porcelana com 0, 0235 m de diâmetro, as quais forçaram o escoamento das partículas de tomate e o processo passou a ocorrer com recirculação. Na cinética de secagem, três períodos foram identificados: dois períodos em que os tomates secaram em taxas constantes, intercalados por um período com taxa variável. Para as taxas de secagem constantes, quantificaram-se os valores do coeficiente de correlação superiores a 0, 99, ao ajustar uma reta aos pontos experimentais. Comparando-se o comportamento do leito fixo com o vibrado, observou-se que a aplicação da vibração atuou diminuindo em 30 % o tempo de secagem. Os resultados indicaram que a influência simultânea da vibração e das esferas de porcelana intensificam o processo de secagem, resultando em uma cinética de secagem peculiar. In this essay, it {{has been}} analyzed the partial dehydration of oval cherry tomato Lycopersicum sp. Mill, by using a vibrated tray dryer with recycle until the tomatoes reached 15 % of its initial water content what represents 70, 19 % of humidity in wet basis or 2, 35 kg of water/kg of dry mass in dry basis. The dryer used consists basically of a <b>vertical</b> <b>dryer</b> tunnel with four perforated trays by whose perforations tomatoes and air flow where drained in a crossed way, being the latter injected {{at the bottom of}} a pipe connected to a blower, allowing the adjustment of output and also to go through a series of four resistors that sets the temperature. All trays are connected to a vibration system that helps the tomatoes flow, which are recirculated with the aid of a conveyor belt. CCD was used to verify the influence of significant variables of the process: air flow, temperature and tomatoes mass. The analyzed response was the amount of in natura tomatoes processed in a day. The optimum operating condition was experimentally reproduced, validating the results obtained in the CCD, where there was obtained 18, 729 kg of tomatoes processed per day, with an optimum temperature of 67. 6 ° C, airflow rate 6 kg / min and amount of processed tomatoes of 4. 025 kg. In the optimum condition of the dryer {{it has been}} studied the drying curve and drying kinetics. The drying process started with the dryer working in batch without tomatoes recicle, until achieve the moisture content of 85 % approximately, followed by the addition of porcelain spheres with a diameter of 0. 0235 m, that forced the tomatoes particles flow and the process began to occur with recirculation. In the drying knetics, three periods were identified: two periods that the dried tomatoes in steady state rates, interspersed with a variable rate period. For the drying rates constants, quantified values of the correlation coefficient above 0. 99, linear fitting a straight line with the experimental points. Comparing the behavior of the fixed bed with the vibrated bed, it was observed that the application of vibration acted in decreasing by 30 % the drying time. The results indicated that the simultaneous influence of vibration and porcelain balls intensify the drying process, resulting in a peculiar air drying...|$|E

The split nut and shell appearance of pistachio nuts are significantly influenced by the drying methods. The types of dryer used for drying pistachio nuts are critical to the final quality of the product. Although sun drying has a good effect on the final product quality, the negative climatic and environmental conditions must be considered.   A combination of bin dryer and sun drying or combination of bin dryer and solar dryer, are recommended as effective drying techniques to prevent adverse quality effect on pistachio nut. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{describes}} {{the design and}} {{development of a new}} drying system for a rollover carwash machine with the support of numerical tools. The drying system is composed of a pair of stationary <b>vertical</b> <b>dryers</b> and a moveable horizontal dryer that can adjust itself to the contour of a vehicle. After the definition of the dryers’ concept, their performance was assessed individually to check their internal flow pattern and to improve their airflow distribution. These issues are expected to provide feedback on redesign and geometric optimization of the dryers. After redesign of the dryers separately, the behaviour of the complete drying system was studied on actual vehicle models, representative of the shortest and tallest dimensions that can be washed with the existing carwash machine sector. The drying efficiency of the whole system was studied by calculation of shear stress distribution on various surfaces of a given vehicle. The results allowed concluding that the overall drying performance of the design system is very good and assure adequate drying on most vehicles surfaces. The results obtained from numerical studies were then validated with experimental measurements and a good agreement was found between the two. The procedure employed in this work can be applied to support the design and analysis of other mechanical drying systems...|$|R

The determination and modeling of desorption isotherms were used to establish the equilibrium moisture content at 60, 75, and 90 °C using the static method with 8 saturated salt solutions. The best fit was obtained with BET and GAB models. The drying process was conducted in a <b>vertical</b> tray <b>dryer</b> and delineated according to a central composite experimental design (2 ²) using the following as factors: air velocity (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 m/s) and temperature (60, 75, and 90 °C), and it presented a good fit to the exponential model (R² > 99. 9 %). The experimental design responses evaluated were the technological properties of the fibers: water-holding, oil-holding, and swelling capacity. Since these properties were present in high levels, the lemon residues could be used to increase content of fibers in foods resulting in the addition of nutritional benefits for the consumers...|$|R

40|$|Neste trabalho, avaliou-se a qualidade fisiológica e se quantificaram os possíveis gradientes de umidade de sementes de sorgo BR 601, durante o armazenamento. Utilizaram-se amostras coletadas em secador de camada fixa vertical, com duto central perfurado e distribuição radial de ar. Os pontos amostrais no secador se distanciavam 0, 10; 0, 30 e 0, 50 m em relação à lateral do duto central de ar e nas alturas de 0, 85; 2, 02 e 3, 64 m da base do secador, com capacidade de 8 t, além de uma amostra média (M) que representou os três pontos radiais, respectivamente. Armazenou-se o sorgo durante nove meses e se avaliou a germinação, vigor e umidade do produto no terceiro, sexto e nono meses de armazenamento. Não houve diferença na qualidade fisiológica das sementes nas diferentes alturas e distâncias em relação ao duto central de ar do secador, em relação à média (M) durante o armazenamento, mas no decorrer deste, a queda de qualidade foi mais evidente no teste de frio, obtida no nono mês de armazenamento. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the physiological quality and possible moisture gradients in seeds of sorghum BR 601, during storage. Samples from a <b>vertical</b> fixed-bed <b>dryer</b> with a perforated central duct and radial air distribution were used. In the dryer, the sample points were located at 0. 10, 0. 30 and 0. 50 m distances {{in relation to the}} lateral of the central air duct. A composite sample was also collected and used as the control in relation to the others, at the respective heights. These sampling procedures were followed at heights of 0. 85; 2. 02 and 3. 64 m from the dryer base. Within each height and distance relative to the air duct, the collected samples were stored during nine months and evaluated for germination and vigor. At the third, sixth and ninth months after storage, the samples were evaluated for possible differences in quality and seed moisture gradient in comparison to the composite sample. No differences were observed in the physiological quality of the seeds from either different heights or distances relative to the hot-air central duct, in comparison to the composite sample, during the storage time. In general, seed vigor diminished with time while the decreasing quality was most evident in a cold test, conducted after nine months of storage...|$|R
