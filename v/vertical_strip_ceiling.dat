30|$|First, Strip computes {{the minimum}} {{bounding}} rectangle (MBR) in two-dimensional space that encloses all the query nodes Q of size n = |Q |, and partitions the MBR into √(n/ 3) equal-width <b>vertical</b> <b>strips.</b> For each <b>vertical</b> <b>strip,</b> Strip sequences all the inside nodes according to y-coordinate by alternately {{top to bottom}} and bottom to top. The final circuit is determined by connecting all the sequences computed for all strips. Strip only involves sorting by x-coordinate and y-coordinate.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} English archery contest. Archers {{take turns}} shooting at a <b>vertical</b> <b>strip</b> of wood, the wand, usually {{about six feet}} high and three to six inches (152 mm) wide. Points are awarded for hitting the strip. As the target is a long <b>vertical</b> <b>strip</b> this competition allows for more errors in elevation, however since no points are awarded for near misses the archer's windage accuracy becomes more important. The wand shoot is, in some respects, similar to the traditional Cherokee game of cornstalk shooting.|$|R

Some realistic printed circuits with multilayered <b>vertical</b> <b>strips</b> are analyzed, and results are compared either to those presented in the literature or to those obtained from the commercial software em by SONNET Software, North Syracuse, NY. In addition, it is demonstrated that this extension has facilitated {{the use of a}} recently developed algorithm, which was specifically developed for the efficient handling of multiple vertical conductors, for the analysis of structures with multiple <b>vertical</b> <b>strips</b> running in multilayer environment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} we study the Plancherel–Rotach type asymptotics for Stieltjes–Wigert, q-Laguerre and Ismail–Masson {{orthogonal}} polynomials with complex scalings. The main {{terms of the}} asymptotics for Stieltjes–Wigert and q-Laguerre polynomials (Ismail–Masson polynomials) contain Ramanujan function Aq(z) for scaling parameters above the vertical line R(s) = 2 (R(w) = 12); the main terms of the asymptotics involve theta function for scaling parameters in the <b>vertical</b> <b>strip</b> 0 <R(s) < 2 (0 <R(w) < 12). When scaling parameters in the <b>vertical</b> <b>strips,</b> the number theoretical properties of scaling parameters completely determine the orders of the error terms. These asymptotic formulas may provide some insights to new random matrix models and also add a new link between special functions and number theory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ruscheweyh and Sheil-Small {{proved that}} {{convexity}} is preserved under the convolution of univalent analytic mappings in K. However, {{when we consider}} the convolution of univalent harmonic convex mappings in KOH, this property does not hold. In fact, such convolutions may not be univalent. We establish some results concerning the convolution of univalent harmonic convex mappings provided that it is locally univalent. In particular, we show that the convolution of a right half-plane mapping in KOH with either another right half-plane mapping or a <b>vertical</b> <b>strip</b> mapping in KOH is convex {{in the direction of the}} real axis. Further, we give a condition under which the convolution of a <b>vertical</b> <b>strip</b> mapping in KOH with itself will be convex in the direction of the real axis. 1...|$|R
