Automatic <b>Vehicle</b> Classification (AVC) <b>detector,</b> among traffic data {{collection}} devices, is very useful but operation failure or damage is often occurred due to unstable power supply, weather changes and poor road pavement condition, causing deteriorated data quality.

This study is intended to identify the problems with existing <b>vehicle</b> <b>detector</b> and develop and evaluate the improved detector. The failure with AVC detector was mostly attributable to unstable power supply and environmental change and complex sensor and controller results in the high cost.
