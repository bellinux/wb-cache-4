50|$|Three (8301/08/10) {{were sent}} to Scotland in 1931-32 {{and as a result}} of the move they had their Westinghouse air brake {{replaced}} with a steam brake and <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Between 1915 and 1921 four (1303-1305, 1309) were fitted for {{push-pull}} working {{using the}} compressed air system; these required the fitting of an extra Westinghouse pump {{to the side}} of the locomotives. In 1924, 8307 was also push-pull fitted using the mechanical system for use on the Great Central section; no extra pump was needed, but it did gain a <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector.</b>|$|E
50|$|All 60 of {{the class}} were {{originally}} built with Westinghouse air brakes. Forty-two were fitted with <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors</b> in a programme during 1929 and 1930. However, withdrawal {{of the class}} had begun in 1928 and 18 of the class never received <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vacuum brakes {{have been}} {{superseded}} by air brakes in modern trains, which use pumps, as diesel and electric locomotives {{no longer have}} a suitable working fluid for <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{fitted with}} Pyle National {{turbo-generators}} and headlamps, with the generator {{attached to the}} top of the smokebox, ahead of the chimney. It had the Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's steam reversing gear, steam operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, steam brakes and combination <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Steam {{is passed}} through a <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> of high {{efficiency}} to exhaust a separate, closed vessel which forms part of a cooling water circuit. The partial vacuum in the vessel causes some of the water to evaporate, thus giving up heat through evaporative cooling. The chilled water is pumped through the circuit to air coolers, while the evaporated water from the ejector is recovered in separate condensers {{and returned to the}} cooling circuit.|$|E
50|$|In Britain, where steam hauled trains {{generally}} have vacuum operated brakes, {{it was quite}} common for turntables to be operated by vacuum motors worked from the locomotive's <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> or pump via a flexible hose or pipe although a few manually and electrically operated examples exist. The major manufacturers were Ransomes and Rapier, Ipswich and Cowans Sheldon, Carlisle. The GWR was the railway company that built several tables for its own use; {{there is little evidence}} any other companies did so.|$|E
50|$|Other visible {{differences}} are larger mechanical lubricators and external {{drive from the}} valve spindle, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> exhaust muffler {{just in front of}} the safety valves, pipes conveying exhaust and ejector steam to the ashpan for mixing with the primary air, the secondary air inlets in the firebox sides with spark arresting plates outside them, and the snifting and bypass valves which were removed and blanked off since the modified locomotive drifted in mid-gear with steam supplied from the drifting valve.|$|E
50|$|All {{were still}} in service at the 1923 grouping, the LNER adding 7000 to the numbers of nearly all the ex-Great Eastern locomotives, {{including}} the class G69 locomotives. The LNER added <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors</b> to all but one locomotive in 1927; the one exception being fitted in 1929. They also removed the condensing apparatus between 1936 and 1938.|$|R

50|$|All the B12 {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors</b> between 1924 and 1929 (the 1928 batch had them from new). Fifty-five locomotives were fitted with ACFI feedwater heaters between 1927 and 1934, {{but these were}} removed between 1934 and 1942. The first substantive change was the fitting of Lenz poppet valves to the 1928 batch (from new), and six of the ex-GE locomotives (8516/19/25/32/33/40). These locomotives were then classified as class B12/2. The poppet valves were not a great success and they all reverted to piston valve engines between 1931 and 1934.|$|R
50|$|The GWR {{experienced}} a substantial growth in long distance passenger traffic immediately before the First World War requiring a further series of fifteen locomotives {{during the first}} six months of 1914 (Swindon Lot 199). These were numbered 4046-60 and named after British princesses. They were all built with 15 in diameter cylinders and had improved boilers compared to the previous batch. They also introduced an improved four-cone <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> made necessary to improve braking on the increasingly long passenger trains. The locomotives were all withdrawn by British Railways between 1950 and 1957.|$|E
50|$|The 38 {{members of}} the Darlington-built batch (46465 to 46502) were {{allocated}} to the Eastern and North Eastern Regions of British Railways. The final 25 (46503 to 46527) were built at Swindon Works and, being allocated to the Western Region, consequently carried the GWR-type <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> and firehole doors. The Swindon locomotives were turned out, initially, in lined black. Under the Hanks regime, some received lined green livery as they passed through works. The rest carried black livery. None of the class was named in service, however some have been named in preservation.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} {{use for the}} injector {{technology is}} in vacuum ejectors in continuous train braking systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. A <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> uses steam pressure to draw {{air out of the}} vacuum pipe and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam.|$|E

50|$|Following {{purchase}} {{they were}} fitted with steam heating, <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors,</b> sliding cab windows, additional lamp irons and new cylinder drain cocks. Further modifications became necessary once the locomotives started to enter traffic, including large roof-top ventilators, British-style regulators (as built they had US-style pull-out ones), three rectangular cab-front lookout windows, extended coal bunkers, separate steam and vacuum brake controls and wooden tip-up seats. This {{meant that it}} took until November 1947 for the entire class {{to be ready for}} work. Telephones were later installed on the footplate to improve communication on the vast network of sidings at Southampton.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were erected at the East London workshops. Apart {{from their}} boilers and cylinders, {{the frame and}} other important components were standard {{with those of the}} Class 14, such as the coupled wheels, bogie, Pyle National turbo-generators and headlamps, Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's steam reversing gear, steam operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, steam brakes and combination <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors.</b> It was also delivered with Type MP1 tenders which had a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. One noticeable visible difference from the Class 14 was the absence of the two large sandboxes on each running board.|$|R
5000|$|Under the Railways Act 1921, the LB&SCR and LSWR amalgamated {{with some}} other large {{railways}} {{at the start of}} 1923 to form the Southern Railway (SR). A number of smaller railways were also to be absorbed by one or another of the larger companies prior to the actual amalgamation, and these included the IWCR and the FYNR which were to be absorbed by the LSWR. However, the FYNR were unhappy with the terms offered, which were not finally settled until 30 July 1923, and it did not formally become part of the SR until 1 September 1923. In March 1924, the bunker was extended, increasing its capacity to 1+1/2 LT; the <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> was removed, with the Westinghouse brake - already in use on all of the other Isle of Wight locomotives - being fitted instead; the locomotive was repainted into SR livery - sage green with black and white lining - and it was renumbered W2, the W prefix denoting Isle of Wight. It continued working on the line between Newport and Freshwater, and normally shared the duties with no. W10, another A1 Class locomotive which the SR had inherited from the IWCR. In January 1927, steam heating apparatus was fitted together with the necessary equipment for motor-train working. In September 1928 it was decided to give names of local significance to all of the locomotives on the Isle of Wight which did not already carry names, and so in October 1928, no. W2 was named Freshwater. In January 1932, the Drummond boiler which had been fitted in 1912 was found to be in need of heavy repairs, and so a boiler of the type used to rebuild the A1 Class to the A1x Class was fitted at Ryde works. This boiler had a single-ring barrel 8 ft long by 3 ft diameter, firebox 4 ft long with a grate area of , and worked at a pressure of [...] It returned to traffic in April 1932, having been renumbered W8 and reclassified A1x. It was now primarily used on the line between Merstone and Ventnor West, but occasionally on the Freshwater line. After the outbreak of World War II, no. W8 was stored for a period, but was used on occasion. By September 1945, it had been painted plain black.|$|E
5000|$|The Axminster and Lyme Regis Railway was {{authorised}} in 1899, and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) was {{contracted to}} work the line. The branch was sharply curved, with lightly-laid track and severe gradients, so {{it would only be}} possible to use small tank locomotives, of which the LSWR had none to spare. Dugald Drummond, the locomotive superintendent of the LSWR, having considered and rejected a new design, approached his opposite number on the LB&SCR, R. J. Billinton, to see if that railway had any spare A1 Class locomotives. Two LSWR representatives rode in a seven-carriage train hauled by no. 668 Clapham of that class, and after they had reported back to Drummond, he offered £600 each for that locomotive and no. 646 Newington. The purchase was sanctioned on 4 March 1903, and on 12 March, both were delivered to Nine Elms locomotive depot on the LSWR. The mileages were 574,266 (no. 646) and 611,070 (no. 668) and the recorded payment was £500 each. They were then moved to Nine Elms works where they were given general repairs and a repaint into LSWR livery (royal green, bordered in brown and lined out in black and white), and were numbered 734 (ex-646) and 735 (ex-668). As part of the repairs, the Westinghouse brake was removed and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> was fitted instead, {{to work the}} train brakes; the brakes on the locomotive itself could now only be operated by hand. Following these repairs, the weight in working order was given as 24.06 LT. They entered service on 4 April 1903, and until the Lyme Regis branch opened, other duties were found for the two locomotives. No. 734 spent several weeks on station pilot duties at Guildford, then on the Poole Quay Tramway, and finally sent to Exmouth Junction depot, that being the base for engines working branch lines in east Devon. From there, it was used on local goods services to Budleigh Salterton, Exmouth and Sidmouth. The Lyme Regis branch opened on 24 August 1903, and both nos. 734 and 735 were used from the start on both passenger and goods trains. In winter, only one locomotive was needed for the branch, and they were exchanged weekly, with the one working the branch being kept overnight in a small locomotive shed at Lyme Regis, and the other carrying out local duties in the Exeter area. The LSWR purchased the branch outright on 1 January 1907, and upgraded the line to allow larger locomotives of the LSWR O2 class. Once these began to be used, other duties were found for the two A1s, although they did assist on the Lyme Regis branch until mid-1909. From September 1907, no. 734 was based at Eastleigh for the Bishop's Waltham branch. It was also used at Sidmouth, Yeovil and Fratton. By February 1912, no. 734 was in Eastleigh Works for reboilering. The new boiler was of Drummond design, and smaller: it had a barrel 7 ft long by 3 ft diameter, a firebox 4 ft long with a grate area of , and worked at a pressure of [...] New cylinders were also provided, and these were of 13 inch mm bore by 20 inch mm stroke. Following the rebuild, the weight in working order was 26.15 LT. It then performed local duties in the Eastleigh area.|$|E
40|$|Jet vacuum {{ejectors}} {{currently used}} have a defect of large air consumption {{due to the}} need of continuous and constant air supply. To solve this problem, a novel technical structure of the jet <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> with flow self-regulation by an adjustable cone has been investigated. In this paper, the structure, key technologies and experiment of this new jet <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> are introduced.

Besides the maximum vacuum value, the vacuum response time and air consumption are the most concerning performances. Special structural design is made so as to meet all the requirements, in which the unequal diameters of pistons, using directional control valves instead of the check valves and stepped flow rate control scheme are proposed and realized.

40|$|Distillation as a {{desalination}} technol-ogy is not {{commonly used}} in theUnited States for producing potable drinking water. Reverse osmosis (RO), which uses thin film membranes, has been the pre-ferred choice. Distillation has been labeled as more expensive because of the perceived higher usage of energy associated with heat-ing water and higher capital costs. Today’s distillation technologies, which include Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) and Mechanical Vapor Compression (MVC), can be cost-competitive, especially when they are collocated with a power plant or resource-recovery facility such as an incinerator or refinery, where a source of waste steam is avail-able. Thermal technologies can utilize this steam—which would otherwise {{be lost in the}} form of stack gases, cooling-water streams, or low-pressure exhaust steam—as a primary or supplemental source of heat for distillation. This is accomplished, in part, by the use of thermo-compressors and <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors.</b> The <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejectors</b> lower the effective tem-perature needed to achieve boiling from 100 º C (212 º F) at 1. 0 absolute atmosphere to below 70 º C (158 º F) at 0. 34 absolute atmosphere. The EcoEléctrica Power Plant, located on Puerto Rico’s southern coast, is the first facility of its type combining a 507 -megawatt power plant, a liquid natural-gas terminal, and a seawater distillation desalination facili-ty—all financed in a single project. The power plant consists of two gas-combustion turbines and one steam turbine. Each pro-duces waste steam, a byproduct that is used by two 3, 785 m 3 /day (1 -mgd) MED units to distill seawater from the Caribbean Sea, pro-ducing cooling water for a nearby power plant and potable drinking water for EcoElectrica and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct Sewer Authority (PRASA) for distribution to surrounding communities. As a commonwealth of the United States, Puerto Rico requires its drinking-water providers to meet all regulations as issued and enforced under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).

40|$|In this endeavor, the {{transients}} persisting in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>ejector</b> system (put reference {{of my old}} paper) is {{studied by}} numerically simulating the flow field, and experimentally validating the simulated results. An inertial effect was discovered in the study due to which the direction of mass flux changes. As a result of this, the recirculation zone moves forward and backward during the transients and the pressure in the secondary chamber rises and falls. The system behaves as a damped oscillatory flow in which the direction of mass flux keeps on changing and finally settles down to a state {{where there is no}} mass flux in either direction. The movement of recirculation zone due to this inertial effect is studied in more detail for various flow and geometric parameters. The results obtained show that the pressure and mass flux through the secondary chamber depend highly on both the thickness of the primary and secondary jet and the chamber volume. The inertial effect reduces with the reduction in thickness of primary and secondary flow. The inertial effect is found to be decreasing with increasing secondary chamber volume. It is also found that, the inertial effect decreases as the primary jet pressure increases, for all other parameters remaining the same.
