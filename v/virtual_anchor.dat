We propose an attractive movement strategy with mobile elements (MEs) to improve the network performance and address limitations of static WSNs in node localization. In our scheme, a mobile sensor node cooperates with static sensor nodes and moves actively to construct <b>virtual</b> <b>anchor</b> nodes. The localization accuracy of the proposed algorithm is further improved by active movement of ME with low communication traffic and computing complexity. It minimizes the communication cost and improves the localization performance simultaneously via using ME and our proposed <b>virtual</b> <b>anchor</b> nodes.

Authors in this paper assume that RSSI based distance estimation technique will have some error due to noisy RSSI readings. The localization algorithm proposed here takes into account this error and localizes a WSN in three stages. Due to this error in distance, nodes in neighbor of three anchor nodes determine their uncertainty region with some accuracy and become virtual anchors. These nodes then help other nodes in the network to determine their region. These non <b>virtual</b> <b>anchor</b> nodes collaborate among themselves to further decrease the size of uncertainty region. The collaborative nature of nodes is exploited to increase the accuracy and precision of localization.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} soft lower-extremity robotic exosuit {{intended}} to augment normal muscle function in healthy individuals. Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the <b>virtual</b> <b>anchor</b> technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit’s performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated {{the effect of the}} ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer’s hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. Engaging the actuators at the ankles at 30 % of the gait cycle for 250 ms altered joint kinematics the least and also minimized metabolic power. The subject’s average metabolic power was 386. 7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381. 8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430. 6 W).

The pipeline installed on the seabed and left exposed have a potential to buckle, walk and change configuration under high temperature and pressure (HT/HP). This could lead to failure of the Pipeline if buckling and walking is not properly controlled or mitigated. The objective of the thesis work is to study and understand the influence of pipeline-soil interaction {{on the design of}} surface laid subsea pipeline susceptible to lateral buckling and pipeline walking. The main focus of the thesis work is on the use of snake-lay configuration as a mitigating measure under controlled buckling design and rock dumping if needed to limit feed-in into buckle and end expansions; the effect of thermal gradient on axial walking and the use of direct electric heating (DEH) to reduce rate of walking. The snake-lay configuration is achieved by installing deliberate horizontal lay imperfection to trigger a sufficient number of thermal buckles at a pre-determined location along the pipeline. The desire is to limit pipeline expansion at the connecting ends by using snake-lay design with intermittent rock dumping. The work includes performing non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) and modeling the soilpipeline interaction of as-laid pipeline using general finite (FE) element software ANSYS. The results are discussed against the relevant design criteria based on design codes DNV-OS-F 101, DNV-RP-F 110 and Subsea 7 Lateral Buckling Analysis Design Guideline. FE analyses were performed to study the lateral buckling of a 2 km VAS model with an initial out-of-straightness (OOS) under operating temperature and pressure. Consequently, the effect of thermal gradient of an asymmetric heating process in pipeline walking phenomenon is investigated. Based on FE analyses findings, the use of direct electric heating (DEH) system to reduce the rate of axial walking is proposed and explained.

40|$|Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) {{refers to}} the family of “wearable” {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSN) used to collect personal data, such as human activity, heart rate, sleep sequences or geographical position. This thesis aims at proposing cooperative algorithms and cross-layer mechanisms with WBAN to perform large-scale individual motion capture and coordinated group navigation applications. For this purpose, we exploit the advantages of jointly cooperative and heterogeneous WBAN under full/half-mesh topologies for localization purposes, from on-body links at the body scale, body-to-body links between mobile users of a group and off-body links with respect to the environment and the infrastructure. The wireless transmission relies on an impulse radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) radio (based on the IEEE 802. 15. 6 standard), in order to obtain accurate peer-to-peer ranging measurements based on Time of Arrival (ToA) estimates. Thus, we address the problem of positioning and ranging estimation through the design of cross-layer strategies by considering realistic body mobility and channel variations. Our first contribution consists in the creation of an unprecedented WBAN measurement database obtained with real experimental scenarios for mobility and channel modelling. Then, we introduce a discrete-event (WSNet) and deterministic (PyLayers) co-simulator tool able to exploit our measurement database to help us on the design and validation of cooperative algorithms. Using these tools, we investigate the impact of nodes mobility and channel variations on the ranging estimation. In particular, we study the “three-way ranging” (3 -WR) protocol and we observed that the delays of 3 -WR packets {{have an impact on the}} distances estimated in function of the speed of nodes. Then, we quantify and compare the error with statistical models and we show that the error generated by the channel is bigger than the mobility error. In a second time, we extend our study for the position estimation. Thus, we analyze different strategies at MAC layer through scheduling and slot allocation algorithms to reduce the impact of mobility. Then, we propose to optimize our positioning algorithm with an extended Kalman filter (EKF), by using our scheduling strategies and the statistical models of mobility and channel errors. Finally, we propose a distributed-cooperative algorithm based on the analysis of long-term and short-term link quality estimators (LQEs) to improve the reliability of positioning. To do so, we evaluate the positioning success rate under three different channel models (empirical, simulated and experimental) along with a conditional algorithm (based on game theory) for <b>virtual</b> <b>anchor</b> choice. We show that our algorithm improve the number of positions estimated for the nodes with the worst localization performance.

Compared with other building structure-based methods, our method has two advantages. The assumption on building structure is minimum and valid in most cases. Even if the assumption does not stand, the method will not lead to positioning failure.

The purpose is to propose a new cooperative algorithm to improve the number of estimated positions with a conditional permutation of the on-body anchors. To do so, we first evaluate and analyze the positioning success rate under a realistic mobility scenario and using two scheduling strategies: Broadcast single node localization (P 2 P-B) and aggregated and broadcast (A&B)) with a medium access control (MAC) layer based on time division multiple access (TDMA). The 3 -WR estimates the distance between two nodes placed on the body with the transmission of three packets. The wireless transmission is based on impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB). However, these transactions can be lost through the WBAN channel leading into a "bad positioning service. " We consider a physical layer based on IR-UWB with three different channels: (1) an empirical theoretical model based on the on-body CM 3 path loss channel (Anechoic chamber), (2) a simulated channel calculated by ray-tracing with the PyLayers simulator, and (3) an experimental channel model obtained by measurements.

Proposed algorithm {{can be seen as}} a variant of GFG (Greedy Face Greedy of Bose et. al) algorithm, but based on combinatorial properties derived in the <b>Virtual</b> Raw <b>Anchor</b> Coordinate system, which is the localization scheme of interest. We utilize a local planarization algorithm of a geometric graph, which is based on the Schnyder's characterization of planar graphs. The new approach is combinatorial in the sense that the nodes are ordered with respect to three distinct order relations satisfying suitable properties. The coordinate system that motivated the development of this routing algorithm is VRAC (<b>Virtual</b> Raw <b>Anchor</b> Coordinates), which localizes the nodes with the raw distances from three anchors. Since the positions of the anchors are not known, the VRAC coordinate system does not correspond to the Euclidean location of nodes, yet leaving sufficient information to define necessary combinatorial constructs for routing with guaranteed delivery. In particular, the routing algorithm avoids the references to geographical arguments and makes use only of the order relations on the nodes. We expect that our approach will foster further research on building efficient order relations, that will prove to be useful in practical implementation of geographic routing algorithms. In particular, we expect that further work will prove that the combinatorial approach for geographic routing, based on a raw anchor based positioning system is more robust in the presence of distance measurement errors...|$|R

Multipath-assisted indoor navigation and tracking (MINT) is a possible concept to enable robust and accurate localization of an agent in indoor environments. Using a-priori knowledge of a floor plan of the environment and the position of the physical anchors, specu-lar multipath components can be exploited, based on a geometric-stochastic channel model. So-called <b>virtual</b> <b>anchors</b> (VAs), which are mirror images of the physical anchors, are used as additional anchors for positioning. The quality of this additional information depends on the accuracy of the corresponding floor plan. In this paper, we propose a new simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach that allows to learn the floor plan representation and to deal with inaccurate information. A key feature is an online estimated channel characterization that enables an efficient combination of the measurements. Starting with just the known anchor positions, the proposed method includes the VA positions also in the state space and is thus able to adapt the VA positions during tracking of the agent. Furthermore, the method is able to discover new potential VAs in a feature-based manner. This paper presents a proof of concept using measurement data. The excellent agent tracking performance— 90 % of the error lower than 5 cm—achieved with a known floor plan can be reproduced with SLAM. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simultaneous}} localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm {{that is based}} on radio signals and the association of specular multipath components (MPCs) with geometric features. Especially in indoor scenarios, localization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath propagation and the unknown MPC-featureassociation. In our approach, specular reflections at flat surfaces (e. g., walls) are described in terms of <b>virtual</b> <b>anchors</b> (VAs). The positions of these VAs are unknown and possibly time-varying. We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem including the unknown MPC-VA association. We represent this model by a factor graph, which enables the use of the belief propagation (BP) scheme for efficient marginalization of the joint posterior distribution. The resulting BP-based SLAM algorithm detects the VAs and estimates the time-varying position of the mobile agent and the possibly time-varying positions of the VAs, thereby leveraging the MPCs in the radio signal for improved accuracy and robustness of agent localization. A core aspect of the algorithm is BP-based probabilistic MPC-VA association. Moreover, for improved initialization of new VA positions, the states of unobserved potential VAs are modeled as a random finite set and propagated in time by means of a "zero-measurement" probability hypothesis density filter. The proposed BP-based SLAM algorithm has a low computational complexity and scales well in all relevant system parameters. Experimental results using both synthetically generated measurements and realultra-wideband radio signals demonstrate the excellent performance of the algorithm in challenging indoor environments.

Our method can also be extended for multiple target nodes. We remark that {{in a large scale}} WSN, it is common to localize target nodes in a sequential way [23]. The target nodes that have enough anchors are localized first. Then, the located target nodes can be viewed as new anchors that can facilitate the localization of other target nodes. Therefore, the multiple-anchors-one-target scenario here is of practical interest. We can even consider a case with a moving anchor, in which a ranging signal is periodically transmitted by the target node, and all the positions where the moving anchor receives the ranging signal are viewed as the fixed positions of some <b>virtual</b> <b>anchors.</b> We assume that all the anchors are synchronized, and their clock skews are equal to 1, whereas the clock of the target node runs freely. Furthermore, we assume that the target node transmits a ranging signal, and all the anchors act as receivers. We remark that other systems may share the same data model such as a passive sensor array for source localization or a GPS system, where a GPS receiver locates itself by exploring the received ranging signals from several satellites [1]. All the satellites are synchronized to an atomic clock, but the GPS receiver has a clock offset relative to the satellite clock. Note that this is a stricter synchronization requirement than ours, as we allow the clock of the target node to run freely. Every satellite sends a ranging signal and a corresponding transmission time. The GPS receiver measures the TOAs, and calculates the time-of-flight (TOF) plus an unknown offset. In this section, TOA measurements are used, and TDOA measurements are employed in the next section.|$|R

The stress intensity factor at the wing crack tip is used as the basis for evaluating the stability and the calculated results are compared with the results produced by the virtual spring model (the calculation model which enables the anchor to be equivalent with the virtual spring). The crack-propagation prevention capacity of the entity element with bending degree of freedom is obviously better than that of the <b>virtual</b> spring <b>anchor</b> which only has tension and compression degree of freedom. The calculated results reveal the disadvantage of virtual spring model which is widely applied in engineering and more practical and effective method is brought forward. The conclusion can be offer reference to design and construction of similar engineering...|$|R
40|$|Massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing games (MMORPGs) produce dynamic socio-ludic {{worlds that}} nurture both culture and gameplay to shape experiences. Despite the persistent {{nature of these}} games, however, the <b>virtual</b> spaces that <b>anchor</b> these worlds {{may not always be}} able to exist in perpetuity. Encouraging a community to migrate from one space to another is a challenge now facing some game developers. This paper examines the case of Guild Wars® and its “Hall of Monuments”, a feature that bridges the accomplishments of players from the current game to the forthcoming sequel. Two factor analyses describe the perspectives of 105 and 187 self-selected participants. The results reveal four factors affecting attitudes towards the feature, but they do not strongly correlate with existing motivational frameworks, and {{significant differences were found between}} different cultures within the game. This informs a discussion about the implications and facilitation of such transitions, investigating themes of capital, value perception and assumptive worlds. It is concluded that the way subcultures produce meaning needs to be considered when attempting to preserve the socio-cultural landscape...|$|R
40|$|Can virtual environments promote {{learning}} {{skills such}} that higher education students understand them? This paper examines {{the impact of}} new online educational scenarios as to how self-learning skills are perceived. The research covered 277 higher education students grouped into classrooms, and their tutoring included an online learning component. At {{the end of the}} academic semester, students responded to a range of self-learning skills adapted to learning in virtual environments. All participants attended Social and Human Sciences course units in higher education, in different institutions, respectively the State Public University and Private Polytechnic institutions. The results of the study show that <b>virtual</b> learning environments, <b>anchored</b> in a design focused on the development of skills and in a teaching model based on the principles of constructivism, autonomy and interaction can be positive in how higher education students perceive learning skills, according to the following dimensions: Active Learning, Learning Initiative and Autonomy. The study examines the implications of the findings, from the perspective of both the practical intervention and the reflection on the future of educational processes.

40|$|Geographic routing is an {{appealing}} routing strategy {{that uses the}} location information of the nodes to route the data. This technique uses only local information of the communication graph topology and does not require computational effort to build routing table or equivalent data structures. A particularly efficient implementation of this paradigm is greedy routing, where along the data path the nodes forward the data to a neighboring node that {{is closer to the}} destination. The decreasing distance to the destination implies the success of the routing scheme. A related problem is to consider an abstract graph and decide whether there exists an embedding of the graph in a metric space, called a greedy embedding, such that greedy routing guarantees the delivery of the data. A common approach to assign geographic coordinates is to measure distances (for instance the distances between neighboring nodes) and compute (virtual) coordinates. The rationale of the <b>Virtual</b> raw <b>Anchor</b> Coordinate System (VRAC) is to use the (raw) measured distances as coordinates in order to avoid further computations. More precisely, each node needs to measure three distances. In this paper, we investigate the existence of greedy routing in the VRAC coordinate system using a metric free characterization of greedy paths that is more general than in previous works. We show that if the graph is saturated (see definition in the text) then the greedy algorithm guarantees delivery. Interestingly, the approach of greediness here applies to Schnyder drawings of planar triangulations. Indeed, by choosing the measured distances appropriately Schnyder drawings of planar triangulations are always saturated and hence our greedy routing algorithm succeeds. The VRAC coordinates have conditions to satisfy to make greedy routing successful. These conditions can be inferred from geometric considerations. However, we formulate these conditions in an abstract way in order to avoid geometric considerations and in order to make possible further derivation of virtual VRAC coordinate systems, i. e. using only the abstract graph description. In particular using only local information would lead to distributed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|When Internet {{technology}} {{entered into}} popular {{culture in the}} 1990 s, the virtual dominated the discourse with talk of cyber-worlds, fragmented communities and disembodied individuals. Today, location and social connection define {{the parameters of the}} media. What some call Web 2. 0 is a platform defined by an ”architecture of participation, ” where users create and distribute content within social networks (O'Reilly, 2005). This new orientation has redirected network activity away from early predictions of virtual isolation and towards a social connectivity that is decidedly located and contextual. If the early web (Web 1. 0 ?) was about giving everyone access to information, Web 2. 0 is about giving everyone access to each other. This change in network perspective that has arisen with the prominence of social software applications like Blogger, Myspace and Facebook, has focused user attention away from anonymous and placeless network activity to identified and located activity. In this essay, I examine changes in the popular understanding of digital space and digital subjectivity. I begin with a discussion of the metaphor of mapping in postmodernism and cyberspace and I suggest that such metaphors, premised on the conceptual distinction between real and virtual, have given way to the localized and embodied mapping of Web 2. 0. Technical, industrial and cultural changes in digital culture {{over the past several years}} have created a distinct digital social space wherein the <b>virtual</b> world is <b>anchored</b> by the growing and persistent visibility and parallel commodification of everyday life...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{method for}} obtaining a {{topology}} preserving map from Virtual Coordinates of a sensor network is presented. In a Virtual Coordinate System (VCS), a node is identified by a vector containing its distances, in hops, {{to a set}} of anchor nodes. VCS is a higher dimensional abstraction of the connectivity map of sensors, with dimensionality defined by the number of anchors. Physical layout information such as physical voids and even relative physical positions of sensor nodes with respect to X-Y directions are absent in a VCS description, and obtaining the physical topology has not been possible up to now. A novel technique, based on Singular Value Decomposition, is presented to extract a topology-preserving map from VCS. Three options with different computation and communication complexities, as a result of using different subsets of coordinates as the input, are presented and analyzed; the input for the three cases consists of a) the entire virtual coordinate set, b) only the <b>virtual</b> coordinates of <b>anchors,</b> and c) <b>virtual</b> coordinates of a random set of nodes. Evaluation results indicate that last two approaches achieve comparable accuracy to the first, but with significantly less complexity. Topology preserving maps for networks representing a variety of topologies and shapes are extracted. A new metric termed Topology Preservation Error (� ��) is defined to evaluate the topology preservation; it accounts for both the number of node flips and degree of the flips. The techniques extract topology-preserving maps with � � � less than 2 %...|$|R
40|$|We study an {{interactive}} live streaming scenario where multiple peers pull streams {{of the same}} free viewpoint video that are synchronized in time but not necessarily in view. In free viewpoint video, each user can periodically select a virtual view between two anchor camera views for display. The virtual view is synthesized using texture and depth videos of the anchor views via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). In general, the distortion of the virtual view increases with {{the distance to the}} anchor views, and hence it is beneficial for a peer to select the closest anchor views for synthesis. On the other hand, if peers interested in different virtual views are willing to tolerate larger distortion in using more distant anchor views, they can collectively share the access cost of common anchor views. Given anchor view access cost and synthesized distortion of <b>virtual</b> views between <b>anchor</b> views, we study the optimization of anchor view allocation for collaborative peers. We first show that, if the network reconfiguration costs due to view-switching are negligible, the problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming. We then consider the case of non-negligible reconfiguration costs (e. g., large or frequent view-switching leading to anchor-view changes). In this case, the view allocation problem becomes NP-hard. We thus present a locally optimal and centralized allocation algorithm inspired by Lloyd's algorithm in non-uniform scalar quantization. We also propose a distributed algorithm with guaranteed convergence where each peer group independently make merge-and-split decisions with a well-defined fairness criteria. The results show that depending on the problem settings, our proposed algorithms achieve respective optimal and close-to-optimal performance in terms of total cost, and outperform a P 2 P scheme without collaborative anchor selection...|$|R
