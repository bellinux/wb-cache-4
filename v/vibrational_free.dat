40|$|We {{present a}} novel cluster-expansion (CE) {{approach}} for the first-principles modeling of temperature and concentration dependent alloy properties. While the standard CE method includes temperature effects only via the configurational entropy in Monte Carlo simulations, our strategy also covers the first-principles free energies of lattice vibrations. To this end, the effective cluster interactions of the CE have been rendered genuinely temperature dependent, {{so that they}} can include the <b>vibrational</b> <b>free</b> energies of the input structures. As a model system we use the phase-separating alloy Fe-Cu with our focus on the Fe-rich side. There, the solubility is derived from Monte Carlo simulations, whose precision had to be increased by averaging multiple CEs. We show that including the <b>vibrational</b> <b>free</b> energy is absolutely vital for the correct first-principles prediction of Cu solubility in the bcc Fe matrix: The solubility tremendously increases and is now in quantitative agreement with experimental findings...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{report a}} quasichemical model for point defect {{equilibrium}} in Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS). An ab initio calculation {{was used to}} estimate {{the changes in the}} phonon spectrum of CZTS due to trial point defects and further <b>vibrational</b> <b>free</b> energy, which in turn influences the final defect concentrations. We identify the dominant point defects and estimate the free carrier concentrations as functions of the Zn, Cu, and Sn chemical potentials, the sulfur chemical potential being set by the vapor-solid equilibrium with elemental S at the same temperature as the sample (one-zone annealing). As hinted by calculated low formation enthalpies, either the Cu vacancy (V-Cu(-)) or Cu on Zn antisite (Cu-Zn(-)) acceptors are expected to dominate over a wide range of cation chemical potentials. However, the sulfur vacancy (V-S(2 +)) becomes a dominant compensating donor especially for one-zone annealing conditions. We also find that different native defects induce distinct perturbations to the <b>vibrational</b> <b>free</b> energy, resulting in non-trivial qualitative and quantitative shifts in the defect equilibrium. At typical annealing temperatures and Zn-rich conditions, this may introduce especially strong modulations in the concentrations of Zn-Sn(2 -) and, contrary to enthalpic predictions, of Zn-Cu(+) compensating donors. The modeling indicates that one-zone processing should result in CZTS, which is p-type but extremely compensated because native donor defects are stabilized by the low Fermi level and finite-temperature effects...|$|E

The solution energies of the bcc Nb-rich and hcp Zr-rich solid solutions obtained {{within the framework of}} density functional theory are in good agreement with experimental data, although insufficient for a quantitative description of the miscibility gap, for which non configurational entropy has to be accounted for. Whereas electronic free energies can be neglected, we show, using the harmonic approximation and the density functional perturbation theory, that both solution free energies are strongly modified by the contribution related to atomic vibrations.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] {{study examined the}} effect of fluid–structure interaction on global dynamic properties such as vibrational frequency, mode shape, modal curvature, as well as <b>free</b> <b>vibrational</b> responses along E-glass composite, carbon composite, and aluminum beams, respectively. The digital image correlation technique {{was used to measure}} the <b>free</b> <b>vibrational</b> responses along the beams in air and water, respectively. The vibration submerged in water exhibited higher frequency modes than the dry vibration under the same excitation. Experimental modal analysis showed that the mode shapes were very close for an aluminum beam with and without the FSI effect while there was a modest difference for a carbon composite beam because the FSI effect is greater for the composite beam. Modal curvatures for the both beams are more influenced by FSI, especially for the composite beam. The curvature {{is directly related to the}} bending strain of the beam. This explains why the difference in strains measured for composite structures in air and water, respectively, varies significantly from location to location of the structures under impact loading. One location has much greater difference in strains than another location. The FSI can change potential failure locations of the composite structures because of the change in modal curvatures...|$|R

The performance of the force fields is compared to several popular dispersion corrected density functional methods. In addition, we present our implementation of lattice <b>vibrational</b> <b>free</b> energy calculations in the quasi-harmonic approximation, using several methods to account for phonon dispersion. This allows us to also benchmark the force fields' reproduction of finite temperature crystal structures. The results demonstrate that anisotropic atom-atom multipole-based force fields can be as accurate as several popular DFT-D methods, but have errors 2 - 3 times larger than the current best DFT-D methods. The largest error in the examined force fields is a systematic underestimation of the (absolute) lattice energy...|$|E

40|$|At the {{interface}} between protein and double-stranded DNA, stair motifs simultaneously involve three different types of pairwise interactions: aromatic base stacking, hydrogen bonding, and cation-π. The relative importance of these interactions is studied in the stair motif occurring in the 1 TC 3 crystal structure, which involves an arginine and two stacked guanines, by means of Hartree-Fock (HF) and Møller-Plesset energy and free energy calculations, including vibrational, rotational, translational contributions, both in a vacuum and various solvents. The results obtained show an anti-cooperative tendency of the HF energy and <b>vibrational</b> <b>free</b> energy terms, and the cooperativity of the rotational, translational, and solvation free energies.

40|$|Femtosecond stimulated Raman {{spectroscopy}} (FSRS) is a {{new technique}} that produces high-quality <b>vibrational</b> spectra <b>free</b> from background fluorescence. FSRS combines a narrow-bandwidth picosecond Raman pump pulse with an approximately 80 fs continuum probe pulse to produce stimulated Raman spectra from the pump-induced gain in the probe spectrum. The high intensity of the Raman pump combined with the broad bandwidth of the probe produces high signal-to-noise vibrational spectra with very short data acquisition times. FSRS spectra of standard solutions and solvents such as aqueous Na 2 SO 4, aqueous KNO 3, methanol, isopropanol, and cyclohexane are collected in seconds. Furthermore, stimulated Raman spectra can be obtained using just a single pump-probe pulse pair that illuminates the sample for only approximately 1 ps. Fluorescence rejection is demonstrated by collecting FSRS spectra of dyes (rhodamine 6 G, chlorophyll a, and DTTCI) {{with varying degrees of}} fluorescence background and resonance enhancement. The high signal-to-noise, short data acquisition time, fluorescence rejection, and high spectral and temporal resolution of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy make it a valuable new vibrational spectroscopic technique...|$|R

The density-functional linear-response approach {{is used to calculate}} the volume-dependent phonon frequencies needed for computing the <b>vibrational</b> <b>free</b> energy within the quasiharmonic approximation. We show that the transformation from a close-packed structure at low temperatures to the bcc phase upon heating is driven by the large vibrational entropy associated with low-energy phonon modes in bcc Li. In addition, we find that the strength of the electron-phonon interaction in Li is strongly dependent on crystal structure. The coupling strength is significantly reduced in the low-temperature close-packed phases as compared to the bcc phase, and is consistent with the observed lack of a superconducting transition in Li.
