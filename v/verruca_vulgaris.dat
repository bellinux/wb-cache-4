40|$|M. Tech. <b>Verrucae</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> {{commonly}} known as warts are benign growths due to infection with papillomaviruses, which occur mainly on the hands and feet (Gawkrodger, 2002). Verrucae are caused by a virus, the human papillomavirus (HPV) (Fitzpatrick and Aeling, 2001). Verrucae are a common skin problem, which account for approximately 5 %- 10 % of the skin conditions seen in patients in many countries. The peak incidence ranging {{between the ages of}} 12 and 16, rarely being found in infants and the elderly (Gibbs and Degreef, 1997). Thuja occidentalis is a common homoeopathic remedy that has historically been used for the treatment of wart-like excrescences on cutaneous surfaces of the skin (Vermeulen, 1994). Based on homoeopathic principles, the toxicological symptoms of this remedy gives the therapeutic indications for which it is prescribed. Ricini oleum, {{commonly known}} as castor oil, for which there is an unknown mode of action, has been recommended for various cutaneous complaints, when applied externally (Grieves and Leyel, 1998). To date insufficient research has been conducted to confirm the effects of Thuja occidentalis and Ricini oleum on <b>verrucae</b> <b>vulgaris.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of homoeopathically prepared, externally applied, Thuja occcidentalis 6 cH and Ricini oleum 6 cH, in the treatment of common warts, <b>verrucae</b> <b>vulgaris.</b> The study was a contextual, placebo controlled, double-blind research study. Forty-five participants ranging from 5 to 60 years old were recruited for this study. Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected (Appendix A). Suitable participants completed a consent form, explaining all aspects of the study (Appendix B). Participants were required to complete a participant profile form, as well as an initial subjective questionnaire after which they were randomly placed into one of three treatment groups (Appendix C). Each participant was given a 25 ml amber glass dropper bottle, which contained either Thuja occidentalis 6 cH, Ricini oleum 6 cH or the placebo. The placebo group was shared with another researcher conducting a similar study. The solutions were administered topically; two drops twice daily v and treatment lasted for ten days. A maximum of two verrucae were treated throughout the study and these lesions were kept covered at all times with a waterproof elastoplaster. Changes in symptoms were documented according to a questionnaire (Appendix D). The verrucae being treated were evaluated on three occasions; one day prior to commencement of the clinical trial, on day five of the trial, as well as on day ten. Each assessment involved photographs and physical measurements of the verrucae, as well as a subjective questionnaire, that the participant was requested to complete. The results were statistically analysed in terms of change in length, width and height of the verrucae. Results for the categorical responses were cross-tabulated with the respective treatments and chi-square tests were performed to compare efficacy of treatments. For the measured responses, the Friedman two-way analysis of verrucae was used to compare the responses to each treatment i. e. before, during and after each treatment. Based on the outcomes of this study, it was revealed that all three treatment groups responded with significant results, in terms of a decrease in overall size of the verrucae lesions. Two of the experimental groups, namely the Thuja occidentalis 6 cH and the Ricini oleum 6 cH groups, illustrated an overall decrease in size of verrucae from the start to the end of the clinical trial. The placebo group yielded the smallest decrease in overall size of verrucae, during this study. None of the participants noticed a change in their emotional status or physical status, while participating in the clinical trial. The duration of the trial was not sufficiently long enough. In addition, further research into this topic is required to assess whether the observations that were made in this study would result in eventual cure of the condition...|$|R
40|$|Dermoscopy is a {{non-invasive}} diagnostic technique, {{which is}} performed {{by means of}} different incident light magnification systems using an oil immersion technique. It allows to observe pigmented and vascular structures, from the stratum corneum to the papillary dermis. Dermoscopy is therefore particularly useful in those skin disorders in which the stratum corneum, epidermis and papillary dermis are involved. It is mostly used for the diagnosis of pigmented skin tumours, but its usefulness has also been reported for the in vivo detection of Sarcoptes scabiei. Additionally, this technique {{may be used for}} the diagnosis of <b>verrucae</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> psoriasis and other diseases with epidermal involvement. Porokeratoses are a group of disorders of keratinization characterized by annular lesions surrounded by a characteristic keratotic border which corresponds to a typical histopathologic feature, namely, the cornoid lamella. The cornoid lamella is a column of parakeratotic cells placed on a depression of the epidermis where the granular layer is absent. Though nonpathognomonic, the cornoid lamella is the most distinctive feature of the various types of porokeratosis. These varieties include the plaque type originally described by Mibelli (few lesions located on the extremities with a cornoid lamella which could be thick up to 10 mm); the superficial disseminated and superficial actinic forms, the punctate variant of palms and soles and the linear type all sharing similar histopathologic features.

40|$|Abstract Background The human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) E 2 protein is a multifunctional DNA-binding protein. The transcriptional activity of HPV E 2 is mediated by binding to its specific binding {{sites in the}} upstream regulatory region of the HPV genomes. Previously we reported a HPV- 2 variant from a <b>verrucae</b> <b>vulgaris</b> patient with huge extensive clustered cutaneous, which have five point mutations in its E 2 ORF, L 118 S, S 235 P, Y 287 H, S 293 R and A 338 V. Under the control of HPV- 2 LCR, co-expression of the mutated HPV E 2 induced an increased activity on the viral early promoter. In the present study, a series of mammalian expression plasmids encoding E 2 proteins with one to five amino acid (aa) substitutions for these mutations were constructed and transfected into HeLa, C 33 A and SiHa cells. Results CAT expression assays indicated that the enhanced promoter activity {{was due to the}} co-expressions of the E 2 constructs containing A 338 V mutation within the DNA-binding domain. Western blots analysis demonstrated that the transiently transfected E 2 expressing plasmids, regardless of prototype or the A 338 V mutant, were continuously expressed in the cells. To study the effect of E 2 mutations on its DNA-binding activity, a serial of recombinant E 2 proteins with various lengths were expressed and purified. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that the binding affinity of E 2 protein with A 338 V mutation to both an artificial probe with two E 2 binding sites or HPV- 2 and HPV- 16 promoter-proximal LCR sequences were significantly stronger than that of the HPV- 2 prototype E 2. Furthermore, co-expression of the construct containing A 338 V mutant exhibited increased activities on heterologous HPV- 16 early promoter P 97 than that of prototype E 2. Conclusions These results suggest that the mutation from Ala to Val at aa 338 is critical for E 2 DNA-binding and its transcriptional regulation. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEpidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) is a {{well known}} {{inherited}} autosomal recessive skin disease associated with numerous early onset viral warts on the sun exposed {{parts of the body}} that usually progress into skin malignancies. Kidney transplant patients are also commonly associated with viral warts that might change into skin cancers. ObjectiveTo describe the clinical pictures of extensive viral warts with skin malignancies in kidney transplant patients in comparison with inherited (EV) features. Patients and methodsThis case controlled study that included 130 patients with kidney transplantation was done in kidney transplantation centers in Baghdad and Al-Karma Teaching Hospitals during December 2002 to September 2004. All recruited patients were receiving multiple immunosuppressive drugs like methyl prednisolone succinate, oral prednisolone, azathioprine and cyclosporine. History was taken from all patients including all the relevant points. These patients were divided into three groups according to the duration of kidney transplant: group A 1 – 10 years, group B 11 – 20 years and group C more than 20 years. Biopsies were performed from the viral warts lesions and the associated tumors. Two hundred and sixty apparently healthy individuals, 206 males and 54 females had been examined as control cases for the presence of viral warts and tumors. These control cases had been taken randomly from general population in multiple regions in Baghdad. ResultsSixty-five patients out of 130 with kidney transplantation had viral warts. Their ages ranged from 20 to 71 (45. 49 ±SD 10. 82) years, 51 males and 14 females, while the duration of the warts ranged from 0. 5 to 10 (3. 74 ±SD 2. 67) years. The distribution of patients with viral warts among the groups was as follows: group A 28 (43. 1 %), group B 30 (46. 2 %) and group C 7 (10. 7 %) cases. Viral warts were seen in 10 (3. 8 %) of the control group. There were statistically significant differences between patients and control cases (P value < 0. 001). Most of the viral warts in patients with kidney transplantation were multiple and of the <b>verrucae</b> <b>vulgaris</b> type. They were mainly located on the exposed areas of the body, mostly on the face and dorsa of hands. Skin malignancies were observed in 6 (9. 2 %) cases: five squamous cell carcinomas and one case of basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma was mainly located on the lower lips in 3 cases and 2 on the dorsa of hands, while basal cell carcinoma was observed on the nose. Two cases (7. 1 %) of squamous cell carcinoma were seen in group A, 2 (6. 6 %) in group B and 1 (14 %) in group C. One case of basal cell carcinoma was noted in group B. No skin malignancy was observed in the control group. ConclusionKidney transplant patients have an increased susceptibility to infection with human papilloma virus and have served as a model for viral induced carcinogenesis. This collection of features deserves the term “acquired epidermodysplasia verruciformis”...|$|R
40|$|Background and Design: The {{definition}} of emergent diseases includes potentially risky diseases that need urgent medical intervention. Diagnostic and therapeutic processes are managed mostly at ourpatient setting in dermatology. Therefore, {{it is unclear}} that which diseases are real emergencies and which patients apply urgently. There are a few studies assessing this topic. Our aim was to evaluate patients referred to our clinic urgently, and to review the concept of ‘‘real dermatologic emergency’’ by comparing dermatologic emergency patients and outpatients. Material and Method: A total of 800 patients (400 urgent patients, 400 outpatients) were included. Demographic features, complaints, disease duration and severity, whether the disease occurs {{for the first time}} were questionned, application time and diagnosis were recorded. The opinions of patients and physicians were inquired about why they thought that the disease was emergent. Results: Most common skin diseases were acute urticaria-angioedema, contact dermatitis, and insect bite in emergency patients; acne <b>vulgaris,</b> <b>verruca</b> and tinea pedis in outpatients. Itching was more common in emergency patients. Emergency patients' complaints were more severe than those of outpatients. Patients who experience disease first time applied to emergency service more than others. Emergency patients had a shorter disease duration than outpatients. Patients and physicians revealed different reasons and criteria about the urgency of the diseases. 93. 5 % of patients and 49 % of physicians thought that existing disease was emergent. Conclusion: Our data reveal that the concept of dermatologic emergency is unsettled. It changes according to socio-cultural, personal features and to the present health system. Determination of the main criteria of the {{definition of}} “dermatologic urgent”, and training of dermatologists, emergency centers’physicians and also of patients in this regard seem to be a necessity to decrease pseudo-emergencies...|$|R

In this study, 29 genital warts in girls less than 5 years of age were examined for nongenital and genital tract HPVs by in situ hybridization. These results were compared with 275 vulvar lesions clinically suspicious for condyloma from adults. Of the 27 HPV-related lesions in young girls, 11 (41 %) were due to HPV 2 whereas the other 16 (59 %) were associated with HPV 6 / 11 infection. Of the 214 / 275 (78 %) HPV positive vulvar lesions in adults, 6 (3 %) were due to HPV 2 whereas 202 / 214 (94 %) contained HPVs 6 / 11; 1 lesion contained HPV 16 and the 5 other lesions contained HPV 42, 43, or 44. Histologic correlation documented that the vulvar lesions positive for HPV 2 commonly showed the marked hyperkeratosis typical of <b>verruca</b> <b>vulgaris.</b> However, the verrucous pattern was present in lesions HPV 6 / 11 positive.

Vacuolation of cells in the upper epidermal layers was observed histologically in both virus-positive and virus-negative papillomas, and the histologically recognizable characteristics of virus-positive papillomas appeared to be the swelling of the nucleus, peripheral accumulation of the chromatin and clearly distinguished nucleoli in vacuolated cells. These nuclear changes were also observed electron microscopically. Malignant histological features were observed in 1 case of epidermodysplasia verruciformis, 1 case of oral papilloma, 1 case of laryngeal papilloma, and 1 case of familial intestinal polyposis. The significances of these findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-one {{patients}} with psoriasis were studied for concomitant diseases and compared with 61 age and sex-matched controls. Concomitant cutaneous diseases most often seen with psoriasis were {{lichen simplex chronicus}} (16. 3 &#x 0025;), <b>verruca</b> <b>vulgaris</b> (9. 8 &#x 0025;) and me Iasina (4. 9 &#x 0025;). Of the systemic disorders, diabetes showed the highest frequency (13. 1 &#x 0025;) followed by hypertension (8. 1 &#x 0025;). Two patients had HIV infection (3. 2 &#x 0025;). Both the patients had severe and atypical lesions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Papilloma virus infections of {{the oral}} cavity have long been {{recognized}} and various clinical expressions have been characterised including <b>verruca</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> focal epithelial hyperplasia (Heck&#x 2032;s disease), multiple papillomas and condyloma acuminata 1, 2. Concurrent papilloma virus infection of the genital and oral tissues has also been reported. Verrucase on the oral mucosa are not that common and usually present as sessile exophytic growths which may at times {{be very difficult to}} differentiate from oral condylomas and papillomas clinically...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{squamous}} cell carcinoma is relatively rare and may present a diagnostic challenge by mimicking benign conditions, such as <b>verruca</b> <b>vulgaris.</b> We describe two patients with longstanding verrucous lesions of the nail bed, which proved to be {{squamous cell}} carcinoma at the histopathology examination, with molecular and cytological evidence of HPV infection. Complete excision was performed. The cases highlight {{the necessity of a}} high index of suspicion in longstanding verrucous lesions of the digits, resistant to conventional anti-verruca vulgaris treatments...|$|E
40|$|A 47 -year-old {{diabetic}} Japanese female {{presented with}} verrucous lesions over the both first metatarsal heads. A neurological examination showed neuropathy with both sensory and motor loss on the feet, and distal lower legs. Althouth a historogical analysis revealed hyperkeratosis, acanthopapillomatosis, and vacuolated keratinocytes in the epidermis as <b>verruca</b> <b>vulgaris,</b> we werenot {{able to detect}} papillomaviruses by means of immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The Pathogenesis of these verrucorus lesions {{might be related to}} chronic pressure or friction in an area of neuropathy...|$|E
40|$|Verrucous {{carcinoma}} is a rare, low-grade, well-differentiated {{squamous cell}} carcinoma most commonly seen on mucosa. It has been infrequently reported to occur on the skin, where it is a slow-growing and locally aggressive tumour. It {{is not uncommon for}} cutaneous verrucous carcinomas to be mistaken for the more frequent <b>verruca</b> <b>vulgaris</b> and treated accordingly. Three cases of cutaneous verrucous carcinoma are presented with the medical history and follow-up data. Surgery is the treatment of choice; these lesions may sustain a potentially anaplastic transformation after radiation therapy.
