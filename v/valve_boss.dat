40|$|Micro-Gas-Analyzers {{have many}} {{applications}} in detecting chemical compounds {{present in the}} air. MEMS valves are used to perform sampling of gasses, as they enable control of fluid flow at the micro level. Current generation electrostatically actuated MEMS valves were tested to determine their ability to hold off a given gauge pressure with an applied voltage. Current valve designs were able to hold off 98 psi with only 82 V applied to the valves. The valves were determined to be 1. 83 times more efficient than older valve designs, due to increasing the electrostatic area of the valve and trapping oxide between polysilicon layers. Newer valve designs were also proposed and modeled using ANSYS multiphysics, which {{should be able to}} hold off 100 psi with only 29 V needed. This performance would be 2. 82 times more efficient than current designs, or 5. 17 times more efficient than older valve designs. This will be accomplished by further increasing the valve radius and decreasing the gap between the <b>valve</b> <b>boss</b> and electrode...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{combination}} of a micromachined silicon valve with low dead volume and a bi-stable electromagnetic actuator produced by conventional machining is presented. The silicon valve part, 7 × 7 × 1 mm 3 in dimensions, is a sandwich construction of two KOH etched silicon wafers {{with a layer of}} chemical resistant silicone rubber bonded in between. This middle layer provides the flexibility needed to move the <b>valve</b> <b>boss</b> positioned in the top wafer during valve operation, but also results in improved sealing if the valve is closed. In order to drive the valve, a dedicated bi-stable electromagnetic actuator has been designed by applying a finite element software package. The resulting actuator consists of a spring-biased armature that can move 0. 2 mm up and down in a magnetically soft iron housing, incorporating a permanent magnet and a coil. This large stroke makes the valve particle tolerant. A major advantage of the bi-stable design is that only electrical energy is needed to switch the valve between the open and closed state. The actuator has been manufactured by conventional machining and was attached to the individual silicon valve parts resulting in a valve with a footprint of 7 × 7 mm 2 and a height of 21 mm. The valve showed an open/closed ratio of more than 100 at 0. 1 bar...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{characterization}} {{of a series}} of electrostatically actuated active microfluidic valves is to be performed. Tests are performed on a series of 24 valves from two different MEMS sets. Focus is on the physical deformation of the structures under variable pressure loadings, as well as voltage levels. Other issues that inhibit proper performance of the valves are observed, addressed and documented as well. Many microfluidic applications have need for the distribution of gases at finely specified pressures and times. To this end a series of electrostatically actuated active valves have been fabricated. Eight separate silicon die are discussed, each with a series of four active valves present. The devices are designed such that the <b>valve</b> <b>boss</b> is held at a ground, with a voltage applied to lower contacts. Resulting electrostatic forces pull the boss down against a series of stops, intended to create a seal as well as prevent accidental shorting of the device. They have been uniquely packaged atop a stack of material layers, which have inlaid channels for application of fluid flow to the backside of the valve. Electrical contact is supplied from the underlying printed circuit board, attached to external supplies and along traces on the silicon. Pressure is supplied from a reservoir of house compressed air, up to 100 Psig. This is routed through a Norgren R 07 - 200 -RGKA pressure regulator, rated to 150 Psig. From there flow passes a manually operated ball valve, and to a flow meter. Two flow meters were utilized; initially an Omega FMA 1802 rated at 10 sccm, and followed by a Flocat model for higher flow rates up to 100 sccm. An Omega DPG 4000 - 500 pressure gauge produced pressure measurements. Optical measurements were returned via a WYKO Interferometry probe station. This would allow for determination of physical deformations of the device under a variety of voltage and pressure loads. This knowledge could lead to insight as to the failure mechanisms of the device, yielding improvements for subsequent fabrications...|$|E

Significant improvements {{have been made}} from pump to pump including the design and fabrication of a double-sided check <b>valve,</b> a <b>bossed</b> silicone membrane, and silicone gaskets. Water flow rates of up to 13 ml/min and a maximum back pressure of 5. 9 kPa were achieved through pneumatic operation with an external compressed air source. Using a custom designed solenoid actuator, flow rates of up to 4. 5 ml/min and a maximum back pressure of 2. 1 kPa have been demonstrated...|$|R

[...] Phil Harrison, Corporate vice president at Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, announces Microsoft Studios is investing over billion into exclusive Xbox One games content, twice of that of its competitors.Julie Larson-Green is appointed head of the Xbox division, succeeding Don Mattrick, who leaves Microsoft Studios to join Zynga as Chief Executive Officer on July 1, 2013; and Jason Holtman, formerly <b>Valve's</b> Steam <b>boss,</b> joins Microsoft Studios as the head of PC Gaming Division and Strategy. On December 6, Microsoft decided to close the Victoria Studio with explanation to focus on Vancouver based studio, Black Tusk. However Victoria didn't develop any games.|$|R
