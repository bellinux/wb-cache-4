25|$|Staple fibers are spun in an {{intrinsic}} viscosity range that lies rather somewhat lower {{and that should}} be between 0.58 and 0.62 dℓ/g. In this case, too, the required viscosity can be adjusted via drying or vacuum adjustment in case of <b>vacuum</b> <b>extrusion.</b> For adjusting the viscosity, however, an addition of chain length modifier like ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol can also be used.|$|E
40|$|Dense prehydrated {{geosynthetic}} clay liners (DPH-GCLs) are {{a particular}} type of GCL which, unlike conventional GCLs manufactured with dry bentonite, contain bentonite prehydrated during manufacturing. DPH-GCLs are produced by a patented process that includes bentonite prehydration with a polymer solution and <b>vacuum</b> <b>extrusion.</b> This paper describes the results of permeability tests that were carried out using flexible-wall permeameters to investigate the hydraulic conductivity of a DPH GCL to water, natural seawater and a 12. 5 mmol/L CaCl 2 solution. Moreover, the efficiency of the 0. 1 m overlap seams between DPH-GCL panels has been investigated by means of a medium-scale permeameter able to accommodate specimens 0. 305 m in diameter. Test results showed that the DPH GCL has very low hydraulic conductivity to water (1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} phase of our studies of the {{contaminants}} and their levels in curbside-collected poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) subjected to a recycling process, we analysed the washed and dried, shredded PET (flake). Of the semi-volatile contaminants found, 26 were below the US FDA threshold of 215 ppb and six were above. Additionally, it was found that surface levels of contaminants far exceeded average concentrations in the bulk of the flake, raising questions about the appropriateness of sampling procedures. In this second phase (again using dichloromethane Soxhlet extractions for the most part), we examined contaminant levels after the flake was subjected to <b>vacuum</b> <b>extrusion,</b> to complete the recycling process. Initially amorphous, extruded pellets were annealed to introduce crystallinity and allow grinding, in order to examine the effect of particle size. Much reduced concentrations of contaminants were found (all 300 - 425 µm and > 425 - 700 µm), approximately 8 h were required for the unground annealed pellets...|$|E

Via flash vacuum pyrolysis even metaparacyclophanes as small and strained as the hitherto unknown oxa[1. 5]metaparacyclophane could be prepared as a side product en route to combretastatin D- 2 by synchronous extrusion of SO 2 and CO 2.

40|$|Abstract. α-SiC {{particles}} {{have been}} processed with surface treatment of high-temperature calcination and water washing technology. SiCp/Al- 30 Si composite has been prepared in the <b>vacuum</b> hot <b>extrusion</b> process. The powder morphology and specimens microstructure {{have been observed}} using scanning electron microscopy, the phase of SiC has been analyzed using the X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, the tensile strength and thermal expansion coefficient of the composite have been tested. The effects of the morphology of the SiC particles, tensile strength and thermal expansion coefficient have been studied on composite microstructure. The consequences show that, after the surface treatment SiCp/Al- 30 Si composite, the interfaces combined with matrix are in a better condition and less holes, the tensile strength of composite materials has been improved significantly, the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} becomes lower than before. As the aerospace and automobile parts develop to the evolution direction of light, low-cost, high performance and high reliability. Which come up with a higher demand on the properties of the materials, traditional materials can not meet the development needs in the field of aerospace and automobile. SiC reinforced Al-Si-based composite material makes up for the inherent shortcomings of traditional materials, along with the deepening research of SiC reinforcement of Al-Si-base...|$|R
40|$|Decontamination cover forming {{cracks and}} vent cup {{assembly}} leaks through the decontamination covers were early manufacturing problems. The decontamination cover total manufacturing process yield was {{as low as}} 55 %. Applicable tooling and procedures were examined. All manufacturing steps from foil fabrication to final assembly leak testing were considered as possible causes or contributing factors to these problems. The following principal changes were made to correct these problems: (1) the foil annealing temperature was reduced from 1375 {degrees} to 1250 {degrees}C, (2) the decontamination cover fabrication procedure (including visual inspection for surface imperfections and elimination of superfluous operations) was improved, (3) the postforming dye penetrant inspection procedure was revised for increased sensitivity, (4) a postforming (prewelding) 1250 {degrees}C/ 1 h vacuum stress-relief operation was added, (5) a poststress relief (prewelding) decontamination cover piece-part leak test was implemented, (6) the hold-down fixture used during the decontamination cover-to-cup weld was modified, and concomitantly, and (7) the foil fabrication process was changed from the extruding and rolling of 63 -mm-diam <b>vacuum</b> arc-remelted ingots (<b>extrusion</b> process) to the rolling of 19 -mm-square arc-melted drop castings (drop cast process). Since these changes were incorporated, the decontamination cover total manufacturing process yield has been 91 %. Most importantly, more than 99 % of the decontamination covers welded onto vent cup assemblies were acceptable. The drastic yield improvement is attributed primarily to {{the change in the}} foil annealing temperature from 1375 {degrees} to 1250 {degrees}C and secondarily to the improvements in the decontamination cover fabrication procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this article reviews the history of durum wheat variety {{development}} in Canada, and how quality models are developed and continue to evolve in response to market feedback. Key technological factors that shaped durum wheat quality requirements in the 1950 s through the 1980 s were the adoption of the continuous <b>vacuum</b> <b>extrusion</b> process and Teflon die inserts, which placed greater emphasis on pasta appearance. In addition, there was growing awareness that stronger gluten is associated with firmer pasta texture. In the 1990 s the use of high-temperature and ultra-high temperature drying of pasta placed even more emphasis on pasta color, and the increasing use of gluten index and alveograph as gluten strength specifications drove market preference to stronger gluten. Canada continued to release varieties that met these evolving market requirements, and as a result annual production of durum wheat in Canada rose steadily from an average of about 0. 5 million metric tons (MMT) in the 1960 s to 5 MMT today. The remainder of this article summarizes results of some research projects that reflect the scope of durum wheat research at the Canadian Grain Commission. The implications of gluten strength on pasta texture are examined, with particular attention to whether blending extra-strong gluten semolina into weak gluten semolina offers any advantage in pasta texture over blending with moderate strength semolina.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Oxygen on (Nb 1 Zr) 3 Sn {{multifilament}} conductors manufactured by the Mono Element Internal Tin (MEIT) process was explored {{to improve the}} current density by refining the grain size. This followed work first done by General Electric on the Nb 3 Sn tape process. Techniques to fabricate the more difficult Nb 1 Zr composites are described and allowed fabrication of long lengths of. 254 mm diameter wire from an 88. 9 mm diameter billet. Oxygen was incorporated {{through the use of}} SnO 2 mixed with tin powder and incorporated into the core. These were compared to samples with Ti+Sn and Cu+Sn cores. Heat treatments covered the range of 700 C to 1000 C. Current density vs. H, grain size, and reaction percentages are provided for the materials tested. The Oxygen gave superior results in the temperature range of 815 - 1000 C. It also stabilized the filament geometry of the array in comparison to the other additions at the higher temperatures. At 815 C a peak in layer Jc yielded values of 2537 A/mm 2 at 12 T and 1353 A/mm 2 at 15 T, 8 - 22 % and 30 - 73 % greater respectively than 700 C values. Results with Oxygen at high temperature show the possibility of high speed continuous reaction of the composite versus the current batch or react in place methods. In general the Ti additions gave superior results at the lower reaction temperature. Future work is suggested to determine if the 815 C reaction temperature can lead to higher current density in high tin (Nb 1 Zr+Ox) 3 Sn conductors. A second technique incorporated oxygen directly into the Nb 1 Zr rods through heat treatment with Nb 2 O 5 at 1100 C for 100 hours in <b>vacuum</b> prior to <b>extrusion.</b> The majority of the filaments reduced properly in the composite but some local variations in hardness led to breakage at smaller diameters...|$|R
