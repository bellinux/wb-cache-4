40|$|This paper takes a {{first step}} towards an {{understanding}} of the mechanism of the diversification of export <b>varieties</b> <b>and</b> trading partners by focusing on intra-East Asian machinery trade. The examination of changes in the composition of export <b>varieties</b> <b>and</b> partner countries and the empirical analysis by decomposing the gravity equation into the number of <b>varieties</b> <b>and</b> the average trade value per variety are conducted. These product-line level analyses suggest that different natures between final products and parts and components and the economic development level of exporter country are important factors behind the diversification of export <b>varieties</b> <b>and</b> trading partners.
