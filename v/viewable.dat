5|$|A {{series of}} 13 TARDISODEs were also produced. These mini-episodes (approximately 60 seconds in length) served as prequels to each {{forthcoming}} episode, and {{were available for}} download to mobile phones and <b>viewable</b> at the official Doctor Who website. The TARDISODEs were recorded intermittently from 31 January to 8 April 2006.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission. In the end, however, no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is <b>viewable</b> {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is <b>viewable</b> in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E
5|$|Eurosport also {{broadcast}} {{coverage of}} the Games <b>viewable</b> in the United Kingdom. In accordance with the ITC Code, it can show live events, provided that such events can also be broadcast by the BBC (although the BBC can choose not to do so).|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, The New York Times {{launched}} its first official foreign-language variant, cn.nytimes.com, in Chinese, <b>viewable</b> in {{both traditional and}} simplified Chinese characters. The project was led by Craig S. Smith on the business side and Philip P. Pan on the editorial side.|$|E
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any <b>viewable</b> quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|Gemstones include rubies, diamonds, rhodochrosite, opal, emerald, and {{amethyst}} among others. Fossils include shark teeth, coprolites, or fossilized dung, petrified wood, dinosaur eggs, trilobites, {{and a baby}} dinosaur of the Psittacosaurus genus. One display features all 12 birthstones with {{a version}} of each in its natural state and as finished gemstones, along with the same before and after for other gemstones such as aquamarine. Around 1,000 of the specimens at the museum are only <b>viewable</b> using a microscope.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} <b>viewable</b> from the visitor centre, {{footpaths}} {{next to the}} A149 and down the East Bank, the beach and the road running from the beach {{back to the main}} road. It can be accessed by footpaths at three points, each leading to one or more bird hides. Beach Road and the beach itself form part of the Peddars Way long distance footpath.|$|E
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily <b>viewable</b> by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules <b>viewable</b> on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is <b>viewable</b> from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E
5|$|Poodle Hat was {{released}} as an Enhanced CD, meaning {{that when the}} disc is placed in a computer, bonus content (including alternate song mixes, short videos, and photo galleries) are <b>viewable.</b> The album met with mixed reviews from critics; some felt that the album represented an artistic misstep for Yankovic, whereas others enjoyed its skewering of early 2000s popular culture. The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200. The album also peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Comedy Albums chart, making it the first of Yankovic's records to earn a position on said chart.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{street names}} {{are not used}} in the development. The main {{thoroughfares}} are styled blue, white, pink, yellow, orange, purple and green where street furniture and coloured ambient lighting will be colour-coded to match. A stylised map of the site has been devised. Landscape architects, Gillespies regenerated the brownfield site to create public spaces. The focal point is a piazza and landscaped park, which stretches to the ship canal around which the buildings are located. The piazza's two distinct areas, The Green and The Stage are capable of holding events for up to 6500 people. In front of The Studios there is a free-standing big screen, which is <b>viewable</b> from the piazza.|$|E
5|$|Cross Generation of Heroes, the 2008 Wii {{version of}} Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, has an Arcade game mode: the player fights against {{artificial}} intelligence (AI)-controlled opponents {{to reach the}} final boss character, Yami from Ōkami. Time attack and Survival modes are also available, and require the player to defeat every character in the game. While Survival limits health regeneration, Time attack challenges players {{to win in the}} shortest time possible. Other modes include Vs. Mode, in which two players engage in combat, and Original Games, which sees up to four players competing in character-specific minigames. Using money obtained throughout the game, the player may purchase unlockable characters, alternate character costumes, minigames, character profiles, movies, illustrations, and background music. Once purchased, the latter four are <b>viewable</b> in a gallery. The arcade release of Cross Generation of Heroes omits the game modes, and instead features a character selection screen from which a player may compete against either AI opponents or a second player.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event <b>viewable</b> by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{world is}} portrayed from a three-quarters {{overhead}} view. The player can adjust the game's <b>viewable</b> perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the {{player in the}} early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and external storage.|$|E
5|$|Underwurlde is a {{platform}} game viewed from a side-angle perspective. The player controls Sabreman, a pith-helmeted adventurer, as he jumps between platforms in a castle and its underground caverns {{to find a}} way to escape past the exit guardians. Sabreman must use a specific weapon—knife, dagger, and torch—that corresponds to each guardian. The player uses the keyboard's QWERT keys to progress through a series of flip screens in which the player's character reaches the boundary of the <b>viewable</b> area on the screen to flip to another area, with 597 screens in all. While Sabreman begins in a castle adorned with clocks, birds, and baskets, the character must also descend down into caverns through several successive vertical screens. Sabreman automatically attaches a rope to the ceiling when the player controls him off of a ledge. The player can then swing Sabreman side to side to jump to another ledge. At the bottom of a cavern, Sabreman can ride a bubble to the top.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is <b>viewable</b> in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are <b>viewable</b> to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|The average {{lifespan}} of {{bald eagles}} {{in the wild}} is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears {{to be influenced by}} its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound in Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a cougar (Puma concolor) ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is <b>viewable</b> online although this film may have been staged.|$|E

25|$|On 27 January 2016, Zombie Evilution {{closed to}} the public and would no longer operate as a laser tag arena, the {{attraction}} was still, however, utilised as a scare-maze for special events, such as Screamworld. On 9 February, Dreamworld welcomed two female white tiger cubs from Kagoshima City, in Japan. These two cubs were <b>viewable</b> in a quarantine enclosure located in front of the Zombie Evilution attraction. On 29 February, Tiger Island closed for refurbishment, the tiger cubs were still <b>viewable</b> in a new Tiger Cub Kindy area, located in Ocean Parade.|$|E
25|$|Marine {{protected}} areas are {{included on the}} WDPA, which, since 2010 is <b>viewable</b> via , an online interactive search engine hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP-WCMC).|$|E
25|$|At Exxon Corporation, for instance, 13 1985-top-of-the-line VS300s at the Houston {{headquarters}} {{were used}} in the 1980s and into the 1990s to receive mainframe reports and make them <b>viewable</b> online by executives.|$|E
25|$|Hulu {{reached a}} deal with the NFL and had almost every episode of America's Game <b>viewable</b> for free on their website. As of late 2012, the series is no longer on Hulu.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} version, {{possibly a}} bootleg recording, exists and is <b>viewable</b> online. It features a single fixed camera shot, {{the same as}} {{is seen in the}} more common video, of the five band members miming to the song.|$|E
25|$|Fans and {{students}} will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, {{which is the}} first practice of the season. The practice is <b>viewable</b> to the public and includes skits with past players as the hosts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the average}} person, the {{diaphragm}} should be intersected by the 5th to 7th anterior ribs at the mid-clavicular line, and 9 to 10 posterior ribs should be <b>viewable</b> {{on a normal}} PA inspiratory film. An {{increase in the number}} of <b>viewable</b> ribs implies hyperinflation, as can occur, for example, with obstructive lung disease or foreign body aspiration. A decrease implies hypoventilation, as can occur with restrictive lung disease, pleural effusions or atelectasis. Underexpansion can also cause interstitial markings due to parenchymal crowding, which can mimic the appearance of interstitial lung disease. Enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery can indirectly reflect changes of pulmonary hypertension, with a size greater than 16mm abnormal in men and 15mm in women.|$|E
25|$|As {{a tourist}} attraction, {{the line is}} most popular on the Fourth of July, when the Oaks Amusement Park {{fireworks}} display is <b>viewable</b> along the river, and in mid-December, when the area's Christmas Ship Fleet parade on the Willamette can be viewed.|$|E
25|$|On 3 June 2008, {{scientists}} {{unveiled the}} largest, most detailed infra-red {{portrait of the}} Milky Way, created by stitching together more than 800,000 snapshots, at the 212th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis, Missouri. This composite survey is now <b>viewable</b> with the GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL Viewer.|$|E
25|$|Many new artists {{explicitly}} {{took up the}} Surrealist banner. Dorothea Tanning and Louise Bourgeois {{continued to}} work, for example, with Tanning's Rainy Day Canape from 1970. Duchamp continued to produce sculpture in secret including an installation with the realistic depiction of a woman <b>viewable</b> only through a peephole.|$|E
25|$|The {{room where}} the frieze is {{displayed}} was specially constructed {{to be the same}} size as the main room in the Temple of Apollo. However, in the original placing they would have been seven metres in the air and close to the ceiling. The reconstruction puts the frieze at an easily <b>viewable</b> height.|$|E
25|$|Belt {{filters are}} {{considered}} simple and reliable, with good availability, low staffing, easy maintenance {{and a long}} life. The belt filter is most advantageous when installed such that it is open and <b>viewable</b> at floor level for easier adjustment and monitoring. This is of course subject to what lighting and ventilation will allow.|$|E
