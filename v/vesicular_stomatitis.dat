5|$|In April 2004, Farmer {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the USAMRIID facility, where {{military}} biologists study infectious diseases, have {{a promising}} vaccine candidate. They {{have developed a}} replication-competent vaccine against Lassa virus based on recombinant <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus vectors expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein. After a single intramuscular injection, test primates have survived lethal challenge, while showing no clinical symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Rhabdoviruses are {{a diverse}} family of single stranded, {{negative}} sense RNA viruses that infect {{a wide range}} of hosts, from plants and insects, to fish and mammals. The Rhaboviridae family consists of six genera, two of which, cytorhabdoviruses and nucleorhabdoviruses, only infect plants. Novirhabdoviruses infect fish, and vesiculovirus, lyssavirus and ephemerovirus infect mammals, fish and invertebrates. The family includes pathogens such as rabies virus, <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus and potato yellow dwarf virus that are of public health, veterinary, and agricultural significance.|$|E
25|$|For the research, she {{isolated}} a rabies type {{of virus}} which produced mutant strains interfering with viral growth. Later, in her work with her husband at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> viruses (VSV) she studied made ribonucleic acid (RNA) from RNA instead of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which did not follow the conventional central dogma: DNA RNA Protein. Her discovery of this VSV virion-associated RNA – dependent RNA polymerase led to Baltimore’s research on tumor viruses and {{the discovery of the}} enzyme called reverse transcriptase. This enzyme converted RNA to DNA, and became a major breakthrough in virology.|$|E
25|$|Transmission to {{vertebrates}} usually occurs via a tick vector. THOV {{persists in}} the tick, {{remaining in the}} organism as it goes through its developmental stages; this is called transstadial transmission. The virus can be transmitted to another host within a day of attachment to the host. THOV can be transmitted between ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, {{in the absence of}} a detectable level of virus in the blood. Such nonviraemic transmission has also been observed with other predominantly tick-transmitted RNA viruses, including bluetongue, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, louping ill, tick-borne encephalitis, <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus and West Nile virus viruses. Transmission of DHOV by respiratory aerosol has also been observed.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} theoretical studies {{of the distribution of}} fitness effects was done by Motoo Kimura, an influential theoretical population geneticist. His neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that most novel mutations will be highly deleterious, with a small fraction being neutral. Hiroshi Akashi more recently proposed a bimodal model for the DFE, with modes centered around highly deleterious and neutral mutations. Both theories agree {{that the vast majority of}} novel mutations are neutral or deleterious and that advantageous mutations are rare, which has been supported by experimental results. One example is a study done on the DFE of random mutations in <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus. Out of all mutations, 39.6% were lethal, 31.2% were non-lethal deleterious, and 27.1% were neutral. Another example comes from a high throughput mutagenesis experiment with yeast. In this experiment it was shown that the overall DFE is bimodal, with a cluster of neutral mutations, and a broad distribution of deleterious mutations.|$|E
2500|$|Huang and Baltimore coauthored a {{paper with}} Martha Stampfer titled [...] "Ribonucleic acid {{synthesis}} of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus, II. An RNA polymerase in the virion." [...] This paper {{went on to}} show that “the virions of <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus contain an enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of ribonucleotides into RNA”.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (VSV), {{known to}} infect horses, cattle and swine, was the virus she first chose to study. It {{did not take}} long {{for her and her}} colleagues to find out about its single strand of RNA and many other {{features}} about the VSV, including replication details. [...] Their findings about the VSV served {{as a model for the}} understanding of the biology of viruses.|$|E
2500|$|She started {{studying}} about viruses as {{a graduate}} student, when little was known about them, where {{she was the first}} person [...] "to purify and characterize interfering viral particles". While at Johns Hopkins University, Huang conducted research looking into the inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis by nonreplicating <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus. She completed this research with Robert R. Wagner. She thought that these mutants played a vital role in viral pathogenesis and could possibly be used to prevent disease.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{postdoctoral}} {{work at the}} Salk Institute and MIT with David Baltimore, Dr. Huang {{worked on}} <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (VSV) and discovered that these viruses had RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. [...] Through this work on VSV she uncovered a mix of surface glycoproteins {{which resulted in a}} novel replication strategy for Negative Strand Viruses as well as Pseudotyping. Pseudotyping is combining a virus or a part of a virus (vector) with a foreign viral envelope protein. Doing this alters their antigenicity which allows them to have a more broad range of hosts.|$|E
2500|$|The innate {{immune system}} {{constitutes}} {{the first line of}} defense against invading pathogens and is regarded as the major initiator of inflammatory responses. [...] Its cellular component involves primarily monocyte/macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), which are activated upon sensing of conserved pathogen structures (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors ((TLRs)). MIR155HG (i.e. miR-155-5p) expression is greatly enhanced by TLR agonist stimulation of macrophages and dendritic cells. [...] Since microbial lipopolysaccharide (an agonist of TLR4) activates a chain of events that lead to the stimulation of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors, it was hypothesized that endotoxin activation of MIR155HG may be mediated by those transcription factors. [...] Indeed, MIR155HG expression was found to be activated in [...] LPS treated murine macrophage cells (i.e. Raw264.7) by an NF-κB-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, [...] H. pylori infection of primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in a NF-κB dependent up-regulation of MIR155HG. In the context of viral infection <b>vesicular</b> <b>stomatitis</b> virus (VSV) challenge of murine peritoneal macrophages was reported to result in miR-155-5p over-expression via a retinoic acid-inducible gene I/JNK/NF-κB–dependent pathway. Support for a role of AP-1 in MIR155HG activation comes from studies using stimuli relevant to viral infection such as TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) or interferon beta (IFN-β). [...] Downstream of those stimuli AP-1 seems to play a major role in MIR155HG activation.|$|E
