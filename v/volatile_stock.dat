40|$|An {{ongoing debate}} {{is whether it}} is {{possible}} to predict future price movements for stocks by analysing the historical stock data. Accord- ing to the Effective Market Hypothesis and the Random Walk Theory this should not be possible and according to the Non Random Walk Theory it should be possible. A large group who also believe that {{it is possible to}} predict the market are all those traders who often use technical analysis as support in their daily investment decisions. A commonly used recommendation among traders and technical an- alysts is to trade in stocks with high volatility to achieve maximum profit. If traders generally trade in high <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks</b> and also use similar analytical methods, then their analyzes and predictions may be self-fulfilling. This study investigate whether there is a difference between predicting tomorrow’s trend of high <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks</b> versus low <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks.</b> Machine learning and a feed forward artificial neural network was used as a tool for making the analyzes and predictions. Ten stocks was selected on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, the five most <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks</b> and the five least <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks.</b> For each stock, stock data from 2001 - 03 - 01 until 2017 - 03 - 01 was downloaded from Ya- hoo Finance, where 70 % of the data was used for training, 15 % for validation and 15 % for tests. For each stock the tests were repeated ten times and then the average hit rate for each stock was calculated, and also the average hit rate for each test group. The high volatile test group achieves an average hit rate of 59, 3 % and the low volatile test group achieves an average hit rate of 54, 1 %. A difference over 5 % indicates that our theory holds and that it is easier to predict fu- ture price movements for a stock with high volatility than for a low volatility stock. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis has {{identified}} {{a gap in}} literature regarding the effects of quantitative easing (QE) on equities since the financial crisis in 2008. An event study has been conducted to investigate the portfolio rebalance effect stating that assets not regarded as close substitutes to targeted assets under the QE-scheme, e. g. equities, should respond with a lag to new information regarding QE. Also literature suggests that larger stocks should tend to lead smaller stocks. Assuming investors regard larger stocks as safer we aim to test the hypotheses that stocks will respond to QEannouncements containing new, unanticipated information and that larger, safer stocks will lead smaller, more volatile. The responses in the U. S. stock indices S&P 500, its corresponding sectors as well as mid and small cap indices are examined on nine identified events.

40|$|We {{examine the}} ability of online ticker {{searches}} (e. g. XOM for Exxon Mobil) to forecast abnormal stock returns and trading volumes. Specifically, we argue that online ticker searches serve as a valid proxy for investor sentiment [...] a set of beliefs about cash flows and investment risks that are not necessarily justified by the facts at hand [...] which is generally associated with less sophisticated, retail investors. Based on prior research on investor sentiment, we expect online search intensity to forecast stock returns and trading volume, and also expect that highly <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks,</b> which {{are more difficult to}} arbitrage, will be more sensitive to search intensity than less <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks.</b> In a sample of S&P 500 firms over the period 2005 - 2008, we find that, over a weekly horizon, online search intensity reliably predicts abnormal stock returns and trading volumes, and that the sensitivity of returns to search intensity is positively related to the difficulty of a stock being arbitraged.

50|$|The freight {{market is}} a very {{volatile}} market, with standard deviations of up to 70%. From an options perspective, this is a possibility for a very large up and downside—part of this downside can be hedged away via freight derivatives. AG-Japan clean and dirty are the most liquid routes traded in the derivatives market. Frontline has a very high dividend yield, both in cash and in Ship Finance (SFL) stocks; for example, in late 2007 its annual dividend ran between 12 and 18%, depending on the fluctuating share price. SFL is an offshoot of Frontline; the offshoot is estimated to have generated 25% gains to shareholders due to the different risk in Frontline and SFL. Golden Ocean Group (GOGL), a dry bulk carrier firm, was also spun off of Frontline and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

5000|$|After gaining {{market share}} in the late 1990s and making {{enormous}} profits, General Motors stock soared to over $80 a share. From June 1999 to September 2000, the Federal Reserve, in a move to quell potential inflationary pressures created by, among other things, the stock market, made successive interest rate increases, credited in part for [...] "plunging the country into a recession." [...] The recession and the <b>volatile</b> <b>stock</b> market created a pension and benefit fund crisis at General Motors and many other American companies. General Motors' rising retiree health care costs and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) fund deficit prompted the company to enact a broad restructuring plan. Although GM had already taken action to fully fund its pension plan, its OPEB fund became an issue for its corporate bond ratings. GM had expressed its disagreement with the bond ratings; moreover, GM's benefit funds were performing at higher than expected rates of return. In 2003, GM responded to the crisis by fully funding its pension fund with a $15 B payment; however, its Other Post Employment Benefits Fund (OPEB) became a serious issue resulting in downgrades to its bond rating in 2005. Then, following a $10.6 billion loss in 2005, GM acted quickly to implement its restructuring plan.|$|E

5000|$|The {{character}} of Dr. Mabuse {{can also be}} seen as depiction of [...] "the power of evil or a distorted inner psyche". [...] Lang scholar Paul Jensen interpreted Mabuse as [...] "a symbol to unite all the negative factors in Germany at the time". [...] The film depicts difficult problems such as rampant crime, worthless money and a <b>volatile</b> <b>stock</b> market as thus being under the control of a single man. [...] Bernd Widdig points out that while Dr. Mabuse is not an anti-Semitic film, aspects of Mabuse's character may have reflected contemporary stereotypes of Jews, especially since he acts in stereotypically Jewish roles such as psychoanalyst, banker, peddler and revolutionary, and consistent with the views on Jews of some contemporary Germans his manipulations were responsible for problems in society. [...] A contemporary Nazi critic wrote that Mabuse is [...] "a quintessential Jewish figure" [...] who goes through time with the singular goal of [...] "mastery of the world" [...] regardless of the consequences to others and whose descent into insanity caused his crimes to go unpunished in what the Nazi critic described as [...] "the typical case of the Jewish criminal". [...] On the other hand, Mabuse with his hypnotic power over the masses in pursuit of evil has also been seen as a foreshadowing of Adolf Hitler. [...] In the sequel The Testament of Dr. Mabuse the link between the Mabuse character and the Nazis is made stronger. [...] Lang stated that he viewed Mabuse as a [...] Nietzschean Übermensch. [...] Lang also saw Mabuse's character as emblematic of a certain kind of money-accumulator in Weimar Germany referred to as a [...] "Raffke". [...] The producer of Dr. Mabuse, Erich Pommer, saw the film as a depiction of the contemporary conflict between the liberal conservatives and the Marxist Spartacists in which the Mabuse character represented the Spartacists.|$|E

40|$|The {{underperformance}} of high idiosyncratic volatility stocks, as {{documented by}} Ang, Hodrick, Ying, and Zhang (2006, JF), {{is a pure}} non-January phenomenon. This non-January negative relation between idiosyncratic volatility and stock returns is more pronounced among firms with greater constraints in short selling, and when short-sale constraints are mitigated from the introduction of options {{and the end of}} the IPO lockup period. Apart from an average underperformance, highly <b>volatile</b> <b>stocks</b> also have the greatest dispersion in expected returns and in price reactions around earnings announcements. These findings support behavioral models suggesting that noise trading and investor overconfidence, combined with short-sale constraints, generate excess volatility, greater mispricing, and on average lower expected returns. ...|$|R

40|$|The principal-agent {{model of}} {{executive}} compensation is of central {{importance to the}} modern theory of the firm and corporate governance, yet the existing empirical evidence supporting it is quite weak. The key predication of the model is that the executive's pay-performance sensitivity is decreasing in the variance of the firm's performance. We demonstrate strong empirical confirmation of this prediction using a comprehensive sample of executives at large corporations. In general, the pay-performance sensitivity for executives at firms with the least <b>volatile</b> <b>stock</b> prices is {{an order of magnitude}} greater than the pay-performance sensitivity for executives at firms with the most <b>volatile</b> <b>stock</b> prices. This result holds for both chief executive officers and for other highly compensated executives. We further show that estimates of the pay-performance sensitivity that do not explicitly account for the effect of the variance of firm performance are biased toward zero. We also test for relative performance evaluation of executives against the performance of other firms. We find little support for the relative performance evaluation model. Our findings suggest that executive compensation contracts incorporate the benefits of risk-sharing but do not incorporate the potential informational advantages of relative performance evaluation. ...|$|E
