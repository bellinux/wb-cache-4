40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{building}} a two level nanostructures with planarization technique. A major technological challenge for the applications of various kinds of nano- electronics {{is the ability to}} interconnect the very small structures. In fact, the interconnect problem is much more formidable than the problem of fabricating nano structures, but receives far less attention in research. The objective of this project was to evaluate a generic process for isolating and connecting together nanoscale circuit elements which are based on a <b>vertical</b> <b>stack</b> structure. The fabrication of pure, single crystal materials and stacks is often the starting point for high quality nano-scale circuit elements. However, the contacting to these stacks and connection in to a circuit is a difficult problem which is common to many nano-electronic studies. Development of such a process could help groups working Ferro electric memories, spin transport (MRAM), and quantum Josephson junction circuits. We tried to develop a planarization process which effectively isolates the <b>vertical</b> <b>stack</b> structure and exposes the top contact for an additional wiring layer. This process is compatible with subsequent lift-off layer of electron beam lithography (EBL). With EBL we can achieve overlay accuracy and line width of 20 nm (when everything is working optimally) which will be necessary for wiring together <b>vertical</b> <b>stacks</b> whe...|$|R

50|$|Deaths {{from human}} crushes and stampedes {{are found to}} be caused {{primarily}} by compressive asphyxiation; trampling is a lesser killer. This is due to crowd crush or crowd collapse. In a crowd crush people are subjected to compressive forces by being pushed from all sides (or against a barrier such as a wall) with nowhere to move into. In a progressive crowd collapse one person falls, creating a space in the crowd into which others fall, creating an even larger hole. Those who have fallen are squashed by the weight of many people on top of them (<b>vertical</b> <b>stacking).</b> Compression in either case is often fatal. A crush is typical of a crowd pushed into a confined area; a progressive crowd collapse may occur in a large crowd moving steadily forward along a confined route.|$|E

The sediment supply for the Middle Siwalik group originated {{from the main}} provenance of the rising Himalayas. With vertical facies variation from sandstone-mudstone to sandstone-mudstone-conglomerate with a thickness approximately 1,400 m.

These facies assemblages suggests a deposition by sheet floods in a braided channel environment. The <b>vertical</b> <b>stacking</b> of this multistorey sandstone complex further indicates of a channel bar that migrates with channels existing predominantly as depositional sites. Finally, the Middle Siwalik is conformably overlain by the Upper Siwalik Sub-group.|$|E

40|$|Creating {{alternating}} {{layers of}} 2 D materials forms vertical heterostructures with diverse electronic and opto-electronic properties. Monolayer WS 2 grown by {{chemical vapour deposition}} can have inherent strain due to interactions with the substrate. The strain modifies the band structure and properties of monolayer WS 2 and can be exploited {{in a wide range}} of applications. We demonstrate a non-aqueous transfer method for creating <b>vertical</b> <b>stacks</b> of mixed 2 D layers containing a strained monolayer of WS 2, with Boron Nitride and Graphene. The 2 D materials are all grown by CVD, enabling large area vertical heterostructures to be formed. WS 2 monolayers grown by CVD directly on Si substrates with SiO 2 surface are easily washed off by water and this makes aqueous based transfer methods challenging for creating <b>vertical</b> <b>stacks</b> on the growth substrate. 2 D hexagonal Boron Nitride films are used to provide an insulating layer that limits interactions with a top graphene layer and preserve the strong photoluminescence from the WS 2. This transfer method is suitable for layer by layer control of 2 D material <b>vertical</b> <b>stacks</b> and is shown to be possible for all CVD grown samples, which opens up pathways for the rapid large scale fabrication of vertical heterostructure systems with atomic thickness depth control and large area coverage...|$|R
50|$|Initially Langdon’s ambigrams {{followed}} the yin/yang model, featuring rotational symmetry. But when the name STARSHIP resisted his efforts, he resorted to mirror image symmetry, establishing a second format. The STARSHIP, ambigram {{was sold to}} Jefferson Starship and appeared on the label of the Spitfire album (1976). Other approaches to ambigram designs followed: chain ambigrams are those that will not work as self-contained words, but when separate parts of a word can each be created symmetrically, they can be linked, end to end in an infinite chain. These can be of either rotational or mirror-image type. Mirror image chains are rare; rotational chains are normally presented in a circular format. Totem ambigrams, so named due to their <b>vertical</b> <b>stacking</b> of letters, present mirror-image symmetry. Totem ambigrams give the artist greater flexibility as to what letter may {{be called upon to}} mirror another. A non-symmetrical type of ambigram is the Figure/Ground illusion, 8 in which spaces within and between the letters of one word form the letters of a second word. These are verbal versions of the well-known profiles-and-chalice illusion. For these, a voluntary perception shift is required of the viewer.|$|E
5000|$|Hurricane {{strengthening}} and weakening is {{the product}} of extensive thermodynamic interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. Generally speaking, the evolution of a hurricane’s intensity is determined by three factors. First, the initial intensity of a tropical cyclone is a predominant factor and its strength will be reflected throughout the storm’s life. Second, the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere through which the cyclone moves will affects its ability to strengthen, as strong horizontal winds will disperse internal circulation and prevent the <b>vertical</b> <b>stacking</b> of energy within the storm. The third component affecting hurricane intensity is the heat exchange between the upper layer of ocean waters and the core of the storm. [...] For this reason, a major focus of hurricane research has been sea surface temperature prior to a storm. However, recent studies have revealed that surface temperature is less important in hurricane deepening than the depth of the ocean mixed layer. In fact, a hurricane’s sea level pressure {{has been shown to be}} more closely correlated with the 26 °C isotherm depth (and oceanic heat content) than the sea surface temperature. [...] Storms passing over the Loop Current or warm core eddies have access to more tepid water, and therefore the higher energy content of the heated molecules.|$|E
5000|$|The 8×50mmR Lebel (8mm Lebel) (designated as the 8 × 51 R Lebel by the C.I.P.) rifle {{cartridge}} {{was the first}} smokeless powder cartridge to be made and adopted by any country. It was introduced by France in 1886. Formed by necking down the 11mm Gras black powder cartridge, the smokeless 8 mm Lebel cartridge started a revolution in military rifle ammunition. Standard 8mm Lebel military ammunition {{was also the first}} rifle ammunition to feature a spitzer boat tail bullet (Balle D), which was adopted in 1898. The long-range ballistic performance of the 8mm Lebel bullet itself was exceptional. For use in the magazine tube-fed early Lebel rifle, the 8mm case was designed to protect against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. However, the shape of its rimmed bottle-necked case, having been designed for the Lebel rifle's tube magazine, also precluded truly efficient <b>vertical</b> <b>stacking</b> inside a vertical magazine. The bolt thrust of the 8mm Lebel is relatively high compared to many other service rounds used in the early 20th century. Although it was once revolutionary, the 8mm Lebel was declared obsolete after World War I and was soon after replaced with the 7.5×54mm French round.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{offensive}} strategies is the <b>vertical</b> <b>stack.</b> In this strategy, a number of offensive players line up between the disc and the end zone they are attacking. From this position, players in the stack make cuts (sudden sprints - usually after throwing off the defender by a [...] "fake" [...] move the other way) into the space available, attempting to get open and receive the disc. The stack generally lines {{up in the middle of}} the field, thereby opening up two lanes along the sidelines for cuts, although a captain may occasionally call for the stack to line up closer to one sideline, leaving open just one larger cutting lane on the other side. Variations of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stack</b> include the Side Stack, where the stack is moved to a sideline and one player is isolated in the open space, and the Split Stack, where players are split between two stacks, one on either sideline. The Side Stack is most helpful in an end zone play where your players line up on one side of the end zone and the handler calls an “ISO” (isolation) using one of the player’s names. This then signals for the rest of the players on your team to clear away from that one person in order for them to receive a pass. In <b>vertical</b> <b>stack</b> offenses, one player usually plays the role of 'dump', offering a reset option which sets up behind the player with the disc.|$|R
