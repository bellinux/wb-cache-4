Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1Gbit/s per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2. Revision 1.4 adds support BT.2020 color space and HDR10 extensions from CTA-861.3, including static and dynamic metadata.|$|E

50|$|<b>Refresh</b> <b>rate</b> or the {{temporal}} resolution of an LCD {{is the number}} of times per second in which the display draws the data it is being given. Since activated LCD pixels do not flash on/off between frames, LCD monitors exhibit no refresh-induced flicker, no matter how low the <b>refresh</b> <b>rate.</b> However, high <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> may result in visual artifacts that distort the image in unpleasant ways. High-end LCD televisions now feature up to 600 Hz <b>refresh</b> <b>rate,</b> which requires advanced digital processing to insert additional interpolated frames between the real images to smooth the image motion. Such high <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> may not be supported by pixel response times, resulting in distorted images.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We develop order bounds on the <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of {{computing}} {{two classes of}} functions over large multi-hop sensor networks – namely, type-threshold (e. g. max) and type-sensitive functions (e. g. average). The <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> quantifies how often the function can be re-computed with new data at sensor nodes. We first show that for type-threshold functions optimal <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of Θ(1) is possible over networks whose connectivity graphs have finite degree. Next, even for a simple representative type-sensitive function, we show that the maximum <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> {{that can be achieved}} in a wide class of networks of n nodes with any multihop digital communication scheme is at most Θ(1 / log n), if the goal is to compute the function with deterministic guarantees. On the other hand, we show that relaxing the requirements to allow probabilistic guarantees enables a <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of Θ(1) over any graph with bounded degree and a <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of Θ(1 /log log n) for random planar networks. Further, for such networks operating over an AWGN channel with signal power path-loss, we show that even <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of Θ(1) can be achieved with vanishing distortion when the power path-loss exponent is strictly less than 4. Thus, relaxing deterministic computation guarantees to probabilistic requirements enables sizeable improvement in <b>refresh</b> <b>rates.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|The {{supported}} maximum <b>refresh</b> <b>rates,</b> at native resolution, {{depend on}} how many TMDS links are used. Single, double, and quad-link support 13, 25, 41 Hz <b>refresh</b> <b>rates,</b> respectively. With reduced blanking periods, the single, double, and quad-TMDS-link can obtain 17.1, 33.72, and 41 Hz refresh. This model's internal <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> is always 41 Hz. The product was withdrawn {{with the introduction of}} the DG5 model in September 2003.|$|R
5000|$|For example, if a {{cathode ray}} tube's {{vertical}} <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> {{is set to}} 60 Hz, most screens will produce a visible [...] "flickering" [...] effect, unless they use phosphor with long afterglow. Most people find that <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> of 70-90 Hz and above enable flicker-free viewing on CRTs. Use of <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> above 120 Hz is uncommon, as they provide little noticeable flicker reduction and limit available resolution.|$|R
50|$|On {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) displays, {{increasing}} the <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> decreases flickering, thereby reducing eye strain. However, if a <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> is specified that is beyond what is recommended for the display, damage to the display can occur.|$|R
50|$|A maximum-sized packet, {{which has}} 512 {{channels}} (slots following the start code), takes approximately 23 ms to send, corresponding {{to a maximum}} <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of about 44 Hz. For higher <b>refresh</b> <b>rates,</b> packets having fewer than 512 channels can be sent.|$|R

5000|$|For a <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> of 600 Hz to be {{displayed}} correctly, an LCD {{would require a}} response time of approximately 1.667 (...) milliseconds GtG (grey-to-grey). In addition to {{the technical aspects of}} achieving such a high <b>refresh</b> <b>rate,</b> there are limits to the capability of the human eye.

50|$|When LCD {{shutter glasses}} {{are used for}} stereo 3D displays, the {{effective}} <b>refresh</b> <b>rate</b> is halved, because each eye needs a separate picture. For this reason, it is usually recommended to use a display capable of at least 120 Hz, because divided in half this rate is again 60 Hz. Higher <b>refresh</b> <b>rates</b> result in greater image stability, for example 72 Hz non-stereo is 144 Hz stereo, and 90 Hz non-stereo is 180 Hz stereo. Unfortunately most computer graphics cards and monitors cannot handle these high <b>refresh</b> <b>rates,</b> especially at higher resolutions.|$|R
