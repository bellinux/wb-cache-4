5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple <b>volva,</b> P.macrosporus, which has a reddish <b>volva,</b> and P.formanosus, which has a pale pink stipe and <b>volva.</b>|$|E
5|$|In North America, Phallus impudicus can be {{distinguished}} from the very similar P. hadriani by the latter's purplish-tinted <b>volva.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phallus impudicus has {{the same}} overall {{appearance}} as P.hadriani, but is distinguished by its white <b>volva.</b> Another similar stinkhorn, P.ravenelii has a smooth, not reticulate head.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, {{says the}} <b>völva,</b> the sky will turn black before fire engulfs the world, the stars will disappear, flames will dance before the sky, steam will rise, {{the world will}} be covered in water and then it will be raised again, green and fertile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>völva</b> {{continues}} that Jötunheimr, {{the land}} of the jötnar, is aroar, and that the Æsir are in council. The dwarfs groan by their stone doors. Surtr advances from the south, his sword brighter than the sun. Rocky cliffs open and the jötnar women sink.|$|E
5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata {{slightly}}, but the former has short grooves {{at the edge of}} a yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow <b>volva,</b> and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a misidentification of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E
50|$|His {{works have}} been {{translated}} into several languages, and have been taught in European universities. There are plans to make three of his works into films: A Sombra Cazadora, Non <b>Volvas,</b> and Calzados Lola.|$|R
25|$|Scandinavian {{archaeologists have}} {{discovered}} wands in about 40 female graves, {{and they have}} usually been discovered in rich graves with valuable grave offerings which shows that the <b>vǫlvas</b> belonged {{to the highest level}} of society.|$|R
5000|$|The archaeological {{record shows}} that the {{population}} of the Gothic Wielbark culture (Poland) had indeed moved and settled in Ukraine and mixed with the previous populations of the Zarubintsy culture, where they formed the Chernyakhiv culture. This cultural movement is identified as the migration of the Goths from Gothiscandza to Oium, but not all scholars find the evidence compelling. [...] Jordanes (XXIV:121) also relates that Filimer expelled the <b>völvas,</b> who were called Aliorumnas (probably Halju-runnos, meaning [...] "hell-runners" [...] or [...] "runners to the realm of the dead", which refers to their shamanistic experiences during trance). These <b>völvas</b> were condemned to seek refuge far away and procreated the Huns.|$|R
5|$|Amanita abrupta {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1897, {{based on a}} specimen he found in Auburn, Alabama. Because {{the remains of the}} <b>volva</b> are not present on the bulb in dried, mature, specimens, Peck thought that the species should be grouped with Amanita rubescens and A.spissa. Synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers by Jean-Edouard Gilbert to Lepidella in 1928, and to Aspidella in 1940. Both of these genera have since been subsumed into Amanita.|$|E
5|$|Amanita exitialis is {{classified}} in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita. Species of this section share the following characteristics: spores that are not strongly elongated, and never with a cylindrical shape; flesh not reddening upon bruising; lamellulae (short gills that do not reach {{the edge of the}} cap) abruptly cut off; a well-formed pouch- or sac-like membranous <b>volva.</b> All species of Phalloideae are ectomycorrhizal and contain amatoxins.|$|E
5|$|Amanita exitialis {{is similar}} to A.bisporigera, a species {{originally}} described by George Francis Atkinson from the United States. In comparison to A.exitialis, A.bisporigera differs by its lower placement of the ring on the stem, smaller spores (typically 8–9.5 by 7–8.5µm), and different structure of the <b>volva.</b> American specimens of A.bisporigera have more abundant inflated cells than that of A.exitialis. Two other white Asian species, A.oberwinklerana and A.subjunquillea var. alba also resemble A.exitialis, but are four-spored.|$|E

50|$|In a stanza of Völuspá hin skamma (found in {{the poem}} Hyndluljóð), Ymir {{receives}} one more mention. According to the stanza, <b>völvas</b> are descended from Viðòlfr, all seers from Vilmeiðr, all charm-workers from Svarthöfði, and all jötnar descend from Ymir.|$|R
50|$|The plotline of {{the story}} is based on the myths of Thor's {{expedition}} to Jotunhem as told in the Gylfaginning section of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, and the <b>Völva's</b> prophecy regarding Ragnarok in the poem Völuspá, preserved in the Poetic Edda.|$|R
5|$|Amanita ocreata, {{commonly}} known as the death angel, destroying angel, angel of death or more precisely western North American destroying angel, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Occurring in the Pacific Northwest and California floristic provinces of North America, A. ocreata associates with oak trees. The large fruiting bodies (the mushrooms) generally appear in spring; the cap may be white or ochre and often develops a brownish centre, while the stipe, ring, gill and <b>volva</b> are all white.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the colored}} <b>volva,</b> A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{resemble}} A.deserticola include the desert fungi Montagnea arenaria and Podaxis pistillaris. Montagnea arenaria is a whitish stalked puffball with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like <b>volva</b> {{at the base}} of the stem. It is topped by a thin disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. Podaxis pistillaris has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.|$|E

5|$|The agaricoid {{species in}} Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca, and Russula are readily {{distinguished}} from other gilled mushrooms by {{the consistency of}} their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, somewhat {{like a piece of}} chalk. Russulaceae never have a <b>volva,</b> but a partial veil can be found in some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|The smell {{has been}} {{described}} as initially faint and honey-sweet, but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the <b>volva</b> as a remnant. The spore print is white, a common feature of Amanita. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10μm (0.30.4mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, other {{similarly}} green-capped species {{collected by}} mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills {{of the genus}} Russula and the formerly popular Tricholoma equestre, now regarded as hazardous owing {{to a series of}} restaurant poisonings in France. Brittlegills, such as Russula heterophylla, R.aeruginea, and R.virescens, can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both <b>volva</b> and ring. Other similar species include A.subjunquillea in eastern Asia and A.arocheae, which ranges from Andean Colombia north {{at least as far as}} central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.|$|E
50|$|In younger legendary sagas, the Norns {{appear to}} have been synonymous with witches (<b>Völvas),</b> and they arrive at the birth of the hero to shape his destiny. It seems that {{originally}} all of them were Disir, ghosts or deities associated with destruction and destiny. The notion that they were three may be due to a late influence from Greek and Roman mythology. The same applies to their (disputed) association with the past, present and future.|$|R
50|$|Ileodictyon cibarium is a {{saprobic}} {{species of}} fungus {{in the family}} Phallaceae. It is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it {{commonly known as the}} basket fungus or the white basket fungus, alluding to the fruit bodies that are shaped somewhat like a round or oval ball with interlaced or latticed branches. While the immature <b>volvae</b> are edible, the mature fruit body is foul-smelling and covered with a slime layer containing spores on the inner surfaces.|$|R

The finds are on display in the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm.|$|R
5|$|The <b>völva</b> {{sees the}} earth reappearing from the water, and an eagle over a {{waterfall}} hunting fish on a mountain. The surviving Æsir meet {{together at the}} field of Iðavöllr. They discuss Jörmungandr, great events of the past, and the runic alphabet. In stanza 61, in the grass, they find the golden game pieces that the gods are described as having once happily enjoyed playing games with long ago (attested earlier in the same poem). The reemerged fields grow without needing to be sown. The gods Höðr and Baldr return from Hel and live happily together.|$|E
5|$|Although very {{distinctive}} in appearance, the {{fly agaric}} has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom {{species in the}} Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basii—a Mexican species similar to A.caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.caesarea-like species in Mexico. Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white. The <b>volva</b> is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales. In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may {{be confused with the}} native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.muscaria and bears no ring.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{the type}} species of the genus. By extension, {{it is also the}} type species of Amanita {{subgenus}} Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a <b>volva</b> that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A.muscaria and its close relatives, including A.pantherina (the panther cap), A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.|$|E
50|$|Christianity in Scandinavia {{came later}} than {{most parts of}} Europe. In Denmark Harald Bluetooth Christianized the country around 980. The process of Christianization began in Norway during the reigns of Olaf Tryggvason (reigned 995 AD-c.1000 AD) and Olaf II Haraldsson (reigned 1015 AD-1030 AD). Olaf and Olaf II had been baptized voluntarily outside of Norway. Olaf II managed to bring English clergy to his country. Norway's {{conversion}} from the Norse religion to Christianity was mostly the result of English missionaries. As {{a result of the}} adoption of Christianity by the monarchy and eventually the entirety of the country, traditional shamanistic practices were marginalized and eventually persecuted. <b>Völvas,</b> practitioners of seid, a Scandinavian pre-Christian tradition, were executed or exiled under newly Christianized governments in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.|$|R
40|$|Agaricus geesterani, a new species, is {{described}} from material collected at three localities in the Netherlands. It combines strong colour-reactions,a well-developed colouring universal veil, and long (sub) capitate cheilocystidia with A. bitorquis-like basidiocarps. The new section Magici is created for it. Agaricus section Magici Bas & Heinem., sect. nov. Basidiocaipus grossus, firmus, ponderosus. Pileus valde caxnosus, margine crasso, involuto praedi-tus.

5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check {{for the presence of}} clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely on the basis of colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and <b>volvas</b> may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|R
