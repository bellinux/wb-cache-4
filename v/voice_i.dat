500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my <b>voice.</b> <b>I</b> think I had a very strange voice."

500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It {{was clear to me}} that we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time and}} I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that <b>voice.</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} deals with {{subjects}} {{as diverse as}} [...] "isolated communities, old school teachers and Roman roads", but maintains a [...] "warped coherency". According to Rhys, Mwngs lyrics—which he considers to be some of his best—were written [...] "very simply" [...] and convey simple messages. The singer {{made an effort to}} be economical with his words, not communicating a lot of information with them. Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If I listen to a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion in his <b>voice.</b> <b>I</b> think equally people can get off on this record by just hitting on the mood of the song, or connecting to the mood of the song." ...|$|E

In an interview for the Chicago Tribune, {{he said of his}} expectations for the album's recording: [...] "I really wasn't sure what it would wind up being sonically. I love Bach cello suites, I love punk music, I love old blues, negro spiritual quartets, Muddy Waters' 'You Need Love.' There is a simplicity but also a bite that connects all that music, from the growl in the cello to the timbre in Muddy's <b>voice.</b> <b>I</b> wanted simple music, but with bite, over which I could lay my lyrical shenanigans." ...|$|E

Anderson said, [...] "You {{have no idea}} {{how difficult it is to}} find someone with Leon Kennedy's hair [...] has to be manly and has to have these long bangs," [...] adding that [...] "if you put photographs of them side-by-side, it's almost like he was manufactured by Capcom." [...] Anderson said that the decision to include Leon and other game characters in the film was [...] "fan-driven". Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that [...] "he doesn't have a high-pitched <b>voice.</b> <b>I</b> feel like he talks how I naturally talk, which is kind of slower." [...] Speaking about the relationship between Leon and Ada, Urb said: [...] "It's kind of like Mulder and Scully and an X-Files type of deal, where you're waiting for it to happen, but it never does. Maybe in the next one, I'm hoping." ...|$|E

[...] "He set the mold with his running patterns and catching the ball." [...] After Lavelli died, Graham praised his abilities and remembered his eagerness to get his hands on the ball. [...] "He was always coming into the huddle and telling me he was open and that I should throw to him," [...] Graham said. [...] "He wasn't saying that to be a big shot. He just loved to play. If he was open by a few inches, he'd be yelling, 'Otto, Otto.' Many a time when I was stuck and heard that <b>voice</b> <b>I</b> would throw it in his direction and darned if he didn't come down with it. He had fantastic hands." ...|$|E

After nine years since the last time, she attended the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, and during an interview {{on the red carpet}} she said, [...] "I didn't know I was gonna have a baby, I didn't know I was gonna be on The <b>Voice,</b> <b>I</b> didn't know I was gonna be writing new music, so I'm just like, what's gonna be next?". Stefani appears as a featured artist on Maroon 5's song [...] "My Heart Is Open", co-written by Sia Furler, from the band's album V, which was performed {{for the first time with}} Adam Levine and an orchestra at the 2015 Grammy Awards.

Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him.

500|$|Azaria's friends {{refer to}} him as [...] "the freakish mimic" [...] due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, {{instantly}} after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later {{realized that it was}} not a common talent. Azaria can [...] "remember every <b>voice</b> <b>I</b> hear, famous or otherwise... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out." [...] Azaria was glad to have found the [...] "ultimate outlet" [...] for this skill, in The Simpsons. He [...] "didn't realize it , but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices." [...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line." ...|$|E
500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his <b>voice?</b> <b>I</b> mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E

500|$|After Fox {{dropped the}} film in early 2000 and before USA Films {{expressed}} interest soon after, Soderbergh paid for pre-production with his own money. USA Films agreed to give him final cut on Traffic and also agreed to his term that all the Mexican characters would speak Spanish while talking to each other. This meant {{that almost all of}} Benicio del Toro's dialogue would be subtitled. Once the studio realized this, they suggested that his scenes be shot in both English and Spanish, but Soderbergh and del Toro rejected the suggestion. Del Toro, a native of Puerto Rico, was worried that another actor would be brought in and re-record his dialogue in English after he had worked hard to master Mexican inflections and improve his Spanish vocabulary. Del Toro remembers, [...] "Can you imagine? You do the whole movie, bust your butt to get it as realistic as possible, and someone dubs your <b>voice?</b> <b>I</b> said, 'No way. Over my dead body.' Steven was like, 'Don't worry. It's not gonna happen.'" [...] The director fought for subtitles for the Mexico scenes, arguing that if the characters did not speak Spanish, the film would have no integrity and would not convincingly portray what he described as the [...] "impenetrability of another culture".|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my <b>voice.</b> <b>I</b> am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals {{are the key to}} her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs [...] "straight," [...] but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did." [...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my <b>voice</b> <b>I</b> wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going {{to make the most of}} it." ...|$|E
