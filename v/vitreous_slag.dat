5|$|John Lavender of {{the local}} Red House Museum noted {{evidence}} of small iron-ore smelting hearths on Warren Hill, while green <b>vitreous</b> <b>slag</b> has been also found on the Head. In his 1911 to 1912 excavations, Bushe-Fox found evidence for working of lead, copper and silver; two ingots discovered at this time revealed that raw materials would have been imported to the area. One ingot was of nearly pure copper, while the other, which weighed 8.6kg, was roughly 50/50 copper-silver alloy with around one percent gold. Argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) copper was refined to produce silver at the Head. There are also indications that gold was worked at Hengistbury. One excavation produced part of a torc, twisted together with a small gold bracelet and another fragment in a manner suggesting it was scrap; a different site produced a streaked touchstone indicating use in gold testing.|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{gasification}} in {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) is an electrical power generation system, which is characterized to be a clean coal technology different than conventional process in combustible treatment. IGCC process {{gives rise to}} inorganic solid wastes {{in the form of}} <b>vitreous</b> <b>slag</b> and fly ashes with singular thermal properties. The gasification of the fuel takes place at high temperature and pressure in reducing atmosphere. Under those conditions, gases such as H 2, N 2 or CO, which are the main components of the gas mixture in the gasifier, show a high solubility in the melt and during the cooling remain enclosed in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>slag.</b> When these wastes are afterward thermal treated in oxidizing conditions, two phenomena occur. The development of a crystalline phase by devitrification of the glassy matrix and the releasing of the enclosed gas, which starts at temperatures nearly to the softening point. At higher temperatures the bubbles with increasing kinetic energy tend to ascent with difficult through the viscous liquid phase and promotes an expansive reaction, giving rise to a foam glass-ceramic product. This paper has been focused on the study of thermal expansion in slag and fly ash samples from the ELCOGAS IGCC power plant located in Puertollano (Spain). 1...|$|E
40|$|The Plasma Hearth Process (PHP) is a {{high-temperature}} {{process that}} destroys hazardous organic components and stabilizes the radioactive components and hazardous metals in a leach-resistant <b>vitreous</b> <b>slag</b> waste form. The PHP technology development program is targeted at mixed waste that cannot be easily treated by conventional means. For example, heterogeneous debris, which may contain hazardous organics, toxic metals, and radionuclides, {{is difficult to}} characterize and cannot be treated with conventional thermal, chemical, or physical treatment methods. A major advantage of the PHP over other plasma processes {{is its ability to}} separate nonradioactive, non-hazardous metals from the non-metallic and radioactive components which are contained in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>slag.</b> The overall PHP program involves the design, fabrication, and operation of test hardware to demonstrate and certify that the PHP concept is viable for DOE waste treatment. The program involves bench-scale testing of PHP equipment in radioactive service, as well as pilot-scale demonstration of the PHP concept using nonradioactive, surrogate test materials. The fate of secondary waste streams is an important consideration for any technology considered for processing mixed waste. The main secondary waste stream generated by the PHP is flyash captured by the fabric- filter baghouse. The PHP concept is that flyash generated by the process can, to a large extent, be treated by processing this secondary waste stream in the PHP. Prior to the work presented in the paper, however, the PHP project has not quantitatively demonstrated the ability to treat PHP generated flyash. A major consideration is the quantity of radionuclides and RCRA-regulated metals in the flyash that can be retained the resultant waste form...|$|E
40|$|The arc-plasma {{vitrification}} of {{a hospital}} wastes containing metals and inorganic oxides yields to a leach-resistant glassy or <b>vitreous</b> <b>slag,</b> which can be environmentally safe for landfill disposal or could be transformed in glass-ceramic tiles with physical and mechanical properties similar to those showed by marketable products for building applications. Standard methods {{have been used for}} testing the leachability of elements from this new type of tiles. The water resistance was evaluated by the DIN 38414 S 4 standard and the chemical durability of glass and glass-ceramics by the weight losses per surface unit, employing NaOH and HCl (5 %) aqueous solutions, at boiling temperature. Results show that although glass-ceramic tiles are most water leachable than original plasma vitreous glass, the concentration of toxic minor elements in their leaching solutions are lower than those allowed by the Normative.

40|$|Slag {{material}} {{produced by}} the Plasma Hearth Process (PHP) varies in chemical composition due to the heterogeneous nature of the input sample feed. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a spectroscopic technique which has been evaluated to perform elemental analyses on surrogate slag material for process control. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>slag</b> samples were ground to a fine powder in an impact ball mill and analyzed directly using laboratory prepared standards. The fluorescent intensities of Si, Al and Fe in the slag samples was utilized to determine the appropriate matrix standard set for the determination of Ce. The samples were analyzed for Cr, Ni, Fe and Ce using a wavelength dispersive XRF polychromator. Split samples were dissolved and analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). The precision of the XRF technique was better than 5 % RSD. The limit of detection for Ce varied with sample matrix and was typically below 0. 01 % by weight. The linear dynamic range for the technique was evaluated over two orders of magnitude. Typical calibration standards ranged from 0. 01 % Ce to 1 % Ce. The Ce determinations performed directly on ground slag material by the XRF techniques were similar to ICP-AES analyses. Various chemical dissolution and sample preparation techniques were evaluated {{for the analysis of}} Ce in slag samples. A fusion procedure utilizing LiBO{sub 2 } was found to provide reliable analyses for the actinide surrogate in a variety of slag matrices. The use of the XRF technique reduced the time of analysis for Ce and Cr from three days to one day for five samples. No additional waste streams were created from the analyses by the XRF technique, while the ICP technique generated several liters of liquid waste...|$|E
