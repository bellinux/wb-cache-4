25|$|Because of valerian's {{historical}} {{use as a}} sedative, antiseptic, anticonvulsant, migraine treatment, {{and pain}} reliever, most basic science research has been directed at the interaction of valerian constituents with the GABA receptor. Many studies remain inconclusive and all require clinical validation. The mechanism of action of valerian in general, and as a mild sedative in particular, has not been fully elucidated. However, some of the GABA-analogs, particularly valerenic acids as components of the essential oil along with other semivolatile sesquiterpenoids, generally {{are believed to have}} some affinity for the GABAA receptor, a class of receptors on which benzodiazepines are known to act. <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> which is responsible for the typical odor of mostly older valerian roots, does not have any sedative properties. <b>Valeric</b> <b>acid</b> is related to valproic acid, a widely prescribed anticonvulsant; valproic acid is a derivative of <b>valeric</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

40|$|Thirty-five {{patients}} with various diarrheal syndromes and 22 controls were studied. All stool samples were carefully cultured for Clostridium difficile, using selective isolation media. Cytotoxin assays with proper antitoxin neutralization {{were done in}} MRC- 5 cells. The stool samples were extracted four times, three times at pH 2 and once at pH 10, using CHCl 3 or ether. Derivatizations of extracts were done with trichloroethanol, heptafluorobutyric anhydride, and heptafluorobutyric anhydride-ethanol, and all derivatives were analyzed by frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography (FPEC-GLC). A dedicated computer was used to assist in both qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Isocaproic acid (iC 6) was always found in stool from which C. difficile was isolated and was absent in C. difficile-negative specimens. p-Cresol was found frequently in both persons with pseudomembranous colitis and controls. Tryptamine was found in stool containing C. bifermentans. The FPEC-GLC profiles of persons with acute diarrhea were very {{different from those of}} normal persons. Diarrhea associated with adenovirus and rotavirus, Klebsiella spp., and Escherichia spp. showed different FPEC-GLC patterns. Stools from well persons consistently contained full-scale peaks of pyruvic, acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids.</b> In rotavirus stools isobutyric, isovaleric, and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids</b> were reduced in quantity from those found in control stools, whereas propionic and butyric acids were increased...|$|R

2500|$|Valproic acid {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1882 by Beverly S. Burton as an analogue of <b>valeric</b> <b>acid,</b> found naturally in valerian. Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid, a clear liquid at room temperature. For many decades, its only use was in laboratories as a [...] "metabolically inert" [...] solvent for organic compounds. In 1962, the French researcher Pierre Eymard serendipitously discovered the anticonvulsant properties of valproic acid while {{using it as}} a vehicle for a number of other compounds that were being screened for antiseizure activity. He found it prevented pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in laboratory rats. It was approved as an antiepileptic drug in 1967 in France and has become the most widely prescribed antiepileptic drug worldwide. Valproic acid has also been used for migraine prophylaxis and bipolar disorder.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1929 samples was {{analyzed}} by direct gas-liquid chromatography and the volatile fatty acid (VFA) {{patterns of the}} positive samples were compared {{with the results of}} culture. There was no correlation between any bacterial genus or species and the detailed VFA patterns although the presence of butyric or <b>valeric</b> <b>acids,</b> or both, was generally associated with the presence of anaerobes and that of acetic acid was generally associated with aerobic bacteria; however, the technique could not predict the nature of the subsequent bacterial isolate. There was also poor correlation between the VFA pattern in a given sample and the VFA pattern(s) of anaerobic bacteria subsequently isolated from that sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} of transition metal Ni-,(2 +) Cu 2 +, Co 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cd 2 + and Fe 3 + in methanol was investigated by using {{different types of}} organic acids as complexing agents. In pure methanol, the weaker and simpler acetic, propionic, butyric and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids</b> could enhance metal ions selectivity by increasing acid concentration and metal ions could be separated with high efficiency. However, hydroxycarboxylic acids obviously made separation efficiency worse. The effect of mixed organic acids, mixture solvent (methanol-acetonitrile, methanol-water) on metal ions separation was discussed further. The advantages of using nonaqueous solvent over aqueous for metal ions separation were shown finally. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Two routes, {{esterification}} and membrane based solvent extraction, {{were tested}} for their efficiency to extract {{volatile fatty acids}} (VFA) (acetic, propionic, butyric, iso-butyric, iso-valeric and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids)</b> produced from the anaerobic-mixed fermentation of slaughterhouse blood. A range of operational parameters and reagents were assessed to optimize each system. Esterification recovered VFA as methyl esters with the production of ammonium sulphate as a value-added by-product of the esterification reaction. A membrane extraction system, comprised of a hydrophobic membrane and extractant using octanol/TOA (trioctylamine), was efficient to separate butyric and iso-valeric acids in favour of acetic acid from the fermentation broth.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of nicotinic acid between water and Alamine 300 (tri-n-octylamine) dissolved in various (proton-donating and-accepting, polar and nonpolar) diluents, and a {{comparison with the}} extraction equilibria of pure diluent alone were studied at 298 K and a phase ratio of 1 : 1 (v/v). The cyclic alcohol/amine system yielded the highest synergistic extraction eciency. The strength of the complex solvation {{was found to be}} reasonably high for halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons and nitrobenzene, activating mainly the formation of the acid 1 -amine 1 structure. The influence of the acid structure over distribution was evaluated through comparing the extractabilities of three acids containing dierent functional groups, i. e., nicotinic, benzoic and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids.</b> The results were correlated using versions of the mass action law, i. e., a modied Langmuir equilibrium model and a chemodel modelling approach comprising one or two acid-amine complex formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of volatile compounds in Turkish Divle Cave cheese produced in 3 different dairy farms was determined during production and ripening, revealing 110 compounds including acids, alcohols, ketones, esters, and terpenes. The presence and concentration of these volatile compounds varied between specific {{phases of the}} production and the 120 -d ripening process. Smaller differences were also detected between cheeses produced at different farms. Carboxylic acids were established as a major class {{at the end of}} ripening. The relative amounts of acids and ketones increased until d 90 of ripening, whereas alcohols increased for the first 30 d and tailed off during the remaining part of the ripening process. The level of esters increased gradually until the end of ripening. Butanoic, acetic, and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids,</b> 2 -butanol, 2 -butanone, 2 -heptanone, ethyl butanoate, α-pinene, and toluene were the most abundant compounds, likely contributing to the characteristic aroma of this traditional cheese...|$|R
40|$|HeLa cells contain beta-adrenergic receptors {{that are}} {{characterized}} by specific binding of I[3 H]dihydroalprenolol, increased 3 ': 5 '-cyclic AMP production in intact cells after incubation with l-isoproterenol, and increased adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] activity {{in the presence of}} l-isoproterenol. After cells were cultured with butyrate, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors, cyclic AMP production in intact cells, and adenylate cyclase activation by l-isoproterenol were increased severalfold over those of untreated cells. The increase involved the induction of synthesis of new receptor molecules with identical affinities for l-[3 H]-dihydroalprenolol; all three processes were blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. This induction was relatively specific for butyric acid and only the closely related short-chain fatty <b>acids,</b> propionic and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids,</b> were capable of partially inducing the same effect. In contrast to induction of beta-adrenergic binding sites, there was no increase in basal or fluoride-activated adenylate cyclase activity, indicating that the beta-adrenergic receptor and adenylate cyclase and different molecules that may be controlled separately...|$|R

50|$|Upon ingestion, {{regardless}} of the route of administration, estradiol valerate behaves as a prodrug via cleavage by esterases into estradiol and the natural fatty acid <b>valeric</b> <b>acid.</b> This cleavage occurs {{not only in the}} liver, but also in the blood and in tissues, and the hydrolysis of estradiol valerate into estradiol and <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> is complete {{regardless of}} whether the drug is administered orally or parenterally. High levels of circulating estradiol are found after an intravenous injection of estradiol valerate, and this indicates very rapid cleavage of the drug upon entering circulation. In contrast to estradiol, which can distribute into and exert its effects in target tissues, <b>valeric</b> <b>acid</b> is quickly metabolized via beta oxidation (see also fatty acid metabolism).|$|E

40|$|Understanding how neural cells handle proteostasis {{stress in}} the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is important to decipher the mechanisms that underlie the cell death associated with neurodegenerative diseases and to design appropriate therapeutic tools. Here we have compared the sensitivity of a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY 5 H) to the ER stress caused by an inhibitor of protein glycosylation with that observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK- 293 T) cells. In response to stress, SH-SY 5 H cells increase the expression of mRNA encoding downstream effectors of ER stress sensors and transcription factors related to the unfolded protein response (the spliced X-box binding protein 1, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, endoplasmic reticulum-localized DnaJ homologue 4 and asparagine synthetase). Tunicamycin-induced death of SH-SY 5 H cells was prevented by terminal aromatic substituted butyric or <b>valeric</b> <b>acids,</b> in association with {{a decrease in the}} mRNA expression of stress-related factors, and in the accumulation of the ATF 4 protein.

40|$|Sago starch is an {{important}} dietary carbohydrate in lowland Papua New Guinea (PNG). An investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes {{play a role in}} its preservation using traditional methods. In 12 stored sago samples collected from PNG villages, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were present (>= 3. 6 x 10 (4) cfu/g) and pH ranged from 6. 8 to 4. 2. Acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids</b> were present in six or more. In freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees C, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of sago starch was observed. This was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and pH reducing from 4. 9 to 3. 1 : both LAB and yeasts were involved. Survival of potential bacterial pathogens was monitored by seeding sago starch with similar to 10 (4) /g of selected organisms.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to ion-exclusion chromatography (IEC) is proposed to overcome the relatively poor conductivity detection response which occurs in IEC on when acids {{are added to the}} eluent in order to improve peak shape. This approach, termed vacancy IEC, requires the sample to be used as mobile phase and a sample of water to be injected onto a polystyrene/divinylbenzene (PS/DVB) -based strongly acidic cation-exchange column (TSKgel SCX). Vacancy peaks for each of the analytes appear at the retention times of these analytes. Highly sensitive conductivity detection is possible and sharp, well-shaped peaks are produced, leading to efficient separations. Retention times were found to be affected by the concentration of the analytes in the eluent, and also by the presence of an organic modifier, such as butanol in the mobile phase. Detection limits for oxalic, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids</b> at S/N= 3 were 0. 04, 0. 1, 0. 47, 0. 66, 0. 71 and 0. 82 μM, respectively, and linear ranges for some acids extended over two-orders of magnitude.

40|$|The role of {{inoculum}} (rumen liquor - RL vs faeces - FA) from cow or buffalo {{with respect}} to feed evaluation using in vitro gas systems was estimated in a trial using 8 substrates. The substrate influenced significantly all fermentation characteristics; with each inoculum the substrates were ranked according the same trends for organic matter digestibility (dOM) and cumulative gas volume per gram of OM incubated (OMCV). The animal species affected dOM and OMCV which were significantly higher in buffalo and cow, respectively. Buffalo showed significantly higher values of acetic, propionic, butyric acids and total VFA, while isobutyric, isovaleric and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids</b> were higher in cow. The inocula influenced the fermentation characteristics in both species: while in cow all parameters, except OMCV, were higher with FA than RL, in buffalo dOM, OMCV, acetic and total VFAs were higher with RL.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of residual glycerine (5 and 10 % w/w) from the biodiesel industry, used as a co-substrate, on biogas production from maize silage. The experiments were conducted in a laboratory-scale, single-stage anaerobic digester at 39 ºC and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 60 d. Addition of 5 % residual glycerine caused organic load rate (OLR) to increase to 1. 82 compared with 1. 31 g organic dry matter (ODM) L- 1 d- 1 for maize silage alone. The specific biogas production rate and biogas yield were 1. 34 L L- 1 d- 1 and 0. 71 L g ODM- 1 respectively, i. e. 86 % and 30 % higher than for maize alone. Increasing the residual glycerine content to 10 % increased OLR (2. 01 g ODM L- 1 d- 1), but clearly decreased the specific biogas production rate and biogas yield to 0. 50 L L- 1 d- 1 and 0. 13 L g ODM- 1 respectively. This suggested that 10 % glycerine content inhibited methanogenic bacteria and organics conversion into biogas.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of rumen fermentation was studied in lambs and wethers using 14 experimental rations {{with and without}} monensin sodium. The 7 pairs of rations (the first a control diet, the second a monensin treated one) consisted of hay and concentrate at ratios of 60 : 40, 40 : 60, 100 : 0, 50 : 50 (lambs), 100 : 0, 75 : 25 and 50 : 50 (wethers), respectively. The molar % of acetic, propionic, butyric and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids</b> were taken into stoichiometric calculations of rumen fermentation. In most of the rations monensin increased rumen fermentation efficiency. Of all lamb and wether rations the highest efficiency was recorded in the monensin treated ones consisting of 40 % hay and 60 % concentrates and 50 % hay and 50 % concentrates, respectively. The high fermentation efficiency was {{probably due to the}} lowest methane production observed with these rations.

40|$|Anaerobic mixed-culture aggregates, which {{converted}} glucose to acetic, propionic, butyric, and <b>valeric</b> <b>acids,</b> {{were formed}} under controlled conditions of substrate feed (carbon limitation) and hydraulic regimen. The continuous-flow system used (anaerobic gas-lift reactor) {{was designed to}} retain bacterial aggregates in a well-mixed reactor. Carrier availability (i. e., liquid-suspended sand grains) proved necessary for bacterial aggregate formation from individual cells during reactor start-up. Electron microscopic examination revealed that incipient colonization of sand grains by bacteria from the bulk liquid occurred in surface irregularities, conceivably reflecting local quiescence. Subsequent confluent biofilm formation on sand grains proved to be unstable, however. Substrate depletion in the bulk liquid is assumed to weaken deeper parts of the biofilm due to cellular lysis, after which production of gas bubbles and liquid shearing forces cause sloughing. The resulting fragments, although sand free, were nevertheless {{large enough to be}} retained in the reactor and gradually grew larger through bacterial growth and by clumping together with other fragments. In the final steady state, high cell densities were maintained in the form of aggregates, while sand had virtually disappeared due to sampling losses and wash-out. Numerical cell densities within aggregates ranged from 1012 /ml at the periphery to very low values in the center. The cells were enmeshed in a polymer matrix containing polysaccharides; nevertheless, carbon sufficiency was not a prerequisite to sustain high hold-up ratios...|$|R
