5|$|There {{are other}} missing B <b>vitamins</b> which were {{reclassified}} or {{determined not to}} be <b>vitamins.</b> For example, B9 is folic acid and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other <b>vitamins</b> already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for internal use), biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as <b>vitamins</b> by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex <b>vitamins</b> (e.g. Bm). There are other D <b>vitamins</b> now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. There appears to be no consensus on any <b>vitamins</b> Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as <b>Vitamins</b> N or I, although the latter may have been another form of one of the other <b>vitamins</b> or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidant <b>vitamins</b> {{are found}} in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. <b>Vitamins</b> A, C, and E can be {{destroyed}} by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. The effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant <b>vitamins</b> than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Humans must consume <b>vitamins</b> {{periodically}} {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different <b>vitamins</b> vary widely; <b>vitamins</b> A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in <b>vitamins</b> A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason that}} the set of <b>vitamins</b> skips {{directly}} from E to K is that the <b>vitamins</b> corresponding to letters F–J were either reclassified over time, discarded as false leads, or renamed because of their relationship to vitaminB, which became a complex of <b>vitamins.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Vitamins</b> are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B <b>vitamins</b> and vitamin C). Water-soluble <b>vitamins</b> dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble <b>vitamins</b> are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble <b>vitamins.</b> Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Total <b>vitamin</b> B 12 levels {{decrease}} significantly {{during pregnancy}} and recover to normal values within 8 -week postpartum. Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) reflects the active part of <b>vitamin</b> B 12 {{and has been}} shown to remain constant during pregnancy and postpartum. A mechanism of redistribution of <b>vitamin</b> B 12 is suggested, with a shift toward holoTC if there is insufficient total <b>vitamin</b> B 12 available. Our objective was to examine <b>vitamin</b> B 12 deficiency and the active <b>vitamin</b> B 12 fraction in postpartum women. Methods Total <b>vitamin</b> B 12 and holoTC were measured in 171 women within 48 hours (T 0) and at 5 weeks (T 5) postpartum. <b>Vitamin</b> B 12 deficiency was defined as total <b>vitamin</b> B 12 < 180 pmol/L or holoTC < 32 pmol/L. The active <b>vitamin</b> B 12 fraction was defined as holoTC/total <b>vitamin</b> B 12. Results Without intervention, <b>vitamin</b> B 12 deficiency based on both serum total <b>vitamin</b> B 12 and holoTC changed from 75 % and 60 %, to respectively 10 % and 6 % at T 5. The fraction of active <b>vitamin</b> B 12 was significant higher in <b>vitamin</b> B 12 deficient women at both time points and across time (P <. 0001 and P =. 002). A high fraction of active <b>vitamin</b> B 12 was only present in women with total <b>vitamin</b> B 12 deficiency at T 0. At T 5, no high <b>vitamin</b> B 12 fraction was found. Conclusion The changes in total <b>vitamin</b> B 12 levels seem to be based on a physiological changes rather than <b>vitamin</b> B 12 deficiency. The results of this study confirm the hypothesis that a shift toward the metabolic active <b>vitamin</b> B 12 (holoTC) occurs in women with insufficient available total <b>vitamin</b> B 12...|$|R

5|$|Until the mid-1930s, {{when the}} first {{commercial}} yeast-extract vitamin B complex and semi-synthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold, <b>vitamins</b> were obtained solely through food intake, and changes in diet (which, for example, could occur during a particular growing season) usually greatly altered the types and amounts of <b>vitamins</b> ingested. However, <b>vitamins</b> have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and synthetic-source multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives, {{since the middle of}} the 20th century.

5|$|<b>Vitamins</b> have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of <b>vitamins,</b> the B complex <b>vitamins,</b> function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, <b>vitamins</b> may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E
40|$|Supplemental <b>vitamin</b> D is {{available}} in 2 distinct forms: ergocalciferol (<b>vitamin</b> D 2) and cholecalciferol (<b>vitamin</b> D 3).
