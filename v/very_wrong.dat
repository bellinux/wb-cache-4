5|$|A {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to the Idle Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included Gravity Bone as an additional feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes <b>very</b> <b>wrong.</b> The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, who called the very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is <b>very</b> <b>wrong</b> for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E

They were there for us to enjoy and they were there for us to pray. But it wasn't meant to be carved into images, which is <b>very</b> <b>wrong</b> for all of us. The more I think about it, the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, but all of us.|$|E
25|$|Eihei-ji {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Zen {{training}} facilities in Japan, and the abbot at this time was Gempo Kitano-roshi. Prior to coming to Japan, Kitano was head of Soto Zen in Korea. He also was one of the founders of Zenshuji, a Soto Zen temple located in Los Angeles, California. Suzuki's father and Kitano had a tense history between them. Sogaku had trained with Kitano in his early Zen training and felt that he was such a high priest due to familial status and connections. Shunryu did not see this in Kitano, however. He saw a humble man who gave clear instruction, and Shunryu realized that his father was <b>very</b> <b>wrong</b> in his assessment.|$|E
25|$|While {{on their}} second road trip, Humbert becomes {{suspicious}} that a driver is following them. On one occasion, Humbert leaves Dolores in a Texas hotel to run errands. After returning, he discovers Dolores's hair is disheveled and her make up is smudged. He strongly suspects {{she has had}} sex with another man while he was out {{but he has no}} way to prove it. Later in the trip, Dolores falls ill and Humbert checks her into a hospital while he stays in a nearby motel. After several days, he contacts a nurse at the hospital to inquire about Dolores's condition. However, the nurse surprises him by saying her uncle has paid her bill, checked her out and has taken her to her grandfather's home. Humbert knows Lolita has no living relatives and immediately realizes something is <b>very</b> <b>wrong.</b> He embarks on a frantic search to find Dolores and her abductor but fails.|$|E

500|$|After all, {{the carpet}} {{was only one}} of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the {{financial}} affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something <b>very</b> <b>wrong</b> with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the [...] "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted [...] "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge of}} [...] "Lamb of God" [...] paraphrases {{the chorus of}} [...] "Across the Universe" [...] (from 1970's Let It Be), whose lyric [...] "Nothing's gonna change my world" [...] {{inspired}} the song. Manson elaborated that: [...] "Mark David Chapman came along and proved him <b>very</b> <b>wrong.</b> That was always something growing up that was very sad and tragic to me". The song uses the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to criticize the media's veneration of death, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. [...] "Burning Flag" [...] is a heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band Ministry. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: [...] "Valentine's Day", [...] "The Fall of Adam", [...] "King Kill 33°" [...] and [...] "Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)", as each song abruptly ends and is instantaneously followed by the intro of the proceeding track.|$|E
500|$|The 59th Division {{was rushed}} to Ireland in {{response}} to the Easter Rising of April 1916, where Blackader's new brigade saw its first active service. Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have just done one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do. I have had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across. There must be something <b>very</b> <b>wrong</b> in the state of things that makes a man like that a rebel. I don't wonder that his pupils adored him." ...|$|E

500|$|When Philomena Goins Doctor {{found out}} what her son had done, she became enraged and {{threatened}} to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS' 60 Minutes, and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist Ed Bradley. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore's story and Bradley's television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, {{to keep them from}} becoming bitter. [...] Michael D'Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, [...] "veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up." [...] Robie Mortin described her past this way: [...] "I knew that something went <b>very</b> <b>wrong</b> in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn't angry or anything." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1977, on {{the final}} date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, {{a small group of}} noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was not the only band member to feel disaffected at the show: guitarist David Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual encores ("Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them"), leaving the band, with backup guitarist Snowy White, to improvise a slow, sad twelve-bar blues, which Waters {{described}} as [...] "some music to go home to". [...] Later that night, returning from hospital after an injury sustained to his foot while play-fighting backstage with manager Steve O'Rourke, Waters spoke with music producer Bob Ezrin, and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the performers and the audience. He later said, [...] "I loathed playing in stadiums ... I kept saying to people on that tour, 'I'm not really enjoying this ... there is something <b>very</b> <b>wrong</b> with this.'" [...] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and Nick Mason was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write new material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a young child. To execute The Wall concept was to attempt to analyse the performer's psychological separation from the audience, using a physical structure as a metaphorical and theatrical device.|$|E
500|$|Inside Zimbabwe, the {{reaction}} was hostile to the players. Zimbabwe's Minister of Information, Jonathan Moyo, called Olonga an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] who had [...] "a black skin and a white mask". Zanu PF information secretary Nathan Shamuyarira claimed they were forced into it by the British media, and [...] "No true Zimbabwean would have joined in," [...] but [...] "Olonga is not a Zimbabwean, he is a Zambian". Olonga was charged with treason, an offence punishable by death. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai released a statement {{in support of the}} protest. He was charged with treason, although the charge was later dropped. Givemore Makoni, the President of Takashinga Cricket Club where Olonga played said [...] "It is disgraceful what Henry Olonga and Andy Flower have done. Taking politics on to the playing field is a thing the International Cricket Council and all sports organisations have been trying to avoid," [...] and that [...] "by taking politics on to the field and bringing the game into disrepute Henry appears to have breached Takashinga's code of conduct". Olonga was immediately suspended and later sacked by Takashinga Cricket Club. Stephen Mandongo, the President of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union also condemned the protest, saying [...] "What Flower and Olonga did is <b>very</b> <b>wrong.</b> They have jeopardised our reputation when given this once in a lifetime chance to host the World Cup ... It would be wrong if they wore black armbands again." [...] They referred the matter to the International Cricket Council, who deemed that they had taken a political action, but refused to charge them with a formal offence. Instead, they released a statement reiterating the apolitical nature of the organisation, and asked the players not to wear black armbands {{for the rest of the}} tournament, with the threat of more serious punishment if they continued to wear them.|$|E
