2500|$|Most {{vibration}} {{testing is}} {{conducted in a}} 'single DUT axis' at a time, even though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously. [...] MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter testing. The <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of the resonances that may {{be present in the}} future. Devices specifically designed to trace or record vibrations are called vibroscopes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Vibration {{qualification}} {{testing of}} propellant actuated devices or power cartridges used in fighter aircraft pose {{a challenge for}} the design and fabrication of the <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> for multi-direction. The <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> is made for CDBU type of cartridge among the various cartridges. Fixture for vibration testing is of cylindrical structure having maximum diameter of 235 mm and of 36 mm thickness. The weight of the fixture is restricted up to the 5 kg. This structure has analyzed and experimentally evaluated. The design of fixture has its certain advantages like; it can accommodate 16 cartridges in multi-directions {{at a time and}} can be tested, it uses all the fixing points of the shaker table. Fixture is designed with Aluminum 6061 -T 6 Alloy adhering to the general principles of vibration fixture design avoiding resonance in the frequency range of test. Theoretical analysis for the natural frequency calculations is based on advanced theory of plate bending. Computer Aided Design software Pro-E Wildfire 4. 0 is used for modeling and drafting work of the fixture. Finite element software ANSYS is used for the modal and random response analysis. Experimental trial was conducted for the two axis for 6 hrs. Control and monitoring accelerometers are bonded at critical locations to get the best results.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this 24 month project focused on improving microhole coiled tubing drilling bottom hole assembly (BHA) reliability and performance, while reducing the drilling cost and complexity associated with inclined/horizontal well sections. This was to be accomplished by {{eliminating the need for}} a downhole drilling tractor or other downhole coiled tubing (CT) friction mitigation techniques when drilling long (> 2, 000 ft.) of inclined/horizontal wellbore. The technical solution to be developed and evaluated in this project was based on vibrating the coiled tubing at surface to reduce the friction {{along the length of the}} downhole CT drillstring. The Phase 1 {{objective of}} this project centered on determining the optimum surface-applied vibration system design for downhole CT friction mitigation. Design of the system would be based on numerical modeling and laboratory testing of the CT friction mitigation achieved with various types of surface-applied vibration. A numerical model was developed to predict how far downhole the surface-applied vibration would travel. A <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture,</b> simulating microhole CT drilling in a horizontal wellbore, was constructed and used to refine and validate the numerical model. Numerous tests, with varying surface-applied vibration parameters were evaluated in the <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b> The data indicated that as long as the axial force on the CT was less than the helical buckling load, axial vibration of the CT was effective at mitigating friction. However, surface-applied vibration only provided a small amount of friction mitigation as the helical buckling load on the CT was reached or exceeded. Since it would be impractical to assume that routine field operations be conducted at less than the helical buckling load of the CT, it was determined that this technical approach did not warrant the additional cost and maintenance issues that would be associated with the surface vibration equipment. As such, the project was concluded following completion of Phase 1, and Phase 2 (design, fabrication, and testing of a prototype surface vibration system) was not pursued...|$|E

The force limited <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> technique has been utilized at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other NASA centers to provide more realistic <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> environments for aerospace flight hardware. In standard random <b>vibration</b> <b>tests,</b> the payload is mounted to a rigid fixture and the interface acceleration is controlled to a specified level based on a conservative estimate of the expected flight environment. In force limited <b>vibration</b> <b>tests,</b> both the acceleration and force are controlled at the mounting interface to compensate for differences between the flexible flight mounting and rigid <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b> This minimizes the over test at the payload natural frequencies and results in more realistic forces being transmitted at the mounting interface. Force and acceleration response data was provided by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for a test article that was flown in 1998 on a Black Brant sounding rocket. The measured flight interface acceleration data {{was used as the}} reference acceleration spectrum. Using this acceleration spectrum, three analytical methods were used to estimate the force limits. Standard random and force limited <b>vibration</b> <b>tests</b> {{were performed}} and the results are compared with the flight data.

40|$|Vibration fixtures, at times, have {{resonant}} frequencies {{that exist}} in the frequency range needed for conducting <b>vibration</b> <b>tests.</b> These resonant frequencies can cause significant problems when running <b>vibration</b> <b>tests</b> over ranges which include these resonances. A test engineer will attempt to control the shaker system through a feedback accelerometer which controls the level of vibration input into the test specimen. However, the control accelerometer can only control the level of vibration at that point. It cannot change the resonant behavior of the vibration fixture. Some problems involving this are described in this article along with some basic material about these phenomena. Often times, <b>vibration</b> <b>tests,</b> are performed to qualify or verify the acceptability of specific hardware for certain environments. We use shaker systems to generate forces or accelerations to replicate some known operating condition or to generate an input spectrum that envelops the actual environment. Usually, a specification mandates the particular input that is needed to satisfy the requirement. The interface between the shaker and the test article is the <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b> As defined in this article, the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> includes the shaker armature, expander head (or slip plate) as well as the attachment fixture (i. e.,. the item designed to accommodate the test specimen).

40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} concept and applications of Force Limited <b>Vibration</b> <b>Testing.</b> The goal of <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> of aerospace hardware is to identify problems {{that would result in}} flight failures. The commonly used aerospace <b>vibration</b> <b>tests</b> uses artificially high shaker forces and responses at the resonance frequencies of the test item. It has become common to limit the acceleration responses in the test to those predicted for the flight. This requires an analysis of the acceleration response, and requires placing accelerometers on the test item. With the advent of piezoelectric gages it has become possible to improve <b>vibration</b> <b>testing.</b> The basic equations have are reviewed. Force limits are analogous and complementary to the acceleration specifications used in conventional <b>vibration</b> <b>testing.</b> Just as the acceleration specification is the frequency spectrum envelope of the in-flight acceleration at the interface between the test item and flight mounting structure, the force limit is the envelope of the in-flight force at the interface. In force limited <b>vibration</b> <b>tests,</b> both the acceleration and force specifications are needed, and the force specification is generally based on and proportional to the acceleration specification. Therefore, force limiting does not compensate for errors {{in the development of the}} acceleration specification, e. g., too much conservatism or the lack thereof. These errors will carry over into the force specification. Since in-flight vibratory force data are scarce, force limits are often derived from coupled system analyses and impedance information obtained from measurements or finite element models (FEM). Fortunately, data on the interface forces between systems and components are now available from system acoustic and <b>vibration</b> <b>tests</b> of development test models and from a few flight experiments. Semi-empirical methods of predicting force limits are currently being developed on the basis of the limited flight and system test data. A simple two degree of freedom system is shown and the governing equations for basic force limiting results for this system are reviewed. The design and results of the shuttle vibration forces (SVF) experiments are reviewed. The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) also was used to validate force limiting. Test instrumentation and supporting equipment are reviewed including piezo-electric force transducers, signal processing and conditioning systems, <b>test</b> <b>fixtures,</b> and <b>vibration</b> controller systems.

40|$|The {{standard}} method for defining static equivalent structural load factors for components {{is based on}} Mile s equation. Unless test data is available, 5 % critical damping is assumed for all components when calculating loads. Application of this method to electrical cable tie-down hardware often results in high loads, which often exceed the capability of typical tie-down options such as cable ties and P-clamps. Random <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> of electrical cables was used {{to better understand the}} factors that influence component loads: natural frequency, damping, and mass participation. An initial round of <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> successfully identified variables of interest, checked out the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> and instrumentation, and provided justification for removing some conservatism in the {{standard method}}.
