50|$|This {{muscle is}} {{categorised}} into five types according to morphology: the independent type, <b>VI-type,</b> VL-type, common type and two-belly type. The independent type of the tensor vastus intermedius, {{also the most}} frequent type, has its tendon lying between the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis. For the <b>VI-type</b> and the VL-type, the tendinous part of the muscle is integrated into the fascia of the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis respectively. For the common type, it has a non-separable origin between the intertrochanteric line and greater trochanter. Two separate muscle bellies can be found for the two-belly types.|$|E

The resulting multivalued function does not satisfy the hypergeometric differential equation of the periods, and we conclude that the cycle is indecomposable for most points in the mirror family.

40|$|Further {{delineation}} of the antigens {{characteristic of}} the Vi or γ 2 c subgroup of γ-globulin was carried out utilizing a number of rabbit and primate antisera. Two genetic antigens characteristic of this subgroup, Gm(b) and Gm(g), were also detected by precipitation techniques with certain of the antisera. These were clearly differentiated from antigens common to all proteins of this subgroup. The concentration, of Vi protein in normal and pathological sera from several population groups was measured quantitatively utilizing a variety of immunological procedures. All sera studied showed measurable levels. The mean value for Caucasian sera was 1. 06 mg/ml, representing approximately 8 % of γG-globulin. This agreed closely with a figure of 8. 4 % for the incidence of myeloma proteins of the Vi subgroup among all γG-myeloma proteins in Caucasians. A relationship {{was found between the}} Vi subgroup concentration and the specific genetic type of a given individual. Measurements of the Gm(b) genetic determinants, which are found solely in <b>Vi-type</b> proteins, brought forward this relationship. Gm(b+) individuals showed higher concentrations of <b>Vi-type</b> γ-globulin than those who were Gm(b-), and this difference was statistically significant for both the homozygous and heterozygous states. It appeared that the structural genes for Gm(b+) polypeptide chains showed a greater synthetic capacity than those for Gm(b-) types. The possible significance of such effects in governing the relative composition of the antibody population in a given individual is discussed...|$|E

The regulator map and Picard-Fuchs equations In this paper we study the first nonclassical higher K-group K 1 (X) for a smooth com-plex projective surface X. It was conjectured by H. Esnault around 1995 that certain elements in this group can be detected in the transcendental part of the Deligne coho-mology group H 3 D (X, Z(2)) via the regulator (Chern class) map. The transcendental part of the regulator map is defined as an Abel-Jacobi-type integral of holomorphi...|$|E
40|$|Applying the {{dynamical}} coherent potential approximation to {{a simple}} model, we have theoretically studied {{the behavior of the}} optical bandedge in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). For A^ II_ 1 -xMn_xB^ <b>VI-type</b> DMS, the present study reveals that the linear relationship between exchange-spitting Δ E_ex and the averaged magnetization |x | widely holds for different values of x. The ratio, Δ E_ex/x , however, depends not only the exchange strength but also the band offset. Furthermore, the present study reveals that in the low dilution of Ga_ 1 -xMn_xAs the optical bandedge exists not at the bandedge of the impurity band but near the bottom of host band. The optical bandedge behaves as if the exchange interaction is ferromagnetic although the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction actually operates at Mn site. We conclude that the spin-dependent shift of the carrier states between the impurity band and host band accompanying with the change of magnetization causes the apparently ferromagnetic behavior of the optical bandedge which was reported in the magnetoreflection measurement of Ga_ 1 -xMn_xAs.

40|$|SUMMARY. Hybridomas were {{prepared}} from mice immunized with myosin from the enlarged left ventricle of a 53 -year-old female with an obstructive cardiomyopathy. The specificity of 15 monoclonal antibodies to myosin heavy chains {{was assessed by}} the reactivity of muscle extracts and of chymotryptic myosin fragments of different sizes with these antibodies, {{as determined by the}} immune replicate technique; some of the monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted only with the ventricular V 3 -type myosin from hypothyroid rats, whereas the other antibodies cross-reacted both with the latter and with the ventricular <b>VI-type</b> myosins from normal young rats. Immu-nological heterogeneity of the fibers from human atrial muscles and from human ventricular muscles was detected by some of the antimyosin antibodies by means of indirect immunofluores-cence. Histochemical fiber heterogeneity was also detected by adenosine triphosphatase staining of the same tissues. Because of the close correspondence observed between the immunological and histochemical responses of atrial fibers, it has been postulated that at least two distinct types of myosin exist in the human atrium, each myosin form being histochemically related to either a- or / 3 -like ventricular myosin heavy chains. In contrast, there was no direct correspondence between the two experimental approaches in human ventricles, and it is postulated that at leas...|$|E
40|$|An {{antiserum}} prepared {{against a}} lambda-Bence Jones protein {{from a patient}} (SUT) who had multiple myeloma and amyloidosis had specificity for lambda-light chains of the chemically defined variable (V) region lambda-chain subgroup lambda VI. Sequence analyses of protein SUT and of five other lambda-light chains recognized immunologically as of the V lambda VI subgroup revealed that all six proteins had the N-terminal sequence characteristic for prototype lambda VI proteins. The isotypic nature of the V lambda VI subgroup was demonstrated immunochemically: lambda VI molecules were detected among light chains isolated from the IgG proteins of each of 12 normal individuals and lambda VI antigenic determinants were also detectable on the intact IgG proteins. The frequency of lambda VI molecules among lambda-type light chains {{is estimated to be}} approximately 5 % based on the finding that 5 of 91 lambda Bence Jones proteins were of the V lambda VI subgroup. Proteins of the V lambda VI subgroup, in contrast to those of the other five chemically-classified lambda chain subgroup, appear to be preferentially associated with the amyloid process as evidenced by the fact that all six lambda VI proteins were obtained from patients with amyloidosis AL and, in addition, 5 of 42 lambda-type monoclonal immunoglobulins from patients with primary or myeloma-associated amyloidosis were classified by immunodiffusion analyses as having lambda <b>VI-type</b> light chains...|$|E
40|$|The {{quadriceps}} femoris {{is traditionally}} {{described as a}} muscle group composed of the rectus femoris and the three vasti. However, clinical experience and investigations of anatomical specimens are {{not consistent with the}} textbook description. We have found a second tensor-like muscle between the vastus lateralis (VL) and the vastus intermedius (VI), hereafter named the tensor VI (TVI). The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify whether this intervening muscle was a variation of the VL or the VI, or a separate head of the extensor apparatus. Twenty-six cadaveric lower limbs were investigated. The architecture of the quadriceps femoris was examined with special attention to innervation and vascularization patterns. All muscle components were traced from origin to insertion and their affiliations were determined. A TVI was found in all dissections. It was supplied by independent muscular and vascular branches of the femoral nerve and lateral circumflex femoral artery. Further distally, the TVI combined with an aponeurosis merging separately into the quadriceps tendon and inserting on the medial aspect of the patella. Four morphological types of TVI were distinguished: Independent-type (11 / 26), <b>VI-type</b> (6 / 26), VL-type (5 / 26), and Common-type (4 / 26). This study demonstrated that the quadriceps femoris is architecturally different from previous descriptions: there is an additional muscle belly between the VI and VL, which cannot be clearly assigned to the former or the latter. Distal exposure shows that this muscle belly becomes its own aponeurosis, which continues distally as part of the quadriceps tendon...|$|E
40|$|The dual {{nature of}} Vi-phage type {{specificity}} of lysogenic Vi-types of Salmonella typhosa was first expressed by Anderson and Fraser (1955). These workers felt that two factors played a part: (i) {{the nature of}} the precursor nonlyso-genic parent culture of the Vi-type; (ii) the character of the temperate or type-determining phage which infects the precursor culture. This duality was expressed by Anderson and Fraser by structural formulas in which the precursor type culture is designated by capital letters and the type-determining phage by lower case letters or numerals, in parentheses. Thus Vi-phage type Di is expressed as A(d,), type D 6 as A(d 6), type 25 as A(25 '), etc. Proof of the correctness of the formulas has, with but one exception, been obtained by infect-ing nonlysogenic Vi-types with type-determining phages and noting the character of any type transformations. The exception occurred in the case of type F 2. Old stock cultures of type F 2 were observed by Felix and Anderson (1951) to give rise to nonlysogenic mutants that were found to be type Fl. Lysogenization of a type F, culture with the temperate phage carried by F 2 cultures converted F, into F 2. The formula, therefore, for type F 2 is expressed as F,(f 2). Additional proof of the correctness of the structural formulas of Anderson and Fraser would require two steps: (i) derivation from lysogenic type cultures of nonlysogenic mutants that correspond to precursor types of the struc-tural formulas; (ii) conversion of the mutants to the original lysogenic type by treatment with the appropriate temperate phage. In the present study, this has been carried out successfully with nine lysogenic Vi-phage types of S. typhosa, employing ultraviolet light radiation as the mutagenic agent in step (i). Reconversion of the "cured " culture to its original <b>Vi-type</b> (step (ii)) has been accomplished by lysogenization wit...|$|E
