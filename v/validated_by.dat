5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these findings have been independently <b>validated</b> <b>by</b> retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggested}} subspecies {{were never}} widely used or <b>validated</b> <b>by</b> field biologists; the described morphological differences were small {{enough that they}} could have resulted from simple variation in nonrepresentative samples. Genetic analyses have tested the existence of three of these putative subspecies. A study examining mitochondrial DNA from skin biopsies taken from 13 sampling locations, considered genetic diversity and structure among hippo populations across the continent. The authors found low, but significant, genetic differentiation among H. a. amphibius, H. a. capensis, and H. a. kiboko. Neither H. a. tschadensis nor H. a. constrictus has been tested.|$|E
5|$|Chandler feared Laffoon, who {{controlled}} the State Democratic Central Committee, {{would attempt to}} hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election, and he used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state {{the next day and}} challenged Chandler's authority to make the call, but Chandler's actions were <b>validated</b> <b>by</b> the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.|$|E

5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge <b>validated</b> <b>by</b> public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
