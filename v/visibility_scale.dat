Materials and Methods: We enrolled 54 patients who underwent both the SSDR and CR of the lower extremities. The study evaluated and statistically compared the image quality of four features (outer cortex, inner cortex, trabecu-lae and intermuscular fat) at six different levels (pelvis, hip, femur, knee, tibia and ankle) between each method. The image quality was evaluated using a <b>visibility</b> <b>scale,</b> and the entrance skin dose was measured using a dosimeter at three dif-ferent levels of a phantom (hip, knee, and ankle). Results: The mean image <b>visibility</b> <b>scale</b> values for the SSDR method were significantly higher than for the CR method. The entrance skin dose for the SSDR method was 278 μGy at each level, compared to the entrance skin doses of the CR method, which were 3, 410 μGy for the hip, 1, 152 μGy for the knee, and 580 μ Gy for the ankle...|$|E

40|$|Major mergers of disc {{galaxies are}} thought to be a {{substantial}} driver in galaxy evolution. To trace the fraction and rate of galaxy mergers over cosmic times, several observational techniques have been developed over the last decade, including parametrized morphological selection. We apply this morphological selection of mergers to 21 cm radio emission line (H I) column density images of spiral galaxies in nearby surveys. In this paper, we investigate how long a 1 : 1 merger is visible in H I from N-body simulations. We evaluate the merger visibility times for selection criteria based on four parameters: Concentration, Asymmetry, M 20 and the Gini parameter of the second-order moment of the flux distribution (GM). Of three selection criteria used in the literature, one based on Concentration and M 20 works well for the H I perspective with a merger time-scale of 0. 4 Gyr. Of the three selection criteria defined in our previous paper, the GM performs well and cleanly selects mergers for 0. 69 Gyr. The other two criteria (Asymmetry–M 20 and Concentration– M 20) select isolated discs as well, but perform best for face-on, gas-rich discs (Tmgr ∼ 1 Gyr).

Here, we compared unconscious processing under continuous flash suppression (CFS) and meta-contrast masking, using similar stimuli, tasks and measures. Participants were presented with a prime arrow followed by a target arrow. They made a speeded response to the target arrow direction and then reported on the prime’s visibility. Perception of the prime was made liminal using either meta-contrast masking (Experiment 1) or CFS (Experiments 2 and 3). Conscious perception of the prime was assessed using a sensitive <b>visibility</b> <b>scale</b> ranging from 0 to 3 and unconscious processing was measured as the priming effect on target discrimination performance of prime-target direction congruency when prime visibility was null. Crucially, {{in order to ensure that}} the critical stimuli were equally distant from the limen of consciousness, we sought stimulus and temporal parameters for which the proportion of 0 -visibility trials was comparable for the two methods. We found that the method used to prevent conscious perception matters: unconscious processing was substantial with meta-contrast masking but absent with CFS. These findings suggest that CFS allows very little perceptual processing, if at all, and that previous reports of high-level and complex unconscious processing during CFS may result from partial awareness...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Contemporary {{axillary}} {{brachial plexus}} block is performed by separate injections targeting radial, median, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerve. These nerves are arranged around the axillary artery, making ultrasound visualisation sometimes challenging. In particular, the radial nerve {{can be difficult}} to localise deep to the artery. OBJECTIVES The primary aim {{of this study was to}} investigate which arm position optimises the visibility of the radial nerve. Secondary aims were the visibility and position of the other nerves during varying arm positions. DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING University teaching hospital, November 2012. PARTICIPANTS Twenty volunteers, recruited by an advertisement on the Department's bulletin board. Inclusion criterion age more than 18 years. Exclusion criteria: refusal of ultrasound examination, restricted shoulder movement, local infection, BMI greater than 30 kgm(- 2). INTERVENTION One anaesthesiologist performed bilateral ultrasound examinations of the axillary brachial plexus on 20 volunteers. Each arm was placed in different positions [shoulder (S) 90 degrees or 180 degrees abduction, elbow (E) 0 degrees or 90 degrees extension] and scans were performed proximally in the axilla, and additionally 5 cm distally to this point [proximal (P) vs. distal (D) ], resulting in eight different scans stored for off-line analysis performed by two blinded anaesthesiologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES For radial, median, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerve, visibility was assessed on a sixpoint <b>visibility</b> <b>scale.</b> Distances and angles of the nerves relative to the axillary artery and distances relative to the skin were measured. RESULTS No significant differences between arm positions were found in the visibility score of radial (P = 0. 359) and musculocutaneous nerves (P = 0. 073). Visibility of the median nerve was improved in positions S 90 degrees/E 0 degrees/D and S 180 degrees/E 0 degrees/P (P = 0. 02). The ulnar nerve was more visible in position S 180 degrees/E 0 degrees/P and D (P = 0. 007). The greatest distance between artery and radial nerve was 7. 4 +/- 4. 7 mm at an angle of 120 +/- 14 degrees in position S 180 degrees/E 0 degrees/D.

40|$|The {{black hole}} {{in the center of}} the Galaxy, {{associated}} with the compact source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is predicted to cast a shadow upon the emission of the surrounding plasma flow, which encodes the influence of general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network with a goal of imaging nearby supermassive black holes (in particular Sgr A* and M 87) with angular resolution sufficient to observe strong gravity effects near the event horizon. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations show that radio emission from Sgr A* exhibits variability on timescales of minutes, much shorter than the duration of a typical VLBI imaging experiment, which usually takes several hours. A changing source structure during the observations, however, violates one of the basic assumptions needed for aperture synthesis in radio interferometry imaging to work. By simulating realistic EHT observations of a model movie of Sgr A*, we demonstrate that an image of the average quiescent emission, featuring the characteristic black hole shadow and photon ring predicted by GR, can nonetheless be obtained by observing over multiple days and subsequent processing of the <b>visibilities</b> (<b>scaling,</b> averaging, and smoothing) before imaging. Moreover, it is shown that this procedure can be combined with an existing method to mitigate the effects of interstellar scattering.

Adding {{to the four}} targets previously studied, we report measurements of the K-band (2. 2 um) visibilities for four more targets, namely AKN 120, IC 4329 A, Mrk 6, and the radio-loud QSO 3 C 273 at z= 0. 158. The observed visibilities are quite high for all the targets, which we interpret {{as an indication of}} the partial resolution of the dust sublimation region. The effective ring radii derived from the observed <b>visibilities</b> <b>scale</b> approximately with L^ 1 / 2, where L is the AGN luminosity. Comparing the radii with those from independent optical-infrared reverberation measurements, these data support our previous claim that the interferometric ring radius is either roughly equal to or slightly larger than the reverberation radius. We interpret the ratio of these two radii for a given L as an approximate probe of the radial distribution of the inner accreting material. We show tentative evidence that this inner radial structure might be closely related to the radio-loudness of the central engine. Finally, we re-observed the brightest Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. Its marginally higher visibility at a shorter projected baseline, compared to our previous measurements obtained one year before, further supports the partial resolution of the inner structure. We did not detect any significant change in the implied emission size when the K-band flux was brightened by a factor of 1. 5 over a time interval of one year.

Atmospheric correction methods based on radiative transfer provide good results as they account for scattering and absorption components effects of atmosphere over electromagnetic radiation, but the lack of ground-daily information of atmospheric parameters for radiative transfer-based models limits these methods operation. Our objective was to perform atmospheric correction of GeoEye- 1 images using MODIS-based parameters as input data for the Moderate-Resolution Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (MODTRAN) code. That was achieved using aerosol optical thickness, Ångström exponent, and water column data extractd from MODIS Aqua data in order to obtain <b>visibility,</b> aerosol <b>scale</b> height, and atmospheric model to be used in MODTRAN.

40|$|We {{present the}} E-field Parallel Imaging Calibration (EPICal) algorithm, which {{addresses}} {{the need for}} a fast calibration method for direct imaging radio astronomy correlators. Direct imaging involves a spatial fast Fourier transform of antenna signals, alleviating an O(N_ant^ 2) computational bottleneck typical in radio correlators, and yielding a more gentle O(N_g _ 2 N_g) scaling, where N_ant is the number of antennas in the array and N_g is the number of grid points in the imaging analysis. This can save orders of magnitude in computation cost for next generation arrays consisting of hundreds or thousands of antennas. However, because antenna signals are mixed in the imaging correlator without creating visibilities, gain correction must be applied prior to imaging, rather than on visibilities post-correlation. We develop the EPICal algorithm to form gain solutions quickly and without ever forming <b>visibilities.</b> This method <b>scales</b> as the number of antennas, and produces results comparable to those from visibilities.

It is the case of the child cluster in France or in Catalunya that includes much more than traditional clusters focused on a final homogeneous product; in fact this includes the production of toys, kids clothes, health products and furniture for children, among others, which belonged to separate sectors and clusters before. In addition to identifying new types of clusters that strengthen the visibility and work of their firms, the great majority of these clusters and districts, e. g. in the Basque Country, have become more ‘complex’ in depth (division and specialization of labor) and extension to a variety of activities that were quite separated from one another, though can now come together with the objective to respond to the new demand of local and global society. For instance, the demand for new renewable sources of energy promotes a change in sectoral/entrepreneurial attitudes, for which such diversified sectors as oil refinery, wind, maritime and solar energy, find representation in the same cluster association and recognize themselves as part of one 'complex' cluster that gains in <b>visibility</b> and <b>scale</b> of operations for global agents such as large industries, large scale construction projects, among others.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{theory for}} classification of natural biosonar targets is developed {{based on the}} properties of an example stimulus ensemble. An extensive set of echoes (84 800) from four different foliages was transcribed into a spike code using a parsimonious model (linear filtering, half-wave rectification, thresholding). The spike code is assumed to consist of time differences (interspike intervals) between threshold crossings. Among the elementary interspike intervals flanked by exceedances of adjacent thresholds, a few intervals triggered by disjoint half-cycles of the carrier oscillation stand out in terms of resolvability, <b>visibility</b> across resolution <b>scales</b> and a simple stochastic structure (uncorrelatedness). They are therefore argued to be a stochastic analogue to edges in vision. A three-dimensional feature vector representing these interspike intervals sustained a reliable target classification performance (0. 06 % classification error) in a sequential probability ratio test, which models sequential processing of echo trains by biological sonar systems. The dimensions of the representation are the first moments of duration and amplitude location of these interspike intervals {{as well as their}} number.

Digitally recorded maps are processed {{in a variety of}} ways to improve the <b>visibility</b> of features. <b>Scaling</b> of the recorded signal to match the 8 -bit gray-scale intensity range of a typical computer display system is almost always necessary. Inherent limitations of gray-scale displays have led to other intensity-encoding methods for X-ray maps, including clipping, histogram normalization, and pseudocolor <b>scales.</b> While feature <b>visibility</b> is improved by applying these scales, comparisons among image sets are difficult. Quantitative comparisons must be based on standardized intensities corrected for background to produce intensity ratio (k-value) maps. We have developed a new logarithmic, multiband color-encoding method to view these k-value maps more effectively. Three color bands are defined, starting with a dark primary color and grading to a bright pastel: blue = trace (0. 001 to 0. 01); green = minor (0. 01 to 0. 1); and red = major (0. 1 to 1. 0). Within each band, the color is assigned according to a logarithmic scale that depends on intensity ratio or compositional measurements. Logarithmic multiband color encoding permits direct comparisons of maps, such as maps of different elements in the same field of view or maps of the same element in different areas, because the color scale is identical for all maps...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a new technique}} for detecting radio transients based on interferometric closure quantities. The technique uses the bispectrum, the product of visibilities around a closed-loop of baselines of an interferometer. The bispectrum is calibration independent, resistant to interference, and computationally efficient, {{so it can be}} built into correlators for real-time transient detection. Our technique could find celestial transients anywhere in the field of view and localize them to arcsecond precision. At the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), such a system would have a high survey speed and a 5 -sigma sensitivity of 38 mJy on 10 ms timescales with 1 GHz of bandwidth. The ability to localize dispersed millisecond pulses to arcsecond precision in large volumes of interferometer data has several unique science applications. Localizing individual pulses from Galactic pulsars will help find X-ray counterparts that define their physical properties, while finding host galaxies of extragalactic transients will measure the electron density of the intergalactic medium with a single dispersed pulse. Exoplanets and active stars have distinct millisecond variability {{that can be used to}} identify them and probe their magnetospheres. We use millisecond time <b>scale</b> <b>visibilities</b> from the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) and VLA to show that the bispectrum can detect dispersed pulses and reject local interference.

At each site, four road workers walked in place wearing one of four different clothing options: a) standard road worker night vest, b) standard night vest plus retroreflective strips on thighs, c) standard night vest plus retroreflective strips on ankles and knees, d) standard night vest plus retroreflective strips on eight moveable joints (full biomotion).

Two independent masked observers manually segmented the OCT images to determine ChT at foveal centre, and averaged across a series of perifoveal zones over the central 5 mm. Results The average subfoveal ChT was 330 ± 65 µm (range 189 - 538 µm), and was significantly influenced by age (p= 0. 04). The ChT of the 4 to 6 year old age group (312 ± 62 µm) was significantly thinner compared to the 7 to 9 year olds (337 ± 65 µm, p< 0. 05) and bordered on significance compared to the 10 to 12 year olds (341 ± 61 µm, p= 0. 08).

An exhibition Discover the Power of Light! organised by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel attracted 270,000 visitors to the iconic Atomium Centre in Brussels. The European Researchers' Night on 25 September 2015 in 24 countries attracted over 1.1 million visitors, and many activities used the theme of light to align with IYL 2015. One notable example is CERN’s activities on light and poetry.  The art festival Nuit Blanche was organized in Bratislava on 10 October 2015, and together with the Festival of Light (10-12 October 2015) attracted 100,000 people to the streets of the Slovak capital. The science festival organised by the German Physical Society (DPG) and the Federal Ministry of Research in Jena, attracted more than 53,000 visitors from 27 September-1 October 2015. The Athens Science Festival celebrated from 17-22 March 2015 chose as its main theme light and its applications, and attracted 33,000 participants, including 8,000 students.|$|R

With their activities, like feeding on woody plants they may increase visibility of a habitat and produce coarse woody debris within that habitat. These changes in vegetation may influence major interactions between organisms, such as competition or even predation. I focused on the latter and experimentally tested the influence of elephant-induced vegetation changes on habitat and within-habitat scale risk. The experiment was performed in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa on resource hot spots in savannah grasslands, i. e. grazing lawns. This controlled for resource availability and ensured sufficient herbivore visitation. I created experimental manipulations that should influence perceived predation risk at habitat and within-habitat scale. Firstly, I compared treatment plots with high and low <b>visibility</b> at habitat <b>scale.</b> I expected herbivores to prefer high visibility plots. Secondly, I added coarse woody debris (CWD) to both closed and open plot, at within-habitat scale. CWD may act as escape impediments or may decrease visibility and thus increase perceived predation risk. I expected herbivores to choose plots without CWD. Then I added predator scat to all treatment plots to introduce immediate predation risk which should additionally increase the perceived risk. I expected smaller, more vulnerable herbivores to respond stronger to immediate risk than larger ones. Herbivore response, i. e. visitation, occupancy and herd size, to risk manipulations was monitored with camera traps. Impala and warthog reduced visitation of plots with coarse woody debris, suggesting they perceived risk at within-habitat scale. However, the response of impala was strongly dependent on presence of predator scat and time of day – impala only reduced visitation to plots with CWD at night and when risk was immediate. Warthog avoided lawn edges and impala did as well at night, but increased the visitation of closed plots without CWD during the day. These responses show the variation in perception of habitat scale risk of different prey species. White rhino did not respond clearly to within-habitat or habitat scale risk, which provides unique experimental evidence that this megaherbivore may indeed be relatively invulnerable to predation. My results show that elephant induced vegetation changes influence both fine scale and habitat scale predation risk, however the smaller herbivore species perceive risk differently than larger ones and the perceived risk changes in presence of predator cues...|$|R
