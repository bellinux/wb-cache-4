25|$|The {{thematic}} {{material of}} Symphony No. 2 {{is designed to}} emulate the sensation of flying. Barber was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not view the symphony as program music. However, in his program notes he mentions that the first movement was meant to capture the excitement of flying while the second movement was inspired by his night flights. The final movement begins with very fast string passages with no barlines to express the sensation of flight. Samuel Barber uses tension and release throughout to create {{a greater sense of}} energy. His use of ostinatos, polytonality, dissonance, and angular lines create a work that can be described as one of Barber's most progressive works. Barber would later revise the work and state that the symphony has no programmatic intentions.|$|E
500|$|Sir Geoffrey Archer was {{appointed}} Governor-General of Sudan in 1925 {{in place of}} Sir Lee Stack. One of his early decisions was to initiate {{the formation of the}} Sudan Defence Force, with a command completely separate from the Egyptian army. He dropped the Egyptian title [...] "Sirdar" [...] for the supreme commander, and did not wear the Egyptian tarboush. He made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was commander in chief of a purely Sudanese army, while reassuring Sudanese officers who had served in the Egyptian army that they would be retained if they had not taken part in the mutiny. The British authorities, who had again became hostile to Mahdism, banned enlistment of Ansar into the Sudanese Defence Force.|$|E
500|$|Tony Blair {{recorded}} his {{part for the}} episode in April 2003, in ten minutes at Downing Street. Blair was sent the script {{early on in the}} writing process, and it took eight months of negotiation between Fox and Blair's director of communications Alastair Campbell before Blair could appear as a guest star. In the original script, Blair was supposed to welcome the Simpsons to the United Kingdom [...] "with a garland of 'genuine Newcastle coal' and hand [...] a complimentary Corgi", but Campbell had them changed, as Blair [...] "made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was only interested in doing the show if he could promote tourism in Britain". The show's staff did not know whether Blair would actually record his lines until showrunner Al Jean and his wife were in London promoting the 300th episode of The Simpsons. They received a call stating: [...] "If you go over to Downing Street tomorrow and can promise to get the recording done in 15 minutes, then the Prime Minister will do it". Jean was [...] "so nervous, it was ridiculous" [...] when he met Blair, an event he has cited as [...] "one of the most fantastic moments of his life". Blair was the top choice to guest star in the episode, but the staff did not think they {{had a chance to get}} him to appear. Blair is the only head of government to guest star in the show, with Rudy Giuliani (who played himself in the episode [...] "Stop! Or My Dog Will Shoot") the only other politician to guest star.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, it was {{reported}} in the media that Duke endorsed 2016 presidential nominee Donald Trump for president. Duke responded on his personal website by saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not actually endorsed Trump. <b>He</b> later clarified <b>that</b> while <b>he</b> viewed Trump as [...] "the best of the lot", due to his stance on immigration, Trump's support for Israel was a dealbreaker for him. Duke claimed that [...] "Trump has made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?" [...] In December 2015, Duke said Donald Trump speaks more radically than <b>he</b> does, advising <b>that</b> Trump's radical speech is both a positive and a negative. In February 2016, Duke urged his listeners to vote Trump, saying that voting for anyone besides Donald Trump “is really treason to your heritage.” In 2016, someone claiming to be David Duke filed a lawsuit in a federal court attempting to bar Trump from the Florida presidential primary. The real Duke referred to the hoax as [...] "the biggest, dirtiest trick I've seen recently".|$|R
60|$|The king walked off, and Jesper {{looked in}} despair at the task before him. Then {{he sat down}} and tried what he could do at it, but it was soon <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> single-handed <b>he</b> could never hope to {{accomplish}} it in the time. Assistance was out of the question--unless, he suddenly thought--unless the King of the Ants could help. On him he began to call, and before many minutes had passed that royal personage made his appearance. Jesper explained the trouble he was in.|$|R
5000|$|Dąbrowski was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the levels}} <b>he</b> {{presents}} [...] "represent a heuristic device". In {{the process of}} development the structures of two or even three contiguous levels may exist side by side, although it must be understood that they exist in conflict. The conflict is resolved {{when one of the}} structures is eliminated, or at least comes under complete control of another structure.|$|R
2500|$|Four {{months after}} the {{incidents}} in New York, the Bennets have gone into hiding, having moved to Costa Verde, California, and assumed the last name of [...] "Butler." [...] Noah takes a subordinate job at a copy store called Copy Kingdom, and makes it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> won't stand for his younger superior's bullying management style. Despite going into hiding, he is still working to take down [...] "the Company" [...] {{with the help of}} Mohinder Suresh.|$|E
2500|$|At a National Day of Prayer {{event in}} the U.S. Capitol, Dobson called Barack Obama [...] "the {{abortion}} president." [...] He said, [...] "President Obama, before he was elected, made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to be the}} abortion president. He didn’t make any bones about it. This is something that he really was going to promote and support, and he has done that, and in a sense he is the abortion president." [...] Among others, Rep. Janice Hahn complained because Dobson used the National Day of Prayer for partisan purposes. She said, [...] "Dobson just blew a hole into this idea of being a nonpartisan National Day of Prayer. It was very disturbing to me...and really a shame. James Dobson hijacked the National Day of Prayer — this nonpartisan, nonpolitical National Day of Prayer — to promote his own distorted political agenda." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, though, {{she made}} the {{acquaintance}} of a wounded colonel of the hussars, Burmin, who was visiting the estate near hers. [...] Burmin was a handsome man who had once {{had a reputation as}} a notorious rake, but who was now both quiet and modest in his personality. [...] The two developed a warm friendship, and it became <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was so restrained that he never made any declaration of love or formal proposal to her. [...] Masha purposely arranged a situation in which {{they would be able to}} talk freely with no one else near. [...] Finally he breaks his silence: He loves her passionately but cannot hope for any happiness with her because he is already married, has been married for four years, to a woman whom he does not know and whom he cannot expect ever to see again.|$|E
50|$|When {{the results}} of the April 8, 2004 presidential {{election}} were announced, Benflis retired his mandate as Secretary-General of the FLN Party. He denounced the election results, which were seen by many as marred with fraud. But Ali Benflis made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> just because <b>he</b> was giving up his post, did not mean he was leaving the political scene. He insists he remains loyal to his ideas.|$|R
60|$|As to the {{deriving}} his Gift of Prophesy {{from the}} Devil, by that pretended Generation, I shall omit that Part, because, as I have all along insisted upon it, that Satan himself has no prophetic or predicting Powers of his own, {{it is not}} <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to me <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could convey it to his Posterity, nil dat quod not habet.|$|R
50|$|At the studios, Joey {{is stuck}} {{shooting}} an easy scene {{over and over}} since Richard is drunk and can barely stay focused. The director made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to Joey <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can't leave until the scenes are finished or as long as Richard is on set and conscious, so Joey convinces a confused Richard that they've completed all of their scenes and sends him home.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{not pleased}} to see him. He looked a little uneasy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hump!" [...] grunted Old Mr. Toad again, {{but it was}} <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{a little}} flattered by Peter's {{interest}} in him and was rapidly recovering his good nature.|$|E
60|$|Miner was plainly uncomfortable. He wriggled about uneasily {{and it was}} <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was there}} only because Old Mother Nature had {{commanded}} him to be there, and that {{the one thing he}} wanted most was to get back into his beloved ground. Old Mother Nature saw this and took pity on him. She picked him up and placed him on the ground where there was no opening near.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{admitted}} Charles, [...] "I do {{not know}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever does, in a general way; but however, it is a <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> thing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> admires you exceedingly. His head is full of some books <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is reading upon your recommendation, {{and he wants to}} talk to you about them; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh! I cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms! Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were in the other room. 'Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} 18, {{he moved}} to Nicosia for his studies. He lives there since and works as a music teacher in primary education. During his studies he was again {{given the chance to}} compose and perform. It was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't want to follow the usual musical norms in both the music and the lyrics, thus he's trying to create a more pioneer and {{authentic}} sound for his work.|$|R
60|$|The light grew dimmer, white mists {{began to}} trail about the heights above, and Millicent was getting cold. She was also getting angry--it {{looked as if}} the others were too busy eating or talking to care what had become of her; some of them ought to have come in search. She felt a {{grievance}} against Lisle in particular. Why she should blame him more than Nasmyth or Carew was not <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> except <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was more used to the country; but she felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ought to have come to her rescue. Then, fearing {{that she would have to}} spend the night on the hillside, she carefully crept toward a small level space near a jutting rock and sat down, shivering, while dusk slowly crept across the bush.|$|R
60|$|The shipman {{smiled at}} the words; but the smile died away from his lips when Nigel, with {{features}} set like ivory and eyes as hard as steel, pulled on the rope so as to bring the skiff under the counter. It was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would do even as he said. At the same time Aylward raised his bulky form from the deck, leaned for a moment against the bulwarks, and then tottered aft to his master's side.|$|E
60|$|They were {{standing}} facing {{one another in}} a grassy ring intersected by the path at the outlet of the wood. The insolent and overbearing look had passed away from the amateur's face, but a grim half-smile was on his lips and his eyes shone fiercely from under his tufted brows. From the way in which he stood it was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a past-master at the game. Tom Spring, as he paced lightly to right and left, looking for an opening, became suddenly aware that neither with Stringer nor with the redoubtable Painter himself had he ever faced a more business-like opponent. The amateur's left was well forward, his guard low, his body leaning back from the haunches, and his head well out of danger. Spring tried a light lead at the mark, and another at the face, but in an instant his adversary was on to him with a shower of sledge-hammer blows which it took him all his time to avoid. He sprang back, but there was no getting away from that whirlwind of muscle and bone. A heavy blow beat down his guard, a second landed on his shoulder, and over went the prize-fighter with the other on the top of him. Both sprang to their feet, glared at each other, and fell into position once more.|$|E
60|$|The {{development}} of war has depended largely upon two factors. One {{of these is}} invention. New weapons and new methods have become available, and have modified tactics, strategy, the relative advantage of offensive and defensive. The other chief factor {{in the evolution of}} the war has been social organisation. As Machiavelli points out in his Art of War, there was insufficient social stability in Europe to keep a properly trained and disciplined infantry in the field from the passing of the Roman legions to the appearance of the Swiss footmen. He makes it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> considers the fighting of the Middle Ages, though frequent and bloody, to be a confused, mobbing sort of affair, and politically and technically unsatisfactory. The knight was an egotist in armour. Machiavelli does small justice to the English bowmen. It is interesting to note that Switzerland, that present island of peace, was regarded by him as the mother of modern war. Swiss aggression was the curse of the Milanese. That is a remark by the way; our interest here is to note that modern war emerges upon history as the sixteenth century unfolds, as an affair in which the essential factor is the drilled and trained infantryman. The artillery is developing as a means of breaking the infantry; cavalry for charging them when broken, for pursuit and scouting. To this day this triple division of forces dominates soldiers' minds. The mechanical {{development of}} warfare has consisted largely in the development of facilities for enabling or hindering the infantry to get to close quarters. As that has been made easy or difficult the offensive or the defensive has predominated.|$|E
50|$|Deducing O'Felix is the murderer, Sam {{brings him}} to court. O'Felix {{was jealous of}} his former student's success and murdered him by spiking his coffee with some {{sleeping}} pills, causing O'Tabby to fall {{asleep at the wheel}} and drive off the cliff to his death. Tanya visits Sam one last time, making it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the romance <b>he</b> had hoped to have with her will never happen. Kitty starts to seduce Sam, only for reality to intrude via owner Jon Arbuckle asking Garfield what he's doing in the closet.|$|R
50|$|Elaman's {{personality}} {{consists of}} the unity of his general and specific personal features. Throughout the narration his character is complemented and enriched by nature. In the initial book of the trilogy Twilight Elaman is an ordinary fisherman. His main innate characteristics are impetuosity and firmness. From the <b>very</b> beginning is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is class conscious and educated. His disadvantage is it is no matter to him {{what happens in the}} outside world. The writer thus gradually lets the social beam into shady characters of the patriarchal circumstances.|$|R
2500|$|Mysterio {{later became}} a [...] "giant killer" [...] by {{defeating}} large opponents such as Kevin Nash, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton. He faced Nash at Uncensored in a match where Lex Luger interfered and helped Nash in winning the match. Although he participated in several notable matches {{with some of the}} heavyweight top card wrestlers, it was made <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would never receive a push to become a main eventer. This was due to Eric Bischoff utilizing cruiserweights as alternative, mid-card entertainment as opposed to the more conventional style that led WCW programming.|$|R
50|$|Born {{within a}} family of musicians, {{his father was a}} {{professor}} in the Band of Granada and his mother a pianist. Since childhood he was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to become a conductor.|$|E
50|$|Gilbert's {{address to}} the {{university}} during the inauguration ceremony in the Whitworth Hall on 22 October 2004 made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed the plan was achievable and listed five key elements in the transition from Good to Great, quoting the book of that title by Jim Collins.|$|E
5000|$|As a DJ, The Scumfrog has {{toured the}} world many times over. Even {{though he has}} played many festivals {{over the past ten}} years (Burning Man being his favorite), he makes it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> prefers smaller venues with great sound systems for the music that he plays. In 2015 he started a new brand of small-room {{underground}} clubbing named M.B.T.S.(Most Below The Surface) ...|$|E
50|$|For his part, Tchaikovsky {{was deeply}} {{offended}} by von Meck's apparent sudden {{lack of interest}} in him. It was not so much that she did not personally write to him anymore, because he knew she was chronically ill, but <b>that</b> the messages <b>he</b> received from Pachulski about her ceased to include any enquiries from her about his welfare, his music or his life, and they were reduced to meaningless politenesses. Tchaikovsky made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to Pachulski <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted and needed his relationship with Nadezhda to continue unchanged in the slightest degree, despite the cessation of her financial support. He expressed this in his letter to Pachulski of 6 June 1891, after eight months of waiting fruitlessly for a reply from von Meck.|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of the}} School of Education in SIUE in {{the early}} seventies, Wilson's work {{required}} him to look after student teachers and visit different high schools to shadow and mentor them. However, [...] "when Wilson walked in to Granite City High School one day, it was made <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not wanted simply for {{the color of his}} skin." [...] He went to supervise student teachers at Granite City, and it was not acceptable to the school. And so when {{he went back to the}} university. The university then decided not to send student teachers to Granite City until they accepted whoever SIUE sends, regardless of race. The impasse lasted for over a decade, until 1991 when Mr. Randy Burgess, an African-American broke Granite City’s unwritten policy concerning student teachers.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{think it}} so {{good of you}} to go, John. But it is just like you. You were always generous." [...] Soon after <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got up and went. It was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have no moment in which to say a word alone to Lily; and if he could find such a moment, what good would such a word do him? It was as yet but a few weeks since she had {{positively}} refused him. And he too remembered very well those two words which she had told him that she would write in her book. As he had been coming to the house he had told himself that his coming would be,--could be of no use. And yet he was disappointed with the result of his visit, although she had spoken to him so sweetly.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Rabou, who {{finished}} the novel [...] after Balzac's death, included Vautrin in this story. However, his Vautrin loses {{most of his}} former genius. The novel gives Vautrin a son (unlikely, seeing as it is made <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has never had any interest in women) and includes his death {{at the hands of}} a forger. Vautrin's later lifestory is not considered canon.|$|E
50|$|When Brenda returns, Peter {{is alone}} in the house (the {{implication}} being that Caroline has been buried in the garden). Brenda has had a total makeover - hair, clothes, make-up - in order to look beautiful for Peter. He makes it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> loves her exactly the way she was. He tells a fairy story which is interspersed with flashbacks implying that he has killed multiple women. Brenda and Peter go to bed.|$|E
50|$|In October 1844, when {{visiting her}} brother, Clotilde met {{one of his}} Polytechnique's Professors, philosopher Auguste Comte. The first known letter from Comte to Clotilde is dated April 30, 1845 and {{from that day on}} it is <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is in love with her. A love Clotilde, fervent Catholic, firmly rejected. Nonetheless she agreed to follow up with their {{correspondence}} and Comte's passionate love kept growing until Clotilde suddenly died of tuberculosis a year later.|$|E
2500|$|The French Premier Édouard Daladier [...] made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to London <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would much}} {{prefer to see}} the British Mediterranean fleet stay in the Mediterranean rather than it being sent to Singapore, and Britain could expect no support from France in the crisis with Japan. Following an {{unsuccessful}} effort to obtain support from Americans (who told the British that the United States would not risk war with Japan for purely British interests), Chamberlain ordered Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador in Tokyo, to find any way of ending the crisis without too much loss to British prestige. During the course of negotiations with the Japanese, Craigie took advantage of divisions within the Japanese leadership, especially between the Prime Minister, Hiranuma Kiichirō, who wished for {{a greater degree of}} control over the military, and the military itself, which wanted less civilian control.|$|R
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> plan <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 11 December 2008, Matt Harding sarcastically 'revealed' at the Entertainment Gathering that [...] "everyone {{knows how}} easy it is to “fake things” on the internet" [...] the videos were an {{elaborate}} hoax and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is an actor hired by a viral marketing New York ad agency, not a game designer, and the videos were made using animatronic puppets and extensive video editing. His presentation’s pie chart of expenses included one milliondollars for “robot uprising insurance.” Harding’s prankster hoax was lost on many when his talk was posted online, with a larger public perceiving the prank as a confession. A month after his presentation, criticism was so widespread that at the Macworld convention Harding revealed the [...] "hoax about the hoax" [...] and joked about the fact many people took it seriously. He explained he came up with the prankster idea when he himself felt duped by a viral video titled “Bike Hero,” which turned out to be a marketing campaign. He also made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the videos <b>he</b> made were indeed 100% real.|$|R
