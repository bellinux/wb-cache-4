Newer models (the 1.6-100 and 1.7-100) incorporate the 100m rotor from GE's 2.5MW towers, enabling these towers to generate substantially more electrical power from locations with sub-optimal wind. Several optional features support its presence in electrical grids, including voltage regulation, low <b>voltage</b> <b>ride</b> <b>through,</b> and the delivery of reactive power during grid disturbances or periods of low wind.|$|E

There are a number of low <b>voltage</b> <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> techniques including Uninterruptible Power Supplies, the use of capacitors on low voltage DC control circuits, the use of capacitors on the DC bus of Variable Speed Drives.

50|$|The crowbar will {{short-circuit}} {{the rotor}} windings {{through a small}} resistance when excessive currents or voltages are detected. In {{order to be able}} to continue the operation as quickly as possible an active crowbar has to be used. The active crowbar can remove the rotor short in a controlled way and thus the rotor side converter can be started only after 20-60 ms from the start of the grid disturbance when the remaining voltage stays above 15% of the nominal voltage. Thus it is possible to generate reactive current to the grid during the rest of the voltage dip and in this way help the grid to recover from the fault. For zero <b>voltage</b> <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> it is common to wait until the dip ends because with zero voltage it is not possible to know the phase angle where the reactive current should be injected.|$|E

40|$|Large {{and distant}} {{offshore}} wind power plants can be efficiently connected to the onshore power grid network using VSC-HVDC (Voltage Source Converter based HVDC) transmission. Chopper controlled resistors {{can be used to}} limit the DC line over-voltage when there is a fault on the onshore AC grid and power transfer to the grid is obstructed. Considering the development of full scale converter based wind turbine generators (WTG), use of unit rated chopper controlled resistors for each of the full scale AC-DC-AC converter system of the individual turbines has been proposed in place of the one on the HVDC line side. Both the cases have been simulated and their performances are found to be similar.

40|$|Power {{converters}} are {{the basic}} unit for the transient <b>voltage</b> fault <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> capability for most renewable distributed generators (DGs). When a transient fault happens, the grid voltage will drop suddenly and probably will also suffer a phase-jump event as well. State-of-the-art voltage fault control techniques regulate the current injected during the grid fault. However, {{the beginning of the}} fault could be too fast for the inner current control loops of the inverter, and transient over-current would be expected. In order to avoid the excessive peak current of the methods presented in the literature, a new fast peak current control (FPCC) technique is proposed. Controlling the peak current magnitude avoids undesirable disconnection of the distributed generator in a fault state and improves the life expectancy of the converter. Experimental and simulation tests with high power converters provide the detailed behaviour of the method with excellent results...|$|R
50|$|As a summary, a doubly-fed {{induction}} machine is a wound-rotor doubly-fed electric machine and has several advantages over a conventional {{induction machine}} in wind power applications. First, as the rotor circuit {{is controlled by}} a power electronics converter, the induction generator is able to both import and export reactive power. This has important consequences for power system stability and allows the machine to support the grid during severe voltage disturbances (low <b>voltage</b> <b>ride</b> <b>through,</b> LVRT). Second, {{the control of the}} rotor voltages and currents enables the induction machine to remain synchronized with the grid while the wind turbine speed varies. A variable speed wind turbine utilizes the available wind resource more efficiently than a fixed speed wind turbine, especially during light wind conditions. Third, the cost of the converter is low when compared with other variable speed solutions because {{only a fraction of the}} mechanical power, typically 25-30%, is fed to the grid through the converter, the rest being fed to grid directly from the stator. The efficiency of the DFIG is very good for the same reason.|$|E

40|$|In the past, {{distribution}} {{networks were}} designed to be operated as a passive system, i. e. without Dispersed Generation (DG) connected.

In this paper, some tools and control strategies to deliver a high quality of service (with particular reference to voltage quality) are discussed in detail.

40|$|Abstract summary Wind {{farms are}} {{becoming}} more and more important as distributed renewable energy resources, that’s why quality issues (such as flicker emission and <b>voltage</b> sag <b>ride</b> <b>through)</b> are being taken into account by grid codes. Wind farms employing fixed speed induction generators may require the installation of compensation devices (e. g. SVC, STATCOM, DVR, [...] .) to fulfill the network LVRT requirements. Additionally, these devices can contribute to decrease the flicker emission. In this paper, the installation of a STATCOM device in parallel with wind turbines is examined. Different configurations are analyzed through simulation with the aim of determining the STATCOM size and designing its control. Measurement data obtained in a wind park has been used in order to simulate the real working conditions of wind turbines. Objectives The main objective of this work is to analyze the capability of an STATCOM connected to LV side of a fixed speed wind turbine. This device is used to fulfill the grid code requirements related to voltage sag immunity (LVRT) and to reduce flicker emissions. The steps to achieve the above mentioned objectives are: •Modeling. Wind turbine and STATCOM are modeled in PSCAD. The wind turbine simulation results are compared with measurement in a real wind turbine installed in the Sotavento Experimental Wind Farm (www. sotaventogalicia. com). •Simulation. The behavior of STATCOM connected in LV side in a wind turbine is studied. •The result is the STATCOM size and the design of its control to fulfill the grid code requirements.

40|$|In 2005 the {{development}} of a 50 Hz, 15 kVA, 230 V: 115 V high temperature superconductor (HTS), partial core transformer was completed. The transformer was designed purely as a proof of concept, rather than as a unit that would be put into service. The transformer windings were layer wound using Bi 2223 HTS tape from American Superconductors. The transformer failed while testing under full load with the internal primary winding failing to open circuit. This prompted an investigation into the cause of failure. Results from the investigation suggested the cause of failure to be a combination of operating near critical limits and insufficient cooling of the windings. This paper presents the design, construction, and testing of a next generation HTS partial core transformer. The design is based around the original 15 kVA HTS transformer with a new winding insulation system allowing improved cooling of the HTS wire. The windings are layer wound with first generation Bi 2223 high temperature superconductor from Trithor Germany. A series of electrical tests were performed on the transformer including, open circuit, short circuit, resistive load, overload, ac withstand <b>voltage,</b> and fault <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> tests.

In the earlier stage, WTGs were possible to be disconnected from the system to avoid the damage of WTGs.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve low <b>voltage</b> <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> (LVRT) {{capability}} of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). First, this paper gives expressions of the stator flux and rotor current during the grid fault occurrence and clearing by solving the mathematical model of DFIG. The results of simulation conducted on a 1. 5 MW DFIG in the PSCAD/EMTDC verified the correctness of the derivation. Through qualitative analysis of stator flux expression, different fault durations will lead to the difference of transient during fault clearing and ignoring the process of fault clearing will lead to excessive crowbar resistance. Therefore, this paper optimizes the Crowbar resistance by considering both the process of grid fault and fault clearing, and then presents a Crowbar resistance adaptive setting principle based on Crowbar structure with parallel resistor. Simulation confirms this method can improve LVRT of wind farms.
