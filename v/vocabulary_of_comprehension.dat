40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design a guide and {{curriculum}} to assist educators in effectively using Graphic Organizers during systematic instruction <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> <b>comprehension</b> and mathematics. Graphic Organizers are visual learning tools, the use of which can benefit student learning, memory and retention. This project describes how one education specialist discovered her students??? need for additional support during instruction of various subjects. The additional support provided, consisted of modified instruction, using Graphic Organizers. Pre-test and post-test results were gathered after six weeks of implementing the use of Graphic Organizers. The data was collected from sixth grade students with learning disabilities, before and after using Graphic Organizers in instruction.

40|$|The unique {{language}} of mathematics incorporates words, numbers, symbols and diagrams. These elements and their associated mathematical concepts introduce reading and comprehension requirements {{that are not}} experienced in other disciplines. It {{is the responsibility of}} teachers to ensure that students are educated about, and encouraged to apply mathematical language in a variety of contexts. This is essential to the development of mathematical problem solving, where word problems often feature in classroom instruction and assessment, and where mathematical language is expected within student responses. Mathematics teachers need to be mindful that the validity of test items used to assess student mathematical problem solving ability are not influenced by other variables such as vocabulary comprehension difficulty. This study discusses the vocabulary which Year 9 students identify as difficult when undertaking word problem tasks in pen and paper test situations.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to explore the relationship between non-word repetition and different aspects <b>of</b> language <b>comprehension</b> (<b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> words, sentences and fables) in 27 children with LI.

40|$|Background: Figurative {{language}}, such as {{metaphor and}} metonymy, {{is very common}} in daily language use. Its underlying cognitive processes are sometimes viewed as lying at the interface of language and thought. Williams syndrome, which is a rare genetic developmental disorder, provides an opportunity to study this interface because individuals with this disorder have relative strengths in vocabulary and syntax {{against a background of}} low general cognitive ability. Few studies have investigated metaphor comprehension in Williams syndrome and none has investigated metonymy. Aims: This is the first study to investigate metaphor and metonymy comprehension in Williams syndrome and to compare their performance with a group of typically developing children. Methods & Procedures: Ten children with Williams syndrome were compared with eleven typically developing children in a novel metaphor-metonymy comprehension task. Cross-sectional trajectory analyses were used to compare the development of metaphor and metonymy using a child-friendly story picture task. Trajectories were constructed linking task performance either to chronological age or to measures of mental age (receptive vocabulary, visuospatial construction). Outcomes & Results: The performance of children with Williams syndrome was significantly poorer than the typically developing group. The <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> metonyms was in line with receptive <b>vocabulary,</b> but <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> metaphors fell below this level. Conclusions & Implications: Metonyms may be part <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> and treated as synonyms in Williams syndrome, while metaphor engages additional cognitive mechanisms outside language that develop atypically in this disorder.

While most research focuses on how extratextual comments influence knowledge acquisition, we propose that children’s learning may also be supported by the specific features of storybooks.

In this study, 60 5 -year olds were read a storybook that either invoked their knowledge of a familiar taxonomic category (taxonomic storybook) or focused on a common thematic grouping (traditional storybook).

Inferential comprehension, however, did not differ across the two conditions. We argue {{for the importance of}} careful consideration of book features and storybook selection in order to provide children with every opportunity to gain the knowledge foundational for successful literacy development...|$|R
40|$|In past years, the {{arguments}} against literature-based reading instruction by some school-based educators (e. g., teachers and administrators) have always revolved around skill mastery and test scores. The general feeling was that while "real" books were a nice {{addition to the}} curriculum, there was no solid evidence that students could learn the skills of reading {{through the use of}} literature. This is no longer true because numerous studies have found that the use of literature has a positive effect upon students' reading achievement. Based on research, there is ample documentation of reading programs that have successfully used literature to increase vocabulary, improve comprehension, and raise test scores. [...] To determine how literature can be used to improve reading proficiency in terms <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> and <b>comprehension</b> skills, a series of three papers focusing on its use with students at different grade levels follows. The levels include: primary (i. e., grades K to 3), elementary (i. e., grades 4 to 6) and junior/senior high (i. e., grades 7 to 12). Also included is a sampling of recent research along with descriptions of actual classrooms/schools where literature-based programs have been in use...|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} {{of the study was}} the students of eighth grade SMP Muhammadiyah 7 Semarang have the problem to understand their English learning especially in writing. They were lack <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary.</b> Their <b>comprehension</b> can be recognized through their way of writing. The population of the research was the eighth grade students of SMP Muhammadiyah 7 Yogyakarta. The research method was an experimental research, which conducted in two classes; the experimental group (VIII B) and control group (VIII F) as sample. The VIII B was taught by using Think-Talk-Write, while the VIII F was taught with conventional method. The formula that was used to analyze the data was t-test. It was used to determine whether there was significant different between students’ score in experimental and control class or not. After collecting the data, {{it was found that the}} pre-test average score in experimental class was 63. 10 and control class was 60. 75. Meanwhile, the post-test average score of in experimental class was 76. 34 and control class was 71. 58. It was obtained that t-test was 2. 883 and the t-table was 2. 01 for (α) 5...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how research on lexical threshold and lexical coverage relates to L 2 proficiency {{in reading and}} listening comprehension, and how this in turn will impact what types <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary</b> should be taught in advanced ESL and EFL classrooms. The research reviewed contains estimations of how much English vocabulary L 2 users {{need in order to}} do certain things in English, such as reading a novel, watching a movie or understanding everyday conversations. The results indicate that to reach lexical coverage of 98 percent, which is necessary to gain an adequate reading <b>comprehension,</b> a <b>vocabulary</b> size <b>of</b> 8, 000 - 9, 000 word families is needed, whereas around 5, 000 word families may suffice if the expected level <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> is lowered to 95 percent lexical coverage. However, the lexical threshold is ultimately dependent on the expected level <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> The <b>vocabulary</b> size needed to understand spoken English is considerably lower than that needed to understand written English. In order to attain the needed amount <b>of</b> <b>vocabulary,</b> it seems that the traditional vocabulary type teaching, focusing on high-frequency words and the Academic Word List, is no longer sufficient. Rather, more pedagogical focus should be placed on mid-frequency vocabulary, which has previously been overlooked...|$|R
