5|$|In March 2013, {{professional}} beekeepers {{and environmentalists}} jointly {{filed a lawsuit}} against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for continuing to allow the use of neonicotinoids in the United States. The suit specifically asks for suspension of clothianidin and thiamethoxam. The lawsuit follows a dramatic die off of bees in the United States, with some beekeepers losing 50% of their hives. The EPA responded to the suit by issuing a report blaming the <b>Varroa</b> <b>mite</b> for the decline in bees and claiming the role of neonicotinoids in bee extinction has been overstated.|$|E
5|$|According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the British Beekeepers Association {{reported}} the bee {{population in the}} United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no harmonisation {{was used in the}} way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the <b>varroa</b> <b>mite,</b> two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the <b>Varroa</b> <b>mite</b> was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E
25|$|<b>Varroa</b> <b>mites</b> can be {{seen with}} the naked eye as a small red or brown spot on the bee's thorax. <b>Varroa</b> <b>mites</b> are {{carriers}} for many viruses that are damaging to bees. For example, bees infected during their development will often have visibly deformed wings.|$|R
5|$|A British {{beekeeper}} successfully {{developed a}} strain of bees that are resistant to <b>varroa</b> <b>mites.</b> Russian honey bees also resist infestations of <b>varroa</b> <b>mites</b> but are still susceptible to other factors associated with colony collapse disorder, and have detrimental traits that limit their relevance in commercial apiculture.|$|R
50|$|Comb {{trapping}} method (also {{known as the}} swarming method) is based on interrupting the honey bee brood cycle. It is an advanced method that removes capped brood from the hive, where the <b>Varroa</b> <b>mites</b> breed. The queen is confined to a comb using a comb cage. At 9-day intervals, the queen is confined to a new comb, and the brood in the old comb is left to be reared. The brood in the previous comb, now capped and infested with <b>Varroa</b> <b>mites,</b> is removed. The cycle is repeated. This complex method can remove up to 80% of <b>Varroa</b> <b>mites</b> in the hive.|$|R

25|$|The wider {{spread and}} {{intermingling}} in the US {{has resulted in}} far greater losses from <b>Varroa</b> <b>mite</b> infections in recent years, than in countries where beekeepers move bees around less.|$|E
25|$|Varroa destructor, a {{parasitic}} mite, propagates {{within the}} brood cell of bees. The <b>Varroa</b> <b>mite</b> prefers drone brood as it guarantees a longer development period, {{which is important}} for its own propagation success. The number of Varroa mites can be kept in check by removing the capped drone brood and either freezing the brood comb or heating it.|$|E
25|$|Kakugo {{virus is}} an iflavirus infecting bees; <b>varroa</b> <b>mites</b> may mediate its prevalence.|$|R
50|$|Limited {{drone brood}} cell method limits the brood space cell for <b>Varroa</b> <b>mites</b> to inhabit (4.9 mm across — about 0.5 mm smaller than standard), and also enhances the {{difference}} in size between worker and drone brood, {{with the intention of}} making the drone comb traps more effective in trapping <b>Varroa</b> <b>mites.</b> Small cell foundations have staunch advocates, though controlled studies have been generally inconclusive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Varroa</b> <b>mites</b> {{feed off}} the bodily fluids of adult, pupal, and larval honey bees, and may carry viruses that are {{particularly}} {{damaging to the}} bees (e.g., deformed wings, and IAPV), and accordingly they have been implicated in colony collapse disorder. Research has indicated that alone, neither <b>Varroa</b> <b>mites</b> nor deformed wing virus are particularly deadly, yet together they can pose an incredible risk to colonies.|$|R
500|$|In 2009, Tim Lovett, {{president}} of the British Beekeepers' Association, said: [...] "Anecdotally, it is hugely variable. There are reports of some beekeepers losing {{almost a third of}} their hives and others losing none." [...] John Chapple, chairman of the London Beekeepers' Association, put losses among his 150 members at between a fifth and a quarter. [...] "There {{are still a lot of}} mysterious disappearances; we are no nearer to knowing what is causing them." [...] The government's National Bee Unit continued to deny the existence of CCD in Britain; it attributes the heavy losses to the <b>varroa</b> <b>mite</b> and rainy summers that stop bees foraging for food.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{mechanical}} controls generally rely on disruption of {{some aspect of}} the mites' lifecycle. [...] These controls are generally intended not to eliminate all mites, but merely to maintain the infestation at a level which the colony can tolerate. [...] Examples of {{mechanical controls}} include drone brood sacrifice (varroa mites are preferentially attracted to the drone brood), powdered sugar dusting (which encourages cleaning behavior and dislodges some mites), screened bottom boards (so any dislodged mites fall through the bottom and away from the colony), brood interruption and, perhaps, downsizing of the brood cell size. A device called the <b>varroa</b> <b>mite</b> control entrance (VMCE) is under development as of 2008. The VMCE works in conjunction with a screened bottom board, by dislodging varroa mites from bees as they enter and exit a hive.|$|E
2500|$|One other {{possible}} {{hypothesis is that}} the bees are falling victim {{to a combination of}} insecticides and parasites. Feral honey bees are prone to high levels of deformed wing virus (DWV). The <b>varroa</b> <b>mite</b> thrives in honey bee colonies by sucking the hemolymph of honey bees, causing open wounds that are susceptible to varroosis. Higher levels of DWV are more prevalent in colonies that are not being treated for varroosis. Tobacco ring spot virus [...] (TRSV) spreads and negatively affects the health of honey bees indirectly. TRSV has a wide host range. It can be transmitted from infected plant hosts, through parasites such as varroa mites, and ultimately infect insects like the honey bee. [...] In January 2012, a researcher discovered Apocephalus borealis larvae, a parasitic fly known to prey on bumble bees and wasps, in a test tube containing a dead honey bee believed to have been affected by CCD.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Varroa</b> <b>mite</b> {{can only}} {{reproduce}} in a honey bee colony. It {{attaches to the}} body of the bee and weakens the bee by sucking fat bodies. In this process, RNA viruses such as the deformed wing virus (DWV) spread to bees. A significant mite infestation will lead to the death of a honey bee colony, usually in the late autumn through early spring. The <b>Varroa</b> <b>mite</b> is the parasite with the most pronounced economic impact on the beekeeping industry.
