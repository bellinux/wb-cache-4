2500|$|... 750 cc and 500 cc {{versions}} of the Revolution engine are used in Harley-Davidson's Street line of light cruisers. These motors, named the Revolution X, use a single overhead cam, screw and locknut <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment,</b> a single internal counterbalancer, and vertically split crankcases; all of these changes making it different from the original Revolution design.|$|E
2500|$|Mark III, IIIA and IIIB, {{made for}} the Crusader tank, with reduced height to fit the engine bay, by {{redesigning}} the oil pump and relocating the water pump. The air compressor was reinstated to enable pneumatically-operated braking and steering. [...] Significant problems were experienced in desert use (the North African Campaign), and the Mk III went through multiple revisions. [...] This included three different chain drive designs for the ancillary cooling fans, a revised <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism, increased compression ratio, revised oil feeds, and two water pump replacements.|$|E
50|$|A manhole (alternatively utility hole, cable chamber, {{maintenance}} hole, inspection chamber, access chamber, sewer hole, or confined space) {{is the top}} {{opening to}} an underground utility vault used to house an access point for making connections, inspection, <b>valve</b> <b>adjustments</b> or performing maintenance on underground and buried public utility and other services including water, sewers, telephone, electricity, storm drains, district heating and gas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{four-cylinder engine}} {{featured}} double overhead cams, with hydraulic lifters which eliminated <b>valve</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The exhaust was a four-into-two finished in black chrome. The engine layout {{was the same}} as the 650 Nighthawk's, but of a different design sharing no parts. [...] The bike also featured shaft drive, electronic ignition, a digital gear indicator, an automatic cam chain adjuster, a spin-on automobile-style oil filter, and Honda’s second-generation TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control) front end control system. Tire size in both front and rear was 16 inches. Brakes were double disc in front, drum in rear.|$|R
50|$|Since 2011, the flexi-fuel (ethanol) {{version is}} {{available}} in several Western European countries, while the Bi-Fuel (LPG) version, an OEM Landi Renzo, is offered in Eastern Europe, Italy, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. As of January 2013, the Bi-Fuel version is also available in France. The Bi-Fuel (LPG) version {{has proved to be}} very popular in Poland. Since the Duster's K4M engine has hydraulic lifters, the LPG version needs no regular <b>valve</b> <b>adjustments.</b> As of 2014, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg are the only countries in the European Union where the LPG version is not offered by Dacia.|$|R

50|$|The FW 38 hp 1020 cc straight-four SOHC was {{designed}} by Hassan and Mundy as the motive unit for a portable service firepump which was supplied to the government under three contracts totaling over 150,000 units. This engine was revolutionary in its lightness, with a bare weight of 180 pounds, combined with the maintenance-free <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> using shims under an overhead camshaft.|$|E
50|$|The {{camshafts}} and {{injection pump}} {{are driven by}} duplex chain from the crankshaft. A separate single-row chain drives the oil pump. The camshaft operated the valves via hydraulic bucket tappets; <b>valve</b> clearance <b>adjustment</b> is automatic.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Toyota and Volkswagen Group also used a {{directly}} actuated, SOHC parallel valve configuration with two valves for each cylinder. The Toyota system used hydraulic tappets. The Volkswagen system used bucket tappets with shims for <b>valve</b> clearance <b>adjustment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Throttle bodies {{may also}} contain <b>valves</b> and <b>adjustments</b> {{to control the}} minimum airflow during idle. Even in those units that are not [...] "drive-by-wire", there will often be a small solenoid driven valve, the Idle Air Control Valve (IACV), that the ECU uses to control the amount of air that can bypass the main {{throttle}} opening to allow the engine to idle when the throttle is closed.|$|R
50|$|The 3RZ-FE is a 2.7 L (2,693 cc) version. Bore is 95 mm {{and stroke}} is 95 mm. Compression ratio is 9.5 to 1. Output is 150 hp (112 kW) at 4800 RPM with 177 lb·ft (240 N·m) of torque at 4000 RPM. This engine {{features}} twin, chain-driven balance shafts. It has four valves per cylinder and DOHC. <b>Valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> is by shim over bucket.|$|E
50|$|The 2RZ-FE and 4RB1 o 4RB2-engine Chinese is a 2.4 L (2,438 cc) version. Bore is 95 mm {{and stroke}} is 86 mm. Compression ratio is 9.5 to 1. Output is 142 hp (106 kW) at 5000 RPM with 160 lb·ft (217 N·m) of torque at 4000 RPM. This engine does not feature balance shafts. It has four valves per {{cylinder}} and DOHC. <b>Valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> is by shim over bucket.|$|E
50|$|Valve {{clearance}} {{refers to}} the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment,</b> excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, {{this results in a}} loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each 20000 mi with a feeler gauge.|$|E
5000|$|Stoves {{feature a}} neoprene-insulated pot (billycan), {{corrugated}} metal heat exchanger (burner) and burner <b>adjustment</b> <b>valve</b> [...] - [...] with ignition via either an outside source or integral push-button electric igniter, {{depending on the}} model.|$|R
2500|$|The 1976 [...] four-cylinder engine, {{as used in}} the Vega {{got some}} refinements. Named [...] "Dura-built 140", it {{features}} quieter hydraulic lifters eliminating <b>valve</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The basic four develops 70 horsepower, but two-barrel carburetion increases the rating to 84. The 1976 model was the introduction of Chevrolet's new 5.0 liter (305 CID) V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor generating [...] at 3800 rpm, but only for California and high-altitude Monza customers, and replaced the 5.7 liter (350 CID) V8. The 262 V8 was again the optional engine in 49 states. A mid-year option for the 1976 model year was a sport front end available for the Towne Coupe, which features the 2+2's polyurethane front end and quad headlamps. The Monza Spyder option package was first introduced in 1976. It features a two-barrel carburetor version of the four-cylinder engine as standard, a floor console, F41 suspension with larger front and rear stabilizer bars, and special shock absorbers. This equipment had been standard on the original 1975 2+2 (excluding the mid-year [...] "S" [...] model).|$|R
50|$|The bubble counter {{measures}} carbon dioxide. The {{flow rate}} {{of carbon dioxide}} is monitored so that the dissolved gas goes into the solution, with a minimum unconsumed. A needle valve or solenoid valve regulates the CO2 bubble rate. <b>Valves</b> with precise <b>adjustment</b> abilities improve bubble control.|$|R
50|$|The V4 engine {{has proven}} itself highly reliable, with few known faults. The gear-driven {{camshaft}} system removed any lingering concerns about cam-chain maintenance, which had dogged the VF-series of Honda V4 engines. <b>Valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> on first-generation VFR750Fs was by screw and locknut, which changed in 1990 to shim-under-bucket, {{along with the}} valve-clearance inspection interval (to 16,000 miles). However, RC36 engines {{have been known to}} reach well over 50,000 miles without any need to adjust the valve clearances.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the days}} when valve drive {{dynamics}} could be analyzed by computer, desmodromic drive seemed to offer solutions for problems that were worsening with increasing engine speed. Since those days, lift, velocity, acceleration, and jerk curves for cams have been modelled by computer to reveal that cam dynamics are not what they seemed. With proper analysis, problems relating to <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment,</b> hydraulic tappets, push rods, rocker arms, and above all, valve float, became things of the past without desmodromic drive.|$|E
50|$|The drive {{package on}} the Venture Royale {{includes}} a liquid-cooled V-4 engine. It has four valves per cylinder, overhead camshafts with shim over bucket <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The five speed transmission {{is integral with}} the engine case. The engine and transmission share lubricating oil. The drive shaft and final drive assembly are built into {{the left side of}} the double sided swing arm. Swing arm motion is damped by an air preloaded monoshock mounted in the center of the frame. The clutch is of the wet plate design and is hydraulically activated by the left hand lever.|$|E
50|$|The wasserboxer, as {{with all}} Volkswagen boxer engines, {{directly}} drives the three-bearing camshaft via a small steel gear on the crankshaft, and a large aluminium one on the camshaft, {{so there is no}} timing belt or timing chain. The entire mechanism is internal to the engine, so there should be no concerns regarding wear or replacements, as long as the engine oil is changed regularly. The overhead poppet valves each feature two concentric valve springs, and are operated by pushrods, with adjustable rocker arms to facilitate <b>valve</b> clearance <b>adjustment.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} {{visualization}} method for concurrent observation of both velocity and magnitude data obtained from through-plane velocity measurements using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. Magnitude and velocity images were combined using an opacity transfer function (OTF) where the opacity was a function of a velocity range defined by the velocity encoding (venc) parameter. Measured velocities were color-coded according to a predefined color scale and then combined into one image with the gray-scale magnitude image according to the OTF. In the combined images, simultaneous information of velocity and anatomy was presented. The proposed visualization method facilitated the understanding of how the measured blood flow was related to the underlying anatomy. Results are shown where the method is used to visualize blood flow measurements in the ascending aorta and the aortic <b>valve.</b> <b>Adjustments</b> of the OTF render possible identification of the peak velocities and their localization. Forward and backward blood flow is easily shown when applying appropriate OTF and color-coding. An advantage when using the proposed method is the ability of developing standardized protocol settings since the velocity information is quantitative and not relative as is the case for data obtained from the magnitude images. The intended application of the visualization method is the analysis of common flow studies used in the diagnosis of different cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|A {{principle}} of best engine valve timing is proposed {{based on the}} requirements of best engine valve timing. A novel variable valve timing system is designed according to the principle. The construction of the mathematical model {{of the system and}} its dynamic simulation are also presented. The adjust performance of system and the oil pressure are studied in the paper. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can achieve fully variable <b>valve</b> timing <b>adjustment</b> by regulating electromagnetic valve closing time according to the engine speed, and the system satisfies the {{principle of}} best engine valve timing proposed in the paper...|$|R
5000|$|SOHC designs offer reduced {{complexity}} {{compared with}} overhead valve designs — when used for multivalve cylinder heads, {{in which each}} cylinder has more than two valves. An example of an SOHC design using shim and bucket <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> was the engine installed in the Hillman Imp (four cylinder, eight valve); a small, early 1960s two-door saloon car (sedan) with a rear mounted aluminium-alloy engine based on the Coventry Climax FWMA race engines. Exhaust and inlet manifolds were both {{on the same side}} of the engine block (thus not a crossflow cylinder head design). This did, however, offer excellent access to the spark plugs.|$|E
5000|$|Mark III, IIIA and IIIB, {{made for}} the Crusader tank. This reduced {{the height of the}} engine to fit the Crusader engine bay. The air {{compressor}} was reinstated to enable pneumatically operated braking and steering. To reduce the engine height, the oil pump was redesigned and the water pump was relocated. Significant problems were experienced in desert use (the North African Campaign), and Mk III went through multiple revisions. This included three different chain drive designs for the engine's ancillary cooling fans, a revised <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism, increased compression ratio, revised oil feeds, and two water pump replacements.|$|E
50|$|The engine's {{downfall}} was premature camshaft wear in {{some early}} models {{in both the}} V45 and V65. In retrospect, the wear was caused by inadequate oil flow to the heads/cams, driving {{for a long time}} on low engine speeds (under 3,000 rpm) and at cold start /engine warm-up procedure, non-accurate <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and insufficient maintenance. But this came too late to save the engine's reputation. Honda itself at first denied there was a problem, then blamed inadequate or incorrect maintenance for the problem. They changed the maintenance interval, and developed and sold a special tool for 'proper' valve-lash adjustment. They eventually made changes to the design and production methods of the engine which eliminated the problem.|$|E
50|$|Some engine {{variants}} have an intercooler {{in addition}} to the turbocharger, they can be identified by the tds. The M51 is an engine made of cast iron, it has one chain driven overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder. Compared to the M21 the M51 has now tappets and a hydraulic <b>valve</b> lash <b>adjustment.</b> The fuel injection in the first engines is controlled by the ECU Bosch DDE 2.1, which was replaced after the first technical revision by the DDE 2.2. This results in greater torque at lower revs. For lubrication SAE 5W-40 oil is used.|$|R
50|$|The 603.96 engine has a {{capacity}} of 2996cc and was an engineering marvel in pre-chamber design and a technological leap forward from the earlier 5 cylinder OM617. It produced 143 hp at 4600 rpm (euro market without catalytic converter produced 148hp) and 195 ft.lb at 2400 rpm with a compression ratio of 22.0:1. Versions 603.96x and 603.97x are turbocharged. Only turbocharged models of the 603 series were available to the U.S. market. The single camshaft and injection pump are driven by duplex chain from the crankshaft. A separate single row chain drives the oil pump. The camshaft operated the valves via hydraulic bucket tappets; <b>valve</b> clearance <b>adjustment</b> is automatic.|$|R
30|$|The Stark {{decelerator}} {{is loaded}} with a molecular beam that is produced in a relatively large source chamber, that is pumped by a 1200 l/s turbo pump. The molecular beams formed are thus not limited by interactions with the vacuum chambers walls, or by limited pumping capacity. A 3 mm diameter commercially available skimmer (Beam Dynamics, model 2) is positioned between the source chamber and the Stark decelerator. A unique feature of our apparatus is that this skimmer is mounted on a movable gate valve [34], such that the source chamber can be vented {{without the need for}} breaking the vacuum in the remainder of the apparatus. This ensures the fast exchange of <b>valves</b> or <b>adjustment</b> of valve-to-skimmer distance.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{recommended}} daily checks of the lights, horn, tire pressure, brakes, fuel and oil level, and a weekly {{check of the}} battery electrolyte level. The new engine break in maintenance was done at 200 mi, requiring adjustment of the valve tappets and contact breaker points, and an oil change, and the rider was advised to stay under 30 mph for the first 500 mi. Every 1000 mi the spark plug needed cleaning, and the chain adjustment checked, and every 2000 mi an oil change, breaker point check, and <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> was due. At 5000 mi, major maintenance was due, requiring the removal and cleaning of the carburetor, drive chain, exhaust silencer, and wheel bearings. The rider closed a manual choke to aid in starting at cold temperatures. By {{the standards of the}} day, this was a simple motorcycle, with minimal maintenance demands, and it earned a reputation for high reliability.|$|E
5000|$|Just before Christmas 1930 Sir William Morris Bt. {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} he would put on the market very soon a new car to sell at £100 and it would be known as the Morris Minor S.V. two-seater. The body, he said, is to be coach built—steel panels on a wood frame—has as few bright parts as possible [...] "to reduce polishing" [...] and is finished in naval grey with red upholstery. Decarbonisation and <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> were very simple and contributed to the new car's low running costs. Within a few months 2-door saloon models with the S.V. type engine were also in production. A 4-seater S.V. tourer was announced in April.The overhead valve engine was proving to be expensive to make and Wolseley's design—the six-cylinder version powered their successful Hornet saloon, and racing MGs—suffered from oil getting into the dynamo. So in 1931 a version with valve gear re-designed by staff of Morris Engines using side-valves and giving nearly the same power output, [...] at 4000 rpm, was introduced.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of socket wrenches: impact sockets and hand sockets. Common sockets are colloquially {{referred}} to by {{counting the number of}} [...] "points" [...] (pointed corners of walls) present {{in the shape of the}} socket nut opening. For example, the hexagon shape is commonly called a [...] "6 point" [...] socket because the hexagon forms 6 [...] "points" [...] where walls intersect to create six sharp pointed corners. This system of description using [...] "points" [...] generally works well in avoiding confusion, with the exception of [...] "8-point" [...] and [...] "12-point" [...] where two very incompatible shapes exist with both having 8 [...] "points" [...] and 12 [...] "points". The vast majority of larger common nut and bolt heads are produced with the 6-point hexagonal gripping shape. Less frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, <b>valve</b> <b>adjustment</b> screws and pipe plugs the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. Nuts and bolt heads are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines more common to aircraft and aerospace applications. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.|$|E
50|$|Harry Mundy {{designed}} the Lotus TwinCam engine for Colin Chapman, who needed the {{replacement for the}} Coventry Climax FWE engine used in Lotus Elite. As Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, the co-founders of Cosworth, used to be Lotus Development Ltd employees, the initial racing adaptation of Lotus TwinCam {{was carried out by}} Cosworth, and the Kent block Cosworth SCA was designed using the basic SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head configuration of the FWE. Due to Mundy being also the co-designer of the FWE, the Kent block Lotus TwinCam initially used the cam profile of the FWE, and shared the same <b>valve</b> clearance <b>adjustment</b> shims with Coventry Climax FWA, FWB, and FWE in production.|$|R
40|$|Motor fuel is a {{piston engine}} {{generator}} that converts heat energy into mechanical {{energy to the}} crankshaft. Motor fuel in the piston there is a mechanism that functions as a regulator valve opening and closing of valves, valve gap affects {{the performance of the}} internal combustion engine piston.

5000|$|The 1100 had a four-speed {{manual gearbox}} and room for five people. There {{was also a}} three-speed {{semi-automatic}} gearbox that required manual shifting but used an electronically activated clutch. The 1100s transmission configuration {{was the same as}} the one introduced by Fiat on the 1964 Autobianchi Primula, in that it was transverse and axial with the engine giving the [...] "engine on one side, transmission on the other" [...] layout copied on almost all [...] "hatchbacks" [...] and front wheel drive vehicles throughout the world ever since. In France, the 1100 was very successful, achieving best-seller status, but it was less competitive in non-European export markets. In the UK, while recognised as an innovative and capable car, its poor record of body corrosion and top end engine wear counted against it. The engine needed frequent <b>valve</b> clearance <b>adjustment.</b>|$|R
