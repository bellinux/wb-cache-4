5|$|In the {{remaining}} case, each clause is either guaranteed to become true {{no matter how}} {{the remaining}} variables are assigned, or neither of its two variables has been assigned yet. In this case the algorithm creates a new choice point and sets any one of the unassigned <b>variables</b> <b>to</b> an arbitrarily chosen value.|$|E
5|$|Perl {{also takes}} {{features}} from shell programming. All variables are marked with leading sigils, which allow <b>variables</b> <b>to</b> be interpolated directly into strings. However, unlike the shell, Perl uses sigils on all accesses to variables, and unlike most other programming languages that use sigils, the sigil doesn't denote {{the type of}} the variable but the type of the expression. So for example, to access a list of values in a hash, the sigil for an array ("@") is used, not the sigil for a hash ("%").|$|E

5000|$|The {{results of}} look ahead {{is used to}} decide the next <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> {{evaluate}} and the order of values to give <b>to</b> this <b>variable.</b> In particular, for any unassigned variable and value, look-ahead estimates the effects of setting that <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> that value.|$|R
50|$|In {{backtracking}} algorithms, {{look ahead}} is the generic {{term for a}} subprocedure that attempts to foresee the effects of choosing a branching <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> evaluate one of its values. The two main aims of look-ahead are <b>to</b> choose a <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> evaluate next and the order of values to assign to it.|$|R
5|$|The 2-satisfiability {{problem is}} to find a truth {{assignment}} to these variables that makes the whole formula true. Such an assignment chooses whether to make each of the variables true or false, so that at least one literal to true in every clause becomes true. For the expression shown above, one possible satisfying assignment is the one that sets all seven of the <b>variables</b> <b>to</b> true. Every clause has at least one non-negated variable, so this assignment satisfies every clause. There are also 15 other ways of setting all the variables so that the formula becomes true. Therefore, the 2-satisfiability instance represented by this expression is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The <b>variable(s)</b> <b>to</b> be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, President Mutharika {{split with}} the United Democratic Front and began his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which has {{attracted}} reform-minded officials from other parties and won elections {{across the country}} in 2006. In 2008, President Mutharika had implemented reforms to address the country's major corruption problem, with at least five senior UDF party members facing criminal charges. In 2012, Malawi was ranked 7th of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, an index that measures several <b>variables</b> <b>to</b> provide a comprehensive view of the governance of African countries. Although the country's governance score was higher than the continental average, it was lower than the regional average for southern Africa. Its highest scores were for safety and rule of law, and its lowest scores were for sustainable economic opportunity, with a ranking of 47th on the continent for educational opportunities. Malawi's governance score had improved between 2000 and 2011. Malawi held its most recent elections in May 2014, with challenger Arthur Peter Mutharika defeating incumbent President Joyce Banda.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a new approach for modelling the behavior of pedestrians which borrows techniques from the kinetic theory of rarefied gazes. This approach is based on concepts from the kinetic theory for ‘active particles’. In our modelling of crowd movements, pedestrians are regarded as entities whose microscopic states include a geometric <b>variable</b> (<b>to</b> denote position), a mechanical <b>variable</b> (<b>to</b> denote speed), and a <b>variable</b> <b>to</b> describe the rate of development of individual strategies that influence the collective dynamics. Indeed, the third <b>variable</b> is introduced <b>to</b> account for the ability of individuals to modify their dynamics according to specific objectives and strategies. The equations eventually obtained are a set of nonlinear integro-differential equations of Vlasov or Boltzmann type...|$|R
5|$|Later {{research}} {{has managed to}} create convincing models of patterns as diverse as zebra stripes, giraffe blotches, jaguar spots (medium-dark patches surrounded by dark broken rings) and ladybird shell patterns (different geometrical layouts of spots and stripes, see illustrations). Richard Prum's activation-inhibition models, developed from Turing's work, use six <b>variables</b> <b>to</b> account for the observed range of nine basic within-feather pigmentation patterns, from the simplest, a central pigment patch, via concentric patches, bars, chevrons, eye spot, pair of central spots, rows of paired spots {{and an array of}} dots. More elaborate models simulate complex feather patterns in the guineafowl Numida meleagris in which the individual feathers feature transitions from bars at the base to an array of dots at the far (distal) end. These require an oscillation created by two inhibiting signals, with interactions in both space and time.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} {{demonstrates the}} effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails {{to account for the}} fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels et al. use a neoclassical growth model to show that women's education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men's education. In both of these cases, economists highlight and address the gender biases of macroeconomic <b>variables</b> <b>to</b> show that gender plays a significant role in models' outcomes.|$|E
