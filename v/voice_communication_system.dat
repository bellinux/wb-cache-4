This method utilizes {{the principles of}} the digital stream cipher, generating instead a continuous pseudorandom analog key stream signal which is transformed with the original analog signal to create an encrypted ciphertext signal which is statistically independent of the original signal and the key stream signal. The transform is then inverted with the ciphertext signal and the same key stream signal to recover the original signal.

40|$|Voice {{activity}} detection (VAD) {{is a vital}} {{process in}} <b>voice</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> to avoid unnecessary coding and transmission of noise. Most of the existing VAD algorithms continue to suffer high false alarm rates and low sensitivity when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, at 0 dB and below.
