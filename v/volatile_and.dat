5|$|Germane (GeH4) is a {{compound}} similar in structure to methane. Polygermanes—compounds {{that are similar}} to alkanes—with formula GenH2n+2 containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH4 reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH3 which contain the GeH3− anion. The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E

5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{produces}} an apocrine secretion on scent glands near their elbow (brachial glands). This clear liquid, when mixed with its saliva, creates a volatile, noxious toxin. When startled, the slow loris licks its brachial glands and applies the secretion to its heads. The oily secretion contains a complex mixture of <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> semi-volatile components; one chemical analysis indicated over 200 components were present. One {{of the components}} {{is a member of}} the secretoglobin family of proteins, and similar to an allergenic protein found in cat dander.

Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), while the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{the first}} comet where the noble gas argon was detected. Noble gases are {{chemically}} inert and highly <b>volatile,</b> <b>and</b> since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, {{they can be used}} for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40K, but has at some point been warmer than 20K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} bioassay {{methods to}} investigate the orientation behaviour of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), to host plant <b>volatiles</b> <b>and</b> a synthetic pheromone (cosmolure+) were compared. A locomotion compensator was used to separately record walking tracks in response to three odour sources. The data show that C. sordidus uses odour-conditioned anemotaxis in its orientation to the odour sources tested. Of the two olfactometers tested, a dual port olfactometer using a continuous airflow showed stronger discrimination by C. sordidus to the different odours compared with a double pitfall olfactometer. The results of all three bioassays indicate that C. sordidus responds in an additive way to the combination of fermentation plant <b>volatiles</b> <b>and</b> the synthetic pheromone...|$|R
40|$|We {{create the}} first {{quantitative}} {{model for the}} early lunar atmosphere, coupled with a magma ocean crystallization model. Immediately after formation, the moon's surface was subject to a radiative environment that included contributions from the early Sun, a post-impact Earth that radiated like a mid-type M dwarf star, and a cooling global magma ocean. This radiative environment resulted in a largely Earth-side atmosphere on the Moon, ranging from ∼ 10 ^ 4 to ∼ 10 ^ 2 pascals, composed of heavy <b>volatiles</b> (Na <b>and</b> SiO). This atmosphere persisted through lid formation and was additionally characterized by supersonic winds that transported significant quantities of moderate <b>volatiles</b> <b>and</b> likely generated magma ocean waves. The existence of this atmosphere may have influenced the distribution of some moderate <b>volatiles</b> <b>and</b> created temperature asymmetries which influenced ocean flow and cooling. Such asymmetries may characterize young, tidally locked rocky bodies with global magma oceans and subject to intense irradiation. Comment: In press at EPS...|$|R

5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very <b>volatile</b> <b>and</b> thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E

40|$|Irradiated samples {{had higher}} thiobarbituric acid {{reactive}} substances (TBARS) than nonirradiated at day 0 {{but the difference}} disappeared during storage in both packaging types. Storage increased the production of <b>volatiles</b> <b>and</b> changed the composition of volatiles only in aerobic-packaged sausage. Irradiation and the fatty acid composition had significant effects on lipid oxidation, <b>volatile</b> production, <b>and</b> sensory characteristics of cooked pork sausages during storage but that oxygen availability had a stronger effect than irradiation and fatty acid composition. Storage increased the production of <b>volatiles</b> <b>and</b> changed the composition of volatiles only in aerobicpackaged sausage. Among the volatile components, 1 -heptene and 1 -nonene were influenced most by irradiation dose, and aldehydes by packaging type. The TBARS values <b>and</b> <b>volatiles</b> of vacuum-packaged irradiated cooked sausage had very low correlation. The TBARS, however, had very high correlation {{with the amount of}} aldehydes <b>and</b> total <b>volatiles,</b> <b>and</b> ketones and alcohols with long retention times in aerobic-packaged pork sausage. The low correlations of irradiation-dependent volatiles (e. g., 1 -heptene and 1 -nonene) with TBARS values regardless of packaging and storage conditions indicated that volatile compounds responsible for irradiation odor were different from those of lipid oxidation odor in cooked pork sausages. Irradiation of cooked pork sausage, especially at 4. 5 kGy and in aerobic packaging, may result in some diminution of typical meaty aromas and increases in an odor described by the panelists in this study as like wet wool or wet animal hair. The training and controlled test situation used in this study may result in greater discrimination in the panel than would exist in most consumers. Whether the changes caused by irradiation would be noticed by consumers or reduce the acceptability of the product to consumers was not addressed in this study. The data obtained suggest that TBARS values may not be useful in predicting the odor changes in cooked irradiated meat products...|$|R
