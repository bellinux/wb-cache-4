5|$|Adler {{wrote in}} his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{depressing}} sections of Chicago is the Uptown area on the North Side. Shabby apartment buildings, vacant stores, wino bars, littered vacant lots, junkies, muggers, and career down-and-outers. It also has a new alderman, Helen Shiller, {{and she has a}} <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> that seedy old neighborhood should be in the future. And apparently her vision is that Uptown should remain a seedy old neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{video game}} adaptations of the Alien franchise, Alien: Isolation places {{a strong emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid and outsmart a single alien creature {{over the course of the}} game with the help of gadgets like a motion tracker and a flamethrower. It was designed more in line with Scott's film as opposed to James Cameron's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the future would look like. The game runs on an entirely new engine that was built from scratch to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects as well as the alien's behavioural design. Creative Assembly originally intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but the perspective was later changed to first-person in order to create a more intense experience.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) {{was founded}} as a {{registered}} charity in 1909 by an Edinburgh lawyer, Thomas Hailing Gillespie. The Corstorphine Hill site {{was purchased by}} the Society {{with help from the}} Edinburgh Town Council in early 1913. Gillespie's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a zoological park should be was modelled after the 'open design' of Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, a zoo which promoted a more spacious and natural environment for the animals, and stood {{in stark contrast to the}} steel cages typical of the menageries built during the Victorian era. The Scottish National Zoological Park was opened to the public in 1913 and was incorporated by Royal Charter later that year. In 1948, following a visit by His Majesty King George VI, the Society was granted the privilege of adding the prefix 'Royal' to its name. It remains the only zoo with a Royal Charter in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn's {{hardware}} {{was new to}} the team, and it {{was their}} first attempt at creating an original environment. It was also Futatsugi's first year working as a full developer at Sega, so he was only able to do simple things while having a clear <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he wanted, which helped him to keep the overall style pure, with stark and minimalist cutscenes. Similarly, Iwade kept the enemies easy to understand visually, with simple shapes, and this overall simple style ended up fitting well with the Saturn's hardware. Then, Team Andromeda set to work on elaborating an extensive back story, and Futatsugi, to be original and to avoid using Japanese or English, {{went so far as}} to create a new language for the game: a mix of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. This was apparently inspired by the anime The Wings of Honneamise, of which team members were fans and which also features an invented language.|$|E

25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must articulate a clear <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E

However, Nera succeeds, and the dead man then asks for a drink. Nera carries him {{on his back and}} they stop at three houses. They enter the third, where the dead man drinks and spits it on the householders, killing them. Returning, Nera sees a fairy host burning the king's hall and slaughtering those inside. He follows the host through a portal into the Otherworld. Nera learns that what he saw was only a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> will happen the next Samhain unless something is done.

25|$|Advances {{in science}} and {{technology}} brought on by World War II, and continued Canadian industrialization, previously interrupted by the Great Depression, created a demand for a more highly trained population. Howard Hillen Kerr was given control of nine Ontario Training and Re-establishment centres to accomplish this. His <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> these institutions would do was broader than what others were suggesting. In 1943, he visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and was convinced Canada could develop its own MIT over one hundred years. Along the way, such an institution could respond to the society's needs. When the Province approved the idea of technical institutes in 1946, it proposed to found several. It turned out all but one would be special purpose schools, such as the mining school. Only the Toronto retraining centre, which became the Ryerson Institute of Technology in 1948, would become a multi-program campus, Kerr’s future MIT of Canada. This vision is reflected in Ryerson's Motto and its mission statement.|$|E
25|$|The White Lady, {{without making}} a sound, {{advances}} along the terrace. Raymonda follows her {{in a state of}} unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E

It has striking remarkable differences in comparison to other Brazilian dialects in phonology, prosody and grammar, often stigmatized as being strongly associated with a substandard variant, now mostly rural.|$|E
25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at a crumpled piece of paper in the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still unsure of what it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E
