40|$|Global Positioning Systems (GPS) provide law {{enforcement}} {{with a powerful}} tool to covertly investigate criminal networks. These networks, however, are often themselves technologically sophisticatedand thus able to elude police surveillance. GPS monitoring has drawn substantial criticism recently as police, in many jurisdictions, may utilize the technology without a search warrant; the issue has boiled down to whether the Fourth Amendment requires a search warrant in the first place. This Comment argues that the Supreme Court should establish a new rule, “Reasonable Suspicion Plus,” that would require police to state in a sworn declaration particularized reasoning for use of a GPS device, but that would not require them to obtain a search warrant. The benefits of the proposed rule would be threefold: (1) temporal and spatial limitations would assure that GPS technology is utilized responsibly; (2) the declaration {{would serve as a}} procedural obstacle requiring police to show good cause for using the device; and (3) when the declaration is registered with the district attorney’s office it would provide a tangible record, facilitating judicial review if a defendant later contests the legitimacy of the operation. Part I examines the concept of “a reasonable expectation of privacy” in the context of how the police use new technologies to monitor suspects’ movements. Part II dissects the shortcomings of those decisions but also points to <b>valid</b> <b>considerations</b> and concerns that arose in those cases. Part III proposes a model rule that can serve as a guidepost for appropriate use of GPS surveillance: “Reasonable Suspicion Plus. ” There are valid concerns {{on both sides of the}} argument, and the rule that this Comment proposes would address those concerns, while maintaining constitutionality and deference to Supreme Court precedent...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years the {{construction}} industry has developed a myriad of alternative procurement routes to offer its clients. As a result of this vast quantity of options it has become imperative that construction industry clients utilise a set of well defined criteria or parameters to assess the merits of the various procurement routes available. The interior fitout sector is characterised by its tight time frames, challenging work environments where construction operatives often have to work around fully functioning offices, tight budgets, the prevalence of third parties in the form of building managers and tight budgets. Relatively little prior research has been conducted into the specific procurement selection criteria of Auckland interior fitout clients. This study’s objectives are to evaluate how influential pre defined procurement selection criteria or parameters are on the procurement decisions of Auckland interior fitout clients. The results obtained from this study will then be partially compared to the results of a similar study conducted in Australia (Thanh Luu, Thomas, & Chen, 2003). A semi structured interview incorporating a questionnaire facilitated the collection of specific data addressing backgrounds of respondents, current procurement selection practices, influence of 34 procurement selection parameters in terms of procurement decision making and open ended questions around overall impressions of construction procurement. The results show that cost related criteria and time related criteria are by far the most influential parameters in terms of procurement decision making. The findings of this study support the findings of numerous previous studies that time and cost are the primary initial indicators of project success of failure and therefore most prevalent in procurement decision making. Furthermore results from this study suggest that interior fitout clients utilise consultant advice to determine a procurement path. Responses to open ended questions indicate contradictory thinking amongst research participants as the same clients who overwhelmingly rated time and cost as the most critical procurement selection criteria feel that too much emphasis is placed on cost factors {{at the expense of other}} <b>valid</b> <b>considerations.</b> Future study could focus on how factors other than time and cost could be incorporated into procurement decision making...|$|R

Validation protocols that allow for independent evaluation of blood pressure measuring devices are available, {{and some of the}} devices on the market have been evaluated according to these protocols. The results of such evaluations have been published periodically in medical journals. However, such surveys are not readily available to the public and to health care authorities with responsibility for purchasing blood pressure measuring equipment for use in clinical medicine, and because of the necessarily lengthy publication process they are no longer up-to-date at the time of publication. Moreover, the results of published validation studies are often flawed because of protocol violations and the conclusions may not be <b>valid.</b> These <b>considerations</b> have been the stimulus for the establishment of an independent non-profit website, which will provide quarterly updates on the accuracy and performance of blood pressure measuring devices on the market as well as an expert assessment of the validation procedures on which recom-mendations are based.

While that study looked at the inner workings of Thai society from the “top-down,” this report will examine the hierarchy from the position of one lowest on the social ladder – the Thai student – and attempt to determine what factors influence them to resort to dishonesty as a means of achieving a higher status.|$|R
