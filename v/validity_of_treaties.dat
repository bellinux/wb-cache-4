Modern historians disagree as to what point in history Greenland went from being a Norwegian possession to being a Danish one. However, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Kiel, signed in 1814, indicates that Greenland was at least politically regarded as having been Norwegian: [...] "...the Kingdom of Norway ... as well as the dependencies (Greenland, the Faroes and Iceland not included) ... shall for the future belong to ...

2500|$|As the Sino-British {{negotiation}} for the Hong Kong sovereignty after 1997 {{began in}} the early 1980s, the business elites sought the way {{to maintain the status quo}} of Hong Kong.

The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treaty</b> negotiations were challenged with claims that the U.S. president, and thus the U.S. government, had not authorized them. The negotiations also involved what some historians have described as bribes, which included offering large subsidies to the tribes and their chiefs, and liberal distribution of liquor before the negotiations began.|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{agreement}} was delayed due to objections from some Iranian diplomats who viewed the Lesser Ararat area as strategically important and who also questioned the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Kars. [...] These diplomats felt that Turkey {{did not have a}} legitimate claim to the territory of Surmali, which had been part of Iran before it was ceded to Imperial Russia in the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Turkmenchay. In addition, because the wording <b>of</b> the Turkmenchay <b>Treaty</b> was vague, they advocated annexing parts of the area. After a constructive meeting with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in Ankara in 1934, Reza Shah, who initially favored annexing the Aras corridor, finally ordered his diplomats to drop any objections and accept the new border agreements.|$|R
25|$|The German {{people saw}} reparations as a {{national}} humiliation; the German Government worked to undermine the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Versailles and the requirement to pay. British economist John Maynard Keynes called the treaty a Carthaginian peace that would economically destroy Germany. His arguments {{had a profound effect}} on historians, politicians, and the public at large. Despite Keynes' arguments and those by later historians supporting or reinforcing Keynes' views, the consensus of contemporary historians is that reparations were not as intolerable as the Germans or Keynes had suggested and were within Germany's capacity to pay had there been the political will to do so.|$|R

The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> this <b>treaty</b> is still contested by some Rapanui.

5000|$|After the Brazilian {{invasion}} and bombing of Paysandú (December 1864 - January 1865) Paraguay declares War on Brasil because <b>of</b> the <b>Treaty</b> both Brasil and Paraguay signed for [...] "defending the Uruguayan independence" [...] (though the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> that <b>treaty</b> is still controversial) [...] and {{for protecting the}} allied Blanco Government. After a victorious but later abandoned campaign in Matto Grosso, the troops of Paraguayan president, Field Marshal Francisco Solano López are intending to reach Uruguay through Entre Rios. While Mitre was secretly giving military support to the coup in Uruguay and allowing the Brazilian Navy and Troops the pass through argentinian territory, he denied access to the Paraguayan Army. That led to the declaration of War from Paraguay to Argentina and the later Campaign of Corrientes.|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} 1700s, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Tordesillas was deemed all but {{redundant}} {{and it was}} clear to both parties that a newer one had to be drawn based on realistic and feasible boundaries. In 1750, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Madrid separated the Portuguese and Spanish areas of South America in lines that are mostly consisted to present-day boundaries. Neither Portugal nor Spain were satisfied with the results, and new treaties were signed in the following decades that either established new territorial lines or repealed them. The final accord signed by both powers, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Badajoz (1801), reaffirmed the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the previous <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> San Ildefonso (1777), which had derived from the older <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Madrid.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Kars is overtly {{rejected}} by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. The ARF specifically condemns the treaty as a [...] "gross violation of international law" [...] and argues that, because the three Transcaucasian republics were {{under the control of}} Moscow in 1921, their independent consent was questionable. [...] The ARF also questions the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treaty</b> based on the authorities of the sides that concluded it. They contend that the Grand National Assembly of Turkey had no legal authority to sign international treaties. [...] In addition, they argue that because the USSR was not founded until 1922, and therefore not a recognized state, it was also [...] "not a subject of international law and, naturally, its government had no authority to enter into international treaties." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the post-Soviet governments of Russia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan accepted the <b>Treaty</b> <b>of</b> Kars. Armenia's position is different, due to the absence of diplomatic relations between Turkey and Armenia. In December 2006, Yerevan's then-Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian said that Armenia accepts the Kars treaty as the legal successor to the Armenian SSR, but noted that Turkey was not adhering to the terms <b>of</b> the <b>treaty.</b> [...] Specifically, Article XVII <b>of</b> the <b>treaty</b> called for the [...] "free transit of persons and commodities without any hindrance" [...] among the signatories and that the parties would take [...] "all the measures necessary to maintain and develop as quickly as possible railway, telegraphic, and other communications." [...] However, due to tension between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkey closed its land border with Armenia and severed diplomatic ties with it, thus violating this article. Oskanian stated that by this action, Turkey was putting the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treaty</b> into doubt.|$|R
2500|$|After {{her visit}} with Deng in Beijing, Thatcher was {{received}} in Hong Kong {{as the first}} British Prime Minister to {{set foot on the}} territory whilst in office.

At the moment, we stick by our treaties.".|$|R
40|$|Poland has {{concluded}} double taxation treaties with Bangladesh, Jordan and Island. These treaties, however, were ratified {{without the consent}} o f Parliament. The question raised in the paper is whether such consent to be bound by the treaties as expressed in the ratification instruments is valid under international law. The author argues that i f the rules of international law are to be followed, the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the said <b>treaties</b> cannot be challenged. The author then discusses the state practice, judicial decisions and the doctrine of international law. In order to prove the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the double taxation treaties in question, the Vienna Convention on the Law <b>of</b> <b>Treaties,</b> and the provisions included in Article 46 and 45 concerning the invalidity <b>of</b> <b>treaties</b> in particular, are quoted. It is argued that the violation of a provision of national law regarding competence to conclude treaties cannot be invoked and that Poland has lost the right to invoke Article 46 of the VCLT that could constitute the ground for invalidating the treaties concluded with Bangladesh, Island and Jordan without its Parliament’s consent...|$|R
50|$|In 1537 {{the duke}} Frederick II of Legnica {{concluded}} a treaty with Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, whereby the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg would inherit the duchy upon {{the extinction of}} the Silesian Piasts. On the death of George William the last duke in 1675, however, Austria refused to acknowledge the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treaty</b> and annexed the duchies and Frederick the Great of the Kingdom of Prussia used this treaty to justify his claim at the invasion of Silesia during the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740. Brieg and most of Silesia were annexed by Prussia in 1741 during the First Silesian War. In 1807 the town's fortifications were pulled down by Napoleon's army. The Prussian Province of Silesia, and thus Brieg, consequently {{became part of the}} German Empire when it was proclaimed in 1871 on the unification of Germany.|$|R
