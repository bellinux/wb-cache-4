5|$|Corgi International Limited made 5-inch {{action figures}} and gadgets (such as a <b>voice-activated</b> briefcase), {{as well as}} its {{traditional}} die-cast toy vehicles. It also created 7-inch figures of characters from the previous films. Scalextric released four racing sets to coincide with the film. Activision released its first James Bond game, also titled Quantum of Solace, which is based on both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.|$|E

50|$|A {{malfunctioning}} skutter runs amok and rewires Red Dwarfs circuitry, producing {{two thousand}} wiring faults {{and making the}} whole ship a booby trap. When Dave Lister orders a milk shake and a Toffee Crisp {{from one of the}} snack machines, he inadvertently triggers the ship's self-destruct countdown. As the auto-destruct can only be over-ridden by a senior officer, all of whom are dead, Kryten performs a mind-swap: the mind of Executive Officer Carol Brown is temporarily placed into Lister's body so she can <b>voice-activate</b> the shut-down procedure; but the plan fails and the auto-destruct sequence continues. Everyone braces for death as the countdown reaches zero - whereupon the food machine dispenses Lister's milk shake and candy bar. It turns out the countdown was wired only to the vending machine, not to the ship's bomb â€” besides which Holly got rid of the bomb ages ago and never bothered to tell anyone.|$|R
5000|$|Seven, {{escaping}} from a holding cell, beams down to New York City. Kirk and Spock, camouflaged in period local attire, follow him. Seven enters {{an office and}} <b>voice-activates</b> a computer which reports that Agents [...] "201" [...] and [...] "347" [...] have not been heard from in three days. With only an hour until the launch, Seven decides to complete their mission. A young woman arrives, and Seven mistakes her for Agent 201, so he asks her to dictate a report to an electric typewriter equipped with speech recognition. When she panics and suddenly attempts to leave, Seven jams the doorknob and asks the Beta Five computer to identify her; she is Roberta Lincoln (Teri Garr, credited as Terri Garr), a secretary employed by the missing agents. Seven, realizing his blunder, appeals to her patriotism and tells Roberta he is a secret government agent and that she should remain quiet about what she has seen. She soon realizes that something very odd is happening. The computer then informs Seven that Agents 201 and 347 have {{died in a car}} accident.|$|R

25|$|Butterfield also oversaw {{installation}} of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman's assistant, Larry Higby, told Butterfield that president Nixon wanted a <b>voice-activated</b> audio taping system installed in the Oval Office and on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, {{was to create a}} more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon's desk, two in lamps on the mantel over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and the Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Higby, the three or four Secret Service technical staffers who installed it, and him. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building.|$|E
500|$|The on-set {{animations}} were programmed {{and performed}} live during the shoot. Romanek wanted the song's stem [...] "split out" [...] {{and to have}} the drums, bass, guitar, and vocals on separate tracks, which were then animated, and the lights were synthesised to each of the tracks. In the end, Romanek and Michael Keeling, the lighting designer, opted to use Chris Martin's vocal track to animate [...] "because it had such dynamics. Roughly 75% of the video is driven by <b>voice-activated</b> animation", said Keeling.|$|E
500|$|Johnson, alive but injured, is {{spying on}} his own home, {{watching}} Briggs visit Shelly. Shelly is terrified that Johnson will return and kill her; but Briggs reassures her he {{will take care of}} things. Johnson is also listening to a police radio in his truck, and hears that Renault's myna bird is being considered a witness as its ability to mimic speech might provide a clue; he drives off immediately. That night, he shoots the bird dead through the sheriff station's window. However, a <b>voice-activated</b> tape recorder had been left by the bird's cage; Cooper is able to find the words [...] "Leo, no!" [...] among the phrases it had repeated that evening.|$|E
500|$|Though Mya's {{character}} was {{generally regarded as}} impressive, the underlying technology was described by Peggy Albright in Wireless Week as not surprising; Albright said Motorola was [...] "latest company in recent weeks to introduce a <b>voice-activated</b> virtual assistant", as Mya was announced shortly after Microsoft had announced their MiPad, and Lucent had launched their Mobile Voice Activated Dialing software. However, Tobey Grummet spoke highly {{of the program in}} anticipation of its release, and Mya was described by Elliot Drucker of Wireless Week as a solution to the limitations of accessing the Internet on a mobile phone, without a keyboard or large colour display. While regarding the program with interest, John Sullivan doubted that Mya would persuade people who were not already on the Internet to start using it, and stated that if Mya could only read emails and not actually converse with him, he would rather just read his emails himself. Dawn Chmielewski from the Orange County Register called Mya a [...] "crude interpretation of things to come", noting that speech technology at the time was not without its limitations.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Funshine learns {{the hard}} way that [...] "serious" [...] is a very bad word in Joke-a-lot. [...] The Joke-a-lot {{residents}} celebrate a [...] "Laff-Fest" [...] in his honour; Funnybone gives him a tour of the town and takes him to his Royal Palace, where Funshine learns of the last two Kings and is introduced to the Royal Sceptre. [...] Stored in a vault within the <b>voice-activated</b> Royal Treasury, the sceptre holds the Royal Jewels of Joke-a-lot, which Funnybone says are [...] "the source of the magic power behind all the fun" [...] there; only the king is granted access. [...] Funshine wants to look, but Funnybone tells him that a coronation is about to take place. [...] He plans to take command of the sceptre, {{now in the hands of}} a slow, elderly alligator called Grand Duke Giggle.|$|E
2500|$|The nozzles were canted {{away from}} the {{centerline}} of the car slightly, so the final effect was that the six exhausts made a [...] "V" [...] pattern to keep the car pointed straight ahead. A bat mask was incorporated onto {{the nose of the}} car, although the sculpted lines made it somewhat difficult to make out at first. The fins were unmistakable and remain as the largest set ever built into a real-world Batmobile. On the Batman & Robin version the arsenal of weaponry and gadgets is controlled by an onboard <b>voice-activated</b> computer which surrounds the single-seat cockpit. From behind the wheel, the driver has access to a multifunctioning key command response system which delivers immediate weapon activation during attack and defensive procedures. The Batman & Robin version of the Batmobile was equipped with dual-mount, subcarriage rocket launchers, front and rear grappling hooks, multipoint infrared and laser scan tracking units, anterior/posterior wheel-based axle bombs, catapult ejection seat, and disguised central carriage, which detaches to become an emergency road vehicle. The single-seat cockpit featured a two-way videoconferencing screen, radar unit, and Redbird communication switch.|$|E
2500|$|Technological {{progress}} and intellectual breakthroughs in scientific theory appear in Atlas Shrugged, leading some observers to classify {{it in the}} genre of science fiction. Writer Jeff Riggenbach notes: [...] "Galt's motor {{is one of the}} three inventions that propel the action of Atlas Shrugged", the other two being Rearden Metal and the government's sonic weapon, Project X. Other fictional technologies are [...] "refractor rays" [...] (to disguise Galt's Gulch), a sophisticated electrical torture device (the Ferris Persuader), <b>voice-activated</b> door locks (at the Gulch's power station), palm-activated door locks (in Galt's New York laboratory), Galt's means of quietly turning the entire contents of his laboratory into a fine powder when a lock is breached, and a means of taking over all radio stations worldwide. Riggenbach adds, [...] "Rand's overall message with regard to science seems clear: the role of science in human life and human society is to provide the knowledge on the basis of which technological advancement and the related improvements in the quality of human life can be realized. But science can fulfill this role only in a society in which human beings are left free to conduct their business as they see fit." [...] Science fiction historian John J. Pierce describes it as a [...] "romantic suspense novel" [...] that is [...] "at least a borderline case" [...] of science fiction.|$|E
2500|$|One early theory {{suggested}} {{that all the}} music was recorded in a single, feverish, possibly manic phase and that after 19 albums the releases would stop. This appeared, at the time, {{as if it might}} have some validity â€“ the 21st album, Lost Cause, finished with a sidelong piece called [...] "The Electric End", a crazed instrumental featuring shouted vocals, electric guitar, and microphone feedback. Instead, this seems to have marked the end of the [...] "first band phase." [...] Then the 22nd album arrived and returned to the acoustic and vocal sound that is found on most of the first six Corwood albums (often referred to as [...] "the first acoustic phase"). This continued unabated for seven albums until, in 1999, The Beginning was released, which ended with a fifteen-minute-long work of instrumental piano. This ushered in the most controversial period of albums in Corwood's history â€“ three albums of unaccompanied voice. Seemingly recorded on a <b>voice-activated</b> tape recorder, these [...] "spoken word songs" [...] ran up to half an hour in length and taxed even the most devoted followers. After these albums, though, the direction changed again and Jandek returned to a voice and guitar mixture with occasional harmonica, though the approach was different than the earlier recordings. The guitar was often electric and the voice was decidedly older than that on the previous albums. Further albums have continued the solo approach, though the instrument used has occasionally been a fretless bass, and the songs have stretched progressively longer and the lyrics have become even more personal. Though Corwood still releases albums like this (the most recent is What Was Out There Disappeared), they are now alternated with releases of the live band shows, which are remarkably different and feature unusually tight playing. He currently records at Houston's Sugar Hill studios.|$|E
