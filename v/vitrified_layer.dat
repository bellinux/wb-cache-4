50|$|In {{the early}} '80s, several groups {{studying}} {{solid state physics}} were attempting to produce vitreous ice by different means, such as high pressure freezing or flash freezing. In a seminal paper in 1984, the group led by Jacques Dubochet at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory showed images of adenovirus embedded in a <b>vitrified</b> <b>layer</b> of water. This paper is generally considered to mark the origin of cryoelectron microscopy, and the technique has been developed {{to the point of}} becoming routine at numerous laboratories throughout the world.|$|E
40|$|Thin <b>vitrified</b> <b>layers</b> of unfixed, unstained and {{unsupported}} virus suspensions can {{be prepared}} for observation by cryo-electron microscopy in easily controlled conditions. The viral particles appear free {{from the kind of}} damage caused by dehydration, freezing or adsorption to a support that is encountered in preparing biological samples for conventional electron microscopy. Cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens offers possibilities for high resolution observations that compare favourably with any other electron microscopical method...|$|R
50|$|Being of {{volcanic}} origin, {{the walls of}} the interior are composed of <b>vitrified</b> <b>layers</b> of magma and basalt. The roof of the cave is about 10 metres high at the highest point, and the tunnels are around 15m broad at their greatest width. The floor is covered in a perpetual sheeting of ice and fallen fragments of solidified lava, and large ice speleothems are common within the cave. The height of the roof is highly variable throughout the cave, and at the latter extremities is only 2-4 m.|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} {{procedures to}} implement the method described in the companion paper for three-dimensional reconstruction from projections of a disordered collection of single particles are presented. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the way the method functions, and practical aspects are discussed in detail. Examples are given of how different symmetries can be exploited by imposing selection rules on the model equations. Applications to negatively stained 50 S ribosomes and to cryo-electron micrographs of thin <b>vitrified</b> <b>layers</b> of unstained and unsupported tomato bushy stunt and Semliki Forest viruses are described, and the resulting reconstructions are presented...|$|R

40|$|Optimisation of the {{geometry}} (curvature of the <b>vitrified</b> enamel <b>layer)</b> of a laser-generated single-stage ceramic tile grout seal has {{carried out with}} a finite element (FE) model. The overall load bearing capacities and load-displacement plots of three selected geometries were determined experimentally by the indentation technique. Simultaneously, a FE model was developed utilising the commercial ANSYS package to simulate the indentation. Although the load-displacement plots generated by the FE model consistently displayed stiffer identities than the experimentally obtained results, there was reasonably close agreement between {{the two sets of}} results. Stress distribution profiles of the three FE models at failure loads were analysed and correlated so as to draw an implication on the prediction of a catastrophic failure through an analysis of FE-generated stress distribution profiles. It was observed that although increased curvatures of the <b>vitrified</b> enamel <b>layer</b> do enhance the overall load-bearing capacity of the single-stage ceramic tile grout seal and bring about a lower nominal stress, there is a higher build up in stress concentration at the apex that would inevitably reduce the load-bearing capacity of the enamel glaze. Consequently, the optimum geometry of the <b>vitrified</b> enamel <b>layer</b> was determined to be flat...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of SV 40 minichromosomes {{has been studied}} by cryo-electron microscopy of <b>vitrified</b> thin <b>layers</b> of solution. In high-salt buffer (130 mM NaCl), freshly prepared minichromosomes are condensed into globules 30 nm or more in diameter. On the micrograph, {{they appear to be}} formed by the close packing of 10 nm granules which give rise to a 10 nm reflection in the optical diffractogram. The globules can adopt many different conformations. At high concentration, they fuse into a homogeneous 'sea' of closely packed 10 nm granules. In low-salt buffer (less than 10 mM NaCl), the globules open, first into 10 nm filaments, and then into nucleosome-strings. The 'liquid drop' model is proposed to explain the condensed {{structure of}} the minichromosome in high-salt buffer: nucleosomes stack specifically on top of one another, thus forming the 10 nm filaments. 10 nm filaments in turn, tend to aggregate laterally. Optimizing both these interactions results in the condensation of 10 nm filaments or portions thereof into a structure similar to that of a liquid. Some implications of this model for the structure of cellular chromatin are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Bonding {{porcelain}} layer was fused on Ti surface by {{laser cladding}} process using a 400 W pulse CO 2 laser. The specimens were studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and bonding tests. During the laser fusion process, the porcelain powders were heated by laser energy and melted on Ti {{to form a}} chemical bond with the substrate. When the laser scanning speed decreased, the sintering temperature {{and the extent of}} the oxidation of Ti surface increased accordingly. When the laser scanning speed is 12. 5 mm/s, the bonding porcelain layers were still incomplete sintered and there were some micro-cracks in the porcelain. When the laser scanning speed decreased to 7. 5 mm/s, <b>vitrified</b> bonding porcelain <b>layers</b> with few pores were synthesized on Ti. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence for the}} essential role of surface water in protein function and structure. However, it is unclear {{to what extent the}} hydration water and protein are coupled and interact with each other. Here, we show by ESR experiments (cw, DEER, ESEEM, and ESE techniques) with spin-labeling and nanoconfinement techniques that the <b>vitrified</b> hydration <b>layers</b> can be evidently recognized in the ESR spectra, providing nanoscale understanding for the biological interfacial water. Two peptides of different secondary structures and lengths are studied in vitrified bulk solvents and in water-filled nanochannels of different pore diameter (6. 1 ~ 7. 6 nm). The existence of surface hydration and bulk shells are demonstrated. Water in the immediate vicinity of the nitroxide label (within the van der Waals contacts, ~ 0. 35 nm) at the water-peptide interface is verified to be non-crystalline at 50 K, and the water accessibility changes little with the nanochannel dimension. Nevertheless, this water accessibility for the nanochannel cases is only half the value for the bulk solvent, even though the peptide structures remain largely the same as those immersed in the bulk solvents. On the other hand, the hydration density in the range of ~ 2 nm from the nitroxide spin increases substantially with decreasing pore size, as the density for the largest pore size (7. 6 nm) is comparable to that for the bulk solvent. The results demonstrate that while the peptides are confined but structurally unaltered in the nanochannels, their surrounding water exhibits density heterogeneity along the peptide surface normal. The causes and implications, especially those involving the interactions between the first hydration water and peptides, of these observations are discussed. Spin-label ESR techniques are proven useful for studying the structure and influences of interfacial hydration...|$|R
