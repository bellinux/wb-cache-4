5000|$|A {{demister}} is {{a device}} often fitted to vapor-liquid separator vessels {{to enhance the}} removal of liquid droplets entrained in a vapor stream. Demisters may be a mesh-type coalescer, <b>vane</b> <b>pack</b> or other structure intended to aggregate the mist into droplets that are heavy enough to separate from the vapor stream.|$|E
40|$|<b>Vane</b> <b>pack</b> demisters in the {{industry}} operate with natural gas at pressures up to 100 bara. A new <b>vane</b> <b>pack</b> has been compared with the traditional one used by {{the industry}}. The vane packs have been investigated through experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD. The fluid flow inside a <b>vane</b> <b>pack</b> consist of turbulence and two fluid phases. The simulations were carried out with a Large Eddy Simulation model and a Scale-Adaptive Simulation model. Phenomena observed in the experiments were confirmed by CFD. A transient Discrete Phase Model,DPM, that should be capable of modeling the generation of a liquid film together with droplets was used. The DPM simulation gave a mist flow pattern that agreed with the one observed in the laboratory. Separation efficiency measurements of the two vane packs using Exxsol D 60 as liquid and SF 6 as gas were performed at different pressures, ranging from 1 to 8 barg. This corresponds to natural gas density ranging from 8 to 65 barg. Non of the experiments achieved the specification given by {{the oil and gas}} industry. The efficiency measurements did show that the pressure had a great influence on the performance. The low pressure measurements were the only experiments which had a efficiency above 97 % at a k-value between 0. 2 - 0. 25 m/s. </p...|$|E
50|$|Effective oil-gas {{separation}} {{is important not}} only {{to ensure that the}} required export quality is achieved but also to prevent problems in downstream process equipment and compressors. Once the bulk liquid has been knocked out, which can be achieved in many ways, the remaining liquid droplets are separated from by a demisting device. Until recently the main technologies used for this application were reverse-flow cyclones, mesh pads and <b>vane</b> <b>packs.</b> More recently new devices with higher gas-handling have been developed which have enabled potential reduction in the scrubber vessel size. There are several new concepts currently under development in which the fluids are degassed upstream of the primary separator. These systems are based on centrifugal and turbine technology and have additional advantages in that they are compact and motion insensitive, hence ideal for floating production facilities. Below are some {{of the ways in which}} oil is separated from gas in separators.|$|R
