5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic <b>vision,</b> meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} <b>vision,</b> which allows colour <b>vision.</b> Microbats may use their <b>vision</b> for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E

This is a large-scale project that aims to demonstrate real life implementation of hydrogen in the transport sector in Norway. The starting point of the analysis is that <b>visions</b> {{play an important role}} in technological projects. <b>Visions</b> carry, communicate and construct valid practices and meanings in technology. Consequently, <b>visions</b> in technological projects should be a matter of analysis. The following paper discusses both the meaning of technological <b>visions</b> and the kinds of <b>visions</b> that have been deployed in the HyNor project. This discussion shows that HyNorś <b>visions</b> are numerous, flexible and dynamic. Furthermore the ambivalence and tension in the projectś <b>visions</b> represent a challenge that needs to be dealt with.

40|$|There {{are many}} <b>visions</b> that {{touch on the}} future of human {{computer}} interaction from a trans-human future to a post-technological UI. However <b>visions</b> related to the progress of technology are not new. Creative and insightful visionaries from Denis Diderot to Vannevar Bush have been postulating <b>visions</b> of possible futures or technology for centuries. Some idealised views end up discredited with advances in knowledge, while others now appear remarkably prescient. The question is, do <b>visions</b> and the process of creating them have a place in CHI, or are they simply flights of fancy? This SIG meeting provides a forum for visionaries; researchers and practitioners looking to consider the place and importance of <b>visions</b> within CHI. Can <b>visions,</b> the process of <b>visioning</b> and forming new <b>visions</b> help us refine, advance or develop new research or forms of interaction. And if <b>visions</b> are important to us, then are they part of the regular academic process? If so, should CHI provide venues for publishing new <b>visions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular <b>vision</b> slightly better than that of modern hawks. Horner {{also pointed out that}} the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular <b>vision.</b> It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic <b>vision</b> provides. In modern animals, binocular <b>vision</b> is found mainly in predators.|$|E
5|$|Since cone cells make color <b>vision</b> possible, {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color <b>vision.</b> The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow <b>vision,</b> but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color receptivity, trichromatic <b>vision</b> may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E

5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they {{must be aware of}} their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of <b>vision</b> of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular <b>vision</b> and the remaining 285° monocular <b>vision.</b> Horses have excellent day and night <b>vision,</b> but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color <b>vision</b> is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vision</b> is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic <b>vision),</b> and most species have colour <b>vision.</b> Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish <b>vision</b> shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
