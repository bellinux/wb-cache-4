40|$|SummaryThe primate {{temporal}} cortex implements neural {{mechanisms for}} memory retrieval from <b>visual</b> long-term <b>storage,</b> and memory neurons {{have been identified}} at the single-neuron level whose activities following cue presentation encode the presented object (“cue-holding” neurons) or to-be-recalled target (“pair-recall” neurons). Although {{these two types of}} neurons can potentially interact during the target recall, little is known about information flow among these neurons. We conducted simultaneous recordings of multiple single units in macaque perirhinal cortex while they performed a pair-association memory task. Granger causality analysis revealed the emergence of directed couplings during the delay period predominantly from cue-holding neurons to pair-recall neurons. Moreover, these interactions coincided with unidirectional signal flow from the recipient recall neuron to another recall neuron, implying cascade-like signal propagation among the memory cell assembly. These results suggest that directed interactions among perirhinal memory neurons are dynamically modulated to implement functional microcircuitry for retrieval of object association memory...|$|R

40|$|The part-report {{advantage}} {{has been}} used to identify short-lived forms of <b>visual</b> <b>storage</b> (Sperling, 1960). We adopt the part-report paradigm to test whether visual memory can preserve, for a brief time, successive inputs and their temporal order. In our experiments, two successive arrays, each of 4 digits, were presented on each trial. The two arrays were spatially coincident, and each was followed by a random pattern-mask. In the part-report conditions, an auditory cue indicated whether the participant should report the first array or the second array. The results consistently showed a part-report advantage, which ranged in size from 16 % to 37 %. Delaying the cue by 500  ms abolished most of this advantage, in that performance was then similar to that in whole-report conditions. Subsequent experiments confirmed that the part-report superiority we measure is not achieved by (a) making eye movements that spatially displace the second array relative to the first; (b) extracting information from a single snapshot containing an integrated representation of the targets and masks; or (c) transferring a subset of material to a phonological store. We propose instead that observers have access to a limited, rapidly decaying representation of successive visual inputs stored in temporal sequence...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} on visual working memory (WM) have inspired {{the hypothesis that}} information about briefly displayed objects is stored in separate object files whose contents may endure for several seconds (e. g., Vogel, Woodman, & Luck, 2001). Supposedly, visual WM can contain about four such files. Yet data from these experiments seem problematic to interpret and were perhaps contaminated by some artifacts. To help resolve such problems, we have conducted new studies that required same-different judgments and cued recall under conditions where successive object displays changed in various ways. Our results suggest {{that at least two}} distinct types of extra-iconic <b>visual</b> <b>storage</b> contributed to performance there. One type involves unintegrated location-independent visual features. The other involves integrated location-dependent features, consistent with the object-file hypothesis. However, it appears from our results that visual WM has a capacity of only about three rather than four object files. 2 Visual Working Memory • Visual information about objects can be stored in two general forms: – Individual object features: no connection to other information (e. g., color, shape, location). – Bound object features: grouped together in “chunks” (e. g., color-location pairs, object files). • Any task that can be performed with individual object features can also be performed with bound features, but not vice versa. • In principle, visual working memory (WM) could be based on either level. ...|$|E

A reduction in visual short-term memory (vSTM) storage capacity was recently suggested as a potential neuro-cognitive endophenotype, i. e., a testable marker of an individual's liability for developing ADHD. This study aimed at identifying markers of the brain abnormalities underlying vSTM reductions in adult ADHD. We combined behavioral parameter-based assessment with electrophysiology in groups of adult ADHD patients and healthy age-matched controls. Amplitudes of ERP markers of vSTM storage capacity, the contralateral delay activity (CDA) and the P 3 b, were analyzed according to (i) differences between individuals with higher vs. lower storage capacity K and (ii) differences between ADHD patients and control participants. We replicated the finding of reduced storage capacity in adult ADHD. Across groups, individuals with higher relative to lower storage capacity showed a larger CDA and P 3 b. We further found differences between the patient and control groups in the ERPs: The CDA amplitude was attenuated in an early time window for ADHD patients compared to control participants, and was negatively correlated with ADHD patients' symptom severity ratings. Furthermore, the P 3 b was larger in ADHD patients relative to control participants. These electrophysiological findings indicate altered brain mechanisms underlying <b>visual</b> <b>storage</b> capacity in ADHD, which are characterized by deficient encoding and maintenance, and increased recruitment of control processes. Accordingly, (quantifiable) ERP markers of vSTM in adult ADHD bear candidacy as neuro-cognitive endophenotypes of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Experts {{with video}} game experience, in {{contrast}} to non-experienced persons, are superior in multiple domains of visual attention. However, it {{is an open question}} which basic aspects of attention underlie this superiority. We approached this question using the framework of Theory of Visual Attention (TVA) with tools that allowed us to assess various parameters that are related to different visual attention aspects (e. g., perception threshold, processing speed, <b>visual</b> short-term memory <b>storage</b> capacity, top-down control, spatial distribution of attention) and that are measurable on the same experimental basis. In Experiment 1, we found advantages of video game experts in perception threshold and visual processing speed; the latter being restricted to the lower positions of the used computer display. The observed advantages were not significantly moderated by general person-related characteristics such as personality traits, sensation seeking, intelligence, social anxiety, or health status. Experiment 2 tested a potential causal link between the expert advantages and video game practice with an intervention protocol. It found no effects of action video gaming on perception threshold, <b>visual</b> short-term memory <b>storage</b> capacity, iconic memory storage, top-down control, and spatial distribution of attention after 15 days of training.

40|$|Visual {{working memory}} {{provides}} an essential link {{between past and}} future events. Despite recent efforts, capacity limits, their genesis and the underlying neural structures of visual working memory remain unclear. Here we show that performance in visual working memory - but not iconic visual memory - can be predicted by the strength of mental imagery as assessed with binocular rivalry in a given individual. In addition, for individuals with strong imagery, modulating the background luminance diminished performance on visual working memory and imagery tasks, but not working memory for number strings. This suggests that luminance signals were disrupting sensory-based imagery mechanisms and not a general working memory system. Individuals with poor imagery still performed above chance in the visual working memory task, but their performance was not affected by the background luminance, suggesting a dichotomy in strategies for visual working memory: individuals with strong mental imagery rely on sensory-based imagery to support mnemonic performance, while those with poor imagery rely on different strategies. These findings could help reconcile current controversy regarding the mechanism and location of <b>visual</b> mnemonic <b>storage...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{complexity}} of behaviour necessitates {{a clear and}} concise approach in order to comprehend its functioning. An example of such an approach is highlighted by the field of cybernetics. Cybernetic models have been used extensively throughout the various fields of Psychology but perhaps never more so {{as in the case}} of short term memory (STM). This particular field abounds with behavioural models and research workers are constantly developing new models or testing the unviversality of existing models. Universal validity is essential to the strength of the behavioural principles inherent in any model but unfortunately such validity tends to be neglected. The present study attempts to reconcile this position with reference to specific models of STM, with relation to the phenomena of eidetic imagery (EI). Certain studies concerning the incidence of EI in illiterate Africans have produced results which are contradictory to those obtained in the Western culture. Two of the most important contradictions concern the fact that the illiterate Africans experienced the absence of an age parameter on the occurrence of such imagery and the fact that the incidence of imagery was more extensive in the African culture. A reason for these contradictions was sought and it was reasoned that as eidetic images have been closely linked with memory images, it may, therefore, be assumed that these particular cultures may use EI as an aid to memory in the absence of written material. Further, it would not be unreasonable to assume that this visual imagery may tend to dominate the STM process and thereby challenge the universality of those memory models that proposed acoustic domination of this process. No work has been done in investigating the memory process of the Africans. Thus, a study which did so would not only test the universality of specific memory models but would also possibly throw more light on the memory process itself. In this particular study there were three specific aims; (a) to ascertain the relative incidence of EI on a cross-cultural level, (b) to assess the influence of EI on the memory process, and (c) to ascertain the extent to which principles of STM developed in the West applied to the African groups. The groups concerned in the study comprised two Xhosa groups and a European group. The European group (WS) was drawn from a White Student population at Rhodes University and was regarded as a control group. The equivalent literate Xhosa group (BS) was drawn from a Black Student population at the University of Fort Hare. The illiterate Xhosa group (RX) was drawn from a population of Red Xhosa people in the Transkei. Four tasks were administered to the groups with the cross-cultural variable carefully controlled as much as possible. The following comprised the four tasks; (a) eidetic imagery (b) auditory serial recall (c) visual serial recall and (d) an acoustic confusable task. Each subject commenced with the eidetic imagery task and was then confronted with a random presentation of the other three tasks. The EI task began with an after image task which was foIlowed by three selected pictures which comprised the EI task. After each picture presentation the subject was closely questioned as to the presence of imagery. Scoring was of a subjective nature. The visual and acoustic confusion tasks constituted serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. Each item was presented for 0, 75 seconds with a negligible inter-item interval. The presentation order of the items was randomized throughout the trials. Presentation was by means of a preprogrammed 16 mm colour film. Items were scored for correct serial position. The auditory task consisted of the serial presentation of ten items over six randomized trials. The items were once again randomized throughout the trials with regards to presentation order. The presentation speed was one word per second. The presentation was by means of a pre-programmed tape. Items were scored for correct serial position. The visual task was common to both language groups whilst the other two tasks correIated with the language group. Thus, the items in the auditory and acoustic confusion tasks were different for each language but an attempt was made to control this variable. The tasks were conducted in the subjects home languagc which was either Xhosa or English. It was assumed that the RX group would demonstrate a greater incidence of EI, irrespective of the age of the subject, and that imagery would be reflected in the recall performance of the memory tasks. It was suggested that imagery may determine or encourage the mode of storage that the subject cmployed, which, in this case, would be the visual modality. If so then it would be expected that <b>visual</b> <b>storage</b> would circumvent the detrimental influence of acoustic confusability. The Xhosa university group (BS) was an unknown quantity but was included to ascertain whether there were any marked differences between the group and the other two. The results revealed that imagery was in fact more prevalent in the Xhosa groups whilst the WS group demonstrated a complete lack of EI but did report the presence of pictorial imagery (PI). However, imagery did not appear to function as an aid to memory. It seemed, however, that in certain instances it correlated with visual encoding. Generally the Xhosa subjects, especially with regards to the visual tasks, tended to encode visually whilst the WS group encoded auditorily. With reference to recall performance, it was found that in all instances the WS group demonstrated superior recall followed by the BS and RX groups in that order. There was a significant difference in the strength of recall between each of the groups. The results of the auditory and visual tasks were interpreted within the STM principles developed in the West. It was found that the WS group adhered to these principles thereby justifying its position as a central group. The BS group followed a similar pattern with exception to the recency effect which was much weaker in their case. The RX group reported the absence of any storage and rehearsal strategies and this was reflected in their poor recall performance. They too were characterized by a very weak recency effect. The interesting point arose, however, when the auditory and visual recency effects were compared. According to Crawder and Norton (1969) the influence or the precategorical acoustic store (PAS) on recall should be reflected by a comparatively stronger auditory recency effect. This trend was observed in relation to the WS group but not to the Xhosa groups who tended to demonstrate a stronger visual recency effect. It was therefore, suspected that PAS did not operate with the same effectiveness with the Xhosa subjects. In fact it was suggested that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the visual peripheral store may be stronger than PAS. Contrary to expectation all three groups exhibited acoustic confusion. This was expected of the WS group as the subjects preferred auditory storage, but not of the Xhosa subjects who preferred <b>visual</b> <b>storage.</b> It was suggested however, that in the case of the Xhosa subjects the <b>visual</b> <b>storage</b> technique would have to be abandoned immediately prior to or during recall as recall was necessarily in the auditory modality. The outcome of the experiment generally confirmed Doab's conclusions as to the incidence of imagery and its relation with memory. However, due to the Xhosa preference for <b>visual</b> <b>storage</b> and their stronger visual recency effect, Sperling's model was slightly modified. Conrad 's findings were, of course, substantiated. KMBT_ 363 Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|E

In a preliminary experiment, target and mask were interleaved (at 140 Hz) and target contrast was varied to determine {{the level at which}} performance fell to chance. In the main experiment, target and mask were separated by an inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of 100, 150, or 200 ms.

Conventional hashing schemes typically feed hand-crafted features into hash functions, which separates the procedures of feature extraction and hash function learning. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that concurrently performs feature engineering and non-linear supervised hashing function learning. Our technical contributions {{in this paper}} are two-folds: 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by gradient propagation, which critically requires a smooth objective function. The discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based optimization. To address this issue, we propose an exponentiated hashing loss function and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation and propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in supervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality has never been discussed in current deep hashing literature. We propose a pre-training scheme inspired by recent advance in deep network based image classification, and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Comprehensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on several widely-used image benchmarks. On all benchmarks, our proposed deep hashing algorithm outperforms all state-of-the-art competitors by significant margins. In particular, our algorithm achieves a near-perfect 0. 99 in terms of Hamming ranking accuracy with only 12 bits on MNIST, and a new record of 0. 74 on the CIFAR 10 dataset.

40|$|Human {{beings are}} endowed {{with a wide}} range of highly {{developed}} cognitive abilities. Which factors have led to this level of intellectual capacity in the course of evo- lution? In cross species studies, overall brain size is a reliable predictor of cognitive performance, but more specific information about how the brain’s structural and functional organization may be linked to these enhancements is lacking. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the role of the anatomy and function of the primary visual cortex (V 1) in behaviour. V 1 is the earliest sensory stage for vision in the cerebral cortex, and is responsible for processing low-level visual features such as spatial orientation, location and frequency. Interestingly, V 1 size displays huge variance between individuals; this offers an amazing opportunity to study the behavioural effect of brain enlargement within a human sample while avoiding the various confounds that can distort the results in cross species studies. Previous research has shown that a larger V 1 is linked to higher perceptual sensitivity; but to what extent these size differences may also affect higher cognitive functions is unknown. Using a combined approach of behavioural testing and fMRI brain imaging methods, we find that the acuity of two cognitive functions, namely the precision of visual imagery and <b>visual</b> working memory <b>storage,</b> are significantly positively correlated with the surface size of V 1 : individuals with a larger V 1 tended to have more precise imagery and greater <b>visual</b> working memory <b>storage.</b> In contrast, the strength of visual imagery was negatively related to V 1 surface size. In addition, we find that other indices of neural function, such as the concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the medial occipital cortex and V 1 spontaneous functional activity levels, covaried significantly with differences in V 1 surface size. Our findings support the notion of a positive relationship between brain (areal) size and cognition and show how even very low-level sensory areas are involved in shaping our intellect. As a last point, we discuss the potential limitations of the positive link between brain size and cognitive ability...|$|R

These results suggest some overlap in the adaptation mechanisms for the two effects, possibly at or below the level of primary visual cortex. The next two experiments revealed the transfer of the effect across the vertical meridian as well as the existence of a preferred stimulus size that is a linear increasing function of eccentricity, mimicking the RF size of the monkey MT neurons. These results suggest that some extrastriate motion area along the parietal pathway including MT mediates motion-based compensation of retinal slip...|$|R
40|$|In humans, DHA occurs {{naturally}} as a {{cell membrane}} fatty acid in the brain, retina, testes and sperm, {{and has been}} reported to be essential in the development of these organs and cells. There it is crucial for the functioning of embedded proteins, i. e. rhodopsin for vision and postsynaptic receptors for neurotransmission. In phospholipids in general, DHA contributes to membrane properties such as fluidity, flexibility and permeability. A deficiency in DHA can lead to memory loss, learning disabilities and impaired <b>visual</b> acuity. Limited <b>storage</b> of DHA in adipose tissue suggests that a continuous supply is needed. These facts clearly demonstrate the physiological importance of DHA for humans and have resulted, for example, in the recommendation of increasing dietary intake of DHA during pregnancy and lactation. Also in the maintenance of cardiovascular health, DHA plays an important role. DHAid™ is a pure vegetarian source of omega- 3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). It is produced from microalgae in a controlled process in fermentation vessels by the Swiss life-science company Lonza. Due to its renewable sources, DHAid™ is environmentally friendly. DHAid™ is allergen free and is free of potential contaminants that are discussed for seafood...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Rationale Nicotine {{has been shown}} to improve both memory and attention when assessed through speeded motor responses. Since very few studies have assessed effects of nicotine on visual attention using measures that are uncontaminated by motoric effects, nicotine’s attentional effects may, at least partially, be due to speeding of motor function. Objectives Using an unspeeded, accuracy-based test, the CombiTVA paradigm, we examined whether nicotine enhances attention when it is measured independently of motor processing. Methods We modelled data with a computational theory of visual attention (TVA; Bundesen 1990) so as to derive independent estimates of several distinct components of attention from performance of the single task: threshold of visual perception, perceptual processing speed, <b>visual</b> shortterm memory <b>storage</b> capacity and top–down controlled selectivity. Acute effects of nicotine (2 mg gum) on performance were assessed in 24 healthy young nonsmokers in a placebo-controlled counterbalanced, crossover design. Chronic effects of nicotine were investigated in 24 age- and education-matched minimally deprived smokers. Results Both an acute dose of nicotine in non-smokers and chronic nicotine use in temporarily abstaining smoker...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} the mechanisms that mediate {{the transfer of}} information from <b>visual</b> input to <b>storage</b> in memory. Observers performed two concurrent tasks, one of which required input into memory. We discov-ered that the processes involved in the transfer of information from sensory input into memory cause slowing in concurrent cognitive tasks (dual-task slowing). We used the dual-task slowing eect to dem-onstrate that memory encoding requires more time when more information is to be encoded and to show that dual-task slowing occurs long after the initial perceptual encoding of visual information (Exp. 1). These results suggest a late and central locus of interaction between the two tasks. Experiment 2 also used two concurrent tasks. However, we reversed the direction of interaction between them and produced a memory deficit from the execution of a concurrent task. Together {{the results suggest that}} the mechanisms that encode information into memory belong to a family of mechanisms that are involved in dual-task slowing phenomena and that have been studied under the rubric of the PRP eect (psy-chological refractory period). We were able to locate the most probable locus of the dual-task interactions to a process that appears necessary for memory encoding. We call this process short-term consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Task {{preparation}} {{has traditionally}} been thought to rely upon persistent memory representations of instructions that permit their execution after delays. Accumulating evidence suggests, however, that accurate retention of task knowledge can be insufficient for successful performance. Here, we hypothesized that instructed facts would be organized into a task set, a temporary coding scheme that proactively tunes sensorimotor pathways based on instructions to enable highly efficient “reflex-like” performance. We devised a paradigm requiring either implementation or memorization of novel stimulus-response mapping instructions, and used multivoxel pattern analysis of neuroimaging data to compare neural coding of instructions during the pre-target phase. Although participants could retain instructions under both demands, we observed striking differences in their representation. To-be-memorized instructions could only be decoded from mid-occipital and posterior parietal cortices, consistent with previous work on <b>visual</b> short-term memory <b>storage.</b> By contrast, to-be- implemented instructions could also be decoded from frontoparietal “multiple- demand” regions, and dedicated visual areas, implicated in processing instructed stimuli. Neural specificity in the latter correlated with performance speed only when instructions were prepared, likely reflecting the pre-activation of instructed decision circuits. Together, these data illuminate how the brain proactively optimizes performance, and help dissociate neural mechanisms supporting task control and short- term memory storage...|$|R
40|$|At {{the dawn}} of a new era, vast {{expansion}} of human communication is profoundly influencing culture everywhere. Revolutionary technological changes are only part of what is happening. Which is unifying humanity and turning it into what is known as a global village. But it is changed in the concept of global room. Because recent decades also have witnessed remarkable developments in the technology of communicating. These includes both the rapid evolution of previously existing technologies and the emergence of new telecommunications and technologies, satellites, cable television, fiber optics, video cassettes, compacts disks, computerized image making and other computer and digital technology and much more else.

40|$|Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is {{a highly}} toxic {{metabolite}} of Aspergillus fungi that contaminates animal feed. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in the Greater Addis Ababa milk shed between September 2014 and February 2015. The objectives were to assess the knowledge and practices of dairy value chain actors on aflatoxins, and to analyze feed {{for the presence of}} AFB 1. A structured questionnaire was administered to value chain actors. A total of 100 dairy farmers, five feed manufacturers, five feed processors and nine feed traders were interviewed and feed samples were collected. All dairy farmers used concentrate feed daily, which commonly included the mixture of wheat bran and noug (Guizotia abyssinica) cake (the byproduct from noug oil factory). In general, feed was stored indoors (94 %) in plastic bags. Quality assessment of feed ingredients was limited to <b>visual</b> inspection. <b>Storage</b> time was highly variable and sometimes up to six months long. Preventive measures, such as the practice of keeping feed on raised platforms were not common (15 %). Most respondents never heard of aflatoxins (88 %). Over 90 % of dairy farmers had no knowledge that milk could be contaminated with aflatoxin. We analyzed the level of AFB 1 in 114 feed samples from dairy farmers and 42 feed samples from feed producers and processors using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All the feed samples were contaminated with AFB 1 ranging between seven and 419 ppb (ug/kg). Analysis of individual wheat bran and noug cake samples revealed that the contamination level of AFB 1 for wheat bran was between nine and 31 ppb while the contamination level for noug cake was between 290 and 397 ppb. Linear regression revealed significant associations between the presence of noug cake in the feed and the levels of contamination of AFB 1 in feed. The level of aflatoxin contamination found in feed is alarming and should prompt urgent action to identify suitable interventions. Training should be provided to the dairy sector on risk mitigation strategies. These results suggest that risk mitigation should focus on noug cake to effectively reduce aflatoxin contamination in the peri-urban dairy value chains in Ethiopia...|$|R
