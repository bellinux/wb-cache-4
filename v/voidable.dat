25|$|Such {{defenses}} {{operate to}} determine whether a purported contract is either (1)void or (2)voidable. Void contracts cannot be ratified by either party. <b>Voidable</b> contracts can be ratified.|$|E
25|$|The {{liquidator}} {{may also}} have to determine whether any payments made by the company or transactions entered into may be <b>voidable</b> as a transaction at an undervalue or an unfair preference.|$|E
25|$|A nullity {{order is}} one which annuls a void or <b>voidable</b> civil partnership. Section 49 of the Act {{provides}} that a civil partnership is void {{on grounds of}} ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as {{to the formation of}} the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a parent) has forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court has not given its consent. Where a civil partnership is <b>voidable,</b> applications for nullity orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.|$|E
25|$|However, one {{category}} of <b>voidable</b> transactions {{which is a}} feature of many other common law jurisdictions but which {{is not part of}} Hong Kong law is the power to challenge transactions as undervalue transactions.|$|E
25|$|The facts must be unknown at {{the time}} of the trial without fault of the party seeking relief. The writ must present facts, not {{appearing}} in the record, which, if true, would show that such judgment was void or <b>voidable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Dimes, {{the judges}} advised the House of Lords that Lord Cottenham's pecuniary {{interest}} made his judgment not void, but <b>voidable.</b> This advice is not {{wrong in the}} context of a judicial act under review, where the judgment will be held valid unless reversed on appeal.|$|E
25|$|If the {{insolvent}} {{enters a}} contract which purports {{to dispose of}} estate property, the contract is <b>voidable</b> {{at the option of}} the trustee; it is not void. The position is the same if the insolvent contracts without obtaining his trustee’s consent where it is required.|$|E
25|$|Mutual mistake {{occurs when}} both parties of a {{contract}} are mistaken as to the terms. Each believes they are contracting to something different. Courts usually try to uphold such mistakes if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgment does not cause the contract to be <b>voidable</b> by the party that is adversely affected. See Raffles v. Wichelhaus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voidable</b> {{floating}} charges. Where {{a company}} goes into liquidation, {{and the company}} created a floating charge on the assets and undertaking of the company within the 12 {{months prior to the}} commencement of the winding up, then unless it can be proved that the company was solvent at the relevant time, that floating charge is invalid except to the amount of any cash paid to the company in consideration for the charge granting of the floating charge.|$|E
25|$|When a {{misrepresentation}} {{has been}} made and an agreement was (or at any rate appeared to be) concluded, the misrepresentee {{does not have to}} bring a halt to the deal. Misrepresentations generally do not render a contract void, as does the contractual doctrine of common mistake or frustration; it makes a contract <b>voidable</b> at the option of the misrepresentee. Not all contracts entered into on the strength of misrepresentations will be bad for the misrepresentee, who may choose not to void the contract.|$|E
25|$|In some courts, {{violations}} of the stay are treated as void ab initio {{as a matter of}} law, although the court may annul the stay to give effect to otherwise void acts. Other courts treat violations as <b>voidable</b> (not necessarily void ab initio). Any violation of the stay may give rise to damages being assessed against the violating party. Non-willful {{violations of}} the stay are often excused without penalty, but willful violators are liable for punitive damages and may also be found to be in contempt of court.|$|E
25|$|A {{contract}} {{made by the}} insolvent {{without the}} trustee's consent, where such consent is necessary, is not void, but it is <b>voidable</b> at the instance of the trustee. This {{is subject to the}} qualification that, if an insolvent purports to alienate, for valuable consideration, and without the consent of the trustee of the insolvent estate, any property acquired after sequestration, or right to such property to a person who proves that he was not aware and had no reason to suspect that the estate of the insolvent was under sequestration, the alienation shall nevertheless be valid.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{misrepresentation}}: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract <b>voidable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lending {{agreements}} {{called for}} all disputes between the borrower and lender {{to be settled}} in arbitration. The original plaintiffs argued that the entire contract, including the arbitration clause, was invalid because it violated the law. When it was appealed to the High Court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote {{for a majority of}} seven that the Federal Arbitration Act, as previously interpreted by the Court, settled a question that had long been debated by legal scholars and lower-court judges. The opinion distinguished void and <b>voidable</b> contracts, requiring that in the latter an arbitrator rule on all issues including the legality of the contract unless the arbitration clause was itself challenged. The only dissenter was Clarence Thomas, who restated his belief that the Arbitration Act does not supersede state law.|$|E
25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and <b>voidable</b> contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face. One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{consequences}} of non-compliance with procedural or formality requirements in a written law is wholly or partly dependent on whether the requirement in question is mandatory or directory. Courts may read a requirement as both mandatory and directory; that is, mandatory as to substantial compliance, and directory as to precise compliance. Old cases usually regarded an act done or decision reached in breach of a mandatory requirement as a nullity and void ab initio (that is, from the beginning). On the other hand, an act done in breach of a directory provision is merely <b>voidable,</b> and therefore effective until set aside. In deciding whether a statutory provision is mandatory or directory, the courts will look at its purpose and relationship with the scheme, subject matter and object of the statute in question, and must assess the importance attached to it by Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Contract law {{works best}} when an {{agreement}} is performed, and recourse {{to the courts}} is never needed because each party knows her rights and duties. However, where an unforeseen event renders an agreement very hard, or even impossible to perform, the courts typically will construe the parties to want to have released themselves from their obligations. It may also be that one party simply breaches a contract's terms. If a contract is not substantially performed, then the innocent party is entitled to cease her own performance and sue for damages {{to put her in}} the position as if the contract were performed. She is under a duty to mitigate her losses and cannot claim for harm that was a remote consequence of the contractual breach, but remedies in English law are footed on the principle that full compensation for all losses, pecuniary or not, should be made good. In exceptional circumstances, the law goes further to require a wrongdoer to make restitution for their gains from breaching a contract, and may demand specific performance of the agreement rather than monetary compensation. It is also possible that a contract becomes <b>voidable,</b> because, depending on the specific type of contract, one party failed to make adequate disclosure or they made misrepresentations during negotiations.|$|E
500|$|The first {{requirement}} of an express trust is capacity; the person creating the trust must be legally {{capable of doing}} so. Generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can form a trust, although there are exceptions. A minor cannot hold land, and therefore cannot create a trust of land; in addition, unless they are soldiers or [...] "mariners at sea", they cannot form a valid will. Where a minor tries to create a trust, it will be held <b>voidable,</b> and can be repudiated by him when he reaches majority, or soon after. Where the trust is clearly of detriment to the minor, the courts may decide to take it as void; the individual, when he reaches majority, could alternately plead non est factum {{if he had been}} too young to appreciate the nature of forming a trust. People who are considered mentally disordered (under the Mental Health Act 1983) and have a receiver appointed cannot have trusts directly enforced against them, as they no longer have control over their property. Where there is no receiver, the mentally disordered person's trust will be held void, unless it was made during a lucid period when the person was capable of understanding their actions. Corporations and statutory bodies only have the powers granted to them by their memorandum of association or authorising statute; if these do not authorise the creation of trusts, any such trust will be held to be ultra vires.|$|E

2500|$|The Court may {{not make}} an order against a party where it would {{materially}} prejudice a right or interest {{of a person who}} is able to bring themselves within the protective provision. [...] Where the person defending the liquidator's claim was not a party to the <b>voidable</b> transaction, the protective provision requires that they must prove that they did not receive a benefit {{as a result of the}} transaction, or if a benefit was received, that it was received in good faith and at the time there was no reasonable grounds for suspecting company insolvent. [...] But if the person defending the liquidator's claim was a party to the <b>voidable</b> transaction then they must prove: ...|$|E
2500|$|Insolvent {{transactions}} are transactions entered into {{by a company}} whilst insolvent, or transactions entered into by the company the result of which caused the company to become insolvent. [...] An insolvent transaction may be <b>voidable</b> {{when one of the}} following conditions apply: ...|$|E
2500|$|A misrepresentee {{does not}} have to {{exercise}} the right to rescind a contract, and have it declared void. A contract is always <b>voidable,</b> and it exists until the option to void is exercised. If one's wish to rescind is clear, this will be effective even if not communicated to the misrepresentor, but to some official authority like the police or a motoring mutual society ...|$|E
2500|$|The great Charter of 1217 {{had struck}} at certain collusive {{practices}} {{to which the}} churches were privy. [...] Collusive gifts to the Church (which were frequently made in order to evade feudal service) were forbidden. Coke interprets this as though its only effect {{was to make the}} excessive gift <b>voidable</b> by the donor’s heir. It certainly could not be voided by the donor’s lord., and this opinion was reiterated by Bracton.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{it is not}} {{possible}} to categorise transactions as unfair preferences or uncommercial transactions, they may still be <b>voidable</b> even if entered into outside of the time periods usually applied to such transactions. [...] This will be the case where transactions were entered into by the company for the purpose of defeating, delaying or interfering with the rights of creditors during the 10 years prior to the relation back day.|$|E
2500|$|Antonin Scalia {{wrote for}} the majority. The Florida Supreme Court's {{distinction}} between void and <b>voidable</b> contracts was, as Cantero had said, irrelevant under Prima Paint and Southland. The relevant section of the FAA was indeed applicable to the case, he said, since it required that contracts with arbitration clauses be treated like all others, and that its definition of [...] "contract" [...] included those that would or could later be voided since it explicitly mentioned such contracts that might later be revoked.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{a company}} is deemed to be unable to pay its debts, this {{has a number of}} other affects in {{addition}} to the ability for a creditor to present a petition to wind it up. [...] It also means that the directors are expected to discharge their duties {{in the best interest of}} the company's creditors rather than its shareholders; that transactions may be potentially vulnerable as <b>voidable</b> transactions, and that the right of creditors to set-off mutual debts may become impaired in relation to debts which are incurred during the period of insolvency.|$|E
2500|$|The second primary {{area where}} courts {{have sought to}} {{constrain}} trustee discretion, but recently have retreated, is in the rule that trustees' decisions may be interfered with if irrelevant issues are taken into account, or relevant issues are ignored. There had been suggestions that a decision could be wholly void, {{which led to a}} flood of claims where trustees had failed to get advice on taxation of trust transactions and were sometimes successful in having the transaction annulled and escaping payments to the Revenue. However, in the leading case, Pitt v Holt the Supreme Court reaffirmed that poorly considered decisions may only become <b>voidable</b> (and so cannot be cancelled if a third party, like the Revenue, is affected) and only if mistakes are [...] "fundamental" [...] can a transaction be wholly void. In one appeal, a trustee for her husband's worker compensation got poor advice and was liable for more inheritance tax, and in the second, a trustee for his children got poor advice and was liable for more capital gains tax. The UK Supreme Court found that both transactions were valid. If a trustee had acted in breach of duty, but within its powers, then a transaction was <b>voidable.</b> However, on the facts, the trustees seeking advice had fulfilled their duty (and so the advisers could be liable for negligence instead).|$|E
2500|$|As most secured lenders {{will not}} usually have {{recourse}} to their security until the debtor company is in a parlous financial state, the usual {{position is that}} even all the remaining {{assets of the company}} are not enough to repay the debt secured by the floating charge, leaving the unsecured creditors with nothing. [...] This perception has led to a widening of the classes of preferred creditors who take ahead of the floating charge holders in a number of countries. [...] The introduction of a regime of <b>voidable</b> floating charges for floating charges taken just prior to the onset of insolvency is a partial response to these criticisms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{breach of}} common law directors' duties may enable a {{liquidator}} to recover property from a director, or may give the liquidator {{a right to}} an account of profits. [...] If a director removes or misuses company property, this would ordinarily be a breach of their duty of good faith, and may render the transaction <b>voidable.</b> [...] Accordingly, the liquidator may attempt to recover the property from the director, who is deemed to hold it on constructive trust for the company. [...] A director who breaches the duty to use reasonable care and diligence may also be liable for damages if the company suffered loss {{as a result of}} the breach.|$|E
2500|$|The law {{relating}} to insolvency, bankruptcy and liquidation is {{regulated by the}} Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005 in the British Virgin Islands. [...] The act is broadly based upon the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United Kingdom (without the changes brought into effect by the UK's Enterprise Act 2002), but modified in certain specific regards {{in relation to the}} jurisdiction's role as an offshore centre. [...] The Insolvency Act is [...] "predicated heavily towards the protection of secured creditors' rights". [...] The legislation includes the ISDA model netting laws to facilitate set-off upon a credit event in derivatives transactions. [...] It also contains specific [...] "safe harbour" [...] provisions {{relating to}} vulnerable transactions (principally undervalue transactions, unfair preferences and <b>voidable</b> floating charges) on an insolvency, to protect structured finance transactions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases of}} fraud, the same {{principle}} applies; the property is held by the fraudster on constructive trust for the original owner, unless the original owner {{was involved in the}} fraud, as in Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 2). An exception to this principle is fraudulent misrepresentation, where the courts disagree over whether it immediately forms a constructive trust or requires action by the victim. In Collings v Lee, an estate agent transferred property to a non-existent purchaser (in reality an alias) and then claimed that as he was not the transferee, {{he did not have to}} pay the vendors; it was held that this fraudulent misrepresentation meant he held the property on constructive trust. However, in Lonrho, Millett J held that [...] "A contract obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation is <b>voidable,</b> not void, even in equity. The representee may elect to avoid it, but until he does so, the representor is not a constructive trustee of the property transferred pursuant to the contact, and no fiduciary relationship exists between him and the representee".|$|E
2500|$|Brian Schall sued Hudgens in 2007 for {{an alleged}} [...] "breach of contract"; {{according}} to the suit, Schall claims he advanced costs and expenses on Hudgens's behalf for her songwriting and recording career. Schall claims Hudgens owed him $150,000 after helping her earn more than $5 million for her music career. Hudgens argued {{that she was a}} 16-year-old minor when she signed the contract in October 2005, and therefore too young to do so. She subsequently disaffirmed it on October 9, 2008. Papers filed in court by her lawyer say California's Family Code [...] "provides that the contract of a minor is <b>voidable</b> and may be disaffirmed before (age18) or within a reasonable time afterward." [...] In 2008, Hudgens was sued by Johnny Vieira, who claims he was owed a share of Hudgens's advances, royalties and merchandising revenue in exchange for his management services. Vieira accuses Hudgens of abandoning her talent team as soon as she became a commercial name. In early May 2009, the case was settled.|$|E
2500|$|The {{peace that}} was {{brokered}} in the Treaty of Shimonoseki was breached by the Boxer Rebellion, {{which led to}} the conclusion of the Boxer Protocol of 1901 (Peace Agreement between the Great Powers and China), and China, not by the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Treaty of Shimonoseki was a dispositive treaty, therefore it is not <b>voidable</b> or nullifiable (this doctrine being that treaties specifying particular actions which can be completed, once the action gets completed, cannot be voided or reversed without a new treaty specifically reversing that clause). Hence, the unequal treaty doctrine cannot be applied to this treaty. By way of comparison, as 200,000,000 Kuping taels were not returned to China from Japan, and Korea had not become a Chinese-dependent country again, the cession in the treaty was executed and cannot be nullified. The disposition of Formosa and the Pescadores in this treaty was a legitimate cession by conquest, confirmed by treaty, and thus is not a theft, as described as [...] "all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese" [...] in Cairo Declaration.|$|E
2500|$|The third action, {{which has}} {{operated}} since the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571, is that transactions entered into by a bankrupt are <b>voidable</b> {{if they would}} result in assets otherwise available to creditors becoming unduly depleted or particular creditors becoming unjustly enriched. Initially transactions made only {{with the intention of}} depriving creditors of assets, or perverting the priorities for order of distribution were vulnerable, while the modern approach of the Insolvency Act 1986 contains more provisions that unwind transactions simply because their effect is deprivation of assets available to creditors. Reminiscent of the 1571 Act, under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 423, a company may recover assets if they were paid away for [...] "significantly less than the value" [...] of the thing, and this was done [...] "for the purpose of" [...] prejudicing other creditors' interests. In Arbuthnot Leasing International Ltd v Havelet Leasing Ltd (No 2) Scott J held that the motive of the company or its directors was irrelevant, so that even though Havelet Leasing Ltd's lawyers had advised (quite wrongly) that their scheme of starting another company and transferring assets to it would be lawful, because the scheme's purpose was to put the assets out of other creditors' reach it breached section 423.|$|E
2500|$|A pecuniary or {{proprietary}} interest can arise in two ways. First, the decision-maker {{may have an}} interest of this nature {{in one of the}} parties involved in a matter. Secondly, the decision-maker may have a pecuniary or {{proprietary interest}} in the outcome of the decision placed before him or her. The two situations are not mutually exclusive – in a 1999 decision, the Court of Appeal of Victoria held {{that it is not a}} judge's mere shareholding in a party [...] "but rather it is the potential interest, created by that shareholding, in the subject matter or outcome of the litigation which is the disqualifying factor". A seminal case in this respect is Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852). In that case the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, was found to have an interest as a shareholder in a company which was a party to a suit presented to him. As this fact was discovered after his Lordship had heard the suit, he was disqualified on the ground of his interest and the decree he issued was held to be <b>voidable.</b> The House of Lords said that it is [...] "a settled principle of constitutional law that a man cannot be judge in his own cause". In Alkaff, the Straits Settlements Court of Appeal recognized that a financial interest may affect a person with bias.|$|E
