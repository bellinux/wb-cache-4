25|$|ECoG is a <b>very</b> <b>promising</b> {{intermediate}} BCI modality {{because it}} has higher spatial resolution, better signal-to-noise ratio, wider frequency range, and less training requirements than scalp-recorded EEG, {{and at the same}} time has lower technical difficulty, lower clinical risk, and probably superior long-term stability than intracortical single-neuron recording. This feature profile and recent evidence of the high level of control with minimal training requirements shows potential for real world application for people with motor disabilities.|$|E

40|$|Reliable GPS {{positioning}} in city {{environment is}} a key issue: actually, signals are prone to multipath, with poor satellite geometry in many streets. Using a 3 D urban model to forecast satellite visibility in urban contexts {{in order to improve}} GPS localization is the main topic of the present article. A virtual image processing that detects and eliminates possible faulty measurements is the core of this method. This image is generated using the position estimated a priori by the navigation process itself, under road constraints. This position is then updated by measurements to line-of-sight satellites only. This closed-loop real-time processing has shown <b>very</b> first <b>promising</b> full-scale test results...|$|R

This programme aims to make the process of clinical trials quicker and easier within the UK. TAP links 13 treatment centres coordinated by a central hub in Birmingham to set up more clinical trials in blood cancer. Because of this geographical spread, it means 20 million people in the UK could have access to the <b>very</b> latest <b>promising</b> blood cancer treatments, if they needed it. Until 2015, 16 new clinical trials have either been opened or approved thanks to TAP.|$|R

25|$|Of the {{diseases}} {{that have been}} identified as potential biological control agents, the fungal pathogen Myrothecium verrucaria {{has been shown to be}} <b>very</b> <b>promising.</b> Disease development is very high at around 30 to 40 degrees Celsius which matches field conditions. In addition, the fungus does not spread outside of areas where it is applied. However, one major drawback of this biological control agent is that it is highly toxic to mammals so extreme care would have to be taken in handling this organism. Other pathogens have been tested as potential biological control agents but have proven to be ineffective.|$|E

25|$|Trichothecenes – sourced from Cephalosporium, Fusarium, Myrothecium, Stachybotrys and Trichoderma.

Four trichothecenes, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON) {{have been most}} commonly encountered by humans and animals. The consequences of oral intake of, or dermal exposure to, the toxins will result in Alimentary toxic aleukia, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia and/or skin irritation. In 1993, the FDA issued a document for the content limits of DON in food and animal feed at an advisory level.

In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of Rent's script. When Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its <b>very</b> <b>promising</b> material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.|$|E
