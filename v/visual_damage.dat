5000|$|FS2000 (7.0) was {{released}} {{as a major}} improvement over the previous versions, and was also offered in two versions; one version for [...] "normal" [...] users, and one [...] "pro" [...] version with additional aircraft. Although many users had high expectations when this version arrived, many were disappointed {{when they found out}} that the simulator demanded high-end hardware; the minimum requirements were only a Pentium 166 MHz computer, although 400 - 500 MHz computer was deemed necessary to have an even framerate. However, even on a high-end system, stuttering framerate was a problem, especially when performing sharp turns in graphically dense areas. Also, the <b>visual</b> <b>damage</b> effects introduced in FS5.0 were disabled, and continued to be unavailable in versions after FS2000.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the intensity of}} oxidative molecular damage and its clinical correlations: <b>visual</b> field <b>damage,</b> intraocular pressure, age, and disease duration. METHODS: DNA was extracted from human trabecular meshwork specimens collected from 17 glaucoma-affected patients using standard filtration surgery. Twenty-one specimens from healthy eyes collected for cornea transplants serve as controls. Oxidative DNA damage was evaluated by determining 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine levels. All patients underwent a Humphrey 30 - 2 visual field examination and diurnal tonometry before surgery. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD DNA oxidative damage was 8. 51 +/- 5. 44 and 1. 75 +/- 1. 80 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine molecules/ 10 (5) normal nucleotides in patients with glaucoma and controls, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was found among human trabecular meshwork DNA oxidative <b>damage,</b> <b>visual</b> field <b>damage,</b> and intraocular pressure. No other statistically significant correlations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress may represent an important pathogenetic step in primary open-angle glaucoma because it could induce human trabecular meshwork degeneration, favoring an intraocular pressure increase, thus priming the glaucoma pathogenetic cascade...|$|R

40|$|This degree {{project was}} carried out at Tetra Pak Research &amp;amp; Development AB in Lund, a unit within Tetra Pak with 250 employees. Tetra Pak develops, {{produces}} and markets complete processing, packaging and distribution systems within the food sector. Tetra Pak Research &amp;amp; Development AB is a unit that supports all business areas within Tetra Pak. In 2003, the unit started {{the development of a}} new package with specific characteristics. The package is a 1000 ml aseptic package, which packs milk for long shelf life. It is called PLDP – Package for Liquid Dairy Product. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate different measuring instruments and test methods concerning appearance aspects of the PLDP at Tetra Pak Research &amp;amp; Development AB. Furthermore, the purpose is to give recommendations on what actions need to be taken to work efficiently with the area of package appearance. To attain the purpose a case study with values, methodologies and tools from the Total Quality Management system was conducted. A range of operations was made to gain an understanding of the PLDP project and its connections to appearance aspects of the package. For instance, a careful mapping of the current way of working with appearance at Tetra Pak Research & Development AB was made. Moreover, a suggestion of an improved partition of the appearance of PLDP was made. This was the starting-point for the identification and prioritisation of practicable features for this study to continue with. Also it facilitated the evaluation regarding measuring instruments and test methods, by viewing the partition in a new and organised way. The features evaluated in this study are Bulging and <b>Visual</b> <b>Damages.</b> In addition, several interviews with strategically selected employees within Tetra Pak were conducted. These interviews formed a basis for defining the conception of Package Appearance, which the area is called. The definition of Package Appearance was crucial to help the author to keep the red thread throughout the entire study. The evaluation of Bulging and <b>Visual</b> <b>Damages</b> was made in different ways. First, available instruments to measure Bulging of the PLDP were listed. Two instruments were decided to go through a further investigation by means of a Measurement System Analysis (Gauge R&R). Such an analysis determines whether variation comes from the packages being measured, differences in operator measurements or the measuring instrument. The results show that a higher precision and a faster measuring procedure, almost without any influence of different operators can be obtained with a laser instrument. The second instrument to be analysed in a Measurement System Analysis was a calliper. According to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), this instrument was not a proper measuring instrument for this purpose. However, a laser instrument and a calliper are associated with different costs and these need to be taken into account in an investment situation. The second feature, <b>Visual</b> <b>Damages,</b> was investigated by first determining which sub features to include in this feature. These sub features formed the input in the conduction of a test method consisting of photo references to compare with the actual defects of the packages. To reduce misconceptions when testing different features of a package, the author suggests working in accordance with such a method which puts references together of what is right and what is wrong among machine operators, laboratory personnel and project leader.

50|$|Soulcalibur IV {{features}} an all-new Critical Finish system. Next to a player's health meter is a colored gem: the Soul Gauge. The gem changes color when the player blocks an attack or has {{his or her}} own attack blocked by a Guard Impact. The color gradually changes from blue to green, then to red and eventually flashing red. The player's own Soul Gauge regenerates if he or she makes an attack and hits the opponent, guarding or otherwise. If the character manages to empty out the opponent's Soul Gauge, the enemy is destroying a piece of armor (characters now show permanent signs of <b>visual</b> <b>damage</b> such as broken and torn clothing) and producing a short stun during which the character can perform a powerful Critical Finish move, which is able to defeat the opponent instantly, by pressing all four face buttons at the same time.

40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between endothelial dysfunction, endothelin 1 (ET- 1) plasma levels and subclinical inflammation in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Main methodsWe enrolled 40 POAG patients with progressive <b>visual</b> field <b>damage,</b> although well controlled intraocular pressure (IOP) and compared to age and sex matched healthxy subjects. Each patient underwent an ophthalmological examination, a standard achromatic perimetry (SAP), blood sampling to assess ET- 1 plasma levels, an objective assessment of cellularity within the anterior chamber (FLARE) and measurement of flow mediated dilation (FMD) with high resolution 2 -dimensional ultrasonographic imaging of the brachial artery. Key findingsAt baseline, POAG patients, compared to healthy controls, showed an increase of ET- 1 plasma levels: 2. 83 ± 0. 28 pg/ml vs. 1. 75 ± 0. 25 pg/ml (p 0. 001). SignificanceThe increase of ET- 1 in POAG patients is related to vascular dysfunction (r= 0. 942; p= 0. 001) and vascular dysfunction is related to sub-clinical intraocular inflammation (r= 0. 968; p= 0. 001).
