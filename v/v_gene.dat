40|$|Tumor-specific markers are {{important}} in identifying and tracking malignant cells. In this regard, functionally rearranged immunoglobulin variable (<b>V)</b> region <b>genes</b> in B-cell tumors fulfill and extend these criteria. <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> provide signature motifs in tumor cells and can delineate critical features of the clonal history of the cell of origin. They also define a tumor-specific antigen, which can be targeted for immunotherapy. Our {{focus has been on}} using novel DNA fusion vaccines to induce antitumor immunity. Here, we describe in detail the methods for identifying tumor-derived <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> at the nucleotide level in the malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma.

40|$|The variable-region (<b>V)</b> <b>genes</b> of the murine T-cell {{receptor}} {{beta chain}} exist largely as single-element subfamilies. The V beta 5 and <b>V</b> beta 8 <b>genes</b> {{belong to the}} only two known three-member V beta subfamilies. We present studies on the linkage of these six genes and show that the genomic organization is that of alternating V beta 5 and <b>V</b> beta 8 <b>genes.</b> Our analysis suggests that these genes were tandemly duplicated, the unit of duplication being a pair of V beta 5 and <b>V</b> beta 8 <b>genes.</b> This tandem organization permits transcripts to initiate from the promoter of an unrearranged V beta located upstream of the rearranged <b>V</b> beta <b>gene.</b> These transcripts can generate functional beta-chain gene messages by novel RNA splicing of the upstream leader exon to the V beta coding exon of the downstream rearranged gene. We extend {{the analysis of the}} T-cell receptor genomic organization to include 12 <b>V</b> beta <b>genes</b> and suggest that all <b>V</b> beta <b>genes</b> are closely linked on chromosome 6.

40|$|In {{the fungus}} Podospora anserina, the {{interaction}} between the nonallelic incompatible R and <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> has two consequences: a lytic reaction due to the synthesis of specific proteolytic enzymes, and a quenching in protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis.

The cessation in ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis was investigated in heterokaryotic strains carrying the antagonistic R and <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> and their “neutral” r and v alleles. Asymmetry between R and <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> {{lies in the fact that}} the strains homozygous for the R genes are the only strains that cannot grow.

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the work of our group on the human and mouse {{immunoglobulin}} genes are reviewed. The human locus contains a large duplication: a 600 kb C-proximal copy with 40 <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> is found in the close vicinity of a 440 kb C-distal copy with 36 very similar, but not identical, <b>V</b> <b>genes.</b> The chimpanzee has only the C-proximal copy of the locus. The locus of the mouse is close to 3. 2 Mb in size, of which 3. 1 Mb have been cloned in four contigs, leaving three small gaps of together about 90 kb; 140 <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> and pseudogenes were localized and sequenced. In paral-lel to the elucidation {{of the structure of the}} loci, the mechanisms of the V-J rearrangement, somatic hy-permutation and gene expression were studied. Various polymorphisms were detected in the human population and a number of haplotypes defined. In addition to the <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> within the loci numerous V orphons were localized on different chromosomes. Comparing the loci of different species allows some interesting conclusions as to the evolution of this multigene family. Finally our strategy of elucidating the structure and function of the loci, which has been termed a ‘cottage industry approach’, is discussed in relation to the large-scale genome analysis as pur-sued today using automated methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{content and}} {{organization}} of the Xenopus tropicalis TCRa/d locus was determined. This locus is highly conserved among tetrapods, with the genes encoding the TCRd chains embedded with those encoding TCRa. However, the frog TCRa/d is unusual in that it contains <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> that appear indistinguishable {{from those in the}} IgH locus (VH). These <b>V</b> <b>genes,</b> termed VHd, make up 70 % of the <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> at the TCRd locus and are expressed exclusively in TCRd chains. Finding TCRd chains that use antibody-like V domains in frogs is similar to the situation in shark TCRd variants and TCRl in marsupials. These results suggest that such unconventional TCR may be more widespread across vertebrate linea-ges than originally thought and raise the possibility of previously unrealized subsets of T cells. We also revealed close linkage of TCRa/d, IgH, and Igk in Xenopus which, in combi-nation with linkage analyses in other species, is consistent with the previous models for the emergence of these antigen receptor loci...|$|R
40|$|Variable (<b>V)</b> 1 <b>genes</b> {{code for}} the {{variable}} polypeptide sequence of immunoglobulin molecules. Available {{evidence indicates that}} there are three pools of <b>V</b> <b>genes,</b> one shared by all kappa chain subtypes, another by lambda chain subtypes, and the third by all heavy chain classes and subclasses. In the case of kappa and lambda <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> the evidence is mainly sequence data of myeloma proteins whereas several additional pieces of evidence suggest that all heavy chains share a common pool of variable polypeptide sequences. The structural genes for these sequences are called VH <b>genes.</b> <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> of the rabbit and the mouse have been defined on Mendelian terms. In the rabbit the a-locus allotypes, a a Z, and a,, have helped in gaining the important information that V and constant (C) genes of the heavy chain remain close but not absolute linkage (1). Meiotic recombinations occur at a frequency of approximately 0. 3 % (2, 3). Different Mendelian markers of <b>V</b> H <b>genes</b> have been observed in the mouse.

In the {{aftermath}} of the consecration of <b>V.</b> <b>Gene</b> Robinson in 2003, Guernsey's parish left the Episcopal Church and became affiliated with the Anglican Church of Uganda. The choice of Uganda was in part because the Anglican Church there ordains women to the priesthood, unlike some other African Anglican provinces.

5000|$|Each {{heavy chain}} and light chain gene {{contains}} multiple copies {{of three different}} types of gene segments for the variable regions of the antibody proteins. For example, the human immunoglobulin heavy chain region contains 2 Constant (Cμ and Cδ) gene segments and 44 Variable (<b>V)</b> <b>gene</b> segments, plus 27 Diversity (D) gene segments and 6 Joining (J) gene segments. [...] The light chains also possess 2 Constant (Cμ and Cδ) gene segments and numerous V and J gene segments, but do not have D gene segments. DNA rearrangement causes one copy of each type of gene segment to go in any given lymphocyte, generating an enormous antibody repertoire; roughly 3×1011 combinations are possible, although some are removed due to self reactivity.|$|E
40|$|Structures {{resembling}} germinal {{centers are}} seen in the salivary glands of patients with Sjögren's syndrome, {{but it is not}} known whether the microenvironment of these cell clusters is sufficient for the induction of a germinal center response. Therefore, we cloned and sequenced rearranged Ig <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> expressed by B cells isolated from sections of labial salivary gland biopsies from two Sjögren's syndrome patients. Rearranged <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> from B cells within one cell cluster were polyclonal and most had few somatic mutations. Two adjacent clusters from another patient each contained one dominant B cell clone expressing hypermutated <b>V</b> <b>genes.</b> None of the rearranged <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> was found in both clusters, suggesting that cells are unable to migrate out into the surrounding tissue and seed new clusters. The ratios of replacement to silent mutations in the framework and complementarity determining regions suggest antigen selection of high-affinity mutants. These results show that an antigen-driven, germinal center-type B cell response is taking place within the salivary glands of Sjögren's syndrome patients. In view of the recent demonstration of a germinal center response within the rheumatoid synovial membrane and the existence of similar structures in the target tissues of other autoimmune diseases, we propose that germinal center- type responses can be induced in the nonlymphoid target tissues of a variety of autoimmune diseases...|$|R
40|$|Complementary {{negative}} and positive genetic selections based on the activity of a plasmid-encoded bacteriophage f 1 <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> are developed. The negative selection {{is based on an}} activity of the <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> protein in E. coli cells which markedly reduces the infection of those cells by f 1 -related viruses. In order to select against cells expressing active <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> protein, the cells are infected with the p'age R 386, a derivative of f 1 which confers resistance to chloramphenicol, and are plated {{in the presence of the}} antibiotic. Those cells which contain <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> protein are infrequently infected with the virus and are unable to grow in the presence of chloramphenicol; those which do not contain the <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> protein are readily infected and can grow in the presence of the antibiotic. The positive genetic selection consists of excising the <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> sequences from the plasmids and using them to replace the <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> of a bacteriophage f 1 derivative containing an amber mutation in <b>gene</b> <b>V.</b> Only those <b>genes</b> which encode an active <b>gene</b> <b>V</b> protein can support phage growth and yield plaques.

50|$|In the {{developing}} B cell, the first recombination event to occur is between one D and one J gene {{segment of the}} heavy chain locus. Any DNA between these two gene segments is deleted. This D-J recombination {{is followed by the}} joining of one <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> segment, from a region upstream of the newly formed DJ complex, forming a rearranged VDJ gene segment. All other gene segments between V and D segments are now deleted from the cell’s genome. Primary transcript (unspliced RNA) is generated containing the VDJ region of the heavy chain and both the constant mu and delta chains (Cμ and Cδ). (i.e. the primary transcript contains the segments: V-D-J-Cμ-Cδ). The primary RNA is processed to add a polyadenylated (poly-A) tail after the Cμ chain and to remove sequence between the VDJ segment and this constant gene segment. Translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the Ig μ heavy chain protein.|$|E

40|$|The {{chromosome}} breakpoints of a translocation, t(2; 14), from an Epstein- Barr virus-transformed human B lymphoblastoid {{cell line}} were isolated and analyzed. This unusual translocation arose {{as a result}} of the fusion of two immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (<b>V)</b> <b>genes,</b> one from the heavy chain cluster on chromosome 14, the other from the light chain (k) cluster on chromosome 2. The chromosome breaks occurred within the coding sequence of each gene, and there was no obvious evidence for lymphoid V(D) J recombinase involvement in the translocation. This suggests that breakage and rejoining of the involved <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> occurred by some process other than that which normally rearranges Ig genes...|$|R
40|$|Beyond the morphological, immunophenotypic, {{and genetic}} {{information}} {{used for the}} diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies, molecular analyses have deepened our insights into the development of B-cell lymphomas. We have learned that B-cell tumors can be grouped according to the mutational status of their immunoglobulin variable (<b>V)</b> region <b>genes,</b> and this has become an important prognostic tool in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The analysis of <b>V</b> <b>genes</b> also has allowed us to more precisely place B-cell lymphomas relative to their normal B-cell counterparts and to the germinal center where somatic hypermutation takes place.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} <b>V.</b> <b>gene</b> family {{expression}} in the primary B cell repertoire of the mouse is strain dependent. In C 57 B 1 / 6 mice, the V.

J 558 is lower than 35 %, while {{the sum of the}} other three families reaches 25 %. To assess which genetic loci control strain-specific <b>V.</b> <b>gene</b> family expression, we studied <b>V.</b> <b>gene</b> family usage in splenic B cell repertoires of different congenic strains of mice. Changes in major histocompatibility complex or immunoglobulin (Ig) K light chain genes did not modify <b>V.</b> <b>gene</b> family expression in adult mice. Differences at the IgH locus, however, modified <b>V.</b> <b>gene</b> family usage. In 1 -d-old mice, the strain-specific <b>V.</b> <b>gene</b> family expression pattern is determined by the IgH haplotype. In adult mice, the <b>V.</b> <b>gene</b> family expression pattern of resting B cells is independent of the IgH locus and follows the genetic background of the congenic strain, while it is determined by the IgH haplotype among Ig-secreting spleen cells.

Examination of circular DNA revealed that a heptamer-related sequence (TACTGTG) within the coding region of VDJ was joined to the recombination signal sequence (RSS) of a germline VH segment. This provides direct evidence for a intramolecular DNA deletion mechanism for <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> replacement. In the pre-B cell line {{as well as in}} in vivo lymphocytes, unusual circular DNAs were found which were structurally similar to the <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> replacement circles.

40|$|We {{examine the}} rules {{governing}} Ti beta variable (<b>V)</b> <b>gene</b> segment usage {{in the formation of}} T cell antigen-MHC receptors in diverse regulatory and effector T lymphoid subpopulations. To this end, a single Ti beta <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> family and its products were analyzed. A monoclonal antibody, termed anti-Ti 3 A, which was shown to be reactive with an epitope encoded by members of the REX cell line Ti beta <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> family, and which was expressed on 2 % of human T lymphocytes was used in selection of clones from unprimed peripheral T lymphocytes. Both T 4 +, as well as T 8 + T cell clones with inducer, suppressor, and/or cytotoxic function were defined. Southern analysis, isoelectric focusing and two- dimensional peptide mapping indicated that individual members of the REX <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> family were linked to different Ti beta diversity and/or joining and constant region segments. Moreover, the Ti alpha chains of such clones were distinct. These results imply that Ti beta <b>V</b> <b>gene</b> usage is not restricted to any functionally or phenotypically defined T cell subsets, and there is presumably little, if any, restriction on the mechanisms that generate combinational, junctional or chain association-mediated diversity...|$|E

40|$|Southern blot hybridizations {{with human}} T cell {{receptor}} <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> probes {{were used to}} determine the sizes of the various <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> subfamilies. An analysis of DNA samples from 100 unrelated individuals identified a single individual who lacked one <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> segment. A second individual had an apparently different repertoire of <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> segments in one subfamily, as assayed by hybridization, possibly due to a gene conversion event. An analysis with four restriction enzymes of DNA from 30 consanguineous donors detected restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with 12 of 14 <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> segment subfamilies examined. In an analysis of DNAs from a large panel of unrelated individuals, some alleles at these loci were found to be in linkage disequilibrium, indicating a potentially close physical linkage. The segregation of three polymorphisms, two associated with <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> segment loci and one associated with the C beta genes, was compatible with Mendelian inheritance, and demonstrated that highly informative haplotypes could be generated. The high degree of polymorphism observed in the human T cell receptor beta chain complex should allow exploration of possible associations between T cell receptor genes and inherited diseases involving the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{experimental}} autoimmune encephalomyelitis {{as a model}} for multiple sclerosis (MS) have demonstrated limited heterogeneity in T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) specific for myelin basic protein (MBP). To investigate restricted beta-chain variable-region (<b>V</b> beta) <b>gene</b> usage in humans, we analyzed TCR gene rearrangements in two lines and 34 MBP-specific T-cell clones that were isolated from five MS patients and two healthy subjects. The T cells were characterized for their specificity to MBP epitopes and HLA-restricting molecules. We demonstrate here that MBP-specific T-cell clones from these different MS patients and healthy individuals, in contrast to T cells from rodents, display a more diverse <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> usage as evidenced by their TCR <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> rearrangements. However, the different MBP-specific T-cell clones isolated from each individual MS patient showed a common <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> usage, suggesting individual-specific TCR restriction. Out of 16 MBP-specific clones derived from a single MS patient, 12 clones (75 %) utilized the <b>V</b> beta 15 <b>gene</b> for their TCR gene rearrangement. MBP-specific clones isolated from four other MS patients also showed a consistent tendency for a predominant, but different, TCR <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> rearrangement. These results suggest a TCR heterogeneity among MBP-specific T-cell clones from different individuals but a limited TCR <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> usage among MBP-specific T-cell clones of the same individual. The predominant <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> used by the MBP-specific T-cell clones studied here was not found to correlate with the epitope specificity of T cells or with their restricting HLA molecule. These findings may support the possibility of intervention with monoclonal antibodies to specific <b>V</b> beta <b>gene</b> products as an approach to immune therapy of MS but also imply the necessity for an individual-specific immunotherapeutic approach...|$|R
