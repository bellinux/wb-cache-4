40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1977 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaNASA {{conducted}} a Pilot Project during 1975 and 1976 {{to determine the}} extent that teleconferencing could replace travel to meetings. The network consists of approximately 34 <b>teleconference</b> <b>rooms</b> and 50 fast facsimile machines, all interconnected on private lines to a master switchboard in Huntsville, Alabama. In addition, portable conference telephones augmented the voice network, and experimental <b>video</b> <b>teleconferences</b> were tried. Evaluations show that the teleconferences "saved" travel costs approximating 21 % of the travel budget at a communications cost of 3 % of this budget. The unused travel funds were diverted into travel other than to management meetings, and consequently, coordination may have improved. This paper discusses the operation of the Pilot Project, which has matured into an operational teleconference network. This experience may be of value to other organizations wishing to adopt teleconferencing...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} current interoperability {{issues that}} exist with <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> {{systems in the}} Department of Defense (DoD). Recent advances in video compression {{and the creation of}} a high speed digital communications infrastructure have caused a proliferation of <b>video</b> <b>teleconference</b> networks and systems throughout the DoD. The current array of <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> systems within the DoD is followed by a discussion interoperability problems. This information medium has not fully reached its potential due in part to interoperability issues such as dissimilar compression algorithms, incompatible transmission speeds and carriers, and transmission security equipment. This is followed by a detailed analysis of standard which are currently making positive impacts these interoperability problems. Finally, a migration strategy is recommended that is designed to overcome many of the interoperability issues presented. Additionally, transmission security and future growth issues are explored and their applicability to <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing.</b> NANAU. S. Army (USA) author...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} system and {{techniques}} for synthesizing views for many-to-many <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing.</b> Instead of replicating oneto -one systems for {{each pair of}} users, or performing complex 3 D scene acquisition, we rely upon user tolerance for soft discontinuities for our rendering techniques. Furthermore, we observed that the participants' eyes usually remain at a constant height (sitting height) during <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing,</b> thus we only {{need to be able}} to synthesize new views on a horizontal plane. We demonstrate a real-time system that uses a linear array of cameras to perform Light Field style rendering. The simplicity and robustness of Light Fielding rendering, combined with the natural restrictions of limited view volume in <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing,</b> allow us to synthesize photo-realistic views for a group of participants at interactive rate.

40|$|Background: The {{shortage}} of medical providers {{in rural areas}} {{is one of the}} greatest barriers to accessing healthcare in the United States. Mental healthcare providers are especially limited in numbers and availability in rural areas. Although all individuals living rurally have challenges with receiving care, one group that demonstrates an exceptional deficiency with access to care is veterans. The numbers of veterans living rurally are significantly higher than vets living close to urban or suburban centers of care. Considering the shortages of mental health providers, alternatives to traditional in-person therapy are needed in order to adequately address the needs of rurally located veterans. Recently, psychotherapy via <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> has been suggested as a way of reaching a greater number of veterans. But is this approach equivalent to in-person therapy in the treatment of PTSD? Methods: An exhaustive search was conducted using Medline-OVID, CINAHL, and Google Scholar using the keywords: mental health, veterans, rural, and telemedicine. Relevant articles were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: Three studies met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. The first study, Frueh et al, is a randomized controlled study (RCT) to compare the efficacy of psychotherapy delivered via <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> or in-person therapy for combat-related PTSD. This study showed a comparable treatment effect and patient satisfaction between the two different methods. The second study, Morland et al, is a non-inferiority-designed RCT comparing anger management therapy delivered either by <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> or same-room therapy to veterans with PTSD. This study demonstrated similar satisfaction in both groups and an improvement in both anger and PTSD symptoms in the <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> group. The third study, Ziemba et al, is a two-arm RCT with either active-duty or veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom comparing psychotherapy administered via <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> or in-person. This study indicated equivalence between the two types of therapies. Conclusion: Psychotherapy administered to veterans with PTSD living in rural areas via <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> has been shown to be equivalent to traditional in-person therapy. Multiple studies show promise for a broader application of psychotherapy via <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing</b> to help with the {{shortage of}} mental health providers in rural areas; however, further studies are needed to investigate the extent to which telemedicine can be used effectively.

40|$|We {{present a}} system and {{techniques}} for synthesizing views for three-dimensional <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing.</b> Instead of performing complex 3 D scene acquisition, {{we decided to}} trade storage/hardware for computation, i. e., using more cameras. While it is expensive to directly capture a scene from all possible viewpoints, we observed that the participantsâ€™ viewpoints usually remain at a constant height (eye level) during <b>video</b> <b>teleconferencing.</b> Therefore we can restrict the possible viewpoint to be within a virtual plane without sacrificing much of the realism. Doing so significantly reduces the number of cameras required. We demonstrate a realtime system that uses a linear array of cameras to perform Light-Field style rendering.
