40|$|We {{interpret}} Minkowski {{black holes}} as world-sheet spikes which are related by world-sheet duality to vortices {{that correspond to}} Euclidean black holes. These world-sheet defects induce defects in the gauge fields of the corresponding coset Wess-Zumino descriptions of spherically-symmetric black holes. The low-temperature target space-time foam is a Minkowski black hole (spike) plasma with confined Euclidean black holes (vortices). The high-temperature phase is a dense <b>vortex</b> <b>plasma</b> described by a topological gauge field theory on the world-sheet, which possesses enhanced symmetry as in the target space-time singularity {{at the core of}} a black hole.

40|$|Electric {{field control}} of {{magnetic}} structures, particularly topological defects in magnetoelectric materials, draws a great attention in recent years, {{which has led}} to experimental success in creation and manipulation by electric field of single magnetic defects, such as domain walls and skyrmions. In this work we explore a scenario of electric field creation of another type of topological defects [...] magnetic vortices and antivortices, which are characteristic for materials with easy plane (XY) symmetry. Each magnetic (anti) vortex in magnetoelectric materials (such as type-II multiferroics) possesses a quantized magnetic and an electric charge, where the former is responsible for interaction between vortices and the latter couples the vortices to electric field. This property of magnetic vortices opens a peculiar possibility of creation of magnetic <b>vortex</b> <b>plasma</b> by non-uniform electric fields. We show that the electric field, created by a cantilever tip, produces a "magnetic atom" with a localized spatially ordered spot of vortices ("nucleus" of the atom) surrounded by antivortices ("electronic shells"). We analytically find the vortex density distribution profile and temperature dependence of polarizability of this structure and confirm it numerically. We show that electric polarizability of the "magnetic atom" depends on temperature as α∼ 1 /T^ 1 -η (η> 0), which is consistent with Euclidean random matrix theory prediction.

40|$|We {{consider}} a magnetic configuration consisting of an arcade structure and a detached plasmoid, {{resulting from a}} magnetic reconnection process, as is typically found in connection with solar flares. We study spontaneous current fragmentation caused by shear and <b>vortex</b> <b>plasma</b> flows. An exact analytical transformation method was applied to calculate self-consistent solutions of the nonlinear stationary MHD equations. The assumption of incompressible field-aligned flows implies that both the Alfven Mach number and the mass density are constant on field lines. We first calculated nonlinear MHS equilibria {{with the help of}} the Liouville method, emulating the scenario of a solar eruptive flare configuration with plasmoids and flare arcade. Then a Mach number profile was constructed that describes the upflow along the open magnetic field lines and implements a vortex flow inside the plasmoid. This Mach number profile was used to map the MHS equilibrium to the stationary one. We find that current fragmentation takes place at different locations within our configuration. Steep gradients of the Alfven Mach number are required, implying the strong influence of shear flows on current amplification and filamentation of the MHS current sheets. Crescent- or ring-like structures appear along the outer separatrix, butterfly structures between the upper and lower plasmoids, and strong current peaks close the lower boundary. Impressing an intrinsic small-scale structure on the upper plasmoid results in strong fragmentation of the plasmoid. Hence fragmentation of current sheets and plasmoids is an inherent property of MHD theory. Transformations from MHS into MHD steady-states deliver fine-structures needed for plasma heating and acceleration of particles and bulk plasma flows in dissipative events that are typically connected to magnetic reconnection processes in flares and coronal mass ejections.

The vortex {{is associated with}} a sudden brightening of the arc and corresponds to an ionospheric region of diverging horizontal electric fields, which is equivalent to a downward field-aligned current (FAC), i. e., the closure current for the upward current above the arc. This event has been revisited because of the subsequent availability of data from the Scandinavian Magnetometer Array. These data, combined with STARE electric fields, have been used to determine the real ionospheric conductance distribution throughout the field of view. As a result, a more realistic, quantitative picture of the current system associated with the arc is obtained than was possible in an earlier model based on an assumed constant conductance.
