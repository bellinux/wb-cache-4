40|$|Abstract. A module {{is called}} small {{if it is}} a small {{submodule}} of its injective hull. Özcan and Harmanci showed that every left R-module over a QF ring R can be decomposed into a direct sum of an X- and an X ∗-module, where X denotes the class of modules that does not contain any small module and X ∗ denotes the class of modules such that every subfactor of them contains a small module. They raised the question if any ring with that property is already QF. In this note we first remark that (X ∗, X) is a hereditary torsion theory G ∗. Then we discuss when G ∗ is splitting, that is every module is a direct sum of a torsion and a torsionfree module. We show that this happens for the following classes of rings: left <b>V-rings,</b> local rings, commutative semiperfect rings, semilocal left Kasch rings and direct products of commutative proper integral domains. In particular we show that for any semilocal ring R: G ∗ is (left) splitting if and only if R cogenerates all injective simple left R-modules. Moreover we give a list of examples showing that rings with G ∗ splitting can be far from being QF...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} Rickart modules was defined recently. It {{has been shown}} that a direct sum of Rickart modules is not a Rickart module, in general. In this paper we {{investigate}} the question: When are the direct sums of Rickart modules, also Rickart? We show that if Mi is Mj-injective for all i<j∈I={ 1, 2,…,n} then ⊕i= 1 nMi is a Rickart module if and only if Mi is Mj-Rickart for all i,j∈I. As a consequence we obtain that for a nonsingular extending module M, E(M) ⊕M is always a Rickart module. Other characterizations for direct sums to be Rickart under certain assumptions are provided. We also investigate when certain classes of free modules over a ring R, are Rickart. It is shown that every finitely generated free R-module is Rickart precisely when R is a right semihereditary ring. As an application, we show that a commutative domain R is Prüfer if and only if the free R-module R(2) is Rickart. We exhibit an example of a module M for which M(2) is Rickart but M(3) is not so. Further, von Neumann regular rings are characterized in terms of Rickart modules. It is shown that the class of rings R for which every finitely cogenerated right R-module is Rickart, is precisely that of right <b>V-rings.</b> Examples which delineate the concepts and the results are provided...|$|R

50|$|Flexible {{plate is}} used in {{electric}} motor and generator armatures, field coil insulation, and magnet and commutator core insulation. Mica consumption in flexible plate was about 21 tonnes in 2008 in the US. Heater plate is used where high-temperature insulation is required. Molding plate is sheet mica from which <b>V-rings</b> are cut and stamped for use in insulating the copper segments from the steel shaft ends of a commutator. Molding plate is also fabricated into tubes and rings for insulation in armatures, motor starters, and transformers. Segment plate acts as insulation between the copper commutator segments of direct-current universal motors and generators. Phlogopite built-up mica is preferred because it wears {{at the same rate}} as the copper segments. Although muscovite has a greater resistance to wear, it causes uneven ridges that may interfere with the operation of a motor or generator. Consumption of segment plate was about 149 t in 2008 in the US. Some types of built-up mica have the bonded splittings reinforced with cloth, glass, linen, muslin, plastic, silk, or special paper. These products are very flexible and are produced in wide, continuous sheets that are either shipped, rolled, or cut into ribbons or tapes, or trimmed to specified dimensions. Built-up mica products may also be corrugated or reinforced by multiple layering. In 2008, about 351 t of built-up mica was consumed in the US, mostly for molding plates (19%) and segment plates (42%).|$|R

As special case Michler and Villamayor [7] considered rings over which every simple module is injective. Definition. The ring R is a (right) <b>V-ring</b> if it satisfies the equivalent conditions: (1) - Every simple right R-module is injective. (2) - Mod-R has a semisimple cogenerator. (3) - For every module MR, Rad(M) = 0. (Jacobson radical) (4) Any right ideal is an intersection of maximal right ideals. As {{a consequence of}} (4) : ∀I r R, I 2 = I. Thus if R is a commutative <b>V-ring,</b> {{it has to be}} Von-Neumann regular. In fact If R is commutative, then R is a <b>V-ring</b> iff R is regular. But we cannot drop commutativity: The endomorphism ring of an infinite dimen-sional left vector space is regular but not a right <b>V-ring.</b> Examples.

Osofsky [9]: There exists a Noetherian V domain with infinitely many nonisomor-phic simple modules.

Thus, the above result provides another proof {{for the fact that}} commutative V-rings (i.e, von Neumann regular rings) are Σ-V-ring. Now if R is a right <b>V-ring</b> that is not right Σ-V-ring, see [15, Example, page 60], then there exists a simple right R-module S which is not Σ-injective. This shows that the commutativity condition cannot be dropped in the above proposition.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSemiartinian right V-rings, {{which we}} call right SV-rings, form a special class of Von Neumann regular rings. We {{characterize}} these rings {{by the fact that}} every factor ring imbeds as a subring in a direct product of right full linear rings containing the socle. If R is a semiartinian ring with all primitive factor rings artinian, then the condition of being an SV-ring is right/left symmetrical and is equivalent to being regular. On the other hand, if R is a right and left SV-ring, then all primitive factor rings of R are artinian. For right SV-rings whose proper ideals are prime we show that the condition of being unit-regular is equivalent to being directly finite. On the other hand we show that there exists a directly finite right SV-ring which is not unit-regular. Furthermore we provide two constructions. For any given ordinal ξ, the first one gives a prime, unit-regular right SV-ring of Loewy length ξ + 1, which is not a left <b>V-ring,</b> and is hereditary if ξ is a natural number; the second one gives a directly infinite right SV-ring, not a left <b>V-ring,</b> whose Loewy length is ξ + 2 if ξ is a natural number and is ξ + 1 otherwise. These constructions are general enough to produce a wide supply of SV-rings, starting from given ones...|$|E

We demonstrate that a finitely presented simple module {{is a model of}} a finite type theory precisely when its biendomorphism ring is a model of the dual theory and determine when the biendomorphism ring is a closed point in the Ziegler spectrum. When the ring is a Noetherian <b>V-ring,</b> we establish that the theory of at modules is generated by the biendomorphism rings of simple modules and determine when the ring has (up to elementary equivalence) a unique indecomposable flat module...|$|E

In this paper, properties of modules having the summand intersection property (SIP) and the summand sum prop-erty (SSP) are studied. We study the direct sum of modules, the SIP and the SSP.

40|$|AbstractIf R is a semiartinian von Neumann regular ring, {{then the}} set PrimR of {{primitive}} ideals of R, ordered by inclusion, is an artinian poset {{in which all}} maximal chains have a greatest element. Moreover, if PrimR has no infinite antichains, then the lattice L 2 (R) of all ideals of R is anti-isomorphic to the lattice of all upper subsets of PrimR. Since the assignment U↦rR(U) defines a bijection from any set SimpR of representatives of simple right R-modules to PrimR, a natural partial order is induced in SimpR, under which the maximal elements are precisely those simple right R-modules which are finite dimensional over the respective endomorphism division rings; these are always R-injective. Given any artinian poset I {{with at least two}} elements and having a finite cofinal subset, a lower subset I′⊂I and a field D, we present a construction which produces a semiartinian and unit-regular D-algebra DI having the following features: (a) SimpDI is order isomorphic to I; (b) the assignment H↦SimpDI/H realizes an anti-isomorphism from the lattice L 2 (DI) to the lattice of all upper subsets of SimpDI; (c) a non-maximal element of SimpDI is injective if and only if it corresponds to an element of I′, thus DI is a right <b>V-ring</b> if and only if I′=I; (d) DI is a right and left <b>V-ring</b> if and only if I is an antichain; (e) if I has finite dual Krull length, then DI is (right and left) hereditary; (f) if I is at most countable and I′=∅, then DI is a countably dimensional D-algebra...|$|E
