40|$|Immune {{activation}} is {{a regular}} feature of sepsis, but the incidence {{and nature of the}} ensuing inflammation-resolving and immunosuppressive component is less well understood. In this study, we compared immunoregulatory markers on blood leukocytes from patients with Gram-negative or Gram-positive sepsis or septic shock, and compared this to blood from patients with severe <b>virosis</b> or healthy controls. To this end, blood from 32 patients with sepsis, including ten cases with shock, and 12 patients with severe <b>virosis</b> were analysed by flow cytometry for the expression levels of monocyte HLA-DR, CD 11 c, CD 14 and CD 40, and for frequencies of CD 163 (+) -suppressive monocytes, HLA-DR(+) or CD 40 (+) -activated T cells and Tregs. Plasma cytokine levels were analysed as a functional measurement. Signs of immunosuppression dominated in the septic shock and Gram-positive sepsis groups, whereas monocyte activation was common in Gram-negative sepsis patients without shock. However, the main finding was the large inter-individual variation of immune activation and immunosuppression, with no correlation to prognosis among the shock patients. The pronounced inter-individual variation in the analysed monocyte and lymphocyte markers forms a strong argument that, when immunomodulatory treatment is considered in a sepsis patient, it should be personalised and guided by a detailed immune status assessment...|$|E

It was {{demonstrated that the}} activation of protease is relatively small within 2 or 3 days after infection and becomes much higher in 4 or 5 days. Deoxyribonuclease, however, is activated only {{in the latter half}} of <b>virosis</b> development. The action of these enzymes i n worms was further measured a few hours after treating with inducers and virus. It was established that the activity of protease as well as deoxyribonuclease is augmented by the injection of hydroxylamine, hydrogen peroxide, potassium nitrite, acetoxime, sodium carbonate and polyhedra. 多角体バイラス蛋白の合成は蚕の幼虫体内に於ける核酸の仲介によつて進行するものと想定せられるが,前報記載の如くリボヌクレアーゼの作用力はバイラスの成長に伴い比較的低度の賦活を示したに過ぎなかつた. しかし蚕の組織に於ては多角体結晶が多くの場合細胞核内に形成されることから,バイラス病の発生は先ず染色体乃至病毒粒子の外側をなす蛋白質が活性化された蛋白酵素によつて水解され,次に内部のデオキシリボ核酸がヌクレアーゼにより或程度分解せられた後に増殖することによつて開始されるものと推測せられる. 従つて本報では蚕体内のデオキシリボヌクレアーゼに対し病毒の接種或は誘発試薬の処理が及ぼす影響をプロテアーゼの作用と併行して観察してみた...|$|E

40|$|Aphids are {{the most}} {{important}} vectors of potato viruses during the crop’s growing season. The most widespread and damaging viruses, the potato virus Y and potato leaf roll virus, are transmitted by aphids in non-persistent and persistent manner, respectively. The two viruses cause the greatest concern of potato producers and a great constraint to seed potato production in Serbia, the region and across the world. Potato virus Y is particularly harmful, given its distribution and spreading rate. Seed potato production systems under well-managed conditions involve a series of virus control measures, including the monitoring of outbreaks of winged aphids, their abundance and species composition, in order to forecast <b>virosis,</b> i. e. potential plant and tuber infection periods. Monitoring the aphid vectors of potato viruses enables determination of optimum dates for haulm destruction when higher than normal numbers of winged aphids as vectors of economically harmful diseases have been observed. Haulm destruction in a potato crop reduces the risk of plant infection and virus translocation from the aboveground parts to tubers, thus keeping the proportion of infected tubers within tolerance limits allowed for certain categories of seed potatoes. This practice has positive effects if used in combination with other viral disease control measures; otherwise, it becomes ineffective. This paper provides an integral analysis of the effects and role of monitoring outbreaks of aphids, their abundance and species composition in timing haulm growth termination to prevent plant infection, virus translocation and tuber infestation in potato crops in Serbia and the wider region...|$|E

In Chile, the disease has been reported with over 60 % of prevalence and it demands adecuate diagnostic methods. Curently the official serologic diagnostic test in Chile is the serum neutralization test (SNT), this method detects the presence of antibodies against the BVD virus and it is considered to have good specificity and sensitivity, althought, it presents some disadvantages in its interpretation and in its execution. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to compare de SNT as gold standard, with a commercial immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in terms of specificity and sensitivity in the detection of antibodies against BVD antigens. A set of 500 bovine sera drawn from 50 milk herds from the Xth Region of Chile were analized. The results showed that the SNT detected 278 serum samples as positives and the ELISA detected 347 serum samples as positives, these represents for ELISA test a relative sensitivity and specificity of 91 % and 57 %, respectively. Statistically significant differences of the serodiagnosis obtained in both tests were established through the McNemar test (< 0. 05), and a median concordance between them through the Kappa test. When the SNT titers were related with the optical densities (OD) of ELISA, a positive association was detected between this values. It was concluded that ELISA provides good results in comparison with SNT, having the former a higher number of detections because its dignostic higher sensitivity.

40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) is {{the most}} devastating <b>virosis</b> threatening the shrimp culture industry worldwide. Variations of environmental factors in shrimp culture ponds usually lead to the outbreak of white spot syndrome (WSS). In order to know the molecular mechanisms of WSS outbreak induced by temperature variation and the biological changes of the host at the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, RNA-Seq technology was {{used to analyze the}} differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in shrimp {{with a certain amount of}} WSSV cultured at 18 °C and shrimp whose culture temperature were raised to 25 °C. To analyze whether the expression changes of the DEGs were due to temperature rising or WSSV proliferation, the expression of selected DEGs was analyzed by real-time PCR with another shrimp group, namely Group T, as control. Group T didn't suffer WSSV infection but was subjected to temperature rising in parallel. At the initial stage of WSSV acute infection, DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated, whereas most DEGs related to cell cycle and positive regulation of cell death and were down-regulated. Triose phosphate isomerase, enolase and alcohol dehydrogenase involved in glycosis were up-regulated, while pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme involved in TCA pathway were down-regulated. Also genes involved in host DNA replication, including DNA primase, DNA topoisomerase and DNA polymerase showed down-regulated expression. Several interesting genes including crustin genes, acting binding or inhibiting protein genes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM 9) gene and a GRP 78 gene were also analyzed. Understanding the interactions between hosts and WSSV at the initial stage of acute infection will not only help to get a deep insight into the pathogenesis of WSSV but also provide clues for therapies...|$|E
40|$|Newcastle disease (ND) is {{an acute}} highly {{contagious}} <b>virosis</b> of birds caused by avian paramyxovirus 1. The outbreaks {{of the disease}} may cause serious economic losses. In the current risk profile the pathways of introduction of ND to Estonian domestic bird populations and factors favouring {{the spread of the}} disease are described. The APMV- 1 infection was assumed to be endemic among Estonian wild bird populations (pigeons). The probability of spread of the virus from wild to domestic birds was considered and evaluated. The release assessment has revealed three main scenarios of introduction of NDV to Estonian domestic birds: • Import of NDV infected domestic birds; • Import of NDV contaminated food and food waste; • Entry of a NDV contaminated vehicle. The probability of introduction is very low in case of all these pathways assuming there are no outbreaks of ND in neighbouring countries. Exposure assessment shows that the probability of exposure of a local bird population is very high in case of introduction of NDV by introducing infected domestic birds into poultry farms. The probability of exposure of poultry to a local infected wild bird population is also very high for small holdings, where the birds are kept outside during the summer. The exposure of poultry flocks through indirect contacts to initial outbreaks and the likelihood of the spread of the infection in the poultry population are moderate. The probability of infection is smaller in vaccinated herds, thus the small holdings are more threatened (vaccination is not compulsory). The consequence analysis shows that the NDV outbreak of any scale among poultry would have at least serious economic consequences for Estonia causing an export ban of live birds and products. In case of wider spread of ND the economic consequences would be severe. The adequacy of risk management measures to minimize the likelihood of NDV introduction should be improved where necessary...|$|E

As alterações nucleolares encontradas constam de hipertrofia inicial, a que se seguem profundas alterações em sua estrutura interna, sob a forma de vacuolizações e condensações granulares (os chamados nucleolinos) de número e tamanhos variados. Alguns destes corpúsculos granulares, fortemente basófilos e que apresentam as mesmas características citoquímicas dos nucléolos, são lançados no carioplasma sob a forma de volumosos corpúsculos basófilos esferoidais. São feitos comentários sobre a natureza do fenômeno, concluindo-se que, tratando-se de uma ocorrência somente encontrada nas viroses, em certas formas de intoxicações e em determinados distúrbios genéticos, o seu aparecimento em um quadro histopatológico encefalítico ou mielítico permite, com segurança atribuir sua etiologia a um vírus. De todos os processos estudados, o que apresentou tais alterações nucleolares com maior exuberância foi a panencefalite nodular de PETTE-DORING.

The tables show that only those in close (direct or indirect) contact with patients fell ill. The relation between these two groups of employees is shown on Table 5. Epidemiological analysis shows that the cause of the infection lay neither in the communication or the virus through infected food or water nor in droplet infection.

The genetic potential of sorts and hybrids can be created through the application of modern technologies in order to grow at least 32 - 35 tons/ha of sugar beet roots. In the Republic of Moldova, sugar beet vegetates between 160 and 180 days in the first year and needs approximately an amount of 2400 - 2900 °C, average of 15. 3 - 15. 4 °C. Each phenological phase needs different temperatures: at least 4 C° is necessary for planting and springing an amount of 650 °C is necessary for foliar apparatus; an amount of 1150 - 1800 °C is necessary to grow the volume of roots and for sugar depositing the average of 2400 to 2600 °C is necessary. The mentioned temperatures ensure a normal development of sugar beet plants. If these temperatures fluctuate, the pathogens and pests are stimulated to develop. The most frequent diseases of sugar beet are: Pythium de baryanum Hesse., Aphanomyces cochlioides Dresch. Peronospora schachtii Fuck., Phoma betae Fr. Cercospora beticola Sacc.

40|$|Desde 1981, o Brasil tem registrado epidemias de dengue de grande {{magnitude}} e atualmente circulam simultaneamente dois sorotipos DEN- 1 e DEN [...] 2, em mais de 2. 700 municípios. Em Salvador - Bahia, situada na Região Nordeste do país, ocorreram duas epidemias nos anos de 1995 e 1996, e posterior endemização da doença. Este estudo analisa a incidência desta virose nesse município, no período de 1995 a 1999, considerando entre outras variáveis, sua distribuição nos Distritos Sanitários e a situação de densidade do Aedes aegypti. Utiliza como fonte de dados registros oficiais de notificação e do programa de combate vetorial da cidade. A taxa de incidência de dengue foi de 691, 4 e 393, 5 por 100. 000 habitantes, respectivamente, em 1995 e 1996, reduziu-se para 65 por 100. 000 em 1998. Nos Distritos Sanitários mais carentes, este indicador alcançou valores superiores a 800 por 100. 000 habitantes. O Índice de Infestação Predial pelo Aedes chegou a atingir 54, 1 % em um dos seus bairros. Considerando a importância da reemergência do dengue no mundo os autores discutem os possíveis fatores que condicionaram a introdução do vírus, as suas apresentações epidemiológicas no curso de 4 anos, e a efetividade do programa de combate vetorial. Since 1981, Brazil has registered dengue epidemic and simultaneous {{circulation of}} the DEN- 1 and DEN- 2 serotypes in over 2, 700 municipalities. In Salvador- Bahia, {{located in the}} Northeastern region of the Country, two epidemic outbreaks occurred in the years of 1995 and 1996, with further endemic spread of the disease. This study analyses the incidence of the <b>virosis</b> within this municipal area, from 1995 to 1999, considering, among other variables, its distribution in the Sanitary Districts and density of Aedes aegypti. Registers of notified cases and the city's Vectorial Control Program were used as data source. The incidence rate of notified cases of dengue in 1995 and 1996, which were 691. 4 and 393. 5 per 100, 000 inhabitants, respectively, decreased to 65 per 100, 000 inhabitants in 1998. In the poorer Sanitary Districts, this index reached figures of over 800 per 100, 000 inhabitants. The Premise Index for Aedes aegypti reached 54. 1 % {{in one of the}} Districts. Bearing in mind the relevance of the re-emergence of dengue in the world, the authors discuss the possible factors which condition the virus introduction, its epidemiological presentation over the course of four years, and the effectiveness of the vectorial combat (eradication) program...|$|E
40|$|The Diagnostic Value of the Antibody Level Testing in Tick Born Encephalitis. This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the antibody testing and its diagnostic value in Tick Born Encephalitis. Data for this thesis were obtained at the laboratory of Virology, Dpt. of Medical Microbiology of the Cenral Laboratories, Hospital České Budějovice. The data were collected between January 1 st and December 31 st 2014. The thesis is divided in two parts: the theoretical and the experimental part. The theoretical part covers the history of the disease, its geographic distribution and the ways of the transmission of the virus. The disease was first described by Austrian physician Hans Schneider in 1931 as a periodically occuring disease. He called it "Epidemische acute Meningitis serosa". The virus was first described as the cause of the disease in Russia in 1937. In Czechoslovakia, the virus was described in 1947 in Prague by virologists František Galia and Josef Rampas. The first succesful virus isolation in Czechoslovakia was from Beroun district, the next successful isolation was in Vyškov district made by Dr. Krejčí. The virus was later isolated in other European countries as well. The hypothesis, that the virus is transmitted by ticks, was proved by Dr. Rampas and Dr. Galia by the isolation of the virus directly from the ticks Ixodes ricinus, collected in the Beroun district. The transmission of the virus by alimentary route was first described in 1951 near east Slovakian town Rožňava. The virus was transmitted by drinking nonpasteurized sheep milk. The laboratory infection is possible, when laboratory staff works with the viable virus. The Tick Borne Encephalitis virus is part of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. It is an enveloped virus with cubic symetry. Virus particles are round shaped, with diameter 5060 nm. The central part is nucleus, containing viral RNA, enveloped by protein capsid and lipoprotein envelope. Lipoprotein envelope is double lined and contains important antigens - glycoprotein E and menbrane protein M. Tick Borne Encephalitis is transmitted by ticks. The incidance is therefore closely connected to the activity of the ticks in nature. The activity of the ticks depends on the season, temperature, humidity and altitude. The presence of people in focal point is also essential. Tick Borne Encephalitis is an infection with the natural focal point. Its natural reservoir are mainly small rodents and other wild animals. Human activity in nature can lead to the transmission of the disese to humans. Human are a blind end of the transmission chain, no interhuman transmisson was described. The virus penetrates the organism via the tick bite. The virus penetrates to the skin from salivary glands of the tick through the small wound. The primary multiplication starts there. The virus is later spread by lymphatic system to the blood stream. This corresponds with {{the first phase of the}} infection. The second phase of the infection is accompanied by secondary viremia, the virus multiplies in various tissues and spreads into the central nervous system. The incubation period before the beginning of the first phase is 714 days. The first phase may proceed under the clinical picture of mild, flu- like <b>virosis</b> with the increased temperature, muscle pain and fatigue. This period lasts 1 to 2 days, maximum 6 days. After the first phase there is a period of approximately one week without any signs of the disease. After this period the second phase may occur, with sthe signs of meningitis, menigoencephalitis or myelitis. The treatment is symptomatic. To diminish the symptoms of the disease, analgetics, antipyretics, anticonvulsives and sometimes antiedematic treatment is indicated. The epidemiological mesures are based on education and vaccination. The vaccine is available since the eigties of the last century. Laboratory diagnostic may use direct or indirect detection of the virus. The methods of direct detec...|$|E
40|$|Die blattlausübertragene Gelbverzwergung der Gerste, verursacht durch verschiedene Stämme des Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) und des Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV), ist eine weltweit bedeutende Virose der Poaceae, die erhebliche Ertragsverluste zur Folge haben kann. Für eine sowohl wirtschaftlich tragfähige als auch ökologisch verträgliche Getreideproduktion ist ein Anbau toleranter Genotypen erforderlich. Eine effiziente Züchtung toleranter Gerstensorten setzt die Verfügbarkeit molekularer Selektionsmarker voraus, da eine phänotypische Selektion nach künstlicher Infektion mittels virustragender Blattläuse nur schwer in den Zuchtgang zu intergrieren ist. Ziel dieser Arbeiten war es daher mittels cDNA-AFLP Gene zu identifizieren, die an der Ausprägung der Toleranzreaktion beteiligt sind und diese in einer phänotypisch charakterisierten Population von DH-Linien zu kartieren. Die Charakterisierung der Genexpression in den Linien Post´ und Vixen´, sowie ausgewählten doppelhaploiden (DH) Linien der Kreuzung Post´ x Vixen´ mit der cDNA-AFLP Technik ergab insgesamt 45 differentiell regulierte Gene mit folgender Verteilung: 13 % Kohlenhydratmetabolismus, 11 % Aminosäurebiosynthese, 11 % Seneszenz assoziiert, 7 % Zellwandsynthese, 2 % BYDV-Reaktion, 16 % mRNAs anderer Klassen, 9 % ohne signifikante Übereinstimmung und 31 % mRNAs unbekannter Funktion. Von sieben differenzierenden Fragmenten konnten Marker als STS, CAPS oder SNPs entwickelt werden, mit denen die gefundenen Unterschiede in der vorhandenen DH-Population DH 21 Post´ x Vixen´ kartiert werden konnten. Die abgeleiteten Marker der im cDNA-AFLP gefundenen Fragmente kartierten in der Untersuchungspopulation nicht im Bereich bisher bekannter QTL. Für einige Sequenzen ließ sich die chromosomale Zuordnung über Weizen-Gerste Additionslinien bestimmen, ohne eine genaue Aussage über die Position auf dem jeweiligen Chromosom treffen zu können. Die im cDNA-AFLP identifizierten Genfragmente, insbesondere Enzyme der Aminosäurebiosynthesewege betreffend, sind vermutlich auf sekundäre Pflanzenreaktionen nach einer BYDV-Infektion zurückzuführen, da insbesondere eine hohe Akkumulation von Kohlenhydraten in den Blättern BYDV-infzierter Pflanzen auf eine gestörte Phloemfunktion zurückgeführt werden kann. Saccharose kann von den Source-Organen nicht in das Phloem entladen werden und reichert sich daher an. Als Folge wird die Saccharose ggf. wieder in Fructose und Glucose gespalten, was zum einen vielfältige Feedback Funktionen auf weitere Prozesse des Kohlenhydratmetabolismus auslöst und zum anderen, als Folge der Anreicherung von löslichen Zuckern in der Pflanze, zu starken Chlorosen führen kann. Die Desorganisation des Phloemgewebes nach einer BYDV Infektion konnte mit den im cDNA-AFLP gefundenen Enzymen nicht abschließend erklärt werden. Indes lassen Erkenntnisse über herunterregulierte Enzyme der Zellwandsynthese nach einer BYDV-Infektion die Vermutung zu, dass unvernetzte Zellwandbestandteile sich im Phloem anreichern und es somit zu einem Verschluß der Siebzellen mit der Folge von Chlorosen und Leistungsminderungen kommen kann. Aphid {{transmitted}} Barley yellow dwarf, {{caused by}} different strains of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) and Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV) {{is an important}} <b>virosis</b> of Poaceae worldwide and causes substantial yield losses. For an economical and ecologically sound production of cereals growing of tolerant cultivars is a prerequisite. For efficient breeding of tolerant barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars molecular markers are useful tools since artifical inoculation using virus bearing aphids can hardy be efficiently implemented in a barley breeding programme. Therefore, this study aimed at the identification of genes involved in BYDV tolerance by cDNA-AFLP followed by mapping of these genes in a phenotypically well characterized DH-line population derived from the cross Vixen´ (Ryd 2) and Post´ (QTL on 2 HL). In order to achieve information on genes differentially expressed after BYDV infection in general and differentiating tolerant and non-tolerant genotypes, the parental cultivars and doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from their cross carrying all possible combinations {{of positive and negative}} alleles at respective loci (Ryd 2, QTL on 2 HL) as well as the non-tolerant cultivar Nixe´ were raised in growth chambers (18 °C, 70 % relative humidity, 16 h light period, illumination level of 1 e 4 lm/sm). Artificial inoculation took place in the one-leaf stage with aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi) carrying the BYDV-PAV-ASL-Isolate. At 2 dpi the aphids were removed with a systemic insecticide, and 15 dpi the success of artificial infection was checked by analysing the tip of the third leaf by DAS-ELISA. The rest of this leaf was used for total RNA extraction, based on a method using guanidinium thiocyanate. Selective isolation of mRNA was carried out with magnetic beads and the mRNA of infected and healthy control plants was reverse-transcribed to double-stranded cDNA. AFLP reactions were applied and subsequently analysed by 256 EcoRI+ 2 /MseI+ 2 primer combinations. Differentiating fragments were cut out of electrophoresis gels and re-amplified by using the corresponding + 2 primer combinations. Re-amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced. Sequences were compared to EST and protein databases on the worldwide web. A total of 45 differentially regulated genes could be examined and attributed to functions as follows: 13 % carbohydrate metabolism, 11 % aminoacid biosynthesis, 11 % senescence associated, 7 % cell wall synthesis, 2 % BYDV, 16 % mRNA of other classes, 9 % without significant similarities and 31 % mRNA of unknown function. Out of seven different fragments STS, CAPS and SNP markers were derived and mapped in the existing DH population Post´ x Vixen´. Out of the derived markers of the isolated fragments from the cDNA-AFLP, no one mapped in the DH 21 population Post´ x Vixen´ at known tolerance loci or QTL regions. Some sequences could be assigned to barley chromosomes (1 H- 7 H) with wheat-barley chromosome addition lines, but the exact position on the repective chromosome can not be determined by this approach. The detected gene fragments, especially from the amino acid biosynthesis pathways, possibly play a role in secondary plant reactions after BYDV infection because the high accumulation of carbohydrates in BYDV infected leaves most probabaly resulted from degeneration of the phloem. Accumulation of sucrose in source-organs is the consequence of a distorted phloem loading. On the one hand the plethora of sucrose gets cleaved in fructose and glucose with manifold feedback processeses in the carbohydrate metabolism and, on the other hand, it results in severe chlorosis {{as a result of the}} enrichment of soluble carbohydrates in the leaf. The reason for distorted phloem transport could not be clarified but the identification of down-regulated genes from cell wall synthesis after BYDV infection allow to presume that uncured fragments of the cell wall accumulate in the phloem, block the sieve cells, cause chlorosis and finally lead to plant damage and yield reduction...|$|E
