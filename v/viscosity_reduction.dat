The two TLCPs were blended with high density PE (HDPE) and high molecular mass PE (HMMPE) by simple twin screw extrusion under the same weight ratio of 1. 0 wt% and were each rheologically characterized at 190 A degrees C. The TLCPs acted as processing modifiers for the PEs and the bulk viscosity of the blends decreased dramatically. However, the <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> ability was not identical: one TLCP had obviously higher <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> ability on the HDPE, with a maximum <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> ratio of 68. 1 %, whereas the other TLCP had higher <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> ability on the HMMPE, with a maximum <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> ratio of 98. 7 %.

Although more applicable to surface processing of oil sands in the short term, ultimately this technique could also be applied to immature oils for in situ processing and recovery.

In situ application would be limited to reservoirs where formation pressure is higher than the pressure required to generate these subcritical effects.|$|R

However, the use of pure biodiesel as a fuel for diesel engines is currently limited due to problems relating to fuel properties and its relatively poor cold flow characteristics. Therefore, the most acceptable option for improving the properties of biodiesel {{is the use of}} a fuel additive. In the present study, the properties of palm oil methyl esters with increasing additive content were investigated after addition of ethanol, butanol and diethyl ether. The results revealed varying improvement in acid value, density, viscosity, pour point and cloud point, accompanied by a slight decrease in energy content with an increasing additive ratio. The <b>viscosity</b> <b>reductions</b> at 5 % additive were 12 %, 7 %, 16. 5 % for ethanol, butanol and diethyl ether, respectively, and the maximum reduction in pour point was 5 °C at 5 % diethyl ether blend.

However, these properties are irreversibly altered when the sludge is exposed to heat (e. g. either passing through heat exchangers of anaerobic digesters or during thermal pre-treatment process before digesters). Literature showed that thermal pre-treatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) solubilises particulate organic matter in sludge and increases the biodegradability of WAS in anaerobic digesters. This paper reports the similarity between the kinetic of rheological enhancements due to thermal treatment and the rate of organic matter solubilisation in the WAS when it is subjected to cyclic thermal treatment between 20 and 80 °C up to 1 h. This work observed the evolution of rheological characteristics and soluble oxygen demand (sCOD) of 3. 5 - 9. 9 wt. % WAS at different temperatures and for different thermal histories (1 h thermal treatment at 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C). Results showed that, the rate of yield stress and infinite <b>viscosity</b> <b>reductions</b> due to thermal treatment (for 1 h treatment at 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C) were linearly proportional to the rate of solubilisation of organic matter. Because similar results were observed in the literature with digested sludge, these results confirmed that rheological measurement (e. g. infinite viscosity and yield stress) can be used to predict the level of solubilisation of organic matter in any type of sludge when it is exposed to thermal treatment.

Out ofall the methods available for pumping waxy crude oil, use of pour point depressant (PPD) is preferred economically. Optimization of PPD dosages can affect cost savings. Present study deals with the synthesis of copolymers of maleic anhydride and esters of n-alkyl alcohols with oleic acid and methacrylic acid. The resulted copolymers were esterified with two moles of fatty alcohol (C 19 H 36 O 3). They were characterized by IR spectroscopy and their molecular weights were determined by GPC. These polymeric diesters with pen-dant fatty chains were evaluated for their efficiency as pour point depressants and flow improvers on crude oil from Gandhar oil field (Gujarat, India). The polymeric diesters of oleic acid series {{were found to be}} more effective and depress the pour point of the crude oil up to 9 oC with 500 ppm of doses. The rheological properties of the crude oil such as apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, and yield values were also studied using Fann V-G meter. The virgin crude oil above the pour point temperature was found to behave as Newtonian fluid and at the pour point it shows Bingham plastic behaviour. Different doses (100, 500, and 1000 ppm) of synthesized polymeric additives were examined at different temperatures with the crude oil to evaluate pour point depressants and to study the dependence of shear rate on its shear stress and viscosity. The additives of polymeric diesters (DO series) were evaluated as PPD and rheological modifiers.

30|$|Without {{a shadow}} of a doubt, global energy demand is {{increasing}} annually and enhancing oil recovery (EOR) from mature reservoirs is of crucial importance. Waterflooding is a popular technique to increase recovery in a candidate oil reservoir; afterward, chemical EOR is a reasonable option to increase recovery further. Polymer flooding is a favorable chemical EOR method due to its impact on sweep efficiency (Standnes and Skjevrak 2014). Vertical heterogeneity may cause incomplete sweep through waterflooding, and polymer fluid is used to drive water within bypassed regions (Needham and Doe 1987). Generally, polymers are responsible for water increasing <b>viscosity</b> and <b>reduction</b> in its relative permeability (Sheng et al. 2015). Therefore, injection of a high-viscosity polymeric fluid leads to mobility ratio improvement, viscous fingering reduction and consequently increasing areal sweep efficiency (Pye 1964; Sandiford 1964).|$|R

30|$|The {{increase}} {{in demand for}} crude oil and the depletion of light crude oil reserves have led to {{increase in}} the production of heavy crude oils. This has resulted in an interest in decreasing the pumping costs by techniques such as heating, dilution and/or mixing with water. Among the aforementioned methods, emulsification of heavy crude oil with water is the cheapest, and hence, optimizing its application has found increasing attention. This study uses one of the heavy crude oils in Oman to study the <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> achieved by emulsification with water at different oil fractions, temperatures, shear rates and salt content. Two chemicals were used to stabilize the emulsions, namely a nonionic surfactant and an anionic, high molecular weight polymer. It was found that <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> higher than 90 % can be obtained through the creation of oil-in-water emulsions with oil content of less than 70 %. Generally, it was found that there is no effect on the <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> obtainable from oil-in-water emulsions produced using the nonionic surfactant at shear rate up to 1620  s− 1, temperature up to 80  °C and salt content up to 2.0  wt%. On the other hand, the <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> using water-in-oil emulsions at a temperature of 30  °C increases with surfactant concentration and shear rate. Also, the increase in salt content adversely affected the <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> obtained using water-in-oil emulsions. Moreover, it was possible to create oil-in-water emulsions with 60 % oil content and <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> of around 100 % in tap water using 100 and 1000  ppm polymer at all temperatures investigated. However, the use of 2.0  wt% salt resulted in lowering the <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> to 53 and 80 % at 30 and 45  °C, respectively. This diverse effect of salt was almost neutralized at 60 and 80  °C resulting in <b>viscosity</b> <b>reduction</b> higher than 90 %. The emulsions created using 3  wt% surfactant were generally stable for one week to a temperature of around 23  °C. The stability of oil-in-water emulsions with an oil content higher than 60 % was not affected by the presence of salt. The emulsions prepared with an oil content of 60 % in 100  ppm polymer were stable only for 1  h. However, the stability in water for these emulsions was greatly enhanced by increasing the viscosity of the continuous water phase by using 1000  ppm polymer, which resulted in stability higher than 70 % after 24  h of incubation at 23  °C. The presence of 2.0  wt% salt in 1000  ppm polymer emulsions resulted in rendering these emulsions as instable even after 1  h of incubation. It can be concluded that high molecular weight polymers can find application in drag reduction for heavy crude oils after thoroughly investigating the effect of different polymer molecular parameters such as molecular weight and charge density.|$|E

Collective length-scale selection has been observed in bacterial fluids, endothelial tissue, and active colloids, yet the physical origins of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we systematically derive an effective fourth-order field theory from a generic microscopic model that allows us to predict the typical vortex size in microswimmer suspensions. Building on a self-consistent closure condition, the derivation shows that the vortex length scale is determined by the competition between local alignment forces, rotational diffusion, and intermediate-range hydrodynamic interactions.

40|$|Sustainability is a {{cornerstone}} of today???s engineering world. Warm mix asphalt (WMA) and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) are the most prominent sustainable materials in asphalt concrete pavements. WMA is a not a new concept, however new innovations and increased usage of WMA has been spurred by the increased focus on sustainable infrastructure systems. WMA enables reduced production temperatures {{through the use of}} wax, water, or other chemical packages. The effects of reduced production temperatures include fuel use and emissions reductions, improved compaction, and possible RAP concentration increases. RAP is the primary recycled product of the aged asphalt concrete pavements and its use leads to reductions in virgin aggregate and asphalt demand. However, significant performance issues can stem from the individual integration of WMA or RAP materials in asphalt concrete. In particular, WMA technologies can increase moisture and rutting susceptibility while RAP significantly increases the stiffness of the resulting mixture. Consequently, quality performance of sustainable asphalt pavements may require the combined use of WMA and RAP to produce mixtures with sufficient stiffness and moisture and fracture resistance. This study evaluates the potential of WMA technologies and their integration with RAP. Initially, an extensive literature review was completed to understand the advantages, disadvantages, and past field and lab performance of WMA and RAP mixtures. Rotational viscometer and bending beam rheometer tests were then used to evaluate Sasobit, Evotherm M 1, and Advera WMA modified and unmodified binders. Finally, virgin and 45 % RAP mixtures were designed and tested to examine the rutting, moisture, and fracture resistance of WMA and HMA mixtures. The results of this experiment provided several key observations. First, <b>viscosity</b> <b>reductions</b> may not be the primary cause for the availability of reduced production temperatures for WMA technologies.

In this work, we study the rheological behavior of solutions of polyisoprene (PI) in chloroform and suspensions of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in these PI solutions using shear rheometry. We perform rheological measurements to study the viscoelastic properties of solutions of trans-PI in chloroform for polymer concentrations ranging from 1. 0 wt% to 10. 0 wt%. Oscillatory strain sweep tests show a concentration-and-frequency independent critical strain of that defines the limit of the linear viscoelastic region. Frequency sweep tests performed in the linear viscoelastic regime give and for low concentrations, as predicted by the Maxwell model. The zero-shear viscosity of the PI solutions, determined by three methods in this work, has a dependence on polymer concentration c of c 5, which implies that the polymer molecules in our solutions are entangled. CNTs are dispersed in the PI solutions using a water-bath sonicator to obtain suspensions of MWCNTs and SWCNTs. Sonication times of many hours are required to obtain stable dispersions. We observe that the viscosity of the PI/CNT composites is a factor or 10 lower than that of the pure PI solution at the same polymer concentration, and independent of shear rate over the range studied. Films of PI/CNT composites are formed by evaporating the solvent from the suspensions. The well-dispersed state of CNTs in our PI/CNT systems is verified by scanning electron microscopy of the films and by the stability and reproducibility of our steady-state-shear flow measurements. We discuss the mechanisms invoked in the literature to explain <b>viscosity</b> <b>reductions</b> observed in other systems and introduce a new mechanism that we believe that applies to our PI/CNT systems. We propose that the adsorption of polymer chains onto the CNT surface reduces the amount of polymer in solution and thus leads to a decrease in viscosity.
