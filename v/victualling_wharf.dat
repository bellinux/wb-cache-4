25|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century a {{significant}} amount of rebuilding took place in what was by now a substantial Royal Navy Dockyard serving the fleet in the Caribbean. A sizeable storehouse with a clocktower formed the centrepiece, with a covered way leading from it to the careening wharves. The adjacent Port Admiral's (later Commodore's) House included a watch tower, to counter the threat of privateers. The Yard continued to expand to meet the new requirements of steam-powered vessels: the <b>victualling</b> <b>wharf</b> became a coaling depot in the 1840s, and twenty years later a small engineering complex was built. The Yard continued to expand through {{to the beginning of the}} 20th century, but then (with the Admiralty focusing more and more on the situation in Europe) the Navy withdrew from its station in Jamaica and the Dockyard closed in 1905.|$|E
