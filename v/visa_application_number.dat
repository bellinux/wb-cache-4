30|$|The post 7 / 7 dummy permits an {{assessment}} {{of the impact of the}} July 2005 London bombings on UK student <b>visa</b> <b>applications</b> and the <b>number</b> of visas issued. Its inclusion enables an analysis of the effect of the bombings on the volume of these two outcomes. The inclusion of this variable assumes a shift change in applications that is common across all countries. We believe this is plausible as we wish to capture concerns among potential students from all countries about safety and their personal security, as well as risk perceptions and other psychological reactions to the fears induced by the incident. It may also capture an expectation among some potential applicants of a harsher policy response as mediated through a greater scrutiny of applications by UK border authorities, and may thus impact more on the volume of <b>visa</b> <b>applications</b> than issues. Of course, we cannot preclude the possibility that this dummy captures other common features post- 2005 that are independent of the terrorist attack but it is hoped that the empirical model is adequately specified in regard to other variables that capture such features to attenuate the effects of this potential problem. However, we do explore the robustness of estimates for the other covariates included in our specifications through estimating separate models that both include and exclude this variable.|$|R

30|$|The two {{dependent}} variables of primary interest are the <b>number</b> of student <b>visa</b> <b>applications</b> and the <b>number</b> of visas issued both expressed per 100, 000 of origin country population. We {{believe there is}} merit in modelling both these aggregate measures as they reflect the outcomes of different behavioural processes. The former relates to individual behavioural decisions, while the latter potentially reflects the effects of government policy decisions. The visa statistics are obtained from the UKBA’s publication UK visa Entry Clearance Statistics, which was published {{on an annual basis}} and provided <b>visa</b> <b>application</b> and <b>visa</b> issue data for all countries 15. An advantage in using UK student visa data is that, in contrast to other visa categories, the definition has been immutable over the period under consideration here. In addition, the data are administrative and thus likely to be accurate. However, some potential limitations of these data merit comment. First, visa data are available on an annual basis but only reported for the fiscal year running from the 1 st of April to the 31 st of March, while all other data are available on a calendar year basis. For instance, the economic data are based on the calendar year corresponding to the first of the two fiscal years and thus influence visa demand with a quarter-year lag. Second, the reported <b>visa</b> statistics (both <b>applications</b> and issues) do not distinguish between different student categories as the data are not disaggregated by type (i.e., language students, A-level and FE students, HE undergraduates and postgraduates). The determinants for these separate student categories are likely to differ. However, we were unable to obtain separate figures for the different student categories. This is because for the period of analysis, visa data from the UKBA only provided aggregate figures for student applications and issues, without differentiating by study type. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that the majority of international students are enrolled in higher education institutions. The Home Office now reports data on the proportion of international students studying at different levels and types of institutions using information on confirmation of acceptance studies (CASs) 16, a policy reform introduced in 2010. The data reveal that in 2012, 75 % of <b>visa</b> <b>applications</b> were for HE institutions, 15 % for tertiary, FE or other colleges, 2 % for English language schools, 7 % for independent schools, and 2 % for other institutions. Although these figures post-date the period of our data, the dominance of higher education and tertiary colleges in our visa data {{is likely to be the}} case even given the various policy changes documented above. Finally, it should be noted that our data do not include student <b>visa</b> <b>applications</b> from those resident in another (third) country but nationals of, and ordinarily resident in, a developing country.|$|R
