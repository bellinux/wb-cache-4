5|$|During the Phoney War the Netherlands officially {{adhered to}} {{a policy of}} strict neutrality. In secret, the Dutch {{military}} command, partly acting on its own accord, negotiated with both Belgium and France via the Dutch military attaché in Paris, Lieutenant-Colonel David <b>van</b> <b>Voorst</b> Evekink to coordinate a common defence to a German invasion. This failed because of insurmountable differences of opinion {{about the question of}} which strategy to follow.|$|E
5|$|From September 1939 a more easterly Main Defence Line (MDL) was constructed. This second main {{defensive}} position had {{a northern}} part {{formed by the}} Grebbelinie (Grebbe line), located at {{the foothills of the}} Utrechtse Heuvelrug, an Ice Age moraine between Lake IJssel and the Lower Rhine. It was dug on instigation of the commander of the Field Army Lieutenant-General Jan Joseph Godfried baron <b>van</b> <b>Voorst</b> tot Voorst. This line was extended by a southern part: the Peel-Raamstelling (Peel-Raam Position), located between the river Maas and the Belgian border along the Peel Marshes and the Raam rivulet, as ordered by the Dutch Commander in Chief, General Izaak H. Reijnders. In the south the intention was to delay the Germans as much as possible to cover a French advance. Fourth and Second Army Corps were positioned at the Grebbe Line; Third Army Corps were stationed at the Peel-Raam Position with the Light Division behind it to cover its southern flank. Brigade A and B were positioned between the Lower Rhine and the Maas. First Army Corps was a strategic reserve in the Fortress Holland, the southern perimeter of which was manned by another ten battalions and the eastern by six battalions. All these lines were reinforced by pillboxes.|$|E
5000|$|When {{listing the}} major refutations of the Christ Myth thesis (Note 3), Hoffmann {{notes that the}} [...] "important studies" [...] are the five works by S. J. Case, F. C. Conybeare, Maurice Goguel, R. T. France, and Morton Smith. Hoffmann omits from that list many {{historically}} significant refutations such as Albert Schweitzer's critique of the Christ Myth in the added chapters 22 & 23 of the second edition of the Quest (1913, translated in 2001), or Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst's</b> work.|$|R

50|$|Willem Anne Assueer Jacob Schimmelpenninck <b>van</b> der Oye (<b>Voorst,</b> 18 September 1834 - Voorst, 31 Augustus 1889) was a Dutch baron and politician. He was {{president}} of the senate of the Netherlands from 1888 till his death in 1889.|$|R

25|$|Paul Maier {{states that}} a {{comparison}} of Eusebius' reference with the 10th-century Arabic version of the Testimonium due to Agapius of Hierapolis indicates that the Christian interpolation present in the Testimonium must have come early, before Eusebius. Robert E. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> also states that the interpolation likely took place some time between Origen and Eusebius.|$|E
25|$|Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{states that}} the {{scarcity}} of Jewish references to Jesus is not surprising, given that Jesus was not a prominent issue for the Jews during the first century, and after the devastation caused by the Siege of Jerusalem in the year 70, Jewish scholars were focusing on preserving Judaism itself, rather than paying much attention to Christianity.|$|E
5000|$|Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle, , and lord of De Voorst in Guelders (Gelderland) ( [...] ; baptized 30 January 1670, Zutphen [...] - [...] 30 May 1718), {{was the son}} of Oswald van Keppel and {{his wife}} Anna Geertruid <b>van</b> Lintelo.

5000|$|Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands had a {{total of}} seven Hofdames ('court ladies'). They {{accompanied}} the Queen and the other female members of the Royal House during visits and receptions at the Royal Court. The monarch paid for their expenses, {{but they did not}} receive any salary. Not all of these ladies were members of the Dutch aristocracy, but each had a [...] "notable" [...] husband. Excellent social behavior and discretion was the most important recommendation for becoming a Hofdame. In 2012 the Hofdames were Ietje van Karnebeek-van Lede, Lieke Gaarlandt-van <b>Voorst</b> <b>van</b> Beest, Julie Jeekel-Thate, Miente Boellaard-Stheeman, Jonkvrouwe Reina de Blocq van Scheltinga, Elizabeth Baroness van Wassenaer-Mersmans and Bibi Baroness van Zuylen van Nijevelt-Jonkvrouwe den Beer Poortugael.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{question}} of the equivalence of the identities of Yeshu and Jesus has at times been debated, many historians agree that the above 2nd-century passage is likely to be about Jesus, Peter Schäfer stating {{that there can be no}} doubt that this narrative of the execution in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth. Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that the Sanhedrin 43a reference to Jesus can be confirmed not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{states that}} {{although}} {{the question of who}} was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of Sanhedrin 43a (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and {{there is little doubt that}} it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth. Christopher M. Tuckett states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.|$|E
25|$|Paul Maier {{states that}} the first case is {{generally}} seen as hopeless given that as a Jew, Josephus would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and that the second option is hardly tenable given {{the presence of the}} reference in all Greek manuscripts; thus a large majority of modern scholars accept the third alternative, i.e., partial authenticity. Baras adds that the third position is more plausible because it accepts parts of the passage as genuine, but discounts other parts as interpolations. Craig Evans (and separately Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst)</b> state that most modern scholars accept the position that the Testimonium is partially authentic, had a kernel with an authentic reference to Jesus, and that the analysis of its content and style support this conclusion.|$|E
50|$|The area {{encompassed}} by Pauw's holdings on Bergen Neck likely {{included the}} eight miles (13 km) of shore line {{on each of}} the Hudson and Hackensack Rivers from Bergen Point to today's Bergen County line. His agent set up a small factorij and ferry slip at Arresick on the tidal island that stills bears his anglicized name, Paulus Hook. He operated an intermittent ferry and traded with the local Lenape population. By 1630 a plantation worked by African slaves had been set up. Pauw, however, failed to fulfill the condition of establishing a community of at least 50 permanent settlers and was required to re-sell his speculative acquisition back to the company. They commissioned construction of a homestead at Gemoenepaen for their representative Jan Evertsen Bout during 1633. During 1634 a homestead was built at Ahasimus for Cornelis Hendriksen <b>Van</b> Vorst (<b>Voorst),</b> whose later descendents would play a prominent {{role in the development of}} Jersey City. Abraham Isaacsen Verplanck received a land patent for Paulus Hook on May 1, 1638. A small farm went up at Kewan Punt. The leasehold of Aert Van Putten at Hobuk (Hoboken) was the site of North America's first brewery. Another patroonship was established farther up the river at Vriessendael. Although the settlements were small, they were strategic in that they were a foothold on the west bank of what had been named the North River across from New Amsterdam and were important trading-posts for the settlers and indigenous people, who dealt in valuable beaver pelts, and they were early attempts at populating the newly claimed territory.|$|R
25|$|Andreas Köstenberger {{states that}} there is strong {{evidence}} that parts of the Testimonium are authentic, and that the comparison of the Greek versions with the Arabic version (discovered by Shlomo Pines in the 1970s) provides {{an indication of the}} original Josephan text. Köstenberger states that many modern scholars believe that the Arabic version reflects the state of Josephus' original text before it was subject to Christian interpolation. Köstenberger adds that the passage includes vocabulary that is typically Josephan and the style is consistent with that of Josephus. Köstenberger (and separately <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst)</b> state that the Josephus' reference to the large number of followers of Jesus during his public ministry is unlikely to have been due to a Christian scribe familiar with the New Testament accounts, and is hence unlikely to be an interpolation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{overlap between}} the sayings of Jesus in the {{apocryphal}} texts and canonical Christian writings, and those {{not present in}} the canonical texts are called agrapha. There are at least 225 agrapha but most scholars who have studied them have drawn negative conclusions about the authenticity of most of them and see little value in using them for historical Jesus research. Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states {{that the vast majority}} of the agrapha are certainly inauthentic. Scholars differ on the number of authentic agrapha, some estimating as low as seven as authentic, others as high as 18 among the more than 200, rendering them of little value altogether. While research on apocryphal texts continues, the general scholarly opinion holds that they have little to offer to the study of the historicity of Jesus given that they are often of uncertain origin, and almost always later documents of lower value.|$|E

500|$|Given its obvious {{strategic}} importance, Belgium, {{though in}} principle neutral, {{had already made}} quite detailed arrangements for coordination with Entente troops. This {{made it difficult for}} the Dutch to have these plans changed again to suit their wishes. The Dutch desired the Belgians to connect their defences to the Peel-Raam Position, that Reijnders refused to abandon without a fight. He did not approve of a plan by <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> tot Voorst to occupy a so-called [...] "Orange Position" [...] on the much shorter line 's-Hertogenbosch – Tilburg, to form a continuous front with the Belgian lines near Turnhout as proposed by Belgian General Raoul van Overstraeten.|$|E
500|$|The same Stuka {{bombardment}} {{that had}} put Brigade B to rout also broke {{the morale of}} the reserves at Rhenen. In the morning these troops had already shown severe discipline problems, with units disintegrating and leaving the battlefield because of German interdiction fire. In the late afternoon most of 4th Infantry Division was fleeing westwards. The Germans had expected that the Dutch would attempt to plug any gaps in the line and indeed it had been planned to shift to the north two regiments of the Dutch 3rd Army Corps for this purpose. But Dutch command now suffered such a loss of control that any thoughts to re-establish a continuous front had to be abandoned. A [...] wide gap had appeared in the defences. Fearing that otherwise they would be encircled, at 20:30 <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> tot Voorst ordered the three Army Corps to immediately abandon both the Grebbe Line and the Waal-Linge Position and to retreat during the night to the East Front of Fortress Holland at the New Holland Water Line. The Germans, however, did not at once exploit their success; only around 21:00 had it become apparent to them that the gap even existed, when the renewed advance had met no enemy resistance.|$|E
500|$|In {{front of}} this Main Defence Line was the IJssel-Maaslinie, a {{covering}} line along the rivers IJssel and Maas, connected by positions in the Betuwe, again with pillboxes and lightly occupied by a screen of fourteen [...] "border battalions". Late in 1939 General <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> tot Voorst, reviving plans he had already worked out in 1937, proposed {{to make use of}} the excellent defensive opportunities these rivers offered. He proposed a shift to a more mobile strategy by fighting a delaying battle at the plausible crossing sites near Arnhem and Gennep to force the German divisions to spend much of their offensive power before they had reached the MDL, and ideally even defeat them. This was deemed too risky by the Dutch government and General Reijnders. The latter wanted the army to first offer heavy resistance at the Grebbe Line and Peel Raam Position, and then fall back to the Fortress Holland. This also was considered too dangerous by the government, especially in light of German air supremacy, and had the disadvantage of having to fully prepare two lines. Reijnders had already been denied full military authority in the defence zones; the conflict about strategy further undermined his political position. On 5 February 1940 he was forced to offer his resignation because of these disagreements with his superiors. He was replaced by General Henry G. Winkelman who decided that in the north the Grebbe Line would be the main defence line where the decisive battle was to be waged, partly because it would there be easier to break out with a counteroffensive if the conditions were favourable. However, he took no comparable decision regarding the Peel-Raam Position.|$|E
500|$|Winkelman {{at first}} {{intended}} {{to continue the}} fight, even though Rotterdam had capitulated and German forces from there might now advance {{into the heart of}} the Fortress Holland. The possibility of terror bombings was considered before the invasion and had not been seen as grounds for immediate capitulation; provisions had been made for the continuation of effective government even after widespread urban destruction. The perimeter around The Hague might still ward off an armoured attack and the New Holland Water Line had some defensive capability; though it could be attacked from behind, it would take the Germans some time to deploy their forces in the difficult polder landscape. However, he soon received a message from Colonel Cuno Eduard Willem baron <b>van</b> <b>Voorst</b> tot Voorst, the commander of the city of Utrecht, that the Germans demanded its surrender; leaflets were dropped by propaganda planes announcing that only unconditional surrender could [...] "spare it the fate of Warsaw". Winkelman concluded that it apparently had become the German policy to devastate any city offering any resistance; in view of his mandate to avoid unnecessary suffering and the hopelessness of the Dutch military position he decided to surrender. All higher-level army units were informed at 16:50 by Telex of his decision and ordered to first destroy their weapons and then offer their surrender to the nearest German units. At 17:20 the German envoy in The Hague was informed. At around 19:00 Winkelman gave a radio speech informing the Dutch people. This was also how the German command became aware the Dutch had surrendered; the Dutch troops had generally disengaged from the enemy and had not yet made contact. The Dutch surrender implied that in principle a cease-fire should be observed by both parties.|$|E
2500|$|Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{states that}} most modern {{scholars}} {{believe that the}} Testimonium is partially authentic, and has a reference to Jesus. However, he states that scholars are divided on {{the tone of the}} original reference and while some scholars believe that it had a negative tone which was softened by Christian interpolators, others believe that it had a neutral tone, in keeping with the style and approach of Josephus regarding the issue. According to <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst,</b> scholars who support the negative reconstruction contend that the reference read something like [...] "source of further trouble in Jesus a wise man" [...] and that it stated [...] "he was the so-called Christ". <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that most scholars support a neutral reconstruction which states [...] "Around this time lived Jesus, a wise man" [...] and includes no reference to [...] "he was the Christ". <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that if the original references to Jesus had had a negative tone, the Christian scribes would have likely deleted it entirely. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> also states that the neutral reconstruction fits better with the Arabic Testimonium discovered by Pines in the 1970s. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that the neutral reconstruction is supported by the majority of scholars because it involves far less conjectural wording and fits better with the style of Josephus.|$|E

2500|$|Tacitus was a {{patriotic}} Roman senator and his writings shows no sympathy towards Christians. Andreas Köstenberger and separately Robert E. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{state that the}} tone of the passage towards Christians is far too negative to have been authored by a Christian scribe - a conclusion shared by John P. Meier Robert E. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that [...] "of all Roman writers, Tacitus gives us the most precise information about Christ".|$|E
2500|$|According to Robert E. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> the {{overwhelming}} majority of scholars consider both the reference to [...] "the brother of Jesus called Christ" [...] and the entire passage that includes it as authentic. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that the James passage fits well in the context in the Antiquities and an indication for its authenticity is the lack of the laudatory language that a Christian interpolator would have used to refer to Jesus as [...] "the Lord", or a similar term. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> also states that the use of a neutral term [...] "called Christ" [...] which neither denies nor affirms Jesus as the Messiah points to authenticity, and indicates that Josephus used it to distinguish Jesus from the many other people called Jesus at the time, {{in the same way that}} James is distinguished, given that it was also a common name.|$|E

2500|$|Theologian, Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> sees {{little doubt}} that the {{reference}} to the execution of the [...] "king of the Jews" [...] is about the death of Jesus. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that possible reasons for Bar-Serapion to suppress the name of Jesus from the letter include the ongoing persecutions of Christians at the time and his desire not to offend his Roman captors who also destroyed Jerusalem. Others such as Craig A. Evans sees less value in the letter, given its uncertain date, and the possible ambiguity in the reference.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} partial authenticity rely on the language used in the Testimonium, e.g. that the passage calls Jesus [...] "a wise man" [...] which is not laudatory enough for an interpolator, neither is the reference to [...] "amazing deeds". According to <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst,</b> the statement [...] "those that loved him at the first did not forsake him" [...] has the characteristics of Josephus' writing and points to the continuation of Christianity. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that this sentence argues for the continuation of Christianity based on the love for its leader, not the reported appearances after his death. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states {{that it is hard to}} imagine that the phrase [...] "receive the truth with pleasure" [...] used in the Testimonium is the work of a Christian interpolator, for Christian writers generally avoid the use of the word [...] "pleasure" [...] (ἡδονή in Greek) in a positive sense due to its association with hedonism.|$|E
2500|$|Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{states that}} modern {{scholarship}} has [...] "almost unanimously agreed" [...] that {{claims of the}} travels of Jesus to Tibet, Kashmir or India contain [...] "nothing of value".|$|E
2500|$|Scholars such as Robert <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{see little}} doubt that the {{reference}} to the execution of the [...] "king of the Jews" [...] is about the death of Jesus.

2500|$|Bruce Chilton {{states that}} Bar-Serapion {{reference}} to the [...] "king of Jews" [...] {{may be related to}} the INRI inscription on the cross of Jesus' crucifixion, as in the Gospel of Mark (15:26 paragraph 1). <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that the parallels drawn between the unjust treatment of three men, and the destruction of Athens and Samos leads to the conclusion that Bar-Serapion viewed the destruction of Jerusalem as punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Roman {{historian}} Tacitus {{referred to}} Christus and his execution by Pontius Pilate in his Annals (written c. AD 116), [...] Robert E. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> {{states that the}} very negative tone of Tacitus' comments on Christians make the passage extremely unlikely to have been forged by a Christian scribe and Boyd and Eddy state that the Tacitus reference is now widely accepted as an independent confirmation of Christ's crucifixion, although some scholars question the historical value of the passage on various grounds.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to England in 1839, Gosse {{was hard}} pressed to make a living, {{subsisting}} on eightpence a day ("one herring eaten as slowly as possible, and a little bread"). His fortunes began to improve when John <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst,</b> the leading publisher of naturalist writing, agreed, {{on the recommendation of}} Thomas Bell, to publish his Canadian Naturalist (1840).

2500|$|In the Middle Ages, {{as part of}} the {{conflicts}} with Christians, a satirical parody of the Christian gospels called the Toledot Yeshu was written. The book referred to Pantera, or Pandera, as the father of Jesus. Robert E. <b>Van</b> <b>Voorst</b> states that the literary origins of Toledot Yeshu cannot be traced with any certainty, and that, given its medieval composition without a fixed form, it is [...] "most unlikely" [...] to contain reliable historical information. The Blackwell Companion to Jesus states that the Toledot Yeshu contains no historical facts as such, and was perhaps created as a tool for warding off conversions to Christianity.|$|E
