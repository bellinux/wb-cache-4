25|$|On 5 August 2006, the High Court of South Africa threw a {{potential}} monkey wrench into the 2007 season when it issued its ruling in the Spears' legal {{challenge to the}} decision. It ruled that the Spears had a <b>valid</b> <b>contract</b> with SA Rugby, the commercial arm of SARU, {{to be included in}} the 2007 and 2008 Super 14. SA Rugby and SARU are expected to appeal the decision. If the Spears win their court challenge, the Lions, the new name for the Cats, will be relegated for 2007 and will play a test match with the lowest South African team on the 2007 ladder, other than the Spears, for a place in the 2008 competition.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} season in the new tier-IV Regionalliga Nord, the Magdeburg board gave out {{immediate}} repromotion as the team's goal. As only one player had a <b>valid</b> <b>contract</b> for the new league, the club was forced {{to bring in a}} large number of new players. Especially in the midfield virtually none of the previous season's squad was retained. With just the top spot bringing promotion, the task for manager Linz was exceptionally difficult. But in spite of the challenge of forming a team from scratch, the majority of managers in the league declared Magdeburg the top candidate for promotion. Following a drop to fourth place in March, the club sacked manager Paul Linz and hired former player Steffen Baumgart as his successor. Baumgart signed a contract until June 2009.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} of the new South African team led to considerable controversy, including government involvement. Finally, the five teams for 2006 were confirmed to be the country's existing four teams plus the Cheetahs, which draws its players from the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces. For the 2007 season, the Southern Spears, based in Port Elizabeth, were originally intended to replace the lowest-finishing South African team from the 2006 competition. However, the existing South African Super 14 franchises opposed the plan, which was pushed through by controversial president of the South African Rugby Union, Brian van Rooyen. After van Rooyen was ousted as president, SARU announced that the Spears would not enter the competition. SARU investigated {{the viability of the}} Spears after discovering serious financial irregularities. A High Court of South Africa ruling stated that the Spears had a <b>valid</b> <b>contract</b> to compete in the Super 14 and Currie Cup. However, because of the organisation's financial and administrative troubles, in November 2006 a settlement was reached. The Spears abandoned their legal case, and will continue to exist, but not compete in the Super 14.|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Activision Blizzard had {{asserted}} that the Electronic Arts deal was invalid, believing {{that they were still}} in negotiations with Double Fine to publish the game.

On June 4, 2009, Activision filed suit to prevent publishing of the game, claiming that they had invested $15 million in the title and still had a <b>valid</b> <b>contract</b> to release the game. Activision's suit also contends that Double Fine had missed a deadline for the game last year, requesting more time and an additional $7 million in development fees. Activision's considers both the loss of the money they spent on the game as well as potential sales and Brütal Legend-related merchandise as part of the harm done in the lawsuit.|$|E
2500|$|Contract {{implied in}} fact. A person's assent {{to be bound}} by an {{agreement}} can be expressed or implied. In the latter case, assuming the requisite formalities for a <b>valid</b> <b>contract</b> are met, there is a perfectly normal contract. The only distinction between a contract arising by express agreement between two people and a contract implied-in-fact is that the latter was recognised by a court drawing inferences from facts proved at trial. When the plaintiff sued on either sort of contract, she was suing in the law of contract in respect of a consensually assumed obligation and her remedy for the defendant's breach was damages.|$|E

2500|$|The {{parties to}} a <b>valid</b> <b>contract</b> {{are bound to}} do what they have promised.

The claimed advantage of this approach is that it satisfies more abstract considerations of justice if the parties are bound by the law they have chosen. But it {{raises the question of whether}} the test is to be subjective, i.e. the law actually intended by the parties, or objective, i.e. the law will impute the intention which reasonable men in their position would probably have had. It cannot safely be assumed that the parties did actually consider which of the several possible laws might be applied when they were negotiating the contract. Hence, although the courts would prefer the subjective approach because this gives effect the parties' own wishes, the objective test has gained in importance.
