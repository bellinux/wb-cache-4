5|$|The {{publication}} of the Pravda editorials coincided with the composition of Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony. The work marked a great shift in style for the composer, owing to the substantial influence of Gustav Mahler {{and a number of}} Western-style elements. The symphony gave Shostakovich compositional trouble, as he attempted to reform his style into a new idiom. The composer was well into the work when the fatal articles appeared. Despite this, Shostakovich continued to compose the symphony and planned a premiere at the end of 1936. Rehearsals began that December, but after a number of rehearsals Shostakovich, for reasons still debated today, decided to withdraw the symphony from the public. A number of his friends and colleagues, such as Isaak Glikman, have suggested that it was in fact an official ban which Shostakovich was persuaded to present as a <b>voluntary</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> Whatever the case, it seems possible that this action saved the composer's life: during this time Shostakovich feared for himself and his family. Yet Shostakovich did not repudiate the work; it retained its designation as his Fourth Symphony. A piano reduction was published in 1946, and the work was finally premiered in 1961, well after Stalin's death.|$|E

2500|$|Owing to the neocortical {{component}} of human functioning, when human beings lose a primary relationship, they grasp its potential repercussions (i.e. {{they may feel}} uncertain about the future or fear being unable {{to climb out of}} an abyss), thus encumbering an additional layer of separation stress. [...] To abandon is [...] "to withdraw one's support or help from, especially in spite of duty, allegiance, or responsibility; desert: abandon a friend in trouble." [...] When the loss is due to the object’s <b>voluntary</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> a common response is to feel unworthy of love. [...] This indicates the tendency for people to blame the rejection on themselves. [...] "Am I unworthy of love, destined to grow old and die all alone, bereft of human connection or caring?" [...] Questioning one’s desirability as a mate and fearing eternal isolation are among the additional anxieties incurred in abandonment scenarios. The concurrence of self devaluation and primal fear distinguish abandonment grief from most other types of bereavement.|$|E
2500|$|The ACLU filed a suit on Sierra's behalf on December 9, 2001 {{against the}} school {{district}} and Mann, but the suspension was immediately upheld in the Kanawha County circuit court. Sierra's pro bono lawyers claimed that Mann was responsible for disruption, {{and that he could}} have taken the opportunity to teach his students about tolerance and constitutional rights instead of making misleading and incendiary comments in the media. The defense countered by saying constitutional rights did not apply equally to adults and students, with the latter not having the same latitude with regards to freedom of speech. Judge James Stucky rejected Sierra's request for a preliminary injunction on November 2, citing her <b>voluntary</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the county school system, but scheduled a jury trial for her lawsuit for June 24. Stucky ruled that while Sierra was free to believe what she wanted and to express those beliefs, those rights were [...] "not absolute" [...] in a school setting and that the disruption she had caused there overrode her right to free speech. Stucky further declared that he could not guarantee her safety at Sissonville High School.

This paper presents a distributed channel allocation algorithm based on the concept of dynamic channel boundaries. Under this scheme, each mobile service station (MSS) is assigned a contiguous range of channels which is not overlapping with the channel ranges of its neighbors. Boundaries between channel ranges of adjacent MSSs are dynamically adjustable but only through <b>voluntary</b> <b>withdrawals.</b> High efficiency is accomplished by the incorporation of two important features, namely early boundary expansion and need-based boundary redrawing. This algorithm imposes a low message volume on the fixed network. It has short response times to connection requests and achieves high channel utilization under both even and uneven load distributions. Channel utilization can be further improved by allowing a MSS to borrow channels from its neighbors. Re [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most serious, sir," [...] {{returned}} Pedgift Senior. [...] "I am betraying Miss Neelie's secret, in Miss Neelie's own interest. Let us {{go back to}} that cautious question I put to her. She {{found some}} little difficulty in answering it, for the reply involved her in a narrative of the parting interview between her governess and herself. This is the substance of it. The two were alone when Miss Gwilt took leave of her pupil; and the words she used (as reported to me by Miss Neelie) were these. She said, 'Your mother has declined to allow me to take leave of her. Do you decline too?' Miss Neelie's answer was a remarkably sensible one for a girl of her age. 'We have not been good friends,' she said, 'and I believe we are equally glad to part with each other. But I have no wish to decline taking leave of you.' Saying that, she held out her hand. Miss Gwilt stood looking at her steadily, without taking it, and addressed her in these words: 'You are not Mrs. Armadale yet.' Gently, sir! Keep your temper. It's not at all wonderful that a woman, conscious of having her own mercenary designs on you, should attribute similar designs to a young lady who happens to be your near neighbor. Let me go on. Miss Neelie, by her own confession (and quite naturally, I think), was excessively indignant. She owns to having answered, 'You shameless creature, how dare you say that to me!' Miss Gwilt's rejoinder was rather a remarkable one--the anger, on her side, appears to have been of the cool, still, venomous kind. 'Nobody ever yet injured me, Miss Milroy,' she said, 'without sooner or later bitterly repenting it. You will bitterly repent it.' She stood looking at her pupil for a moment in dead silence, and then left the room. Miss Neelie appears to have felt the imputation fastened on her, in connection with you, far more sensitively than she felt the threat. She had previously known, as everybody had known in the house, that some unacknowledged proceedings of yours in London had led to Miss Gwilt's <b>voluntary</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from her situation. And she now inferred, from the language addressed to her, that she was actually believed by Miss Gwilt to have set those proceedings on foot, to advance herself, and to injure her governess, in your estimation. Gently, sir, gently! I haven't quite done yet. As soon as Miss Neelie had recovered herself, she went upstairs to speak to Mrs. Milroy. Miss Gwilt's abominable imputation had taken her by surprise; and she went to her mother first for enlightenment and advice. She got neither the one nor the other. Mrs. Milroy declared she was too ill to enter on the subject, and she has remained too ill to enter on it ever since. Miss Neelie applied next to her father. The major stopped her the moment your name passed her lips: he declared he would never hear you mentioned again by any member of his family. She has been left in the dark from that time to this, not knowing how she might have been misrepresented by Miss Gwilt, or what falsehoods you might have been led to believe of her. At my age and in my profession, I don't profess to have any extraordinary softness of heart. But I do think, Mr. Armadale, that Miss Neelie's position deserves our sympathy." ...|$|E
