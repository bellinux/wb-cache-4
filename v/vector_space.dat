5|$|Linear maps V → W {{between two}} vector spaces form a <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> HomF(V, W), also denoted L(V, W). The space of linear maps from V to F {{is called the}} dual <b>vector</b> <b>space,</b> denoted V∗. Via the {{injective}} natural map , any <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> can be embedded into its bidual; the map is an isomorphism {{if and only if}} the space is finite-dimensional.|$|E
5|$|Every <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> has a basis. This {{follows from}} Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the <b>vector</b> <b>space,</b> denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E

40|$|In this book, {{the authors}} define the new notion of set <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> {{which is the}} most {{generalized}} form of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> Set <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> make use of the least number of algebraic operations, therefore, even a non-mathematician is comfortable working with it. It is with the passage of time, that we can think of set linear algebras as a paradigm shift from linear algebras. Here, the authors have also given the fuzzy parallels of these new classes of set linear algebras. This book is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter briefly recalls some of the basic concepts in order to make this book self-contained. Chapter two introduces the notion of set <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> {{which is the most}} generalized concept of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> Set <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> lends itself to define new classes of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> like semigroup <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> and group <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> These are also generalization of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> The fuzzy analogue of these concepts are given in Chapter three. In Chapter four, set <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> are generalized to biset bivector spaces and not set <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> This is done taking into account the advanced information technology age in which we live. As mathematicians, we have to realize that our computer-dominated world needs special types of sets and algebraic structures. Set n-vector spaces and their generalizations are carried out in Chapter five. Fuzzy n-set <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> are introduced in the sixth chapter. The seventh chapter suggests more than three hundred problems. Comment: 344 page...|$|R
25|$|Dual <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> find {{application}} in many branches of mathematics that use <b>vector</b> <b>spaces,</b> {{such as in}} tensor analysis with finite-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> When applied to <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> of functions (which are typically infinite-dimensional), dual spaces are used to describe measures, distributions, and Hilbert spaces. Consequently, the dual space is an important concept in functional analysis.|$|R
30|$|D_ 0 is the bounded derived {{category}} of finite-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> over a field k, and D⊃D_ 0 is the derived {{category of}} all <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> (or at least, of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> of countable dimension).|$|R
5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum {{can be written}} in exponential notation as V⊕N, or simply VN {{with the understanding that}} the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> Rn.|$|E
5|$|A nonempty subset W of a <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> V that {{is closed}} under {{addition}} and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the 0-vector of V) {{is called a}} linear subspace of V, or simply a subspace of V, when the ambient space is unambiguously a <b>vector</b> <b>space.</b> Subspaces of V are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set S of vectors is called its span, {{and it is the}} smallest subspace of V containing the set S. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of S.|$|E
5|$|By {{mathematical}} induction, a setQ is convex if and onlyif every {{convex combination}} of members ofQ also belongs toQ. By definition, a convex combination of an indexedsubset{v0,v1,...,vD} of a <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> is any weighted average for some indexedset of non-negative real numbers{λd} satisfying the equation=1.|$|E

5|$|Due to this {{it often}} suffices to find {{representations}} of the Lie algebra. Lie algebras are much simpler objects than Lie groups to work with. Due {{to the fact that}} the Lie algebra is a finite-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>space,</b> in the case of the Lorentz Lie algebra the dimension is , one need only find a finite number of representative matrices of the Lie algebra, one for each element of a basis of the Lie algebra as a <b>vector</b> <b>space.</b> The rest follow from extension by linearity, and the representation of the group is obtained by exponentiation.|$|E
5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a <b>vector</b> <b>space,</b> and the group represents symmetries of the <b>vector</b> <b>space.</b> For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{product of}} vector spaces and the direct sum of vector spaces {{are two ways}} of {{combining}} an indexed family of vector spaces into a new <b>vector</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to offer a family of invariants {{that allows us to}} {{classify}} finite potent endomorphisms on arbitrary <b>vector</b> <b>spaces,</b> generalizing the classification of endomorphisms on finite-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> As a particular case we classify nilpotent endomorphisms on infinite-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

5|$|A <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> (also {{called a}} linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.|$|E
5|$|The set of {{one-dimensional}} subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> V {{is known}} as projective space; it {{may be used to}} formalize the idea of parallel lines intersecting at infinity. Grassmannians and flag manifolds generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension k and flags of subspaces, respectively.|$|E
5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} way that the independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a <b>vector</b> <b>space.</b> One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} maps between two normed <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> are the continuous linear maps. Together with these maps, normed <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> form a category.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{notion of}} {{generalized}} locally bounded I-topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> is introduced. Some of their important properties are studied. The relationship between {{this kind of}} spaces and the locally bounded I-topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> introduced by Wu and Fang [Boundedness and locally bounded fuzzy topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces,</b> Fuzzy Math. 5 (4) (1985) 87 − 94] is discussed. Moreover, we also use the family of generalized fuzzy quasi-norms to char-acterize the generalized locally bounded I-topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces,</b> and give some applications of this characterization. 1...|$|R
500|$|Banach and Hilbert {{spaces are}} {{complete}} topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of functional analysis—focusses on infinite-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>spaces,</b> since all norms on finite-dimensional topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> {{give rise to}} the same notion of convergence. The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and ∞-norm on R2: as the unit [...] "balls" [...] enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm {{if and only if}} it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> richer than that of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> without additional data.|$|R
5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a <b>vector</b> <b>space,</b> which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|General vector spaces do {{not possess}} a {{multiplication}} between vectors. A <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field. Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we define and discuss some {{properties}} of {{partition of unity}} on *-inductive limits of topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> We prove that if a partition of unity exists on a *-inductive limit space {{of a collection of}} topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces,</b> then it is isomorphic and homeomorphic to a subspace of a *-direct sum of topological <b>vector</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{differential}} topology, {{a branch}} of mathematics, a smooth functor {{is a type of}} functor defined on finite-dimensional real <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> Intuitively, a smooth functor is smooth {{in the sense that it}} sends smoothly parameterized families of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces</b> to smoothly parameterized families of <b>vector</b> <b>spaces.</b> Smooth functors may therefore be uniquely extended to functors defined on vector bundles.|$|R

5|$|The Lorentz {{group is}} a Lie group and has as such a Lie algebra, The Lie algebra is a <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E
5|$|In a real <b>vector</b> <b>space,</b> a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
