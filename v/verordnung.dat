Not long afterwards, he called elections for 5 March. Six days before the election, on 27 February, the Reichstag fire damaged the house of Parliament in Berlin. Claiming that the fire was {{the first step in a}} Communist revolution, the Nazis used the fire as a pretext to get the President, Hindenburg, to sign the Reichstag Fire Decree, officially the <b>Verordnung</b> des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat (Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State).|$|E
50|$|The Malicious Practices Act (<b>Verordnung</b> zur Abwehr heimtückischer Diskreditierung der nationalen Regierung) {{was passed}} on 21 March 1933 in Nazi Germany. It {{was part of}} a series of events that {{occurred}} within 1933, which marked the brutality and resilience of the Nazi party. From here on life for thousands of Germans would be controlled and monitored for those dubbed as ‘social outcasts’. Not only were many killed; others were forced into Nazi concentration camps in order to allow the German economy to flourish and eradicate opposition to the Nazi Party. The Act in particular portrayed some of the Nazis' key political and philosophical policies.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Second World War in 1939, many new laws and prohibitions were established in Nazi Germany, forcing the population to decide whether to obey the Nazi regime or to risk being declared [...] "criminals".

This law prohibited deliberate listening to any foreign radio station under threat of penal servitude. Likewise all non-governmental radio transmissions were banned and all critical equipment of German amateur radio operators were seized by the Reichspost authorities.|$|E
50|$|The command {{relationships}} in the Bundeswehr are defined in the Ministerial Directive Governing Superior-Subordinate Relations (official translation of <b>Verordnung</b> über die Regelung des militärischen Vorgesetztenverhältnisses, abbreviated Vorgesetztenverordnung (VorgV)). These service regulations were decreed March 19, 1956, shortly before the first soldiers joined the newly founded Bundeswehr, and went into effect June 7, 1956. They were modified by decree October 7, 1981. The Vorgesetztenverordnung applies only to Bundeswehr soldiers and {{does not apply to}} civilian personnel of the Bundeswehr. Superior-subordinate relations of civilian Bundeswehr members (as well as military-civilian or civilian-military superior-subordinate relations) are defined by other regulations and ordinances. The content of the Vorgesetztenverordnung {{is one of the first}} things that recruits are required to learn.|$|E
50|$|In the Autumn of 1938, only 40,000 of the {{formerly}} 100,000 Jewish businesses {{were still in}} the hands of their original owners. Aryanisation was completed with the enactment of a regulation, the <b>Verordnung</b> zur Ausschaltung der Juden aus dem deutschen Wirtschaftsleben (Regulation for the elimination of Jews from German economic life) of 12 November 1938, through which the remaining businesses were transferred to non-Jewish owners and the proceeds taken by the state. Jewellery, stocks, real property and other valuables had to be sold. Either by direct force, by government interventions such as sudden tax claims, or by the weight of the circumstances, Jewish property changed hands mostly below fair market value. Jewish employees were fired, and self-employed people were prohibited from working in their respective professions.|$|E
5000|$|The law [...] "Ordonnance réglant l’utilisation du nom « Suisse » pour les montres" [...] or <b>Verordnung</b> vom 23 Dezember 1971 über die Benützung des Schweizer Namens für Uhren (Ordinance {{regulating}} {{the use of}} the name [...] "Swiss" [...] on watches) first defines a [...] "watch" [...] (as opposed to a clock) by the dimensions of its movement. Thereafter, the law defines a Swiss watch, the definition of which is dependent on certain aspects of its movement. The law then goes on to define under what circumstances a watch movement may be considered Swiss made. The law then sets forth the conditions for {{the use of the}} name Swiss on watches, on watch cases, on watch movements, on watch dials and on replacement watch parts. The pertinent parts of the law are digested below.|$|E
5000|$|The Reichstag Fire Decree (Reichstagsbrandverordnung) is {{the common}} name of the Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State (<b>Verordnung</b> des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat) issued by German President Paul von Hindenburg {{on the advice of}} Chancellor Adolf Hitler on 28 February 1933 in {{immediate}} response to the Reichstag fire. The decree nullified many of the key civil liberties of German citizens. With Nazis in powerful positions in the German government, the decree was used as the legal basis for the imprisonment of anyone considered to be opponents of the Nazis, and to suppress publications not considered [...] "friendly" [...] to the Nazi cause. The decree is considered by historians as one of the key steps in the establishment of a one-party Nazi state in Germany.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first edition}} of this Bible was printed {{starting}} in 1641 and had no dedication. The second edition was printed starting in 1649 had an engraved portrait of Queen Christina of Sweden included with a 4 page dedication. The third edition was printed starting in 1652 also was dedicated to Queen Christina of Sweden. The fourth edition was printed starting in 1662 after Christina’s conversion to Catholicism. This action made it inappropriate to have her portrait in the Bible and it was therefore replaced with a portrait of Ernst of Saxony. The National Library of Sweden in Stockholm has 7 editions including the first 4 editions. In Isaac Vossius's (Queen Christina's Librarian) handwritten catalog of her books it is labeled as follows under Folio: [...] "Mart. Luthers Biblis, auff <b>Verordnung</b> Hertzog Ernsts. Nürnberg 1649".|$|E
50|$|The {{three other}} civil {{servants}} present at Riga - Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein, Wilhelm Anton von Klewitz and Friedrich August von Stägemann - also played important rôles in the reforms. Altenstein became high financial councillor in the Generaldirektorium. When Stein was dismissed in 1807, Altenstein and {{the minister of}} finances Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten put in place the state reform conceived by Stein. In 1810, Klewitz and Theodor von Schön edited the <b>Verordnung</b> über die veränderte Staatsverfassung aller obersten Staatsbehörden (Decree on the new constitution of all the high portfolios of state). Other collaborators {{took part in the}} reforms, such as Johann Gottfried Frey (chief of police in Königsberg and the real author of the Städteordnung), Friedrich Leopold Reichsfreiherr von Schrötter (who collaborated with Stein on the Städteordnung), Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth (in Prussian service since 1801, who had collaborated with Hardenberg on the fiscal and industrial laws) and Christian Friedrich Scharnweber (who had some influence on Hardenberg).|$|E
