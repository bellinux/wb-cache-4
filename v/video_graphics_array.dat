500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), but not <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|E
2500|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{of the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, such as those from Apple, Atari and Commodore, did not use RGB as their main method to manage colors, but rather composite video. [...] IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits—one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) for its first IBM PC (1981), later improved with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphic card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, {{but it was not}} until the arrival of the <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analogue, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added truecolor. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised truecolor Super VGA hardware.|$|E

Three colour signal referred to collectively as R (red), G (green) and B (blue) signal. The VGA monitor using resolution of 640 by 480 by mode to display colours. The project constructed by using Xilinx ISE 10. 1 software and Xilinx Spartan- 3 E board to develop the project into a complete module. The project using the Finite State Machine (FSM) technique to generate HDL coding based on the VGA timing diagram specification. To get VGA monitor controller properly, the timing diagram must be correctly. The design will be written using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) coding style based on FSM to ensure the VGA controller and PS- 2 controller work properly. The behavioral simulation was done by using Xilinx ISE Tool software to verify the functionality of the design. The Spartan 3 E starter Kit board was chosen to implement the desig...|$|R
