To {{be able to}} reuse software components, {{it is necessary to}} locate the component that can be reused. Locating components, or even realizing that they exist, can be quite difficult in a large collection of components. These components need to be suitably classified and stored in a repository to enable efficient retrieval. Four schemes have been previously employed, Free Text, Enumerated, Attribute <b>Value</b> and <b>Faceted</b> classification. But we try to develop only with two schemes which are attribute <b>value</b> scheme and <b>faceted</b> <b>value</b> scheme. This paper titled “Implementation of attribute <b>value</b> and <b>faceted</b> <b>value</b> classification for constructing reuse repository” is aimed to develop a classification scheme which uses an attribute <b>value</b> and <b>faceted</b> <b>value</b> of existing classification that can be used by people to retrieve the reusable components. This approach serves as an effective means to categorize components and to retrieve the relevant components efficiently to improve retrieval efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Information flow {{analysis}} {{is the study}} of mechanisms by which developers may protect sensitive data within an ecosystem containing untrusted third-party code. Secure multi-execution is one such mechanism that reliably prevents undesirable information flows, but a programmer’s use of secure multi-execution is itself challenging and prone to error. <b>Faceted</b> <b>values</b> have been shown to provide an alternative to secure multi-execution which is, in theory, functionally equivalent. The purpose of this work is to show that the theory holds in practice by implementing usable <b>faceted</b> <b>values</b> in JavaScript via source code transformation. The primary contribution of this project is to provide a library that makes these transformations possible in any standard JavaScript runtime without requiring native support. We build a pipeline that takes JavaScript code with syntactic support for <b>faceted</b> <b>values</b> and, through source code transformation, produces platform-independent JavaScript code containing functional <b>faceted</b> <b>values.</b> Our findings include a method by which we may optimize the use of <b>faceted</b> <b>values</b> through static analysis of the program’s information flow...|$|R

50|$|Edwin A. Locke’s Range of Affect Theory (1976) {{is arguably}} the most famous job {{satisfaction}} model. The main premise of this theory is that satisfaction is determined by a discrepancy between what one wants in a job and what one has in a job. Further, the theory states that how much one <b>values</b> a given <b>facet</b> of work (e.g. the degree of autonomy in a position) moderates how satisfied/dissatisfied one becomes when expectations are/aren’t met. When a person <b>values</b> a particular <b>facet</b> of a job, his satisfaction is more greatly impacted both positively (when expectations are met) and negatively (when expectations are not met), compared to one who doesn’t <b>value</b> that <b>facet.</b> To illustrate, if Employee A values autonomy in the workplace and Employee B is indifferent about autonomy, then Employee A would be more satisfied in a position that offers a high degree of autonomy and less satisfied in a position with little or no autonomy compared to Employee B. This theory also states that too much of a particular facet will produce stronger feelings of dissatisfaction the more a worker <b>values</b> that <b>facet.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our participation in INEX 2012 in the Social Book Search Track and the Linked Data Track. For the Social Book Search Track we compare {{the impact of}} query- and user-independent popularity measures and recommendations based on user profiles. Book suggestions {{are more than just}} topical relevance judgements and may include personal factors such as interestingness, fun and familiarity and book-related aspects such as quality and popularity. Our aim is to understand to what extent book suggestions are related to user-dependent and -independent aspects of relevance. Our findings are that evidence that is both query- and user-independent is not effective for improving a standard retrieval model using blind feedback. User-dependent evidence, on the contrary, is highly effective, leading to significant improvements. For the Linked Data Track we compare different methods of weighted result aggregation using the DBpedia ontology relations as <b>facets</b> and <b>values.</b> <b>Facets</b> and <b>values</b> are aggregated using either document counts or retrieval scores. The reason to use retrieval scores for facet ranking is that we want the top retrieved results to be summarised by the top ranked <b>facets</b> and <b>values.</b> In addition, we look at the impact of taking overlap in aggregation into account. <b>Facet</b> <b>values</b> that give access to many of the same documents have high overlap.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) to {{investigate}} how a faceted classification {{can be expressed}} in RDF and shared on the Semantic Web. Statement of the Problem Faceted classification outlines facets as well as subfacets and <b>facet</b> <b>values.</b> Hierarchical relationships and associative relationships are established in a faceted classification. RDF is used to describe how a specific URI has a relationship to a <b>facet</b> <b>value.</b> Not only does RDF decompose "information into pieces, " but by incorporating <b>facet</b> <b>values</b> RDF also given the URI the hierarchical and associative relationships expressed in the faceted classification. Combining faceted classification and RDF creates more knowledge than if the two stood alone. An application understands the subject-predicate-object relationship in RDF and can display hierarchical and associative relationships based on the object (<b>facet)</b> <b>value.</b> This paper continues to investigate if the above idea is indeed useful, used, and applicable. If so, how can a faceted classification be expressed in RDF? What would this expression look like?

40|$|JavaScript is most {{commonly}} used {{as a part of}} web browsers, especially client- side scripts interacting with the user. JavaScript is also the source of many security problems, which includes cross-site scripting attacks. The primary challenge is that code from untrusted sources run with full privileges on the client side, thus lead- ing to security breaches.

40|$|JavaScript {{has become}} a central {{technology}} of the web, {{but it is also}} the source of many security problems, including cross-site scripting attacks and malicious advertising code. Central to these problems is the fact that code from untrusted sources runs with the same privileges as trusted code in the same frame. While much work has been done to secure JavaScript in a somewhat piecemeal approach, information flow analysis presents a compelling option for providing a more systemic solution to the problem. By tracking the flow of sensitive information in the browser, we can prevent it from leaking out to untrusted sources. Formally, information flow analysis can provide non-interference, the guarantee that public outputs do not depend on private inputs. Previous information flow techniques have primarily relied on static type systems. While effective, they are an awkward fit for dynamically typed JavaScript code. This dissertation explores three different runtime enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee non-interference dynamically. The no-sensitive-upgrade check forbids updating public reference cells in a private context {{through the use of a}} runtime monitor. This approach can be done with minimal performance overhead by using a sparse-labeling strategy, which leaves security labels on data implicit whenever possible. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach. While the no-sensitive-upgrade check is effective, it sometimes rejects valid program executions that do not violate the security property. The permissive upgrade strategy is a refinement of this approach that still guarantees non-interference, but which accepts strictly more executions. When a public reference cell is updated in a private context, the permissive upgrade strategy marks the data as partially leaked rather than terminating execution. Partially leaked data is carefully tracked to avoid leaking private information. The final approach introduces special <b>faceted</b> <b>values,</b> which capture multiple views for a single object. <b>Faceted</b> <b>values</b> simulate multiple executions for different security levels, giving the following benefits:* <b>Faceted</b> <b>values</b> do not rely on the stuck executions of the no-sensitive-upgrade and permissive upgrade approaches, and therefore accept strictly more programs than either of the monitor-based approaches. * <b>Faceted</b> <b>values</b> avoid redundant computations, improving efficiency over related approaches. Finally we implement <b>faceted</b> <b>values</b> in Firefox and show how they may be used to prevent a variety of attacks...|$|R
40|$|Most work on {{watermarking}} {{has resulted}} in techniques for different types of data: image, audio, video, text/language, software, etc. In this paper we discuss the watermarking of abstract structured aggregates of multiple types of content, such as multi-type/media documents. These semi-structures can be usually represented as graphs and are characterized by value lying both in the structure and in the individual nodes. Example instances include XML documents, complex web content, workflow and planning descriptions, etc. We propose a scheme for watermarking abstract semi-structures and discuss its resilience with respect to attacks. While content specific watermarking deals {{with the issue of}} protecting the value in the structure’s nodes, protecting the value pertaining to the structure itself is a new, distinct challenge. Nodes in semi-structures are value-carrying, thus a watermarking algorithm could make use of their encoding capacity by using traditional watermarking. For example if a node contains an image then image watermarking algorithms can be deployed for that node to encode parts of the global watermark. But, given the intrinsic value attached to it, the graph that “glues ” these nodes together is in itself a central element of the watermarking process we propose. We show how our approach makes use of these two <b>value</b> <b>facets,</b> structural and node-content...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Recent {{studies of}} cases with mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) suggested that besides Alzheimer disease (AD) -related biomarkers, some personality dimensions are associated with progression to AD. To date, there are no studies addressing the psychological determinants of subtle cognitive decline in healthy elderly controls. Methods: 488 community-dwelling healthy controls were assessed with a detailed neuropsychological battery at baseline and an 18 -month follow-up. Personality factors and facets were investigated at baseline using the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R). Upon follow-up, there were 264 stable controls (sCON) and 224 deteriorating controls (dCON). Their personality data were compared {{to those of the}} 102 MCI cases using one-way analysis of variance and logistic regression models. Results: Significantly higher scores of Openness factor (as well as Aesthetics, Ideas and <b>Values</b> <b>facets)</b> were found in sCON than in both dCON and MCI cases. The three groups did not differ in the other NEO-PI-R factor and facet scores. Openess factor (and the same facets) was associated with cognitive preservation in healthy controls (OR: 0. 72, 95 % CI: 0. 59, 0. 87). Lower scores in the same factor and facets conferred higher risk to have MCI (OR: 0. 61, 95 % CI: 0. 46, 0. 79).

In order to understand the coping experience of this group, ten female South Asian patients being treated for breast cancer were recruited for in-depth semi-structured interviews, which were recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed using constructivist grounded theory to produce a model conceptualising the resources or processes that this group used in order to cope with breast cancer.

40|$|Purpose: to {{establish}} the value placed on the facets that contribute to a meaningful leisure occupation for the residents of a residential care facility by the staff that care for them. Design/methodology/approach: this was a service evaluation using a self-reported questionnaire, completed by 6 Activity Co-ordinators from the home of 158 Individuals {{with a wide range}} of neuropalliative conditions. Findings: the cultural/ historical components, the built and social environment, learning, life satisfaction and goal orientation were reported as the least <b>valued</b> <b>facets,</b> which make up a leisure occupation. The staff did however; value the sense of health and capability, purpose, the feeling of being fully human and the sense of belonging that comes about through leisure. They also valued preventing boredom, opportunities for self-expression, creativity, achievement and control. Additionally they valued opportunities to gain a clear sense of the rhythm of life, of self-identity, choice of occupation and engagement in the occupation. Research limitations/implications: the findings highlight a variance between the perceptions of staff members who deal with the day-to-day leisure opportunities and decisions of the residents, and the literature of Occupational Science about what makes an occupation meaningful, and therefore is worthy of consideration when planning a leisure occupation. Practical implications: personalised care requires consideration of the individual’s cultural & historical background, the environment surrounding the occupation, opportunities for social interaction, individual learning, life satisfaction and goal orientation when organising leisure opportunities. These facets are stressed because the participants undervalued them.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} address the issues {{pertaining}} practicalities of value co-creation {{from the perspective of}} Service-Dominant Logic (S-D) of Marketing. Using an interpretive strategy and case study method, this study responds to the call for empirical treatment of Service-Dominant Logic conceptualization. This is done by answering the question “how does integrating resources co-create value?”. A multiple-actor framework of value co-creation is derived from empirical material interpretation incorporating the nature of value realized by actors, resources and actor classifications, nature of interactions, and stages in value co-creation. The outcome of this study suggests that value co-creation is a system where actors engage in dialogues with the aim of improving ‘personal situations’. This system is comprised of various processes at four stages. For instance, resources integration among actors happens at a collaboration stage that co-creates consequences. These consequences are experiences, service offerings, relationships and fluctuations in resources and skills. Resources integration is done through reciprocal co-operative dialogue among actors. These dialogues have four types: initiating, building, sharing and critiquing (IBSC). In the next stage, value is realized in the form of inter-related facets: knowledge, monetary, relationship, functional and experience value. All these <b>value</b> <b>facets</b> together increase or decrease the experience value. Once value is realized, the next stage is the appraisal of the overall experience in the form of positive word of mouth, willingness to participate in the future, innovation, and premium valuation of the service offerings. Positive appraisal results in the improved situations of actors. Improved situations are: increase in resources, actors satisfaction, long-term and sustainable partnerships, and successful service delivery. A negative appraisal recognizes in the co-destruction of value. This framework is significant because in addition to providing implications for marketing theory and future research, 4 E’s of value co-creation matrix (Engage, Event Space, Evaluation, Encourage) which are focused on resource integrations and actors, are recommended for value co-creation practices. 4 E’s of value co-creation also question the efficacy of marketing mix in framing managerial decisions. 4 E’s of value co-creation presents a service dominant perspective on developing marketing strategies...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that volunteering can improve positive psychological wellbeing, and protect against the onset of depressive symptoms amongst older adults. However, the mechanisms at play in the relationship remain unclear. This research project analysed two data sets {{in order to test}} the predictions of a social-cognitive theory of depression as it applies to the volunteering-psychological wellbeing relationship. A social cognitive theory of depression (as described by Oatley and Bolton (1985)) suggests that older adults are susceptible to symptoms of depression and reduced psychological wellbeing when difficult life events limit their ability to maintain social roles that have previously facilitated investment in <b>valued</b> <b>facets</b> of their self-concept. Therefore, volunteering may compensate for such role losses by enabling older adults to continue to contribute to their sense of self through their volunteering role, and subsequently protect them from the effects that such role-loss may have on their psychological functioning. Using longitudinal data from a New Zealand-based sample, this research illustrates that older adults who have relatively poorer physical health {{are more likely to be}} protected from experiences of depressive symptoms as a result of consistently volunteering than those who experience higher levels of health. Analyses of longitudinal data also provide some evidence that employment status may moderate the impact of volunteering consistency on protection against symptoms of depression. In addition, analyses of cross-sectional data demonstrate a relationship between contributions to self-concept through the enactment of social roles, and better psychological wellbeing. This research also suggests that the extent to which negative life events limit a person’s ability to invest in their sense of self is related to psychological wellbeing outcomes. Finally, it is suggested that the amount of investment in self-concept facilitated by a volunteering role is related to psychological wellbeing. However, investment in self-concept through volunteering was not shown to moderate the relationship between pertinent life stressors, and psychological wellbeing. To a large extent, these findings align with a social-cognitive theory of depression (Oatley & Bolton, 1985), but they raise questions about the way that compensatory coping through social role changes has previously been theorised...|$|R

A surface roughness of 0. 64 +/- 0. 25 micron (mean +/- S. D.) was found for the enamel-to-enamel contact areas. status: publishe...|$|R

It focuses first on {{the differences in the}} profitability of Canadian-controlled and U. S. -controlled enterprises and asks whether there are differences in trends in profitability by country of ownership over the business cycle experienced in the 1990 s. It uses micro-economic data on the profitability of large non-integrated firms to investigate the role played by market share in determining profitability in each group {{and the extent to which}} profits that deviate from the mean are forced quickly or slowly back to their long-run equilibrium <b>values.</b> Both <b>facets</b> of profit behaviour are related to the nature of competition in the markets served by firms. Finally, it {{examines the}} role played by changes in the Canada-U. S. exchange rate in determining profitability in order to understand the extent to which each group uses these changes to adjust their foreign prices and thus to affect reported Canadian profits.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} Dynamic Category Sets, a novel {{approach}} that addresses the vocabulary problem for faceted data. In their paper on the vocabulary problem, Furnas et al. note that &quot;the keywords that are assigned by indexers are often at odds with those tried by searchers. &quot; Faceted search systems exhibit an interesting aspect of this problem: users do not necessarily understand an information space {{in terms of the}} same facets as the indexers who designed it. Our approach addresses this problem by employing a data-driven approach to discover sets of <b>values</b> across multiple <b>facets</b> that best match the query. When there are multiple candidates, we offer a clarification dialog that allows the user to disambiguate them...|$|R
