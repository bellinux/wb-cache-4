5000|$|Serenade {{tells the}} story of poor <b>vineyard</b> <b>worker</b> Damon Vincenti (Mario Lanza), who becomes an operatic tenor, and is {{involved}} with two women [...] - [...] one a high society hostess, Kendall Hale (Joan Fontaine), the other a Mexican bullfighter's daughter, Juana Montes (Sara Montiel). The tenor has a breakdown because of his unrequited love for the society woman, but finds love (and a happy ending) with the Mexican girl. Highly melodramatic, the film features a great deal of operatic music, all of it sung by Lanza. Of note are the Act III Monologue from Verdi's Otello and an extract from the duet [...] "Dio Ti Giocondi" [...] from the same opera featuring Metropolitan Opera soprano Licia Albanese.|$|E
50|$|The film {{begins with}} the contorted body of the woman, covered in frost. From this image, an unseen and unheard {{interviewer}} (the voice of Varda herself) puts the camera on the last men to see her {{and the ones who}} found her. The action then flashes back to the woman, Mona (Sandrine Bonnaire) walking along the roadside, hiding from the police and trying to get a ride. Along her journey she meets and takes up with other vagabonds such as herself as well as a Tunisian <b>vineyard</b> <b>worker,</b> a family of goat farmers, a professor researching trees, and a maid who envies what she perceives to be a beautiful and passionate lifestyle. Mona explains to one of her temporary companions that at one time she had an office job in Paris and did very well for herself, but she became unsettled with the way she was living - choosing instead to wander the country free from any responsibility, picking up what she could to survive as she goes. Throughout the film, Mona's condition seems to become progressively worse until she finally falls where we first saw her, frozen and entrenched in her misery in a ditch.|$|E

50|$|The town {{is known}} for its strong labor movement. Farm workers revolted against landowners in the 19th century In the 1930s, {{according}} to Joe Foweraker, the <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers</b> had a close relationship with their work, and a humanist tradition.

Despite the health risks associated with this line of work, many agricultural workers lack health insurance or {{access to health care}} services. The {{purpose of this study was}} to collect demographic data and investigate the musculoskeletal health of Latino migratory <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers.</b> A physical therapy team collected demographic data at health clinics held at vineyards in Oregon. Nearly half (48. 4 %) of all <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers</b> reported experiencing musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) in at least one region of the body. The primary region of reported MSS was the back (32 % of all men and 43. 7 % of all women). In most cases, those who reported MSS were significantly older than those who did not report MSS.

50|$|Helvécia {{was founded}} in 1892 by Swiss-born teacher Heinrich Eduard Weber (Wéber Ede in Hungarian). After the great {{phylloxera}} epidemic that had destroyed much of the historical vineyard plantings in the 1870s, sandy soils of the Great Plains became much more valuable for grape cultivation than before. Helvécia was settled by 501 <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers,</b> most {{of them from the}} Balaton wine country. It gained independence of nearby Kecskemét in 1952.|$|R
25|$|The Greeks practiced {{an early}} form of pigeage when grapes {{were ready for}} crushing. Wicker baskets filled with grapes were placed inside wooden or {{earthenware}} vats with a rope or plank above. <b>Vineyard</b> <b>workers</b> grasped the rope for balance to crush the grapes with their feet, occasionally {{to the accompaniment of}} a flute played in a festive manner. After crushing, the grapes were placed in large pithoi, jars where fermentation took place.|$|R
5000|$|The name Vespaiola {{is derived}} from the Latin vespa and refers to the wasps that are {{attracted}} to the high sugar content in the grapes as they ripen late into the growing season.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{quantify}} the UV exposure of <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers</b> was carried out using polysulphone dosimetry. The study took place in Tuscany (Italy) involving 32 <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers,</b> covering three different stages of the vine's growth. The level of personal exposure expressed as a function on the available ambient UV radiation was determined. We also assessed skin reflectance parameters, pre and post exposure. It was found that during spring backs received between 53 % and 87 % of ambient exposure and arms between 30 % and 60 %. During summer, the workers received on the back between 36 % and 77 % of ambient exposure and between 19 % and 43 % of ambient exposure on the arm. The comparison with the occupational UV exposure limit showed that all subjects received UV exposures {{in excess of the}} limit. The exposure of back of neck exceeded 10 SED (assumed as a threshold level of sun-adapted skin for Mediterranean subjects) in spring, which means {{that in the case of}} non sun-adapted skin and without sun protection, erythema can be induced in this targeted population. The cumulative exposure was also estimated under specific assumptions of UV exposure giving values in some cases higher than previous studies.

25|$|Pliny was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for training vines up trees in a pergola, noting that the finest wines in Campania all derived from this practice.

He described some contemporary varieties, recommending Aminean and Nomentan as the best. Ampelographers believe that two white wine varieties mentioned, Arcelaca and Argitis, may be early ancestors to the modern grape Riesling.|$|R
40|$|Objectives : Copper-based {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as agricultural fungicides for many years. Their use in Australia is escalating with increase in the scale of planting and associated pest problems. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify viticulture activities associated with high exposure to foliage sprays. It would be determined if occupational exposure of <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers</b> to copper-based sprays was associated with raised body copper levels through analysis of saliva and buccal cells. Methods : The activities of six <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers</b> from four <b>vineyards</b> in the Yarra Valley Victoria, Australia, were monitored over a period of 2 years. During this period, workers carried out seasonal activities, including fungicide spraying, canopy management, and tractor operation. Saliva and buccal cells from workers were collected and analysed for copper levels that were then correlated with the different types of vineyard activity. Results : The buccal cells of <b>vineyard</b> <b>workers</b> exposed to copper through seasonal activities including fungicide spraying, canopy management, and tractor operation contained copper levels of 0. 87, 1. 24, and 0. 95 ng Cu per 106 cells, respectively. This was up to 10 -fold higher than the copper levels in buccal cells from the control subjects (0. 1 ng Cu per 106). Copper levels in buccal cells from workers participating in other viticulture activities such as shoot thinning, bunch counting, and disbudding were not significantly different from those of control subjects. The levels of copper in saliva samples of both <b>workers</b> undertaking any <b>vineyard</b> activity and control subjects were below the level of detection. Conclusions : Seasonal activities undertaken in vineyards that involved direct contact with copper, in particular canopy management, fungicidal spraying, and tractor operation were associated with high copper levels in buccal cells of workers. This indicates that copper derived from copper-based fungicidal compounds is accumulated within body cells. The lack of detectable copper levels in saliva suggests that the route of transport of copper into buccal cells is not through saliva. The results indicate potential adverse health risks associated with use of copper fungicide. Recommendations are made in relation to the precautions that should be taken in relation to use of copper sprays and to validate buccal cells as an indicator of body copper status. <br /...|$|R

2500|$|Wine expert Hugh Johnson has {{suggested}} that the unappealing thought of drinking wine made from fungus-infested grapes may have caused Sauternes producers to keep the use of Botrytis a secret.
