The consequence of the hygroscopic growth of pharrnaceutical aerosols is a change in their deposition characteristics, such that there is an increase in the total amount deposited in the lung. In this study the hygroscopic growth of disodium fluorescein (DF) aerosol powders was investigated by coating the powders with lauric and capric acids. The coating procedure was carried out in dichloromethane and chloroform, which acted as cosolvents for the fatty acids. An assessment of the extent {{and the nature of the}} coating was carried out. The qualitative assessment of the coating was achieved by infra-red spectroscopy, electronscanning chemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The quantitative analysis was carried out by differential refractometry, ultra-violet spectroscopy and gas liquid chromatography. These powders were generated under conditions approaching those in the lung, of 97 % relative humidity and 37 "C. Coated and uncoated DF aerosol powders were introduced into a controlled temperature and relative humidity apparatus, designed and constructed for the investigation of hygroscopic growth in these studies. A <b>vertical</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> device was used to generate the powders. Under conditions of controlled temperature and relative humidity mentioned, the growth ratio of disodium fluorescein alone was 1. 45 compared with 1. 68, for a nominal coating of DF with lauric acid of 0. 12 gg- 1, 1. 0 for a nominal lauric acid coating of 0. 2 gg- 1, and 1. 02 for a nominal capric acid coating of 0. 18 gg- 1. The range of control of hygroscopic growth of these aerosols has implications for the deposition of these preparations in the respiratory tract. These implications are discussed in the light of the current knowledge of the effects of hygroscopic growth on the deposition of pharmaceutical and environmental aerosols.

Single phase fluid-rotor heat-transfer coefficients hr are presented for rotor angular velocities rad s- 1 and volumetric throughflow rates m 3 s- 1.

Here, using a ferromagnetic-semiconductor GaMnAs-based <b>vertical</b> <b>spin</b> MOSFET with a GaAs channel layer, we demonstrate a large drain-source current IDS modulation by a gate-source voltage VGS with a modulation ratio up to 130 %, {{which is the largest}} value that has ever been reported for <b>vertical</b> <b>spin</b> {{field-effect transistor}}s thus far. We find that the electric field effect on indirect tunneling via defect states in the GaAs channel layer is responsible for the large IDS modulation.

Furthermore, we find that the TMR ratio can be modulated by VGS. This result mainly originates from the electric field modulation of the magnetic anisotropy of the GaMnAs ferromagnetic electrodes as well as the potential modulation of the nonmagnetic semiconductor GaAs channel layer.

40|$|The <b>spinning</b> cloth <b>disc</b> reactor (SCDR) is an {{innovative}} enzymatic reaction intensification technology. The SCDR uses centrifugal forces {{to allow the}} spread of thin film across the <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> which has a cloth with immobilized enzyme. Research has shown this geometry promotes accelerated reactions due to high mass transfer rates and rapid mixing. In this study, the flow regimes in the SCDR were characterized by means of residence time distribution (RTD) analysis and visual study tracking dye staining. RTD analysis showed that the flow pattern on the <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> with/without cloth became closer to plug flow with an increase of spinning speed and flow rate. With the cloth, the equivalent number of tanks-in-series was at least 2 times lower than that without cloth at different spinning speeds and flow rates, indicating the flow is better mixed, {{in contrast to the}} typical plug flow found for conventional <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactor. Two flow regimes were observed in the visual study with the dye spreading within the spinning cloth: radial finger-like flow and concentric flow. At low spinning speeds and high flow rates, the flow was {{in the form of a}} few random and uneven radial streams, with the zone between these streams free of dye. At higher spinning speeds and lower flow rates, this uneven radial flow was replaced by an even concentric flow. Using tributyrin hydrolysis as a model reaction, a SCDR reactor mathematical model based on perfectly mixed model was developed to simulate the variation in SCDR conversion with spinning speed and flow rate, and the model fitted well with the experimental data.

40|$|An {{engineering}} model for single-phase flow in a multi-stage rotor–stator <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactor is presented. The model {{is based on}} residence time distribution data, obtained by tracer injection experiments. Measurements are done for gap ratios of G = 0. 017 and 0. 03, rotational Reynolds numbers of Re = 4. 4 × 104 to 2. 05 × 106 and superposed dimensionless throughflow rates of Cw = 127 – 421. A single rotor–stator cavity can be described by regions of radial plug flow at low radial disc positions, in combination with a single ideally mixed region at high radial positions. The radial position where transition between plug flow and ideally mixed regions occurs decreases with increasing rotational Reynolds number and gap ratio, and increases with increasing superposed throughflow rate. The resulting flow model is explained by the throughflow and rotation dominated regions observed in rotor–stator cavities with superposed throughflow. The model {{can be used to}} quantify performance characteristics of rotor–stator <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactors, without application of extensive numerical simulations. Results indicate that the model can be scaled up with any number of rotor–stator cavities in series, as well as with increasing disc radius and gap ratio.

40|$|The {{ultraviolet}} irradiated thin lm coated <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactor {{is a new}} technol- ogy for the intensication of heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions. This reactor {{has previously}} {{been found to have}} a reaction rate maxima for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue across a <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactor. The reaction rate maxima occurred at an intermediate flow rate of 15 mL/s and rotational speeds of 100 and 200 rpm, where the reaction kinetics switched from first order to second order with a change in the flow structure. The findings of this work show that the reaction rate maxima is most likely in part caused by periodic forcing from the peristaltic pump increasing the mass transfer of the oxygen. The enhancement in the rate of oxygen transfer {{to the surface of the}} disc would increase the charge carrier separation in the catalyst, increasing the reaction rate kinetics. Oxygen being a second limiting reactant would also explain the presence of the second order kinetics. The flow regimes on the surface of the disc change between smooth, spiral and irregular waves depending on the flow rate and rotational speed. The effect of flow rate modulation only occurs when the flow is undisturbed by asymmetric outflow conditions interfering with the flow regime otherwise present on the disc. The initial surface rate of reaction for methylene blue was approximately 0. 5 x 10 ^(- 7) mol/m 2 /s for most operational conditions, but the fast rate of reaction achieved with periodic forcing was 3. 7 x 10 ^(- 7) mol/m 2 /s, seven times greater than that achieved without the periodic forcing.

40|$|Process {{intensification}} tools, {{such as the}} capillary reactor, offer several {{benefits to}} the chemical process industries due to the well-defined high specific interfacial area available for heat and mass transfer, which increases the transfer rates, and due to low inventories, they also enhance {{the safety of the}} process. This has provided motivation to investigate three such tools, namely the capillary microreactor, <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> and rotating tube reactors, in this study. The gas-liquid slug flow capillary microreactor intensifies reactor performance through internal circulation caused by the shear between the continuous phase/wall surface and the slug axis, which enhances the diffusivity and consequently increases the reaction rates. However, integrating the complex hydrodynamics of this reactor with its chemical kinetics is a mathematically challenging task. Therefore, in this study, a simple-to-complex approach, using a set of state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamic tools, has been used. Firstly, simulations were performed without any chemical reaction to ascertain the extent of slug flow regime. The model also clearly captured the slug flow generation mechanism which can be used to structurally optimize the angle of entry in these reactors. Finally, the hydrodynamic model was also capable of estimating the pressure drop and slug lengths. After successfully simulating the hydrodynamics of the system, a reaction model was incorporated to study the chemical reaction kinetics. The results were compared with the published experimental work and were found to be in good agreement. The <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactor utilizes the centrifugal and shear forces to generate thin liquid films characterized with intense interfering waves. This enables a very high heat transfer coefficients to be realized between the disc and liquid, as well as very high mass transfer between the liquid and the bulk gas phase. The waves formed also produce an intense local mixing with very little back mixing. This makes a <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactor an ideal contactor for multiphase processes. The focus of this study has been to elucidate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the liquid film flow over the horizontal <b>spinning</b> <b>disc.</b> Investigations were also performed to elaborate the local and overall hydrodynamic characteristics of a fully developed <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> reactor. Simulation results showed a continuous linear liquid film on the horizontal <b>spinning</b> <b>disc</b> and intense mixing performance in the annulus of the reactor around the disc surface.
