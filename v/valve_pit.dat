50|$|Over {{the next}} {{thirteen}} months {{the progress of}} the water tower was regularly reported in the Johnstone River Advocate. In December 1933, a total of 19 men were employed, 14 full-time and 5 part-time. The columns had been concreted to a height of 14 feet (4.27 metres), the central tower to 21 feet (6.4 metres), with the 27 feet (8.23 metres) high second staging in preparation of a second lift of the columns. In January the columns were raised to a height of 29.5 feet (8.99 metres), the central tower to 35 feet (10.67 metres) and the pipes and <b>valve</b> <b>pit</b> in the tower had been set in place and tested. Despite being affected by heavy rain in April, the final concrete pour had been made {{to the top of the}} splay under the bottom of the tank, and the floor of the tank, consisting of 200 tons of concrete, was put down in a continuous pour that lasted for 19 hours. On 18 May 1934, 21 local men concreted the wall of the tank which was 13 feet (3.96 metres) high with a circumference of 134 feet (40.84 metres) in a process that took 27 hours. By 6 June the dome of the tank was completed, again in one continuous pour. At 42 feet (12.8 metres) in diameter, it was one of the largest reinforced concrete domes in Queensland. All that was required to finish the job was coating the inside with bitumen and completing the parapet walls and lookout. It is not known if the current paint scheme matches the tower's original exterior finish.During the early stages of construction there was some discussion about taking advantage of the visual prominence of the structure. Advertising and a town clock were suggested; however the Shire Council decided on a lookout, the guard rail for which was erected shortly after the dome on the tank was completed.

The DRR includes the documented comments {{and their respective}} dispositions for this design. Acceptance of the comment dispositions and closure of the review comments is indicated by the signatures of the participating reviewers. Project W- 314 is a project within the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Tank Waste Retrieval Program. This project provides capital upgrades for the existing Hanford tank farm waste transfer, instrumentation, ventilation, and electrical infrastructure systems. To support established TWRS programmatic objectives, the project is organized into two distinct phases. The initial focus of the project (i. e., Phase 1) is on waste transfer system upgrades needed to support the TWRS Privatization waste feed delivery system. Phase 2 of the project will provide upgrades to support resolution of regulatory compliance issues, improve tank infrastructure reliability, and reduce overall plant operating/maintenance costs. Within Phase 1 of the W- 314 project, the waste transfer system upgrades are further broken down into six major packages which align with the project`s work breakdown structure. Each of these six sub-elements includes the design, procurement, and construction activities necessary to accomplish the specific tank farm upgrades contained within the package. The first design package (AN <b>Valve</b> <b>Pit</b> Upgrades) was completed in November 1997, and the associated design verification activities are documented in HNF- 1893. The second design package, 200 East (200 E) Upgrades, was completed in March 1998. This design package identifies modifications to existing valve pits 241 -AX-B and 241 -A-B, {{as well as several}} new waste transfer pipelines to be constructed within the A Farm Complex of the 200 E Area.

We examined the spatial distribution of Xf in the precibarium of vectors that had been fed on infected grapevines. Xf cells attached on end to the insect’s cuticle and were distributed throughout the precibarium, with few exceptions, on both pharynges. Xf was not present on top of the precibarial valve, but interestingly cells were observed within the <b>valve’s</b> <b>pit.</b> In a transmission experiment with long inoculation access period, all infective insects transmitted Xf to healthy grapevines; individuals free of Xf on the precibarium did not vector the pathogen. An ancillary objective was to determine if the relatively low transmission rates (5 - 15 % daily) by the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS) were influenced by the plant tissue inoculated: stem or leaf. On grape, adult GWSS feed mainly on stems. In an initial experiment with low transmission rates (less than 7 % per GWSS adult) there were no differences among treatments (stem only, leaf only, stem and leaf). This will be repeated with more insects per plant and longer exposure for inoculation, but these initial results suggest that feeding site on green tissues are not a major factor...|$|R

40|$|Waste tank W- 12 is a tank in the ORNL Low-Level Liquid Waste (LLLW) {{system that}} {{collected}} waste from Building 3525. Because of a leaking flange in the discharge line from W- 12 to the evaporator service tank (W- 22) and continual inleakage {{into the tank}} from an unknown source, W- 12 was removed from service {{to comply with the}} Federal Facilities Agreement requirement. The initial response was to decontaminate the <b>valve</b> <b>pit</b> between tank W- 12 and the evaporator service tank (W- 22) to determine if personnel could enter the pit to attempt repair of the leaking flange. Preventing the spread of radioactive contamination from the pit to the environment and to other waste systems was of concern during the decontamination. The drain in the pit goes to the process waste system; therefore, if high-level liquid waste were generated during decontamination activities, {{it would have to be}} removed from the pit by means other than the available liquid waste connection. Remote decontamination of W- 12 was conducted using the General Mills manipulator bridge and telescoping trolley and REMOTEC RM- 10 manipulator. The initial objective of repairing the leaking flange was not conducted because of the repair uncertainty and the unknown tank inleakage. Rather, new piping was installed to empty the W- 12 tank that would bypass the <b>valve</b> <b>pit</b> and eliminate the need to repair the flange.

40|$|Cracks {{found in}} many of the double-shell tank (DST) pump and <b>valve</b> <b>pits</b> bring into {{question}} the ability of the pits to provide secondary containment and remain in compliance with State and Federal regulations. This study was commissioned to identify viable options for maintain/restoring secondary containment capability in these pits. The basis for this study is the decision analysis process which identifies the requirements to be met and the desired goals (decision criteria) that each option will be weighed against. A facilitated workshop was convened with individuals knowledgeable of Tank Farms Operations, engineering practices, and safety/environmental requirements. The outcome of this workshop was the validation or identification of the critical requirements, definition of the current problem, identification and weighting of the desired goals, baselining of the current repair methods, and identification of potential alternate solutions. The workshop was followed up with further investigations into the potential solutions that were identified in the workshop and through other efforts. These solutions are identified in the body of this report. Each of the potential solutions were screened against the list of requirements and only those meeting the requirements were considered viable options. To expand the field of viable options, hybrid concepts that combine the strongest features of different individual approaches were also examined. Several were identified. The decision analysis process then ranked each of the viable options against the weighted decision criteria, which resulted in a recommended solution.

The new OGT line will provide a waste transfer pipeline between these valve pits in support of saltwell pumping activities. The length of the OGT line is approximately 180 ft from pit to pit. The primary pipe is nominal 1 -in. diameter stainless steel (SST) braided Ethylene-propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) hose. The encasement pipe is a nominal 3 -in., flanged, SST pipe made up of several different length pipe spool pieces (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 1 and sh. 2). The OGT line slopes from <b>valve</b> <b>pit</b> 241 -S-B toward <b>valve</b> <b>pit</b> 241 -S-D. At each end, the primary and encasement pipe connect to a pit entry spool piece. The pit entry spool pieces are constructed of prefabricated SST materials. These spool pieces allow for {{the separation of the}} primary and encasement pipelines after the pipes have entered the valve pits (drawing H- 2 - 818280, sh. 2). The pit entry spool pieces also allow for leak detection of the encasement pipe at each end (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 2). The OGT encasement pipeline is supported above ground by adjustable height unistrut brackets and precast concrete bases (drawing H- 2 - 829654, sh. 1). The pipeline is heat-traced and insulated.

40|$|There {{are three}} tanks in the 241 -SY tank farm. Tank 241 -SY 101 and 241 -SY- 103 are {{flammable}} gas watch list tanks. Tank 241 -SY- 102 {{is included in}} the ventilation improvement process in an effort to further control air flow in the tank farm. This tank farm has only one outlet ventilation port for all three tanks. Flammable gas is released (may be steady and/or periodic) from the waste in the primary tank vapor space. The gas is removed from the tank by an active ventilation system. However, maintaining consistent measurable flow through the tank can be problematic due to the poor control capabilities of existing equipment. Low flow through the tank could allow flammable gas to build up in the tank and possibly exceed the lower flammability limit (LFL), prevent the most rapid removal of flammable gas from the tank after a sudden gas release, and/or cause high vacuum alarms to sound. Using the inlet and outlet down stream butterfly valves performs the current method of controlling flow in tank farm 241 -SY. A filter station is installed on the inlet of each tank, but controlling air flow with its 12 inch butterfly valve is difficult. There is also in-leakage through pump and <b>valve</b> <b>pits.</b> Butterfly <b>valves</b> on the downstream side of each tank could also be used to control air flow. However, their large size and the relatively low air velocity make this control method also ineffective. The proposed method of optimizing tank air flow and pressure control capability is to install an air flow controller on the inlet of each existing filter station in SY farm, and seal as best as practical all other air leakage paths. Such air flow controllers have been installed on 241 -AN and 241 -AW tanks (see drawing H- 2 - 85647) ...|$|R

The findings indicated credible downwind lethal / semi lethal threat distance up to 300 meters. The conclusions of the H 2 S toxic risk assessment combined with the inherent safe design guidelines have yielded an entirely new set of requirement for the risk reduction. To start with it was realized that safe distance control room should be constructed and facilities should be designed for the remote operation, utilizing the new trends of foundation field bus, electronic marshaling and SIL- 3 fiber optic sensors. The facility should be access controlled with mandatory PPE requirement of personal H 2 S monitors and personal quick donning (5 sec) escape SCABA (15 minutes capacity). The centrifugal compressors should be new generation design of enclosed and hermetically sealed type, levitated with magnetic bearing, without dry gas seals and oil lubrication.
