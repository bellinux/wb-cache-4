30|$|First, we have {{considered}} several <b>vacancy</b> sizes of single h-BN sheet {{to study the}} size effect of <b>vacancy</b> structures. Because N-terminated <b>vacancy</b> structure of h-BN sheet is more stable structure than B-terminated one [3, 4], we mainly focus on N-terminated triangular <b>vacancy</b> structures. To control <b>vacancy</b> sizes of h-BN sheet, we {{increase the number of}} ejected atoms in h-BN sheet maintaining the triangular shape. The B-terminated <b>vacancy</b> structures after relaxation result in small distortion in their vertex region with weakly binding between B atoms (not shown here) while the N-terminated structures shows a distinct change at the vertices of their triangular <b>vacancy.</b> Among different <b>vacancy</b> sizes of N-terminated triangular shape, we find two types of optimized (i.e., locally stable) structures. One is a symmetric structure (denoted as N-symm) in which no noticeable change of structure at vertex of triangular <b>vacancy</b> is found when compared with the pristine h-BN sheet, whereas the other is a distortion structure (denoted as NN-bond) that shows N-N bonds at all vertices of triangular hole <b>vacancy</b> in h-BN sheet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the <b>vacancy</b> {{migration}} in Cu interconnect of large scale integration caused by stress induced voiding was calculated using the α multiplication method. Then, {{the effect of}} weight coefficient, α, on stress induced <b>vacancy</b> diffusion analysis was investigated and {{the validity of the}} α multiplication method was verified. Furthermore, the method of the <b>vacancy</b> diffusion analysis coupled with thermal stress analysis which can consider the history of thermal stress due to temperature changes was proposed. The results of the <b>vacancy</b> diffusion analysis coupled with the thermal stress analysis were compared with the analytical results of the <b>vacancy</b> migration without the effect of history of thermal stress. As a result, the maximum site of <b>vacancy</b> accumulation was found to be qualitatively in good agreement between them. However, the quantitative value of maximum <b>vacancy</b> concentration obtained by the <b>vacancy</b> diffusion analysis coupled with thermal stress analysis was found to be much higher and the <b>vacancy</b> distribution is found to be much more localized...|$|R
5|$|The {{easiest way}} to produce {{intrinsic}} defects in diamond is by displacing carbon atoms through irradiation with high-energy particles, such as alpha (helium), beta (electrons) or gamma particles, protons, neutrons, ions, etc. The irradiation can occur in the laboratory or in the nature (see Diamond enhancement– Irradiation); it produces primary defects named frenkel defects (carbon atoms knocked off their normal lattice sites to interstitial sites) and remaining lattice <b>vacancies.</b> An important difference between the <b>vacancies</b> and interstitials in diamond is that whereas interstitials are mobile during the irradiation, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, however <b>vacancies</b> start migrating only at temperatures ~700°C.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{the way of}} {{reducing}} the TiO 2 hand gap to enhance the activity of TiO 2 has widely been investigated. In this paper the property of point defects in anatase TiO 2 is investigated and the character of hand structure and density of states is analyzed by using first-principle pseudopotential calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT). It is discovered that the crystal structure was changed due to pulling into vacancy; the nearby oxygen atom has the trend of closing to the oxygen <b>vacancy</b> and keeping off the titanium <b>vacancy,</b> whereas the nearby titanium atom has the trend of closing to the titanium <b>vacancy</b> and keeping off the oxygen <b>vacancy.</b> Oxygen <b>vacancy</b> makes Fermi energy rise about 2. 6 eV and titanium <b>vacancy</b> makes Fermi energy go down. A defect level appeares in the gap about 0. 25 eV above the top of valence hand due to titanium <b>vacancy.</b> Theoretical results show that oxygen <b>vacancy</b> causing conduction hand wider is n-type impurity and titanium <b>vacancy</b> causing conduction hand narrower is p-type impurity; the redundant electrons nearby oxygen <b>vacancy</b> contributed to valence band, which causes the change of the electric populations and alters the local motional property of electrons...|$|R

30|$|We have {{investigated}} the structural and electronic properties of the triangular <b>vacancy</b> structures of h-BN sheet using first-principles calculations. The optimized triangular <b>vacancy</b> structures were found to depend on their <b>vacancy</b> size. The most stable configuration of large <b>vacancy</b> structures has the N-N bond at each vertex of triangular <b>vacancy,</b> which determines its magnetic moments. When the missing of a BN pair occurs {{at the edge of}} triangular <b>vacancy</b> structure with a large hole size in the h-BN sheet, as observed in the experiment, the most stable structure is found to be a face missing structure with formation of N-N bonds. The magnetic moments and LDOS of the optimized structures depend on the missing positions of BN-pair at the edge of triangular <b>vacancy.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the determinants of job <b>vacancy</b> durations in Queensland.

Analysis indicates that important determinants of <b>vacancy</b> duration include the skill level of the <b>vacancy,</b> the accessibility of the region of the <b>vacancy,</b> {{and the size of the}} firm advertising the <b>vacancy.</b> Wage offers are found to have a confounding effect, with higher wage offers apparently associated with longer duration. However, an ancillary regression uncovers evidence of wage posting. Surprisingly, little evidence of variation in <b>vacancy</b> duration across industries is found. Results from a proportional hazard model with shared frailty based on the firm advertising the <b>vacancy,</b> suggest unobserved heterogeneity is also important...|$|R
30|$|Because h-BN sheet {{consists}} of two types of atoms, in contrast to graphene sheet, the edge structures of its clusters, nanoribbons, or nanoholes divide into two types: N-terminated and B-terminated. The most stable structure of the edge of cluster has N-terminated edge with zigzag structure [3, 4]. In previous theoretical studies, the atomic and electronic structures of <b>vacancy</b> structures in single-layer h-BN sheet depend {{on the type of}} termination atoms and their <b>vacancy</b> size [3 – 11]. That is, the calculated stability of triangle <b>vacancy</b> structures and the magnetic properties were found to depend on the type of terminated atoms and <b>vacancy</b> sizes of triangle <b>vacancy</b> due to lone electrons at edge atoms. The triangular <b>vacancy</b> structures were found in experiments for using a free-standing h-BN sheet [12 – 15]. Electron beam irradiation results in increasing size of <b>vacancy</b> structures that maintain triangular shape [12, 13] regardless of the <b>vacancy</b> size.|$|R

5|$|Two <b>vacancies</b> {{occurred}} on the Supreme Court during Tyler's presidency, as Justices Smith Thompson and Henry Baldwin died in 1843 and 1844, respectively. Tyler, ever at odds with Congress—including the Whig-controlled Senate—nominated several men to the Supreme Court to fill these seats. However, the Senate successively voted against confirming John C. Spencer, Reuben Walworth, Edward King and John M. Read (Walworth was rejected three times, King rejected twice). One reason cited for the Senate's actions was the hope that Clay would fill the <b>vacancies</b> after winning the 1844 presidential election.

40|$|Atomic scale {{modelling}} {{methods have}} been used to study the change in <b>vacancy</b> population when H is introduced into the W bulk matrix. <b>Vacancy</b> defects are predicted to dominate in pure W, and the <b>vacancy</b> concentration is expected to be very small.

Clustering of H interstitials in W is predicted to be unfavourable without a W <b>vacancy.</b> H has also been shown to affect the <b>vacancy</b> binding characteristics in W, changing the behaviour from a repelling interaction in pure W, retarding the formation of small <b>vacancy</b> clusters, to an attractive interaction when vacancy-H clusters are considered. The changes in defect behaviour predicted, will have observable implications to operational properties and the application of W in fusion reactor components. © 2014, Elsevier B. V...|$|R

Firstly, there is no single {{answer to the question of}} calculations accuracy of the <b>vacancy</b> formation energy. Secondly, the existing phenomenological theories tacitly assume that the <b>vacancy</b> formation energy and entropy of <b>vacancy</b> formation do not depend on temperature. Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free energy of <b>vacancy</b> formation and its components in a number of metals within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Methods. The <b>vacancy</b> formation energy and entropy in FCC Al, Ag, and Pd are determined as a function of temperature using ab initio methods within a quasi-harmonic approximation. Results. It was shown, that the <b>vacancy</b> formation energy substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of the <b>vacancy</b> formation energy is compensated by the vibrational <b>vacancy</b> formation entropy contribution. The latter appears to be strongly increasing with temperature in the case of Mo. Conclusions. However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of <b>vacancy</b> formation energy in the process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of <b>vacancy</b> formation and strongly increases with temperature. Such underestimation is related to certain problems in quasi-harmonic approximation. ????????????. ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???????? ? ?????? ???? ???????. ??-??????, ??? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ????????. ??-??????, ???????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????????, ??? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ?? ???????????. ???? ????????????. ??????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ?? ??????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????????????? ???????????. ???????? ??????????. ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????? ? ???

40|$|The {{balanced}} market <b>vacancy</b> rate is {{a market}} indicator utilized by housing analysts to determine {{one aspect of the}} private rental apartment market. The act of comparing the observed <b>vacancy</b> rate to the balanced rate supposedly reveals to what degree a market is over- or under-supplied. However, the balanced market <b>vacancy</b> rate is assumed to have the same value for all cities, regardless of market, demographic or legislative factors. An alternative market indicator is the natural <b>vacancy</b> rate as defined by Rosen and Smith (1983). The natural <b>vacancy</b> rate is a rate at which change in real rents is zero. It is assumed that factors such as government regulations have, over time, affected the market. This suggests that the natural <b>vacancy</b> rate is preferable to the balanced market <b>vacancy</b> rate as a market indicator because it considers various socio-economic and demographic variables. A pooled data linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the usefulness of the natural <b>vacancy</b> rate model as a market indicator. Additionally, the components or determinants of the natural <b>vacancy</b> rate were examined using a multiple regression. This study found that a functional relationship existed between the percent change in rent and difference between the observed <b>vacancy</b> rate and the natural <b>vacancy</b> rate. The relationship between the components of the natural <b>vacancy</b> rate and the level of the natural <b>vacancy</b> rate was uncertain. Though the correlation coefficient indicated a strong and direct relationship, caution should be used in interpreting the regression statistics since the sample size was small. Dept. of Geography.
