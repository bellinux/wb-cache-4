5|$|The red wattlebird {{has been}} kept as an aviary bird in Sydney. It is not {{difficult}} to look after but can be <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> to other cage birds. Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is a useful companion shrub as it bears flowers all year round.|$|E
5|$|Oscars {{will often}} {{lay claim to}} {{an area of the}} {{aquarium}} and will be <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> towards other fish encroaching on their newly established territory inside the aquarium or lake. The size of the territory varies depending on the size and aggressiveness of the fish based on its surroundings. Once the oscar establishes a territory, it will vigorously defend it by chasing away other fish.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E
5|$|However, {{their larger}} sizes and <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{behavior}} also {{make them a}} serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with a mental health aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
5|$|To {{bolster the}} new amendment, Grant {{relied on the}} army and signed {{legislation}} creating the Justice Department, primarily to enforce federal laws in the South. Where the attorney general had once been only a legal adviser to the president, he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law, including a solicitor general to argue on the government's behalf in court. Under Grant's first attorney general, Ebenezer R. Hoar, the administration was not <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, Amos T. Akerman, was more zealous.|$|E
50|$|Histologically they {{resemble}} very low-grade fibrosarcomas, {{but they}} are <b>very</b> locally <b>aggressive</b> and tend to recur even after complete resection.

5|$|Following {{a largely}} organic and uncalculated impulse, {{many of these}} new bands infused classic heavy metal with the immediacy of pub rock and the {{intensity}} of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Motörhead; in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> sound based on riffs and power chords, featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls. Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, Saxon, Holocaust, Tygers of Pan Tang, Girlschool, Tank and More are notable performers of this style, which bands such as Atomkraft, Jaguar, Raven and Venom stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti {{gained the}} lead and held it at the lap-180 restart. Junqueira {{attempted}} to pass Servià around the inside for fourth position {{but was unable to}} get ahead. Carpentier attempted to pressure da Matta {{towards the end of the}} race but it was difficult to overtake and he did not want to be <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> and run off the racing line. Vasser set the race's fastest lap during the 210th (and penultimate) lap, competing a circuit of 25.217 seconds. Franchitti maintained the lead for the remainder of the race and crossed the start-finish line after 211 laps to win the race. Da Matta was second, ahead of Carpentier in third, Servià was fourth and Junqueira fifth. Takagi, Vasser, Bräck, Manning, and Andretti rounded out the top ten finishers. Jourdain, Dixon, and Domínguez were the last of the classified finishers. It was Franchitti's third (and final) victory of the season, his first win on an oval track in CART, and the tenth (and final) of his career. There were nine lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Bräck's total of 134 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Franchitti led three times, for a total of 58 laps.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, the horses' habitat {{was made}} part of Namib-Naukluft Park, the largest game reserve in Africa. In 1986, after the {{expansion}} to the park, a movement {{was made to}} remove all horses (which were considered an exotic species); public outcry prevented this from happening. The following year, 10 horses {{were removed from the}} park for research purposes and 8 others for use as patrol horses in Etosha National Park, although they were unsuccessful in the latter use. In 1992, as Namibia gained its independence and a drought enveloped southern Africa, a decision was made to reduce the population, then estimated at 276 animals. In June, 104 animals were captured unselectively and sold, but many did not adjust well to their new habitats and by 1997 at least half had died. In 1997, with the feral population at 149 horses, 35 horses, selected for age, gender and degree of genetic relationship, were removed, with the intent being to sell them at auction. The horses were kept in holding pens for six weeks, during which time the stallions became <b>very</b> <b>aggressive</b> and had to be separated; after this, the auction was cancelled and the horses released back to their range. Beginning in December 1993, semiannual population counts have been completed. Between 1993 and 2005, herd numbers ranged between 89 and 149 animals, with the 1999–2001 counts providing sub-100 population numbers. Although several attempts were originally made to exterminate the horses, due to a possible threat to oryx habitat, they are now protected by the South West Africa/Namibia Directorate of Nature Conservation. The Namib Desert Horse is likely the only herd of feral horses in Africa.|$|E
