This can include removing pollution after {{it has already been}} emitted into air, water, or soil.

The purpose of this policy is for all polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of mitigation.|$|E
5|$|The Depression {{began in}} the United States in October 1929 and grew {{steadily}} worse to its nadir in early 1933. President Herbert Hoover feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important American values. His laissez-faire views appeared to be shared by the Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon. To combat with the growing economic decline, Hoover organized a number of <b>voluntary</b> <b>measures</b> with businesses, encouraged {{state and local government}} responses, and accelerated federal building projects. However his policies had little or no effect on economic recovery. Toward the end of his term, however, Hoover supported several legislative solutions which he felt might lift the country out of the depression. The final attempt of the Hoover administration to rescue the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (which provided funds for public works programs) and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) (which provided low-interest loans to businesses).|$|E

2500|$|While it has {{not been}} the norm, {{employee}} participation rights in corporate governance have existed in many specific sectors, particularly universities, and many workplaces organised as partnerships. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977 required all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first [...] "codetermination" [...] laws in the world. However, as many of those Acts were updated, the Companies Act 2006 today still has no general requirement for workers to vote in the general meeting to elect directors, meaning corporate governance remains monopolised by shareholding institutions or asset managers. By contrast in 16 out of 28 EU member states employees have participation rights in private companies, including the election of members of the boards of directors, and binding votes on decisions about individual employment rights, like dismissals, working time and social facilities or accommodation. At board level, UK company law in principle allows any measure of employee participation, alongside shareholders, but <b>voluntary</b> <b>measures</b> have been rare outside employee share schemes that usually carry very little voice and increase employees' financial risk. Crucially, the Companies Act 2006 section 168 defines [...] "members" [...] as those with the ability to vote out the board. Under section 112 a [...] "member" [...] is anybody who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members' register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work.

An SE may have a two-tiered board, as in German companies, where shareholders and employees elect a supervisory board that in turn appoints a management board responsible for day-to-day running of the company. Or an SE can have a one tiered board, as every UK company, and employees and shareholders may elect board members in the desired proportion.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The U. S. tax system is based on voluntary reporting. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reviews all tax returns after they are filed to ensure compliance with tax laws governing this voluntary system. Despite these efforts, each year {{billions of dollars in}} taxes owed are not voluntarily reported and paid, which could result in reduced revenue to fund federal programs, higher tax rates, or both. There are three types of voluntary compliance measures: filing compliance, which measures the percent of taxpayers who file returns in a timely manner; payment compliance, which measures the percent of tax payments that are paid in a timely manner; and reporting compliance, which measures the percent of actual tax liability that is reported accurately on returns. This report reviews the status of IRS' plans to <b>measure</b> <b>voluntary</b> reporting compliance as well as six other federal programs that currently <b>measure</b> <b>voluntary</b> compliance. GAO found that IRS has tried to develop an approach for <b>measuring</b> <b>voluntary</b> compliance. It has established objectives and guiding principles for developing this measure as well as developed database software to collect and analyze data. As of March 2001, IRS' preliminary draft plan included four alternatives for <b>measuring</b> <b>voluntary</b> reporting compliance. GAO found that each of the six programs measure compliance by gathering different types and amounts of information from a random sample of clients. Sample sizes range from about 1, 400 to more than 500, 000 annually. In all but one program, clients are randomly selected and interviewed in person. ...|$|R
