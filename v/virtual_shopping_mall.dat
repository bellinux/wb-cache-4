Technology developments {{and the use of the}} Internet made users to expect more services, which help to improve the user's life. Using a 3 D virtual environment and adding a shopping idea to it is considered as very interesting, especially if it reflects the real world in a virtual reality that make its users attached to it. Furthermore, the possibility of having an avatar to represent themselves in computer-mediated virtual environment help users to explore the virtual environment. Another advantage is that users have the possibility to invite friends and to navigate inside a 3 D Virtual-shopping mall not alone but together, which gives the user the capability to socialise inside the mall. Besides, changing of the customer's profile and chatting with friends is supported, too. Moreover, the transformation process from a two-dimensional environment to a three-dimensional environment is considered to be convenient for both, customers and mall owners.   I have used phenomenology to investigate this new phenomenon. In addition the data was gathered by interviewing several participants from different educational levels as well as business owners of 3 D virtual malls.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the application of}} Collaborative Virtual Environments- CVEs in the WWW (multiplayer games, <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>malls,</b> <b>virtual</b> cities etc). However, most of the existing CVEs supporting systems are tuned to specific tasks and their architecture are, typically, tightly coupled to the applications. This makes any modification to the application dependent on programming, making CVEs construction and extension in large scale a challenging task. The ability to change an application without having to stop it is an importat non-functional requirement for CVEs (extensibility), especially {{if they are to be}} provided as web services, available around the clock. This paper presents a novel solution to building and extending CVEs through the integration of interactive non-linear stories and Virtual Reality concepts.

Although the same technique can be adopted to simulate crowds of virtual humans in a shared virtual world, it remains a great challenge to simulate the high-level intelligent behavior of a virtual human with planning capabilities. In this paper, we present a shared virtual environment crowded with real and virtual users. Virtual users, controlled by a world manager, are simulated in groups, {{each of which is}} led by an intelligent group leader. At run time a world manager can interactively assign a goal configuration to each group leader, and the system will automatically generate collision-free paths that bring the leaders to the goals. Since we allow multiple groups to move simultaneously in the virtual world, we adopt a decoupled path-planning approach, in which the paths being executed by the other leaders be- come the motion constraint of the current leader under consideration. The remaining members in a group follow the motion of the leader with emergent behaviors such as flocking.

The system provides a generic kernel for evaluating user inputs and additional pieces of information from situational, personal, and functional context.

In case an error is likely to occur or detected, a context-adequate dialog output is generated.

This project deals with developing an e-commerce platform for marginalized communities of the Eastern Cape region, South Africa. An online “shopping mall” to support the marketing of art and crafts from disadvantaged communities is presented, with Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP (LAMP) as the development environment.

Customers are not provided with the same shopping experience as they would in an actual store or mall. This experience, however, {{can be achieved by}} the creation of a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>mall</b> environment, simulating most of the actual shopping user interactions. The virtual mall brings together the services and products of various vendors. Users can navigate through the virtual shopping malls, adding items of interest into a virtual shopping cart, and perform searches assisted by 'intelligent agents'. A Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) can realize a sophisticated virtual shopping application. In such a CVE, a large number of potential users may interact with each other. In this paper, vCOM, a VRML and Java 3 D-based prototype is presented, which permits users to navigate around virtual e-commerce worlds and perform collaborative shopping and intelligent searches with the assistance of software agents, in order to find the products and services of interest to them. They can then negotiate with sales agents to bargain for the best possible price and then make a secure buying transaction. The virtual mall prototype also allows the user to communicate with an 'intelligent shopping assistant' using simple voice commands. This assistant interacts with the shopper using voice synthesis and helps him/her use the interface to efficiently navigate in the mall.

The objective of this study was to clarify 1) the significance of VST by comparing VST with other conventional tests, 2) the applicability of VST to brain-damaged patients, and 3) the performance of VST in relation to age differences. [Methods]The participants included 10 patients with brain damage, 10 age-matched healthy subjects for controls, 10 old healthy subjects, and 10 young healthy subjects. VST and neuropsychological tests/questionnaires about attention, memory and executive function were conducted on the patients, while VST and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were conducted on the controls and healthy subjects. Within the VST, the participants were asked to buy four items in the <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>mall</b> quickly in a rational way.

The mean number of times referring to hints and the mean number of movements were significantly larger for the patients with brain damage, and the mean total time was significantly longer for the patients than for the controls.

Then, a presentational audio-video continuous-media retrieval application is illustrated to show how to control stream retrieval In the third part, a real-time extension proposal to HLA and an architecture of real-time RTI is presented. The Internet is moving to Quality of Service (QoS) age, which will provide delay and jitter bounded services. With the IP QoS and real-time operating systems involved, it is shown that HLA can support real-time DIS by taking advantages of these new technologies.
