40|$|THE {{fact that}} vitamin B,old {{nomenclature}} (1), consisted {{of at least}} two factors, one of which was more heat-stable than the other, was perhaps first clearly demonstrated by testing one <b>vitamin</b> <b>preparation</b> on two species of animals.

40|$|Professor Buytendijk’s miracle drug. The <b>vitamin</b> <b>preparation</b> Eviunis and {{the risks}} of {{scientists}} doing publicity work The discovery of vitamins {{at the start of}} the 20 th century not only stimulated new areas of scientific research in the field of nutrition and pharmacy; vitamins also turned out to be profitable products for new or existing industries. Consequently, vitamins drove scientists and commercial vitamin producers into each others’ arms during the first decades of the century. Several publications – by Harmke Kamminga and Sally Horrocks for instance – deal with the causes and effects of forms of co-operation between science and industry in the nutritional and pharmaceutical sector. They mostly stress – using examples from Great- Britain – the interconnected interests from which both profited: industry-sponsored vitamin research made vitamins available to a larger public of consumers, with scientists authorizing the health claims of the products these companies tried to sell. This article shows how Dutch scientists and vitamin producers were concerned with the same issue in the inter-war period. Not only does it focus on the interconnected interests, but particularly on the conflicts of interests scientists were experiencing whilst performing advisory or research work for the industry. The article singles out F. J. J. Buytendijk, nowadays remembered for his pioneering research in the field of phenomenological psychology after the Second World War, and his involvement with the Swiss <b>vitamin</b> <b>preparation</b> Eviunis at the end of the nineteen-twenties. Buytendijk actively promoted the introduction of this particular preparation on the Dutch market. He was confronted with a growing number of critics, however, after tests demonstrated how the preparation could hardly sustain any of the claims that had been made with regard to its vitamin-like performance. Buytendijk’s strongest critics accused him of misusing his scientific authority to sell a fraudulent product – after all, he that maintained his own tests had confirmed Eviunis’ claims. A final, state-ordered counter test of Eviunis resulted in the ban of the preparation from the Dutch market. However, it did not condemn Buytendijks commitment to the product. It only concluded that the physiologist had been mistaken in his interpretation of the working of Eviunis. Buytendijk’s reputation as a vitamin researcher compromised nonetheless, because of his spirited commitment to a product that turned out to sell an illusion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Acrobic acid is key {{substance}} {{in the human}} metabolism and the rapid and accurate determination in food {{is of a great}} interest. Ascorbic acid is an electroactive compound, however poorly responded on the bare carbon paste electrodes. In this paper, brilliant cresyl blue and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were used for the modification of carbon paste electrode. Brilliant cresyl blue acts as a mediator improving the transition of electrons, whereas multiwalled carbon nanotubes increased the surface of the electrode. Both brilliant cresyl blue and multiwalled carbon nanotubes were added directly to the composite material. The electrochemical behavior of modified electode was determined in electrolyte at various pH, and the effect of the scan rate was also performed. It was shown that the electrochemical process {{on the surface of the}} modified carbon paste electrode was diffusion-controlled. The resulted modified carbon paste electrode showed a good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of ascorbic acid at a reduced overpotential of + 100 mV descreasing the risk of interferences. A linear response of the ascorbic acid oxidation current measured by the amperometry in the range of 0. 1 - 350 µmol. L - 1 was obtained applying the sensor for the standard solution.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{patient with}} {{multiple}} injuries developed a severe coagulation defect {{due to a}} deficiency of vitamin K. None of the usual predisposing factors was present and the patient's diet was very poor. Dietary deficiency of vitamin K {{and the importance of}} antibiotic therapy in its production are discussed. Vitamin K deficiency is usually due to long-standing complete obstruction to the common bile duct or, more rarely, to malabsorption. Vitamin K dependent clotting factors are reduced by oral anticoagulants. Dietary deficiency of vitamin K has rarely been described and there has been some doubt whether it occurs in man as a clinical problem. Case report In February 1976 a 60 -year-old woman was involved in a road accident. She sustained a head injury and compound fractures of both legs. Recovery was slow and {{for the next six months}} she remained drowsy and very reluctant to feed, her diet consisting mainly of orange and glucose drinks with a multi-vitamin preparation which does not contain vitamin K. Her compound fractures became infected and she was treated with penicillin in various forms, gentamicin, tetracycline, and co-trimoxazole (Septrin). She then developed long-standing inter-mittent diarrhoea which was treated with codeine phosphate. She also received a strong analgesic mixture regularly as it was thought likely that she would soon die. All antibiotics were stopped and 46 days later (six months after the accident) she began to bleed per urethram. Bruising of the limbs was noted together with bleeding gums and purpura. A clinical diagnosis of scurvy was made initially but then it was realised that the patient had received ascorbic acid, 25 mg daily, in the <b>vitamin</b> <b>preparation</b> and this diagnosis was not pursued further.

40|$|Rationale: Patients on {{long-term}} home parenteral nutrition (HPN) receive a <b>vitamin</b> <b>preparation</b> with a fixed {{combination of all}} vitamins without vitamin K according to ESPEN guidelines. The current reference range of vitamin D level is controversial and its extraskeletal functions are partly unclear. Every day patients achieve 220 IE cholecalciferol intravenously. The majority of the patients show cholecalciferol serum concentrations below the current reference range. The analysis of the laboratory findings is expected to clarify the influencing factors on vitamin D level and to reveal if patients suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Methods: Since 1994 the Surgical Department of Charité University Hospital Berlin treats 821 patients {{on long-term}} HPN. In order to adapt HPN {{to the requirements of}} the patients, laboratory examinations were done every two months. The analysis provides the first laboratory data {{at the beginning of the}} HPN and the last data after 63. 3 ± 105. 6 weeks. Results: At the beginning 78. 2 % of the cholecalciferol serum concentrations are below 50 nmol/l. Due to the daily infusions the cholecalciferol level increases significantly from 29. 3 nmol/l to 35. 5 nmol/l. Decreased calcium and magnesium level as well as a secondary hyperparathyroidism can be observed in quite a few patients. These can be symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. But there are more patients with cholecalciferol < 50 nmol/l and coexistent ordinary calcium, magnesium and parathormone level. There are no differences between men and women regarding the cholecalciferol. The length of HPN, the age and the BMI of the patients have probably no bearing on the vitamin D level. But the analysis depicts seasonal variations in cholecalciferol level. The increased sunlight exposure in summer months leads to higher serumconcentration. Conclusion: There are no clear proofs of a vitamin D deficiency. It must be assumed that the majority of the patients has a vitamin D deficiency in theory because the reference range seems to be set too high regarding the current stand of research. In addition healthy people worldwide have a median cholecalciferol concentration below the reference range. Furthermore patients acquire calcium homeostasis although their cholecalciferol level is 50 nmol/l...|$|E

40|$|Objective   To {{explore the}} role of amino acids and {{vitamins}} {{in the prevention of}} and recovery from the fatigue related to military operation in the officers and soldiers at high altitude. Methods   The participants were 100 officers and soldiers, whose Modified Fatigue Rating Scale (MFIS) scores were > 21 points. The participants were randomly divided into three groups: capsule, placebo, and granules. Amino acids capsule (8 kinds of essential amino acids and 11 kinds of vitamins were contained), placebo, or amino acid-fructose beverage was given to respective group for 14 days continuously. The 3000 -m running performance of the officers and soldiers stationed on a plateau was measured on the first and 14 th days. The maximal grip strength of the right hand, fist-making times per minute, and the height reaching by the hand after three-step run-up for the same candidate were observed before and after fatigue loading (3000 -m running). The blood levels of lactic acid and urea nitrogen of the candidates were measured after fatigue loading on the first and the 14 th days. Results   The 3000 -m running performance of officers and soldiers in the capsule and granules groups on the 14 th day were better than that of the first day (P P > 0. 05). The diﬀerence between the capsule and the granules groups in grip strength, fist-making times per minute, and hand reaching height on the 14 th day were obviously lower than that on the first day (P P > 0. 05).

Vitamin D deficiency has {{been implicated in}} chronic pain. Immigrant and ethnic minority populations {{have been shown to}} have lower vitamin D levels than native Western populations and often to be vitamin D deficient. This systematic review investigates the relationship between vitamin D and chronic pain in immigrant and ethnic minority populations. Included were studies reporting on 25 -OH vitamin D levels in immigrant/ethnic minority populations affected by chronic pain, and/or reporting on the treatment of chronic pain with <b>vitamin</b> D <b>preparations</b> in such populations. We found that 25 -OH vitamin D levels were low and often deficient in immigrant/ethnic minority populations. Vitamin D levels depended on the latitude of the study location and hence sunlight exposure. There was insufficient evidence to reach a verdict on the value of treating chronic pain in immigrant/ethnic minority patients with <b>vitamin</b> D <b>preparations</b> because the studies were few, small, and of low quality. 1...|$|R
