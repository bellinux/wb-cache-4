Purchasing and supply management are changing more than any other business function in the 21 st Century. There are a plethora of new programs and issues to master. These include: 1.)

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} supply chain {{relationships}} and segmented planning and ICT concepts. Major supplier segments are distinguished based on literature: capacity suppliers, standard suppliers, system suppliers and key suppliers. Next, current supply chain planning solutions are distinguished: <b>vendor</b> <b>managed</b> <b>inventories</b> (VMI), supplier hubs, electronic markets and integrated systems. A framework, with dimensions customisation and integration, linking supplier typologies with supply chain planning solutions is presented. Finally, {{the applicability of}} the framework is tested at a mid-size Danish manufacturer. The case shows that level of customisation and level of integration between buyer and supplier define options for supply chain planning and related ICT solutions...|$|R

40|$|Global trade lanes rely on {{shipping}} companies and operators to transport their goods. This {{may be changing}} as producers increase their control in downstream logistics. We examine how the flow of pulp from Brasilia to main markets in Europe has evolved, and how the roles of producers, ship operators and distributors in the value chain have changed {{and will continue to}} develop. By using an in-depth case study, we show some disruptive changes in the structure and operations of the concerned supply chain. The case company signed a long-term contract with a shipbuilder and operator company to transport its total export volume of wood pulp. Thus, the pulp producer's dedicated fleet enables a move from fluctuating, unreliable pulp shipments towards pre-scheduled, accurate deliveries to destinations within close proximity of the pulp customers' sites. Moreover, the pulp producer under study has also agreed with its key overseas customers that <b>vendor</b> <b>managed</b> <b>inventories</b> (VMIs) will be implemented on a global scale to reduce inventories across the supply chain and improve customer service. In the current body of knowledge, VMI is mainly applicable in local contexts. There are only few cases documenting VMI implementation on a global scale, not to mention in the global maritime context. The case reported could serve as a precedence of novel solutions for supply chains more generally...|$|R
40|$|Consignment is {{a popular}} form of {{business}} arrangement where supplier retains ownership of the inventory and gets paid from the retailer based on actual units sold. The popularity of such an arrangement has come with some continued debates on who should control the supply chain inventory, the supplier or retailer. This paper aims at shedding light on these debated issues. We consider a single period supply chain model where a supplier contracts with a retailer. Market demand for the product is price-sensitive and uncertain. The supplier decides his consignment price charged to the retailer for each unit sold, and the retailer then chooses her retail price for selling the product. We study and compare two different consignment arrangements: The first allows the retailer to choose the supply chain inventory, together with her retail price, and is labeled as a Retailer <b>Managed</b> Consignment <b>Inventory</b> (RMCI) program; and the second calls for the supplier to decide the inventory, together with his consignment price, and is labeled as a <b>Vendor</b> <b>Managed</b> Consignment <b>Inventory</b> (VMCI) program. We show that with an RMCI program, the supply chain loses at least 26. 4 % of its first-best (expected) profit, while with VMCI, it loses just or no more than 26. 4 % of the first-best profit. Second, we demonstrate that both programs lead to an equal split of the corresponding channel profit between the supplier and the retailer. These results indicate that it is beneficial both to the supplier and to the retailer when delegating the inventory decision to the supplier {{rather than to the}} retailer in the channel.

40|$|Research {{questions}} 1. What kind {{of risks}} {{in the supply}} side of HUAWEI supply chain can be identified? 2. How can supply side risks of HUAWEI supply chain be assessed? 3. How can supply side risks of HUAWEI supply chain be mitigated? Purpose This paper describes supply side risks in HUAWEI in China, the types of risks identified, provides guidelines for assessment of these risks and suggestions for mitigation. Methodology In order to answer above research questions empirical data have been collected through observations, interviews at with logistics managers of HUAWEI in China, and from the official documents, annual reports and authentic web pages of the HUAWEI. Â Theoretical framework has been built through scientific articles, peer reviewed journals, authentic web based documents, and textbooks. The information is then assessed and analyzed, which result in conclusion and recommendations for the company. Conclusion There can be four major risks identified on the supply side. Manufacturing risk, logistics risk, information risk and inventory risk. The manufacturing risk include risks related to production, skill, and quality. The logistics risk further include delivery risk, lead time risk, and transportation risk. Production risk and skill risk are critical {{and they can be}} avoided by enhancing risk awareness, evaluating production feasibility, strengthen staff training, investing in high skills, strengthening R&D, and analysis of the external environment. The quality and inbound delivery risks can be reduced through supplier inspection and establishing good supplier relations. Lead time risk and inventory risk can be reduced by <b>vendor</b> based <b>managed</b> <b>inventory</b> system and mass customization. Meanwhile, transportation risk can adopt risk transfer strategy. The information risk can be reduced by increasing information sharing levels and adopting modern communication technologies...|$|R

50|$|A {{stocking}} {{location that}} manages inventory {{according to the}} TOC should help a non-TOC customer (downstream link in a supply chain, whether internal or external) manage their inventory according to the TOC process. This type of help can {{take the form of}} a <b>vendor</b> <b>managed</b> <b>inventory</b> (VMI). The TOC distribution link simply extends its buffer sizing and management techniques to its customersâ inventories. Doing so has the effect of smoothing the demand from the customer and reducing order sizes per SKU. VMI results in better availability and inventory turns for both supplier and customer. More than that, the benefits to the non-TOC customers are sufficient to meet the purpose of capitalizing on the decisive competitive edge by giving the customer a powerful reason to be more loyal and give more business to the upstream link. When the end consumers buy more the whole supply chain sells more.|$|E
