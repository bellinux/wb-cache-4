For the latter, several tests were selected; the Daphnia magna mobility test, the algal growth inhibition test and the inhibition of light emission of Vibrio fischeri were considered as a basic test set. From a methodological point of view, no significant problems were reported during the ring test. A total of 149 tests out of the 161 tests conducted were considered acceptable. The overall {{results showed that the}} D. magna mobility test was highly sensitive to incineration ash and contaminated wood eluates. On the other hand, high variability in the results was observed mainly for the contaminated wood eluate (INC, min-max: 10; WOO, min-max: 31). The CVs were 62 and 103 % for INC and WOO respectively.

40|$|The holt-melt {{extrusion}} {{technique has}} proven to be an advantageous method for preparation of solid dosage forms. The aim of this work was to evaluate the release profiles of sustained release cylinders produced by hot-melt extrusion. The cylinders were composed of inner and outer part, both containing theophylline [1]. Cylinders were 0. 5 cm or 1 cm long. The two parts were extruded separately, cut into pieces and joined manually. Dissolution testing was performed on USP 2 apparatus at rotation speed 50, 100 and 150 rpm. Artificial gastric and intestinal media were used consecutively. Due to their hydrophilic / lipophilic properties inner part of cylinder releases the drug fast while outer part represents extended release component. No influenceof stirring rate on theophyline release was observed for 1 cm cylinders while for 0. 5 cm cylinders the amount of released drug slightly increased with increase of stirring rate (Fig. 1). However, due to high <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> release <b>results</b> significant differences could not be proven. This high <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> release <b>results</b> was beside other factors (poor wettability due to lipophilic components etc.) at least partly ascribed to manual preparation of the dosage forms. Manual joining of the inner and outer part of the cylinder caused void spaces between both parts as shown on the stereomicrographs (Olympus SZX 12) (Fig. 2). The consequence of void spaces is additional free surface available for dissolution which can not be controlled and thus increases the <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> release <b>results.</b> Thus, the automatic simultaneous co-extrusion would be better choice when preparing co-extrudates as void spaces between two parts of cylinders could be avoided and variabilityat least partly reduced...|$|R
