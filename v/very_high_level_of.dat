Hoppus commented to NME that he was {{surprised}} {{it took so long}} to leak and was relieved rather than annoyed that it had, reading warm comments about the album online.|$|E
5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, {{how long a}} turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are. Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E

5|$|MIT {{was elected}} to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a {{research}} university with a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> research activity; research expenditures totaled $718.2 million in 2009. The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million. MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty. In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties. Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{inclined}} elevators {{was intended}} to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with a shorter, easier path to the train platform {{as well as to}} reduce tunneling costs. The two elevators were manufactured by Maspero Elevatori, in Appiano Gentile, Italy, using a controller made on Long Island, speed governors made in Ohio, and buttons and other parts in Queens. The software for the elevator was written in the United States. Maspero Elevatori assembled the elevators in Italy, and they failed an operational test there, prior to being shipped to the United States. The MTA said the manufacturer chose to use American subcontractors in place of local Italian suppliers after reading the specifications the transit agency submitted. The MTA worked with the manufacturer to try to resolve the problems caused by a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> customization.|$|E

Ward extracted a number of important concessions from the party, insisting on a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> personal control – he felt that the party's previous lack of direction was the primary cause for its failure. He also worked to build alliances with the growing labour movement, which was now standing candidates in many seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{remarkable}} and accomplished poems {{in the manuscript}} are both long exercises in a late form of alliterative verse with a superimposed rhyme-scheme: Pater Noster and The Three Dead Kings. Some modern commentators have suggested that these poems cannot be by Audelay, as they show a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> technical skill not immediately apparent in other poems in the manuscript, but others have maintained that they were most probably Audelay's own work.|$|E
25|$|The Highlands Gallery {{contains}} {{native plants}} from South to Central America. Its plants collect {{moisture from the}} air, and from water that drips from the trees above. Due to its drastically higher elevation (3,000–10,000 feet), this room is kept cooler than the Lowlands Gallery (around 65°F) and is kept at a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> humidity {{through the use of}} a misting system, as the Highland Tropics typically receive 200 inches of rain per year.|$|E

25|$|Sometime {{between the}} 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD, the first {{anthropomorphic}} {{representations of the}} Buddha were developed. These were absent from earlier strata of Buddhist art, which preferred to represent the Buddha with symbols such as the stupa, the Bodhi tree, the empty seat, the wheel, or the footprints. But the innovative anthropomorphic Buddha image immediately reached a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> sculptural sophistication, naturally inspired by the sculptural styles of Hellenistic Greece.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 presidential {{election}} {{were carried out}} on 4 January 2004. The election was an outcome of the bloodless Rose Revolution and a consequent resignation of President Eduard Shevardnadze. It {{is well known for}} a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> electoral turnout and also for the number of votes cast for one particular presidential candidate— Mikheil Saakashvili (96%). All other candidates received less than 2% of the votes. In total, 1,763,000 eligible voters participated in the election.|$|E
25|$|The Lowlands Gallery {{contains}} {{plants from}} the tropics of South America (near the equator).

The Rashidun army maintained a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> discipline, strategic prowess and organization, along with motivation and self initiative of the officer corps.

25|$|A {{practice}} {{similar to}} chilla is also performed by Hindustani classical music practitioners at an advanced level.It is called chilla katna. The musicians lock themselves up in a chilla-khana for forty days and practice their instrument severely. A special diet, often omitting meat and grains, is taken {{during this period}} and very little food is eaten. Any contact {{to the outside world}} is avoided during this period. People try not to fall asleep at any cost, if necessary they will tie their hair to a noose at the ceiling. It is done to achieve a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> skill, that cannot be achieved due to normal regular practice. The chilla details may differ between gharanas (musical lineages).|$|E
25|$|The first instar of the {{larval stage}} is between 1.5–3mm long. These larvae {{have been found}} to have a very high {{mortality}} rate when compared to other larvae at this stage of development. There is only approximately a 65% survival rate after this instar. At the second instar, the larvae are 3–7mm long and have a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> viability. During the third instar level, the larvae are 7-19.5mm. This level is broken down into two stages. The first stage is when the larvae continue to feed and collect nutrients needed during pupation. The second stage of development is when the third instar larvae begin the search for a suitable place to pupate where it can begin the pre-pupal stage.|$|E
