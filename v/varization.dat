40|$|Transtrochanteric {{rotational}} osteotomy (TRO) is {{a controversial}} procedure with reported inconsistent results. We reviewed 50 patients (60 hips) who underwent this procedure for extensive osteonecrosis of the femoral head, focusing on <b>varization</b> {{to determine its}} effectiveness as a head-preserving procedure in young adults. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 28  years (range, 18 – 46  years). Using the Ficat-Arlet classification, 40 hips had Stage II and 20 hips had Stage III involvement. According to the classification system of Shimizu et al., the extent of the lesions were Grade C in 54 hips and Grade B in six hips; the location of the lesions were Grade c in 56 hips and Grade b in four hips. Minimum followup was 18  months (mean, 84  months; range, 18 – 156  months). The mean preoperative Harris hip score was 44. 7 points (range, 32 – 62 points) which improved to an average postoperative score of 80. 1 points (range, 44 – 100 points) at the latest followup. Forty-four hips showed no radiographic evidence of progression of collapse. Ten hips showed progressive collapse, seven hips showed progressive varus deformity, three hips had stress fractures of the femoral neck, and one hip had infection. We believe TRO with <b>varization</b> is worth attempting for extensive osteonecrosis of the femoral head in young adults, although failures and complications are not uncommon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSubtalar arthroereisis corrects {{childhood}} and adult reducible valgus flat-foot in certain indications. Inserting an expansion screw in the sinus tarsi simultaneously corrects the calcaneal valgus of the talocalcaneal divergence and first-ray pronation {{if these are}} reducible. The displacement induced in the posterior subtalar joint (decoaptation, translation, rotation) is, however, poorly known. The present study involved arthroscopic assessment of posterior subtalar joint surface displacement during insertion of a talocalcaneal arthroereisis screw, with the hypothesis that displacement varies in three dimensions according to screw size. Material and methodEight specimens {{were used for the}} study. All ankles were supple, taken from adult subjects. A 4. 5 -mm arthroscope was used and measurements were taken with a graduated palpator in the posterior subtalar joint. Three sinus tarsi expansion screws of incremental diameter were assessed. Before and after insertion measurements were made of posterolateral and posteromedial talar exposure on the calcaneus, anteroposterior and lateromedial translation, and talocalcaneal joint-line opening. ResultsMedial rotation, <b>varization</b> and anterior translation of the calcaneus were comparable in all cases. Mean lateral opening of the posterior subtalar joint was 0. 88 mm with 8 -mm screws and 1. 25 mm with 16 -mm screws. Significant differences between 8 and 16 mm screws were found for lateral subtalar joint opening (P= 0. 028) and for lateromedial translation (P= 0. 004). ConclusionSinus tarsi expansion screwing corrects hindfoot valgus and talocalcaneal divergence by inducing medial translation of the calcaneus under the talus and talar medial rotation and <b>varization,</b> proportional to screw size (medial translation and lateral opening of the subtalar joint).

40|$|The {{system of}} {{treatment}} of hip dysplasia that is developed, applied and perfected at FSBI "Scientific and Research Institute for Children's Orthopedics n. a. H. Turner" involves the early entirely functional treatment (Lorenz method, other methods {{are similar in}} gist, providing immobilization with a cast or other devices, are not applied). The operative therapy is performed in primary patients with intrauterine or teratogenic dislocations of the hip. Technology of operative treatment is extremely gentle, sparing. Operations on deepening of socket, iatrogenic affection on cartilage cover, capsular arthroplasty are excluded from the arsenal of surgeons. Anatomy of a children’s dysplastic of hip joints (not subjected to inappropriate conservative or surgical treatment) has several fairly standard options. For each option, there {{is a combination of}} classical operational techniques (tenomyotomy of lumbar-iliac muscle, capsulotomy, detorsion, <b>varization,</b> shortening, medialization, changes in the spatial orientation of the arch or of the whole acetabulum), which have proven on the vast clinical material to be very effective with the right technical performance...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen {{patients}} with a severe form of Perthes disease who underwent containment derotation varus osteotomy (DVO) of the proximal femur were studied retrospectively for the neck-shaft angle (NSA) remodelling. Analysis of results after a mean follow-up of 7 years (minimum of 5 years and maximum of 8. 7 years) showed mean preoperative, immediate postoperative and the latest follow-up neck-shaft angles (NSA) as 135 °, 110 °(none had varus less than 90 °) and 125 °, respectively. A statistically significant relationship between NSA remodelling and the immediate post-op NSA (P = 0. 0035) was established. Patients with smaller postoperative NSA showed bet-ter remodelling compared with those who had high-er degrees of NSA immediately after the surgery. No significant relationship {{was found between the}} degree of NSA remodelling and the patient’s age at diagnosis, age at surgery, severity of Perthes or the Stulberg grading at maturity. The authors conclude that up to 90 ° or more <b>varization</b> after DVO for Perthes disease can remodel with time, and the remodelling process is independent of the patient’s age at diagnosis, age at surgery, or severity of Perthes or Stulberg grading at maturity...|$|E
40|$|For {{evaluating}} pelvic support osteotomy as a {{salvage procedure}} in managing neglected hip problems in {{adolescents and young}} adults, PSO was performed for 20 hips in 20 patients (5 men and 15 women). The mean age was 21. 5  years. The etiology was neglected developmental dysplasia of the hip in 9 patients, post-septic hip sequelae in 9 patients, and paralytic dislocation due to poliomyelitis in 2 patients. All patients were treated by two osteotomies: a proximal femoral osteotomy to support the pelvis and correct the flexion and rotational deformities of the hip and a distal <b>varization</b> and lengthening osteotomy. Final clinical evaluation was done 6  months after frame removal. The mean external fixation time was 6. 4. Lengthening and mechanical axis parallelism was achieved in all patients. At the final follow-up and according to a predesigned scoring system, there were 7 (35 %) excellent results, 6 (30 %) good results, 7 (35 %) fair results, and no poor results. Hip reconstruction by Ilizarov’s concept can be technically demanding and involving lengthy period wearing the frame but {{found to be a}} valuable salvage procedure for numerous neglected hip problems particularly in young patients...|$|E
40|$|Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease {{represents}} avascular necrosis of the femoral head in {{a growing}} child. It commonly affects children aged 2 - 14 years, mostly boys, and has familiar pattern. The etiology of this disease is unknown. It is based on avascular necrosis due to variations of the femoral head vascular supply, trauma, coagulation of endocrine disturbances. The disease presents with limping and pain localized in the hip with projection to thigh and knee, frequently accompanied by the limitation of abduction and internal rotation, as well as slight limitation in flexion of about 20 degrees. Plain radiography is most informative additional diagnostic procedure, enabling assessment of the stage of disease, containment of the femoral head within the acetabulum, acetabular coverage {{and the extent of}} disease. Main treatment goal is obtaining the spherical congruity of the hip joint. This can be achieved by abduction bracing, <b>varization</b> femoral osteotomies and various innominate osteotomies (sometimes combined with femoral osteotomies). Children younger than four years of age, with minimal femoral head involvement, do not need any treatment. These children with a larger involvement, older than four years of age, with possible containment in hip abducion, should be treated by one of the following procedures: Salter innominate osteotomy, Salter innominate osteotomy with femoral shortening, or triple pelvic osteotomy. The patients with containment of the hip is not possible in abduction (related to subluxation and femoral head crush), should be treated by Chiari pelvic osteotomy...|$|E
