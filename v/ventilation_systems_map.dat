40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, {{displacement}} ventilation has been increasingly used in Scandinavia and Western Europe to improve indoor air quality and to save energy. By using a detailed computer simulation method, this study compared the energy consumption of a displacement <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> {{with that of a}} mixing <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> for three types of U.

40|$|Until {{the end of}} 90 -ties all {{dwelling}} {{buildings in}} Latvia were equipped with mandatory natural <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> with stack effect.

40|$|Purpose / Context –The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} indoor environment and energy saving performance of houses, which employ passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems,</b> built in mild climate region and hot humid region in Japan. Methodology / Approach – In this study, investigation of passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems,</b> such as passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> and solar heating panels, have been conducted by two steps. The first step is real measurement of indoor environment and heating energy in houses employing passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> The second is analysis of total primary energy consumption of heating, cooling and ventilation by using a computational program based on the extended heating degree method. Results – From the measurement results, a passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> can be used in the regions from the viewpoint of the indoor environment. From the calculations results, a passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> with a self regulating damper yields less energy than typical mechanical <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> It is confirmed that a solar heating panel have a positive effect on heating energy reduction even in hot humid region. Key Findings / Implications – In mild climate region, indoor environment of the house employing a passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> have almost met the reference values of the Act on Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings in Japan. A solar heating panel works well as an assistant heating system on houses even in hot humid region. In mild climate region and hot humid region, a passive stack <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> which is generally adopted in cold climate regions can be used with less energy by employing a self regulating damper than typical mechanical <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems.</b> Originality - In mild climate region and in hot humid region, where passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> are generally not employed in housing, primary energy consumption and indoor environment of houses employing passive <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> are evaluated by real measurement and computational calculations.  Keywords - Passive Ventilation, Domestic Ventilation, Mild Climates, Hot Humid Climate, Primary Energy Consumptio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{push-pull}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> {{is effective}} for hazardous material exhaustion. Although a push-pull <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> has advantages over a local exhaust hood, some laborious adjustments are required. The pertinence of the adjustments is uncertain {{because it is}} difficult to evaluate the performance of a push-pull <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> quantitatively. In this study, a measurement of the capture efficiency of a push-pull <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> was carried out by means of a tracer gas method. The capture efficiency decreased to 39. 3 – 78. 5 % when blockage material, a dummy worker and a cross draft, were set in the ventilation zone, but the efficiency was 95. 1 – 97. 9 % when the cross draft was stopped. The results suggest that the uniform flow of a push-pull <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> will detour a blockage and the performance of the system will not be reduced unless a cross draft disturbs the uniform flow.
