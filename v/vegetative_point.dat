50|$|Almost all Aponogeton species {{go through}} resting and growth phases {{in their natural}} locations, {{triggered}} by the local ecological conditions. During growth periods the plant will deposit proteins, fats, carbohydrates and mineral substances in the storage rhizome or tuber During the resting period the tuber survives in the soil in order to again sprout during the following vegetation period. Tubers in Aponogeton species have a high resistance to drying out. This ability to store water is exploited, for instance, in the annual export of thousands of dormant A. crispus specimens, shipped in large bags in a totally dry state. Special care has to be taken, however, to prevent the tubers from contracting. At the same time, the <b>vegetative</b> <b>point</b> must not be damaged.|$|E
40|$|The {{programmes}} of {{the tree}} melioration were not based on what is genetically more efficient but rather on what is genetically possible. Even starting with the ‘ 80 s, the researchers stated that the classical melioration strategies can exploit {{only one part of}} the genetic variability, asserting that the vegetative propagation {{is a good way to}} exploit this genetic variability of the woody species, establishing almost 20 advantages for the method of multiplication in vitro. (3) The present paper presents some aspects regarding the capacity of regeneration and multiplication of different types of spruce explants in vitro: meristem, apex, <b>vegetative</b> <b>point,</b> as well as the achievement of callus from mature embryos. This paper has in view the mass of callus, the diameter, colour, consistency and the presence of the meristemoids, as well as, the stages necessary for the acclimatization ex vitro of the spruce plants achieved in vitro...|$|E
40|$|In {{regions with}} {{abundant}} rainfall coffee shows a flowering rhythm {{quite different from}} that in regions with distinct dry and wet periods. Some species and varieties flower only on the first-year wood, other ones also on the older wood. In some flowering lasts much of the year, other bloom heavily for only a short time. To find whether these differences already appear in {{the origin of the}} flowers, descriptions were made of the morphology and development of the branch system, the inflorescence and the flower with Coffea canephora P. var. robusta Linden and C. macrochlamys K. Sch. var. excelsa A. Chev., and besides {{of the structure of the}} inflorescence of C. arabica L. The structure of the inflorescence of Coffea L. was shown to derive from the structure of the vegetative parts of the plant. Eight stages could be distinguished in the development of the <b>vegetative</b> <b>points</b> of third degree into flowers. Between the periodicity of floral initiation on primary side-branches of some Coffea L. spp. and the periodicity of wet and dry periods, different relations were found for different species and varieties, but in the second half of a dry period flowers never arose. Constantly wet regions gave robust plants with few flowers and so smaller yields than regions with periodic drought giving thinner plants with many flowers. Much useful literature on flowering was reviewed. <p/...|$|R
50|$|A bulb's leaf bases, {{also known}} as scales, {{generally}} do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At {{the center of the}} bulb is a <b>vegetative</b> growing <b>point</b> or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a reduced stem, and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. Roots emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. Tunicate bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales. Species in the genera Allium, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, and Tulipa all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as Lilium and Fritillaria species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales.|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The biological {{leaf area index}} data show {{that there can be}} large variations in field <b>vegetative</b> condition from <b>point</b> to point. This is especially true in flood-irrigated fields, in which plant density (and development) varies drastically between rows that are in channels vs. those that are in raised areas. Considerable care must be used in interpreting the significance of isolated leaf area index measurements made from a single wheat row...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to study}} {{characteristics}} and dynamic of elite handball players’ physiological indicators. Material: In experiment elite handball players (n= 112, age 18 - 35 years) participated. For determination of vegetative homeostasis state we analyzed variability of heart rhythm. The researches {{were conducted in}} laboratory conditions in rest state, in lying position during 5 minutes. Results: {{it was found that}} organism’s adaptation reactions to training loads go with different tension of regulation systems. At the end of competition period there appears hyper-kinetic syndrome. It witnessed insufficiency of means, which permit to maintain optimal regulation of cardio-vascular system and increase its functional potentials. Conclusions: indicators of cardio-vascular system and their dynamic w 3 itnessed maintaining of high level of handball players’ organism hemodynamic provisioning. High level of <b>vegetative</b> homeostasis <b>pointed</b> at certain degree of sportsmen’s fitness. Such state is sufficient for preservation of high potential of sympathetic -adrenaline system and overcoming of fatigue processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of tissue}} {{fragments of the}} cotyledon of the pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) cultivated in vitro, with and without the addition of growth regulators 2 -,naphthoxyace|tic acid and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy- acetic acid in concentrations from 10 " 9 — 10 - 5 to the nutrient medium, has been studied. When cultivated on the standard medium without any addition of growth regulators the tissue of the cotyledon developed a discrete callus and well-developed roots of normal appearance on the cut surface of the proximal part. The whole tissue fragment enlarged twice its volume, owing to hypertrophy of mesophyle cells, and to cell divisions inside the tissue, especialy in the neighbourhood of the conducting systems (vessels). The nutritive medium did not inhibit {{the activity of the}} proximal side and it behaved equally regardless whether it was oriented upside or downside. At both orientations the distal side showed only the process of wound healing. In this nutrient medium, having no regulatory substances, the cells showed a tendency to hyperhydrataceous transformation. The applied growth regulators 2 -naphthoxyacetic acid and 2, 4 - -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in concentrations of 1 CT 7 to 10 5 showed striking and similar effects on the growing tissue. At these concentrations both substances inhibited the development of the roots (even if they had already been preformed) regardless whether the proximal or the distal part was deeped into the medium. The proximal as well as the distal part of the tissue fragment proliferated well and developed into big masses of undiferentiated tissue the volume of which was the greater the higher the concentration of the growth regulator employed. The proximal side was more sensitive and reacted more intensely than the distal side. If the distal side of the tissue fragments was oriented outside of the medium it did not react with the growth substances, even not at their highest concentrations. The histological investigations of the newly developed cell masses shoved that they consist of parenchimatic cells and conducting elements. These elements appeared either associated in clusters, series, or as single cells. Single tracheidal elements were especially frequent. At higher concentrations of growth regulators in the newly developed cell masses, islets consisting of small 2 ̆ 7 cells, resembling the cells of <b>vegetative</b> <b>points,</b> were formed. According to all the above facts the tissue of the cotyledon of Cucurbita pepo appears to be very sensitive to the strong growth regulators applied. Thus it seems to be very probable that by further investigation of combined effects of different growth regulators {{it would be possible to}} obtain a strain of undifferentiated tissue which could be permanently subcultivated...|$|R
40|$|Plants were {{regenerated}} from encapsulated shoot tips of pointed gourd. Shoot tips {{isolated from}} multiple shoot cultures of AM- 8 and AM- 15 cultivars of pointed gourd were encapsulated in sodium alginate beads. For germination and shoot proliferation, encapsulated shoot tips (artificial seed) were cultured in MS basal medium containing different concentrations and combinations of BAP and NAA. Use of MS medium resulted in 90 % conversion of encapsulated shoot tips into plantlets. The results exhibited that BAP and combinations of BAP and NAA {{play an important}} role in germination of artificial seed being encapsulated by sodium alginate beads. The plantlets were successfully established in earthen pot. Under the present study, limited experimental efforts have been made to establish the protocol for encapsulating the shoot tips for the production of artificial seed and their subsequent regeneration. It is the first report in Bangladesh in developing artificial seed production technique using <b>vegetative</b> tissue of <b>pointed</b> gourd. Key Words: In vitor propagation, pointed gourd, shoot tips...|$|R
40|$|Rationale : The {{validity}} of experimentally induced panic attacks {{as a model}} to study the pathophysiology of panic disorder has been questioned. Unspecific, unpleasant and aversive effects as well as specific patterns of psycho <b>vegetative</b> symptoms <b>pointing</b> to different subtypes of panic disorder have been observed. These findings {{raise the question of}} challenge paradigms as a valuable tool to identify different vulnerabilities in patients with panic disorder. Methods : We compared the two most widely studied panicogenic drugs sodium lactate and cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK- 4) with placebo in 25 patients with panic disorder and age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. To measure psychophysiological changes, we repeatedly administered the Acute Panic Inventory (API) and visual analogue scales for anxiety and arousal. Cardiovascular (heart rate and blood pressure) and neuroendocrine (ACTH, Cortisol and prolactin) data were recorded simultaneously. Results : In patients with panic disorder, 18 out of 26 experienced a sodium lactate- or a CCK- 4 induced panic attack. Lactate or CCK- 4 -induced symptoms and induced panic attacks were only correlated in healthy controls, but not in patients with panic disorder. (Analysis of sodium lactate- and CCK- 4 -induced changes of cardiovascular and neuroendocrine parameters is in progress at the moment and results will be presented). Conclusions : The mechanisms of lactate and CCK- 4 induced panic attacks are distinct in panic disorder patients but not in healthy controls. Different neurobiological vulnerabilities may be uncovered by different challenges and may indicate differential response to specific therapeutic interventions as well...|$|R
40|$|Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is {{a highly}} clonal marine {{angiosperm}} that can also reproduce sexually through flowering and seed formation. In a previous study, Fst values from six microsatellite loci suggested that a perennial San Francisco Bay subpopulation at Point Molate (Richmond, California) was able to recover from a drastic 2006 die-off through seed recruitment from neighboring eelgrass subpopulations, changing its reproductive strategy from clonal to sexual. Although Fst measures continue to be widely used in population genetics, the assumptions under which they operate are not always appropriate given certain circumstances, such small population sizes and/or asymmetrical migration rates. Our summer research goal was to re-analyze the microsatellite data with the program MIGRATE, which uses coalescent-based analyses to estimate posterior probability distributions for genetic parameters such as effective population size and migration rates. With MIGRATE, we employed a Bayesian approach to infer migration rates between three Point Molate subpopulations (2005, 2007, and 2008) and its neighboring subpopulations at Point San Pablo, Point Orient, and Keller Beach. To add to an ongoing study of its temporal genetic variation, we collected 46 <b>vegetative</b> shoots from <b>Point</b> Molate for future genotyping. We also collected 50 vegetative shoots from Tomales Bay (Marshall, California) for a future study on genetic connectivity of inner and outer SF Bay eelgrass subpopulations. Results from MIGRATE analyses are still in preliminary stages and require further manipulation before a conclusive interpretation can be reached...|$|R
