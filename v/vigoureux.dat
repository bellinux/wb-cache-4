5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign <b>Vigoureux</b> concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E

500|$|Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan {{described}} the brawny bolete as Boletus pachypus in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse. Many of his {{names have been}} rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently. Swedish mycologists Elias Magnus Fries and Christopher Theodor Hök described Boletus torosus in 1835 based on Secretan's B.pachypus—distinct from the B.pachypus described by Fries himself. Fries reported in his 1838 book Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum {{that he had not}} actually observed the species, and he did not designate a type specimen or illustration.

60|$|If you are {{interested}} in the almost grotesque disparity that can lie between cause and effect, here is a subject for you. Three months earlier a tailor named <b>Vigoureux,</b> whose wife secretly practised magic, had entertained a few friends to dinner, amongst whom was an intimate of his wife's, named Marie Bosse. This Marie Bosse it was who drank that excessive glass of wine which, drowning prudence, led her to boast of the famous trade she drove as a fortune-teller to the nobility, and even to hint of something further.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (<b>Vigoureux</b> et al. Int. J. Theor. Phys. 47 : 928, 2007) {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that the velocity of light and the expansion of the universe are two aspects of one single concept connecting space and time in the expanding universe. It has then be shown that solving Friedmann's equations with that interpretation (and keeping c = constant) can explain number of unnatural features of the standard cosmology (for example: the flatness problem, the problem of the observed uniformity in term of temperature and density of the cosmological background radiation, the small-scale inhomogeneity problem [...] .) and leads to reconsider the Hubble diagram of distance moduli and redshifts as obtained from recent observations of type Ia supernovae without having to need an accelerating universe. In the present work we examine the problem of the cosmological constant. We show that our model can exactly generate Λ (equation of state P_φ = - ρ_φ c^ 2 with Λ∝ R^- 2) contrarily to the standard model which cannot generate it exactly. We also show how it can solve the so-called cosmic coincidence problem...|$|E
