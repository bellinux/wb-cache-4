40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{conducted}} {{three of}} the six tests needed to verify that the effluent monitoring system for the new Canister Storage Building <b>ventilation</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> meets applicable regulatory performance criteria for air sampling systems at nuclear facilities. These performance criteria address both the suitability of the location for the air-sampling probe and the transport of the sample to the collection devices. The criteria covering the location for the air-sampling probe ensure that the contaminants in the stack are well mixed with the airflow at the probe location such that the extracted sample represents the whole. The sample-transport criteria ensure that the sampled contaminants are quantitatively delivered to the collection device. The specific performance criteria are described in detail in this report. The tests reported here cover the contaminant tracer uniformity and particle delivery performance criteria. These criteria were successfully met. The other three tests were conducted by the start-up staff of Duke Engineering and Services Hanford Inc. (DESH) and reported elsewhere. The Canister Storage Building {{is located in the}} 200 East Area of the U. S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. The new air-exhaust system was built under the W 379 Project. The air sampling system features a probe with a single shrouded sampling nozzle, a sample delivery line, and a filter holder to collect the sample...|$|E
40|$|Double-shell tanks (DSTs) and Double Contained Receiver Tanks (DCRTs) are {{actively}} ventilated, along with certain single-shell tanks (SSTs) and other RPP facilities. The exhaust air stream {{on a typical}} primary ventilation system is drawn through two stages of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration to ensure confinement of airborne radioactive materials. Active <b>ventilation</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> require a stack CAM interlock to detect releases from postulated accidents, and {{to shut down the}} exhaust fan when high radiation levels are detected in the stack airstream. The stack CAM interlock is credited as a mitigating control to stop continued unfiltered radiological and toxicological discharges from the stack, which may result from an accident involving failure of a HEPA filter. This document defines the initial technical design baseline for a HEPA filter AP fan interlock system...|$|R
2500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} over the environmental hazards that {{may be caused by}} construction and operation.

40|$|The W 420 project {{covers the}} {{upgrading}} of effluent monitoring systems at six <b>ventilation</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> in tank-farm facilities at the U. S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site. The discharge stacks {{of five of}} the six systems will be completely replaced. Four of these (296 -A- 25, 296 -B- 28, 296 -S- 22, and 296 -T- 18) will be of the same size, 6 -inches in diameter and about 12 -ft high. This report documents tests that were conducted to verify that these four stacks meet the applicable regulatory criteria regarding the placement of the air sampling probe. These criteria ensure that the contaminants in the stack are well mixed with the airflow at the location of the probe such that the extracted sample represents the whole. There are also criteria addressing the transport of the sample to the collection device. These are not covered in this report, but will need to be addressed later. These tests were conducted by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on a full-scale model of the 6 -inch stick. The sequence of tests addresses the acceptability of the flow angle relative to the probe and the uniformity of air velocity and gaseous and particle tracers in the cross section of the stack. All tests were successful, and all acceptance criteria were met...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Extended {{tunnelled}} roadways requiring <b>ventilation</b> via <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> are {{an increasingly}} common solution to traffic congestion around the world. In response to community concerns about {{adverse health effects}} associated with emissions from a new road tunnel <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack,</b> despite no demonstrable change in local ambient air quality, we conducted a cross sectional study to test for an association between exposure to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> emissions {{and the presence of}} eye, nose and throat symptoms. Methods Stack emissions were modelled and categorised into areas of high, medium and low levels of exposure to emissions. A telephone interview survey was conducted in these three zones. Multivariate analysis was undertaken using Cox Proportional Hazards modelling to estimate prevalence ratios between zones for eye, nose and throat symptoms. Results The prevalence of eye, nose and throat symptoms in the study area were 50 percent, 67 percent and 33 percent respectively and did not differ between the exposure zones. The presence of these symptoms was associated with a measure of reported "environmental worry". Conclusion The study did not demonstrate a community wide health impact associated with modelled emissions but is unable to exclude the possibility of sensitive individuals being adversely affected. </p...|$|R

The HV-S 1, HV-S 2, and IHLW-S 1 <b>exhaust</b> <b>stacks</b> were tested together as a group (Test Group 3 - 4) because they share a geometric attribute: the common factor in their design is that the last significant flow disturbance upstream of the air sampling probe is a jog (i. e., two conjoined bends of equal and opposite curvature resulting in a change in elevation of the duct). Federal regulations require that a sampling probe be located in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>stack</b> according to criteria established by the American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) N 13. 1 - 1999, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stack and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities.
