The paper provides a theoretical treatment {{of this issue}} within a Heckscher-Ohlin framework. It extends beyond previous treatments by allowing for an arbitrary number of goods, factors, and fragments, and by formally specifying a "fragmentation technology". It defines a "margin of international fragmentation" and shows how this margin shifts in response to economic globalization. Factor prices are driven by associated changes in "effective prices" of individual fragments of the <b>value-added</b> <b>chains.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{competition}} is changing {{both in terms}} of the dynamics of market requirements and who the competitors are. The changing market requirements create the need for uninhibited flow of information up and down the organisation and across the value-added network. As organisations cooperate to compete, competition is increasingly between <b>value-added</b> <b>chains</b> rather than between companies. Integration of organisations in the <b>value-added</b> <b>chains,</b> resulting in extended enterprises, where product and process design of an organisation will have to reflect the operating conditions of customers' customers and suppliers' suppliers, has therefore become of a very significant importance to the emerging reality of competition between <b>value-added</b> <b>chains.</b> But, building a solid foundation for the integration of an extended enterprise must start with integration of internal capabilities, facility and functions within individual enterprises. It is against this background that the enterprise-wide integration programs in three companies have been studied and reported in this paper for the purpose of deeper understanding of the requirements, problems, lessons, benefits and implications of the effort. The three case study companies include aerospace, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications companies with extensive international business interests...|$|R

50|$|But {{unlike in}} the PRC, this was a much more extreme, highly {{unregulated}} form of privatization during the Presidency of Boris Yeltsin, which resulted in asset grabs by Russians in a highly unregulated fashion, resulting in deep socio-economic inequalities within Russia {{and the collapse of}} the economy as well as various Russian institutions. Thus, in the post-Cold War period, the PRC emerged in a far more favourable and stable financial position. The PRC is currently seeing the fastest rate of economic growth of any large economy, several points higher than Russia which has been growing at an annualized rate of some 5-6%. Russia's economy in the early 2000s was largely driven by demand for export of natural resources to Europe and Asia, with a gradual move up the <b>value-added</b> <b>chain</b> as Russian aluminum and steel mills upgrade to international standards.

The globalisation of tourism is unavoidable and, in many respects, positive.

In the pursuit of cultural activities, besides actual production and distribution of cultural goods and services, processes of meaning and value negotiation and the elaboration of preferences and perceptual habits play an important role. Since many cultural activities take place in an almost completely institutionalised setting, Cultural Institutions Studies are also concerned with financing structures, <b>value-added</b> <b>chains,</b> organisational change in the cultural sector, and with legal and cultural policy frameworks. Taking the approach of institutional and organisational theory, Cultural Institutions Studies also investigate processes occurring place within individual companies, as well as certain structural characteristics in cultural management. Aspects of occupational sociology connected with division of labour and integration of different types of activity are also relevant to understanding co-operation of different occupational groups in the cultural sector or in cultural industries.|$|R

Without doubt, a future-oriented strategy cannot dismiss the potentials offered by digitalization and automation, in particular robotics and artificial intelligence. Saving resources is not only an issue of the supply side, but will be also most important on the demand side. Almost needless to state, that also consumers {{play a key role in}} these networks and will have to support the transformation. No innovation will survive without consumers willing to adopt it. Also, changed consumption patterns like sharing-economies will accelerate the transformation (Perez and Marin, 2016) and reduce massively consumption of resources.

40|$|Includes BibliographyThe global {{economic}} crisis has {{put an end}} to a period of worldwide expansion and halted the integration of Latin America and developing Asia with the international economy. Current and expected economic weakness in the advanced economies has led us to look elsewhere for sources of growth. Emerging economies in Asia and Latin America have increased their contributions to world production, finance, and trade in the past decades. In doing so, the two regions have deepened their economic ties with significant implications for the recovery of their respective economies. In this paper we discuss the impact of the crisis on the commercial patterns inside and outside the Forum for East Asia Latin American Cooperation (FEALAC) bloc. We describe the FEALAC economy and identify existing trade and investment structures, and find important structural shortcomings such as a high dependence on inter-industry trade between Asia and Latin America. We argue that this is also an opportunity for greater integration into bi-regional <b>value-added</b> <b>chains</b> and that trade and cooperation between the two regions can be an effective means to counterbalance the adverse effects of the current financial turmoil...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In 2006, the People's Republic of China adopted an innovation policy designed to accelerate domestic economic innovation. With this policy, China aimed to shift its economy from one that manufactures products {{at the lower}} end of the <b>value-added</b> <b>chain</b> to one manufacturing products at the top of the <b>value-added</b> <b>chain.</b> China plans to become not only a high-technology manufacturing nation but to become the world-leader in innovation. Certain aspects of this plan for endogenous growth through state-driven economic innovation were economically competitive with the United States. This thesis will assess the impact of the PRC's plans and actions to drive innovation, to include answering the following questions: Have the PRC's actions regarding innovation made an impact on its economic performance? And consequently: How might we expect China's state-driven-innovation to affect U. S. 'China relations?

40|$|This paper {{models and}} {{analyzes}} international trade flows using open flow networks (OFNs) with the approaches of flow distances, which provide a novel perspective and effective tools {{for the study}} of international trade. We discuss the establishment of OFNs of international trade from two coupled viewpoints: the viewpoint of trading commodity flow and that of money flow. Based on the novel model with flow distance approaches, meaningful insights are gained. First, by introducing the concepts of trade trophic levels and niches, countries' roles and positions in the global supply <b>chains</b> (or <b>value-added</b> <b>chains)</b> can be evaluated quantitatively. We find that the distributions of trading "trophic levels" have the similar clustering pattern for different types of commodities, and summarize some regularities between money flow and commodity flow viewpoints. Second, we find that active and competitive countries trade a wide spectrum of products, while inactive and underdeveloped countries trade a limited variety of products. Besides, some abnormal countries import many types of goods, which the vast majority of countries do not need to import. Third, harmonic node centrality is proposed and we find the phenomenon of centrality stratification. All the results illustrate the usefulness of the model of OFNs with its network approaches for investigating international trade flows...|$|R
