40|$|FIFO {{communication}} is expensive to support. It is also quite restrictive for several applications. In this paper, we study {{the concept of}} relative speed of messages and a hierarchy of such speeds which results in a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>channel.</b> In <b>hierarchical</b> <b>channels</b> messages sent at lower levels of the hierarchy cannot be overtaken by message sent at a higher level. But lower level messages can overtake higher level messages. The flexibility provided by <b>hierarchical</b> <b>channels</b> can be exploited by several distributed applications. We present examples to illustrate how FIFO ordering constraints can be relaxed for such applications using <b>hierarchical</b> <b>channels,</b> leading to increased concurrency. We present a new algorithm to implement <b>hierarchical</b> <b>channels.</b> The algorithm employs selective flooding, and is tolerant to link-failures.
