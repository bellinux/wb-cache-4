30|$|Free or {{facilitated}} {{access to}} the EU territory has long been sought by many Turkish citizens as {{this would be the}} most tangible benefit of European integration for ordinary citizens. EU, on the other hand, assumes a rational and a pragmatic approach to the issue. Since the early 2000 s, it has instrumentalised visa and visa liberalization in its migration management. It offers <b>visa-free</b> or facilitated <b>access</b> to the Schengen Area to citizens of third countries when they conclude readmission agreements with the EU. Most of these countries are either source and/or transit countries for irregular migration to the EU. 5 Candidate countries, on the other hand, are already obliged to make their borders impermeable against irregular migrants and other undesirable persons. These countries prepare themselves for Schengen Area by complying with the EU’s acquis on migration, borders and asylum. Their territory becomes a part of the Schengen Area once they succeed in internalizing this acquis.|$|R
