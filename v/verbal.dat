5|$|Developmental <b>verbal</b> dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. The speech {{of a child with}} developmental <b>verbal</b> dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental <b>verbal</b> dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E

5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and <b>verbal</b> root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in <b>verbal</b> inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from <b>verbal</b> roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
5|$|The <b>verbal</b> prefix {{contains}} {{information about}} the person and number of the subject, sometimes also the person and number of the object, as well as obligatory {{information about the}} tense of the clause. Furthermore, a <b>verbal</b> suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While {{only a small number}} of tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the <b>verbal</b> prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of <b>verbal</b> or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered <b>verbal</b> or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of <b>verbal</b> or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. <b>Verbal</b> and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|All {{other things}} being equal {{and in the absence of}} any {{explicit}} adverbials, the indicative mood will be interpreted as complete or incomplete depending on the <b>verbal</b> aktionsart.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for <b>verbal</b> clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite <b>verbal</b> clause. Finite <b>verbal</b> clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|But if a {{sentence}} containing an atelic <b>verbal</b> phrase is embedded {{within the context}} of a past time narrative, it would be interpreted as past.|$|E

5|$|Innovations in Ottawa {{morphology}} {{contribute to}} differentiating Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe. These differences include: the reanalysis of person prefixes and word stems; {{the loss of}} final /-n/ in certain inflectional suffixes; a distinctive form for the <b>verbal</b> suffix indicating doubt; and a distinctive form for the <b>verbal</b> suffix indicating plurality on intransitive verbs with grammatically inanimate subjects.|$|E

5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the valency of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming <b>verbal</b> compounds with two or more <b>verbal</b> roots.|$|E
5|$|Noun {{compounds}} {{are commonly}} formed by combining {{two or more}} nominal stems or combining a nominal stem with an adjectival or <b>verbal</b> stem.|$|E
5|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} parts of speech in Wagiman are verbs, coverbs and nominals. Apart from these, there are a multitude of <b>verbal</b> and nominal affixes, interjections and other particles. Pronouns class with nominals.|$|E
5|$|There are {{personal}} pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional {{as subjects}} or objects, {{but only when}} the <b>verbal</b> inflection refers to such arguments.|$|E

5|$|<b>Verbal</b> goes on {{to explain}} that, after Fenster had bailed on the group, Kobayashi gave them a {{location}} at which to find their compatriot's dead body. They tried to kill Kobayashi, but he strong-armed them into performing the heist by threatening their loved ones. They staked out the ship and killed several Argentinian and Hungarian gangsters, but found no drugs on board. McManus, Hockney and a man locked aboard the ship were killed by an unseen person, who also killed Keaton and set the ship on fire as <b>Verbal</b> looked on.|$|E
5|$|Attributive Adjectives {{after the}} noun they modify, and inflect for number and gender. Adjectives may also occur alone, {{in which case}} they become an NP. Practically all {{adjectives}} also have a <b>verbal</b> form used for predicative purposes, which behaves just like a normal verb.|$|E
5|$|Coverbs however, cannot inflect for {{person and}} cannot, in themselves, head finite clauses. If {{they are to}} act {{as the head of}} a clause, they must combine with a verb, thereby forming a bipartite <b>verbal</b> compound, {{commonly}} called a complex predicate.|$|E
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, <b>verbal</b> declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly <b>verbal</b> learning). Deficits in <b>verbal</b> memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. <b>Verbal</b> memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

On November 11, Jones and Okafor tweeted {{simultaneously}} that they would make simultaneous <b>verbal</b> commitments on November 15 from their local high schools. His <b>verbal</b> commitment announcement was scheduled on the same date as Alexander and Stanley Johnson. According to ESPN, all four were among the top 10 in the national class (Okafor #1, Alexander #3, Jones #4 and Johnson #9). On the eve of their announcement, Duke was the heavy favorite to land Jones and Okafor. He made his <b>verbal</b> commitment on ESPNU to Duke basketball on November 15. Prior to his senior season, USA Today named him to its 10-man preseason All-USA team along with Alexander, Stanley Johnson, Trey Lyles, Mudiay, Malik Newman, Okafor, Kelly Oubre, D'Angelo Russell, and Myles Turner. On November 21, Winslow committed to Duke, giving them the number one recruiting class in the nation with Jones, Okafor, Winslow and Grayson Allen all committed.|$|E
5|$|The Wagiman {{language}} is notable within linguistics for its complex system of <b>verbal</b> morphology, which remains under-investigated, its {{possession of a}} cross-linguistically rare part of speech called a coverb, its complex predicates and {{for its ability to}} productively verbalise coverbs.|$|E

5|$|<b>Verbal</b> {{derivation}} {{is extremely}} productive, and Greenlandic employs {{many hundreds of}} derivational suffixes. Often a single verb will use more than one derivational suffix, resulting in very long words. Below are given some examples of how derivational suffixes can change the meaning of verbs.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{only the}} <b>verbal</b> aspects {{are taken into}} consideration. This is usually {{referred}} to as <b>verbal</b> intelligence or <b>verbal</b> fluency, and is commonly a reflection of an individual's overall linguistic intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Intraverbals – <b>verbal</b> {{behavior}} {{for which the}} relevant antecedent stimulus was other <b>verbal</b> behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior <b>verbal</b> stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question).|$|E
25|$|Formally, the <b>verbal</b> noun (VN, still {{retaining}} <b>verbal</b> characteristics) takes okurigana, as is {{usual for}} verbs, while the deverbal noun (DVN, without <b>verbal</b> characteristics) {{does not take}} okurigana, as is usual for nouns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Verbal</b> {{morphology}} in Nobiin {{is subject}} to numerous morphophonological processes, including syllable contraction, vowel elision, and assimilation of all sorts and directions. A distinction {{needs to be made}} between the <b>verbal</b> base and the morphemes that follow. The majority of <b>verbal</b> bases in Nobiin end in a consonant (e.g. nèèr- ‘sleep’, kàb- ‘eat’, tíg- ‘follow’, fìyyí- ‘lie’); notable exceptions are júú- ‘go’ and níí- ‘drink’. <b>Verbal</b> bases are mono- or disyllabic. The <b>verbal</b> base carries one of three or four tonal patterns. The main verb carries person, number, tense, and aspect information.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 101 Clearfield Area School District {{students}} took the SAT exams. The district's <b>Verbal</b> Average Score was 463. The Math average score was 481. The Writing average score was 453. The statewide <b>Verbal</b> SAT exams results were: <b>Verbal</b> 491, Math 501, Writing 480. In the USA, 1.65 million {{students took}} the exams achieving scores: <b>Verbal</b> 496, Math 514, Writing 488. According to the College Board the maximum score on each section was 800, and 360 students nationwide scored a perfect 2,400.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, average total SAT scores were around 900 (typically, 425 on the <b>verbal</b> and 475 on the math). The average {{scores on the}} 1994 {{modification}} of the SAT I were similar: 428 on the <b>verbal</b> and 482 on the math. SAT scores for admitted applicants to highly selective colleges in the United States were typically much higher. For example, the score ranges of the middle 50% of admitted applicants to Princeton University in 1985 were 600 to 720 (<b>verbal)</b> and 660 to 750 (math). Similarly, median scores on the modified 1994 SAT for freshmen entering Yale University {{in the fall of}} 1995 were 670 (<b>verbal)</b> and 720 (math). For the majority of SAT takers, however, <b>verbal</b> and math scores were below 500: In 1992, half of the college-bound seniors taking the SAT were scoring between 340 and 500 on the <b>verbal</b> section and between 380 and 560 on the math section, with corresponding median scores of 420 and 470, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In general, it is {{difficult}} to test for linguistic intelligence as a whole, therefore <b>verbal</b> intelligence is often measured instead. This is done using various types of <b>verbal</b> fluency tests.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{singular}} of <b>verbal</b> nouns: Generally, <b>verbal</b> nouns {{form their}} individual singulars by the suffixation of a. For example, بني bany > بنية banya, تفركيس tfarkīs > تفركيسة tfarkīsa.|$|E
