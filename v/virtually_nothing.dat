The Bulgarian censor rigorously cut any references about the Serbian participation in the operation in the telegrams of the foreign correspondents.

Accordingly the Serbs claimed that their troops of the 20th Regiment were those who captured the Ottoman commander of the city, and that Colonel Gavrilović was the allied officer who accepted Shukri's official surrender of the garrison, a statement that the Bulgarians disputed. Subsequently the Serbs officially protested, pointing out that although they had sent their troops to Adrianople to win for Bulgaria territory whose acquisition had never been foreseen by their mutual treaty, the Bulgarians had never fulfilled the clause of the treaty requiring Bulgaria to send 100,000 men to help the Serbians on their Vardar front.

40|$|Introduction: Since the {{introduction}} in the 1970 s of the unilateral approach in surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism by Wang, authors have increasingly been recommending limited forms of parathyroid surgery. Although unilateral explorations reduce operation time and admission days, decrease operative risk and give better cosmetic results, {{the debate about}} the best surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism has never been settled. Bilateralists oppose less invasive approaches because they estimate the incidence of multiple gland disease to be as high as 30 %. However, in spite of a systematic bilateral exploration of the neck in search of the diseased parathyroid gland, with identification and estimation of the size of all parathyroid tissue, in only 44 % of cases are four glands identified, in 37 % three, and in 19 % less than three. In chapter 1 we reported an exceptional case of persistent hyperparathyroidism (due to a non-descended inferior parathyroid) after extensive bilateral exploration, illustrating a clinical dilemma that can be encountered in parathyroid surgery. Imaging carried out prior to re-exploration and including, among other methods, ultrasonography and computed tomography, revealed a parathyroid adenoma {{at the level of the}} mandibular angle and the hyoid bone. Guided by the imaging results the adenoma was successfully resected by a local direct procedure taking less than 10 minutes. In general, the main reason an adenoma is not found during exploration is the variability in location, rather than variety in the number of glands. It is therefore of pivotal importance to understand not only the anatomy, but also the embryology of the parathyroid glands. As radiologist John Doppman succinctly stated, If you are an experienced parathyroid surgeon and not able to find a tumor, you cannot have looked high enough. Since primary hyperparathyroidism can be diagnosed with nearly 100 % accuracy and successfully treated in more than 95 % of cases, surgery is the treatment of choice. The gold standard in parathyroid surgery has been conventional neck exploration (CNE), and with success rates exceeding 95 % and <b>virtually</b> no complications <b>nothing</b> more seemed left to be desired. However, it cannot be denied that there is a discrepancy between the extent of the operation and the size of the offending gland in the majority of patients. Encouraged by the pace of development in methods of imaging (resulting in increased accuracy), combined with the knowledge that primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a solitary adenoma in at least 85 % of cases, and our experience of the relatively simple and quick MIA procedure (chapter 1) we wondered whether such a direct, minimally invasive strategy could be utilized for the more common cases of primary hyperparathyroidism as well. For this purpose we formulated the following hypothesis (chapter 3) : A substantial group of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism can be successfully treated by limited access surgery after preoperative localization studies and may thus be spared unnecessary extensive dissection (conventional neck exploration). Minimally invasive adenomectomy: We prospectively tested this minimally invasive approach as an alternative to CNE. In chapter 4 we described the results of 110 consecutive patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, 84 of whom were selected for minimally invasive adenomectomy (MIA) and 26 for CNE. Operating time was 20 minutes in the MIA group and 80 minutes in the CNE group (p 50 %, measured 8 minutes after resection, predicting normocalcemia). Costs: Minimally invasive adenomectomy has definitely entered the therapeutic regimens for primary hyperparathyroidism, and therefore it is important to study the economic burden. We cost-analyzed a prospective series of 164 patients to obtain information on the relative costs of MIA and CNE (chapter 9). To observe the effect of changing appreciable variables, multiple sensitivity analyses were carried out. The mean cost of MIA was calculated as. 1, 288 and that of CNE. 2, 106 (p< 0. 0005). The reason MIA is so much cheaper than CNE is the differences in operating time (median 20 minutes in MIA versus 75 minutes in CNE) and admission days (2 days in MIA versus 3 days in CNE). Sensitivity analyses showed that an increase in total average costs of 63 %, an increase in operating time to 272 minutes, prolongation of admission from 2 to 4. 5 days, or an initial operation failure rate of 54 % in the MIA group would result in MIA costs equaling those for CNE. Such extreme examples are clearly unrealistic, but admission time remains a variable that is highly dependent on local logistics, and may be amenable to reduction. In particular, day care surgery will shortly become possible for MIA, provided a safe protocol for the management of postoperative hypocalcemia can be designed (and adhered to). The future: The ongoing technical developments of imaging modalities presage an increase in discriminating capacity and increasing accuracy of various techniques, making MIA possible for even more patients. The possibility of day-care MIA, using intravenous sedation combined with local anesthesia, will further liberalize the indications for this method. Conclusion: In conclusion, minimally invasive adenomectomy is a safe and effective alternative to conventional neck exploration, able to replace it in approximately 75 % of cases. It is not only associated with a very low complication rate, comparable to that of conventional neck exploration, but is also cheaper than conventional exploration. In the future, additional savings may be anticipated when day-care MIA becomes possible...|$|R
