5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light that hits the retina of the eye. Photoreceptors in the retina transduce the sensory stimulus of light into an electrical nerve signal that {{is sent to the}} <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> in the occipital lobe. Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex.</b>|$|E
5|$|Visual Impairment – Athletes {{with visual}} {{impairment}} ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment {{of one or more}} component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and <b>visual</b> <b>cortex).</b> The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete {{with visual impairment}} and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides (along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football became eligible to receive medals of their own.|$|E
5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} {{of objects and}} {{the totality of the}} visual scene is accomplished by the <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex.</b> The <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> combines all sensory information perceived by the striate cortex which contains thousands of modules that are part of modular neural networks. The neurons in the striate cortex send axons to the extrastriate cortex, a region in the <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> that surrounds the striate cortex.|$|R
50|$|Work by Hubel and Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s {{showed that}} cat and monkey <b>visual</b> <b>cortexes</b> contain neurons that {{individually}} respond to small {{regions of the}} visual field. Provided the eyes are not moving, the region of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its receptive field. Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields. Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of <b>visual</b> space. The <b>cortex</b> in each hemisphere represents the contralateral visual field.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an approach}} for image segmentation by using pulse coupled neural network (PCNN), {{based on the}} phenomena of synchronous pulse bursts in the animal <b>visual</b> <b>cortexes.</b> The synchronous bursts of neurons with different input were generated in the proposed PCNN model to realize the multi-object segmentation. The criterion to automatically choose the dominant parameter (the linking strength ?), which determines the synchronous-burst stimulus range, was described in order to stimulate its application in automatic image segmentation. Segmentations on several types of image are implemented with the proposed method and the experimental results demonstrate its validity...|$|R
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
25|$|There is a <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> in each {{hemisphere}} of the brain, much {{of which}} {{is located in the}} Occipital lobe. The left hemisphere <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> receives signals mainly from the right visual field and the right <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> mainly from the left visual field, although each cortex receives a considerable amount of information from the ipsilateral visual field as well. The <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> also receives information from subcortical regions, such as the lateral geniculate body, located in the thalamus. However, ample evidence indicates that object identity and location are preferentially processed in ventral (occipito-temporal) and dorsal (occipito-parietal) cortical visual streams, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> is {{the part}} of the {{cerebral}} cortex in the posterior part of the brain responsible for processing visual stimuli, called the occipital lobe. The central 10° of field (approximately the extension of the macula) is represented by at least 60% of the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex.</b> Many of these neurons are believed to be involved directly in visual acuity processing.|$|E
40|$|Three cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{were trained}} preoperatively in visual {{discrimination}} learning for an auditory secondary reinforcer. Each new discrimination problem was solved {{on the basis}} of the secondary reinforcer, and primary reinforcement (food reward) was given only after a new problem had been solved. The animals learned 50 new problems in each daily session and it was therefore possible to assess accurately their average rate of learning new discrimination problems in this procedure. After the learning rate had stabilized preoperatively the animals were operated upon to transect the uncinate fascicle, the cortico-cortical pathway from <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> in the temporal lobe to prefrontal cortex. The animals' learning rate was unchanged after uncinate fascicle section. A previous experiment has shown that visual learning for an auditory secondary reinforcer is unaffected by disconnection of <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> from the amygdala and the fornix. Taken together, this negative evidence points strongly to the conclusion that visual learning for an auditory secondary reinforcer depends upon interaction of temporal lobe <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> with the corpus striatum, since other possibilities have been excluded...|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} of Stroop and Simon tasks were monitored on 10 healthy young adults using {{magnetic resonance image}} (MRI) scanning. Functional images were acquired at specific time intervals during each subject's scan. Brain activation during the Stroop and Simon task was remarkably similar including anterior cingulate, supplementary motor <b>cortex,</b> <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex,</b> inferior temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, inferior frontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and caudate nuclei. Interference effects in the Stroop and Simon tasks activate similar brain regions at similar time distributions.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{mentioned}} the apparatus developed to measure CFFs {{at the various}} point of the retina. Eleven CFFs measured at the central retina of both eyes (used usually} simultaneously, at the central retina of each eye separately, and at four points of the peripheral retina of each eye were analyzed together and {{referred to as the}} multi-point critical flicker fusion frequency (MCFF). MCFF can be used to estimate the level of cortex activity, since the temporal and nasal parts of each eye are connected to different <b>visual</b> <b>cortexes</b> through the optic nerve. As the apparatus used to measure the MCFF was controlled by a micro-computer, the order of measurements and the calculation were done automatically...|$|R
50|$|The {{neocognitron}} {{was inspired}} by the model proposed by Hubel & Wiesel in 1959.

40|$|An {{earlier study}} found that rhinal cortex ablations in the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) {{impaired}} delayed matching-to-sample only when the stimuli in the experiment came from a large population of possible stimuli, not when the stimulus population was small. The present experiment tested the idea that delayed matching-to-sample with a small stimulus population selectively engages the direct projection from <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> to the prefrontal cortex, bypassing the rhinal cortex. This selective involvement could explain the preservation, after rhinal cortex ablations, of memory for items drawn from a small stimulus population. We trained monkeys preoperatively in delayed matching-to-sample with large and small stimulus populations, exactly as in the earlier study, then examined the effect of sectioning the cortico-cortical pathway between <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> and prefrontal cortex, the uncinate fascicle. Uncinate fascicle section {{had no effect on}} postoperative performance of delayed matching-to-sample, with either large or small stimulus populations. These data give no support to the idea that preserved matching with a small stimulus population after rhinal lesions reflects the selective involvement in this task of the direct projection from <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> to prefrontal cortex. Further, they strengthen the idea (derived from earlier studies of uncinate fascicle section) that the uncinate fascicle does not play a general role in visual memory or perception, but instead has a specialized function in the processing of conditional instruction cues...|$|R
25|$|A {{recent study}} found that adult rats with {{amblyopia}} improved visual acuity two weeks after being placed into an enriched environment. The same study showed that another two weeks after ending environmental enrichment, the rats retained their visual acuity improvement. Conversely, rats in a standard environment showed no improvement in visual acuity. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment reduces GABA inhibition and increases BDNF expression in the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex.</b> As a result, the growth and development of neurons and synapses in the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> were much improved due to the enriched environment.|$|E
25|$|The eye is {{connected}} to the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> by the optic nerve coming {{out of the back of}} the eye. The two optic nerves come together behind the eyes at the optic chiasm, where about half of the fibers from each eye cross over to the opposite side and join fibers from the other eye representing the corresponding visual field, the combined nerve fibers from both eyes forming the optic tract. This ultimately forms the physiological basis of binocular vision. The tracts project to a relay station in the midbrain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, part of the thalamus, and then to the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> along a collection of nerve fibers called the optic radiation.|$|E

40|$|Visual pseudohallucinations are {{reported}} on {{in a patient}} with a left lower quadrantanopia due to a right parietotemporal surgical defect after tumour removal. Besides metamorphopsia, he hallucinated {{the lower half of}} human figures which were limited to within the borders of the anopic defect and appeared "amputated" at the hip with one forearm and hand appearing from above in correct anatomical position. The lower half of these human figures was perceived as correctly scaled in relation to anatomical and environmental coordinates and was recognised as unreal. These pseudohallucinations led to the concept of an "aperture effect" which alludes to the visibility through the anopic field defect of a segment of the contents of the <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex.</b> This supports the idea of a pictorial mode for representation of endogenously generated images in the <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{feedforward}} neural network for syllable recognition. The core of the recognition system is based on a hierarchical architecture initially developed for visual object recognition. We show that, given the similarities between the primary auditory and <b>visual</b> <b>cortexes,</b> such a system can successfully be used for speech recognition. Syllables are used as basic units for the recognition. Their spectrograms, computed using a Gammatone filterbank, are interpreted as images and subsequently feed into the neural network after a preprocessing step that enhances the formant frequencies and normalizes the length of the syllables. The performance of our system has been analyzed on the recognition of 25 different monosyllabic words. The parameters of the architecture have been optimized using an evolutionary strategy. Compared to the Sphinx- 4 speech recognition system, our system achieves better robustness and generalization capabilities in noisy conditions. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) effects of mental stress in {{patients}} with coronary artery disease (CAD) are unexplored. The present study used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure brain correlates of mental stress induced by an arithmetic serial subtraction task in CAD and healthy subjects. Mental stress resulted in hyperactivation in CAD patients compared with healthy subjects in several brain areas including the left parietal cortex [angular gyrus/parallel sulcus (area 39) ], left anterior cingulate (area 32), right <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> (area 18), left fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum. These same regions were activated within the CAD patient group during mental stress versus control conditions. In the group of healthy subjects, activation was significant only in the left inferior frontal gyrus during mental stress compared with counting control. Decreases in blood flow also were produced by mental stress in CAD versus healthy subjects in right thalamus (lateral dorsal, lateral posterior), right superior frontal gyrus (areas 32, 24, and 10), and right middle temporal gyrus (area 21) (in {{the region of the}} auditory association cortex). Of particular interest, a subgroup of CAD patients that developed painless myocardial ischemia during mental stress had hyperactivation in the left hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule (area 40), left middle (area 10) and superior frontal gyrus (area 8), temporal pole, and <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> (area 18), and a concomitant decrease in activation observed in the anterior cingulate bilaterally, right middle and superior frontal gyri, and right <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> (area 18) compared with CAD patients without myocardial ischemia. These findings demonstrate an exaggerated cerebral cortical response and exaggerated asymmetry to mental stress in individuals with CAD...|$|R
50|$|As visual {{information}} passes forward through the visual hierarchy, {{the complexity of}} the neural representations increases. Whereas a V1 neuron may respond selectively to a line segment of a particular orientation in a particular retinotopic location, neurons in the lateral occipital complex respond selectively to complete object (e.g., a figure drawing), and neurons in <b>visual</b> association <b>cortex</b> may respond selectively to human faces, or to a particular object.|$|R

25|$|Spatial {{attention}} {{is the process}} where objects in one location are chosen for processing over objects in another location. This would imply that neglect is more intentional. The patient has an affinity to direct attention to the unaffected side. Neglect {{is caused by a}} decrease in stimuli in the contralesional side {{because of a lack of}} ipsilesional stimulation of the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex</b> and an increased inhibition of the contralesional side. In this theory neglect is seen as disorder of attention and orientation caused by disruption of the <b>visual</b> <b>cortex.</b> Patients with this disorder will direct attention and movements to the ipsilesional side and neglect stimuli in the contralesional side despite having preserved visual fields. The result of all of this is an increased sensitivity of visual performance in the unaffected side. The patient shows an affinity to the ipsilesional side being unable to disengage attention from that side.|$|E

40|$|With an {{estimated}} 1. 5 million chronic cocaine {{users in the}} U. S., cocaine abuse is a considerable public health concern (Bolla et al., 2004). The mood elevation and euphoria associated with cocaine use {{is the result of}} the inhibition of the reuptake of dopamine in the mesolimbic “reward” pathway. Chronic cocaine use produces a number of distinctive biochemical adaptations within structures in this pathway, and has been the focus in numerous studies (Berhow et al 1996). A decrease in functional connectivity (i. e. the level of correlation in neural activity between distinct brain regions) in the primary motor and <b>visual</b> <b>cortexes</b> has been shown to be an acute effect of cocaine intake (Li et al 2000). The long-term effects of chronic cocaine-use on functional connectivity between structures in the mesolimbic pathway, however, has never before been investigated. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables researchers to observe and analyze spontaneous neural activity since the subject is not performing a task.
