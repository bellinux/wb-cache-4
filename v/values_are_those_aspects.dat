A pesquisa apóia-se nos diários de viagem à Itália de três notáveis grand tourists - o novelista britânico Thobias Smollet, o poeta alemão Johann W. von Goethe e o especialista inglês em antigüidades Richard Payne Knight. Com base em seus relatos, olhamos para as condições de realização do Grand Tour observando rotas e destinos, meios de transporte, guias e acomodações. Entre as questões permeando o universo cultural do grand tourist, destacamos o gosto pela arte e a arquitetura dos antigos, o culto à ruína e a atração de valores estéticos sublimes, em meio às quais podemos distinguir a emergência de uma visualidade dessa experiência de viagem dita "clássica". This work {{deals with}} the Grand Tour as a social phenomenon and points out technical and cultural aspects of these 18 th century pioneering travels for pleasure from which derives the leisure and cultural travels of our present time. The research bases upon the writings of three outstanding grand tourists to Italy - the British novelist Thobias Smollet, the German poet Johann W. von Goethe and the English expert in antiquities Richard Payne Knight. Based on information provided by their travel accounts, {{we look at the}} conditions under which the Grand Tour used to be taken in aspects such as routes and destinations, means of transportation, guides and lodging. The taste for art and architecture of antiques, the cult of ruins and the attraction of sublime aesthetic <b>values</b> <b>are</b> emphasized as <b>those</b> <b>aspects</b> underlying the cultural universe of the grand tourist. The emergence of a visuality derived from the so-called "classic" travel might also be observed...|$|R
