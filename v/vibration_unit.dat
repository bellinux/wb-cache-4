40|$|Vibration {{cementing}} is a {{new technique}} that can significantly improve the bond strength of cementing interface. To popularize this technique, {{it is necessary to}} solve the key problem of how to make cementing string generate downhole radial vibration in the WOC stage. For this purpose, an electric vibrator was developed. With this vibrator, electric energy is converted into mechanical energy by means of a high-temperature motor <b>vibration</b> <b>unit.</b> The motor <b>vibration</b> <b>unit</b> rotates the eccentric block through an output shaft to generate an exciting source, which produces an axial-rotating exciting force {{at the bottom of the}} casing string. Then, the vibration characteristics of vertical well casing string under the exciting force were analyzed by using the principal coordinate analysis method, and the response model of casing string to an electric vibrator was developed. Finally, the effects of casing string length, exciting force and vibration frequency on the vibration amplitude at the lowermost of the casing string were analyzed based on a certain casing program. It is indicated that the casing string length and the square of vibration frequency are inversely proportional to the vibration amplitude at the lowermost of the casing string, and the exciting force is proportional to the vibration amplitude at the lowermost of the casing string. These research results provide a theoretical support for the application of vibration cementing technology to the cementing sites with different requirements on well depth and amplitude...|$|E

BackgroundIntradialysis hypotension {{is a common}} problem among hemodialysis patients. Some {{studies have shown that}} autonomic neuropathy could be a major cause of intradialysis hypotension, whereas others have not. Furthermore, whether there are parallel changes in the autonomic nervous system and somatic nerves remains unclear. MethodsWe investigated the autonomic and peripheral nervous functions of 12 chronic hemodialysis patients who suffered from intradialysis hypotension, and of 12 age- and sex-matched hemodialysis patients who had stable blood pressure during hemodialysis. We used spectral analysis of their heart rate variability and systemic vascular resistance to evaluate autonomic functions. Vibrameter and nerve conduction studies to assess peripheral nervous function were also performed. Low-frequency/high-frequency ratio power index was used as a surrogate of sympathovagal balance. ResultsThe power index rose progressively in the control group and reached significantly high levels at hour 4 compared to the basal values (3. 7 ± 0. 5 vs. 2. 1 ± 0. 3; P < 0. 05). However in the group prone to hypotension, the power index remained almost unchanged. In addition, their systemic vascular resistance was lower than that in the control group (13. 7 ± 1. 8 vs. 22. 3 ± 2. 6 Wood units; P < 0. 05).

The single plane balancing procedures are addressed, wherein one substitutes a corrective mass moment to compensate for these nonuniform distributions of imbalance. The approach to be used concentrates in several areas. The first area is the vibration sensors and related instrumentation. The next area is the response of a rotor as it runs up to operating speeds, with some introduction to the mode shapes involved. The third area is the plotting of data, specifically the polar plot, to give the balancer some insight on the ?heavy spot? vs ?high spot? relationship. Fourth, the balancing procedures creating a response vector (T) from a calibration or trial weight and shifting that vector to effectively cancel the ?original? vector, resulting in smooth 1 x synchronous motion are discussed. The fifth area is the calculation of the correcting influence coefficient in terms of a weight (or moment) vector unit per <b>vibration</b> <b>unit</b> with an ?additive? angle to affect a future ?one shot correction. ? Finally, some other single plane techniques are discussed balancing with the coupling?s original residual unbalance, balancing without phase information, introduction of static-couple vector logic, and the review of some of the industry balancing standards.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyAnkle injuries {{are one of the most}} common injuries in sport, often leading to functional deficits and instability, a vicious cycle of recurrent sprains and time loss due to injury. Although research has been conducted on the best methods of treating such deficits and instability, new training methodologies are continually being sought to help improve clinical outcomes and with this comes a need for designed research to test such hypotheses. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the effect of vibration training on balance and muscle function in physically active individuals suffering self reported functional ankle instability (FAI). Stage one of the research was to initially investigate the effect of a six week whole body vibration training (WBVT) exercise routine on 38 University dancers reporting FAI. An initial assessment of the severity of the instability was done using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT), to identify those who classed themselves functionally unstable but still able to participate in their chosen sport. The group was randomly arranged into one of two groups (treatment and control) and a pre/post test study was undertaken, with the control group asked to continue normal activity. The selection of participants was based on instability score from the CAIT. A larger sample of athletes was initially recruited across two accessible sports of football and dance due to access and availability. These groups then completed CAIT and where included if scoring criteria were met. The treatment group undertook six weeks of progressive vibration training on a stabile vibration system. Pre and post testing consisted of measures of static single leg balance, a Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) and Electromyography (EMG) of peroneus longus in demi-pointe. Results indicated a significant improvement in static balance (p =. 04) and certain SEBT directions within the treatment group compared to the control group (p. 05). The results of the study suggested six weeks vibration training improved certain balance parameters within FAI populations. These results although initially encouraging, identified the need for further research with not just a direct comparison between treatment and control, but a closer examination of the effect of vibration training in comparison to more classical methods of rehabilitation before it can be recommended as a serious methods of treatment for FAI. The second stage of the research involved the implementation of a new piece of rehabilitation equipment which combined a <b>vibration</b> <b>unit</b> within a wobble board (Vibrosphere TM, Sweden). The manufactures claim the combination of the two principles accelerates rehabilitation for numerous lower body injuries and disorders. This specially designed unit allowed direct analysis of the effect of the vibration component of the unit on balance and muscle function, by comparing those who used the combined vibration/wobble board and those who simply used the wobble board alone. A control group was also included to analyse any difference over time as the testing was done during a pre-season training cycle. The research consisted of 33 semi-professional footballers reporting FAI as confirmed by CAIT and taler tilt and an anterior drawer test, being randomly assigned to one of three groups; Vibration/wobble board, Wobble board alone and Control. Both Vibration/wobble board and Wobble board alone completed identical exercises on identical equipment so results could not be attributed to different equipment. The results of the study suggest a significant difference in static balance; modified SEBT and Single leg triple hop for distance between groups with the greatest improvement being within the combined vibration/wobble board group (p <. 05). The results suggest the combination of vibration and wobble board improve balance and functional strength in those footballers reporting FAI compared to wobble board training alone. The precise mechanisms behind the current results are unclear. It has been suggested that it may be due to vibration having a positive effect on the stimulation of mechanoreceptors and the combination of that and unstable surface control seems to be optimal. It is difficult to compare studies but the research has highlighted certain areas for further research. The difference in static balance and SEBT scores between the dancers and footballers seems to suggest that the CAIT scores although similar may identify the need for more specific tests for each population. Also a longitudinal study is required to access injury rates following intervention and effect duration of the improvements seen...|$|E

When the vibration amplitude was kept constant, each unit started firing at a definite threshold of vibration frequency. With higher frequencies the rate of firing rapidly reached a maximum. Units recruited at higher frequencies presented a lower maximum rate of firing. 3. When the vibration frequency was kept constant, each masseter unit discharged at a definite threshold of vibration amplitude. With higher amplitudes the unit quickly reached a maximum rate of discharge. Units with a higher frequency threshold tended to also present a higher amplitude threshold. Motor unit "excitability" curves could be plotted using the combined threshold conditions for frequency and amplitude of applied vibrations. 4. With a given parametric set of <b>vibration,</b> the <b>units</b> only started firing at a given delay after the onset of vibration. The delay was quite different for different units and it increased considerably, sometimes by several seconds, when the vibration amplitude was made smaller. 5.
