The couple decided to enroll for the seminar. However, they were told later that the company cannot accept gay couples. Seelig took it to his Facebook {{and it was then}} picked up by Towleroad and other media outlets. The company responded by claiming that they allow gay couples in the seminar only if they are co-habitating and that the customer representatives Seelig spoke to misunderstood him. Seelig asked the Best Ever Vacations for a public apology, but there was no further response from the company.|$|E

Bart and Homer are {{released}} {{and just as}} Marge is lecturing them, all power is cut and a horde of Itchy and Scratchy robots advance towards them. One of the park employees refuses to let them escape on the helicopter with them due to Homer and Bart's misdeeds at the park. Homer frantically throws everything he can at them and discovers that the flash of a camera short circuits the robots' systems. The Simpsons then grab dozens of cameras from a closed gift shop and defeat the entire Itchy & Scratchy army. The family is thanked for saving the park and agree that it was their best <b>vacation</b> <b>ever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie was}} shot in {{location}} in Ireland. Trenchard-Smith:From a genre standpoint it’s my riff on those old fashioned 60′s blended family comedies like Yours, Mine and Ours and With Six You Get Eggroll. Lea Thompson is an absolute dream to work with. So talented; there’s nothing she cannot do, or nuance. She was particularly helpful with the child actors. Just before each take, she would remind her screen children, who sometimes had the attention span of all young kids, [...] "Remember I’m your mother, {{pay attention to what}} I am saying…" [...] The Irish crew were fantastic. That’s how we got a lot done on a low budget in 20 ten hour days, with all the attendant restrictions on the working hours of the under 16′s.Trenchard-Smith did not like the title The Cabin, which he thought made the movie sound like a horror film. He thought it should have been called Worst <b>Vacation</b> <b>Ever.</b>|$|R

50|$|Tired of The Amboy Dukes lack {{of effort}} and discipline, Nugent decided he had enough and left the group. He took a three-month <b>vacation</b> (his first <b>ever)</b> {{clearing}} {{his head in the}} Colorado wilderness, spending his time deer hunting and enjoying the outdoors.|$|R

Similarly, {{those of}} you who in your long <b>vacations</b> have <b>ever</b> stayed near Dumblane will be, I think, {{disappointed}} in no small degree by this study of the abbey, for which I showed you the sketch at last Lecture. You probably know that the oval window in its west end is one of the prettiest pieces of rough thirteenth-century carving in the kingdom; I used it for a chief example in my lectures at Edinburgh; and you know that the lancet windows, in their fine proportion and rugged masonry, would alone form a study of ruined Gothic masonry of exquisite interest.|$|R
50|$|Lyndon {{left the}} video games {{industry}} {{for a brief}} stint to develop CD-ROM productivity products for Computer Associates including Simply House, Stanley's Complete Book of Home Repair and Improvement and Simply Vacation, the first database driven travel-agent custom <b>vacation</b> software product <b>ever</b> developed. Both products were also innovative in terms of content size. They were also two of the first 10 CD-ROM titles ever to include Intel's Indeo full-screen video playback technology.|$|R
60|$|That <b>vacation!</b> Shall I <b>ever</b> forget it? I think not. Madame Beck went, {{the first}} day of the holidays, to join her {{children}} at the sea-side; all the three teachers had parents or friends with whom they took refuge; every professor quitted the city; some went to Paris, some to Boue-Marine; M. Paul set forth on a pilgrimage to Rome; the house was left quite empty, but for me, a servant, and a poor deformed and imbecile pupil, a sort of crétin, whom her stepmother in a distant province would not allow to return home.|$|R
2500|$|According {{to his own}} statements, he {{depended}} on familiar surroundings for his composition: [...] "I can compose only with myself at home. Neither on a summer holiday nor during longer <b>vacations</b> I have <b>ever</b> created anything". Statements like this explain why Wetz began to devote himself increasingly to the composition of symphonies and larger choral works only when he settled in Erfurt, but also why he later refused all offers for more lucrative positions and commissions. The seclusion - bordering on isolation - from the mainstream of the German music scene of the past allowed Wetz to concentrate completely upon the development of his own personal style.|$|R
5000|$|While {{working at}} the Taj, using the tips that he received, Irani bought a camera and took sports {{pictures}} (school cricket and football matches), selling them for twenty to thirty rupees, which he continued till well after marriage. His epiphany came when he saved money for seven years to take his family for their first <b>ever</b> <b>vacation</b> to Ooty, but they {{ended up in a}} desolate run down hotel, ironically called Shawham palace. Irani decided to take control of his life, and instead of living the petty existence of a photographer selling small photos and making a living, he would start to dream and live big and provide for his family in a better manner. Irani calls it his [...] "zero number bulk moment".|$|R
