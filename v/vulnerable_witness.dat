50|$|After {{witnessing}} a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection {{by the federal}} government as a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witness.</b> Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife Nicole Walker, in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, Stefano DiMera. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, Stefano insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because {{he does not want to}} betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is his daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous Clyde Weston.|$|E

40|$|Information {{provided}} by witnesses {{is fundamental to}} the investigation of criminal offences, and vulnerable people make up {{a large proportion of}} witnesses who enter the criminal justice system. Research concerning particularly <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witnesses</b> (i. e., children with autism) is still in its infancy. Further, research concerning typically developing children and adolescents, while vast, does not fully address the developmental and cognitive needs that this population present. Current best practice for eliciting information from <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witnesses</b> in England and Wales advocates the use of the Cognitive Interview (CI), which includes the Mental Reinstatement of Context (MRC) mnemonic. However, the benefits of MRC are unclear, both with typically developing children and children with autism. This thesis presents a series of studies that investigate how children might be better supported to recreate the context of an event using a developmentally appropriate drawing technique (Sketch-Reinstatement of Context; Sketch-RC). First, this thesis explores the interviewing practices of professionals who conduct or assist interviews with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witnesses,</b> with a particular focus on the use of drawing. Following this, a series of studies examine the efficacy of Sketch-RC and MRC with both typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder. Findings demonstrate that practitioners make regular use of drawing during investigative interviews. Importantly, Sketch-RC was found to be most effective for all children, improving remembering without a concomitant increase in incorrect or confabulated recall. Further, Sketch-RC enabled children with autism to perform on par with their typically developing peers. These findings provide evidence for an empirically and theoretically supported retrieval tool that can be used by practitioners when interviewing <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witnesses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: Over {{the last}} 25 years {{there has been}} a growing {{recognition}} that the way in which cases involving the vulnerable are investigated, charged and tried needs to change. Successive judgments of the Court of Appeal have re-enforced the message that advocates and judges have a duty to ensure <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witnesses</b> and defendants are treated fairly and allowed to participate effectively in the process. How do practitioners recognise who is or may be vulnerable? How should that person be interviewed? What account should police and the CPS take of a defendant's vulnerabilities? How should advocates adjust their questioning of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witnesses</b> and defendants whilst still complying with their duties to their client? How should judges manage a trial to ensure the effective participation of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witnesses</b> and defendants? <b>Vulnerable</b> People and the Criminal Justice System, written by leading experts in the field, gathers {{together for the first time}} answers to these questions and many more. It provides a practical, informative and thought-provoking guide to recognising, assessing and responding to vulnerability in witnesses and defendants at each stage of the criminal process. Backed by authoritative research and first-hand experience and drawing on recent case law, this book enables practitioners to deal with cases involving vulnerable people with calmness, authority, and confidence...|$|R
40|$|Through an {{analysis}} of a videotaped police interview with a child witness in an alleged rape case, we use conceptual frames and narrative analysis to illustrate how perceptions of co-conspirator and guilt are naively cultivated by (1) the child's relative inability to appropriately structure narrative responses to the police officer's questions and (2) the police officer's {{lack of attention to}} the cultural associations embedded in questions asked that draw on the rape myth. These observations illustrate that the videotaped police interview should not serve as both (1) police-produced information for the Crown prosecutors and (2) the witness's evidence-in-chief to be shown in court. Our analysis suggests that a great deal of damage can be done in an interview with a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witness</b> due to the absence, criticized in earlier work, of lawyer direction, and that a child's testimony is weakened by the jury watching this video as the witness's evidence-in-chief...|$|E
40|$|Police {{officers}} {{when dealing}} with interviewing children {{have to cope with}} a complex set of emotions from a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witness.</b> Triggers for recognising those emotions and how to build rapport are often the basis of learning exercises. However, current training pulls together the full complexity of emotions during role-playing which can be over-whelming and reduce appropriate learning focus. Interestingly a serious game’s interface can provide valuable training not because it represents full complex, multimedia interactions but because it can restrict emotional complexity and increase focus during the interactions on key factors for emotional recognition. The focus {{of this paper is to}} report on a specific aspect that was explored during the development of a serious game that aims to address the current police-training needs of child interviewing techniques, where the recognition of emotions plays an important role in understanding how to build rapport with children. The review of literature reveals that emotion recognition, through facial expressions, can contribute significantly to the perceived quality of communication. For this study an ‘emotions map’ was created and tested by 41 participants to be used in the development of a targeted interface design to support the different levels of emotion recognition. The emotions identified were validated with a 70 % agreement across experts and non-experts highlighting the innate role of emotion recognition. A discussion is made around the role of emotions and game-based systems to support their identification for work-based training. As part of the graphical development of the Child Interview Stimulator (CIS) we examined different levels of emotional recognition that can be used to support the in-game graphical representation of a child’s response during a police interview...|$|E
40|$|This article evaluates {{protective}} measures for vulnerable witnesses {{in light of}} both the Victims' Charter and measures in English law, giving effect {{to the right to}} protection in the Framework Decision on the Standing of Victims in Criminal Proceedings. It further highlights the fact that special measures for vulnerable witnesses are inadequate, being restricted to intermediaries and CCTV testimony. The pre-recorded evidence-in-chief and cross-examination, {{along the lines of the}} Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (YJCEA), ought to be introduced. It was found that the hearsay exception does not adequately protect vulnerable witnesses who are too afraid to testify. An exception to this, such as that in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which permits a court to admit hearsay evidence if a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witness</b> does not give evidence through fear. Drawing on European Court of Human Rights and English case law, it could be argued that pre-recorded video evidence-in-chief and cross-examination, as well as a hearsay exception based on fear of testifying, would not infringe the accused's constitutional right to challenge evidence. The article also assesses the restrictions on sexual history evidence as contained in the YJCEA. These have been interpreted by the House of Lords to permit sexual history evidence that is relevant to an act of consent, i. e. to disallow it would violate the accused's right to a fair trial. In this article it is also argued that the Legislature is unlikely to succeed in preventing the admission of sexual history evidence based on gendered constructions of consent. The article goes on to postulate that sexual offence victims should be granted leave for their lawyers to object to the admission of such evidence. The article concludes by arguing that, in order to create the impetus to introduce the measures that it advocates, the Victims' Charter should be revised to adopt the expansive right to protection enshrined in the Framework Decision. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} reading of Michael Ondaatje's {{narrative}} works that correlates certain aesthetic choices with alternative forms of political allegiance. Starting {{with a discussion of}} what constitutes the haptic qualities of these texts, I demonstrate how synaesthesia and indexicality as aesthetic devices and thematic choices forge a more egalitarian and interactive relationship between reader, author and work. Whilst the dissolution of monologic textuality gives way to heteroglossic textural propinquity, Ondaatje's works do not simply celebrate multivalent meaning, but recurrently remind one of the disruptive potential of the haptic. For not only are these narratives postmodernist flights into imagination and experiment, but they also constitute disturbing interventions into mainstream. discourses. Furthermore, haptic writing iscapable of offering an ethicil 1 ly responsible narrative that disrupts normative regimes of representation without dismissing the personal and the intima~. The indexical nature of hapticity constructs the text as a trace of a material reality and real material bodies; a remainder that is itself physical and opaque. Thus, the inscrutable corporealities and untranslatable textualities enact a form of witness writing, which does not become a redemptive spectacle, nor does it offer a cure-all solution. Resisting transparent repres;ntation and absolute cognitive me'chanisms, Ondaatje's works bear just witness to the irreducibility of difference and self-reflectively acknowledge their own representational limits. Similarly to the physicality of the body,Ã‚Â· haptic writing testifies to its own insufficiency and invites the reader in her tum to become an embodied and participatory, an agentive and <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witness.</b> The agency conferred by a haptic writing is of a microscopic rather than macro nature. Ondaatje's much criticised interest in the personal and the intimate, however,does not soar into a celebration of individualism. The haptic emphasis on the irreducibility of corporeality highlights a site where multiple allegiances can gain recognition without being subsumed into a uniform political stance. However, such immanent relationality can be romanticised or exoticised, just as multiple microscopic allegiances can be co-opted by regimes of dispersed control or of qmisi-fascistic nature. In this respect, Ondaatje's narratives not only gesture at their insufficient and constructed nature, but also outline their potential implication in and appropriation by normative discourSes.

40|$|Republic of Serbia has {{invested}} maximum efforts in adjusting national legislation {{with the international}} legal framework, as well in fulfilling its obligations foreseen in relevant international documents, including the Child Rights Convention. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present Units for the Protection of Child Victims and Witnesses in the Criminal Proceedings that were developed within the IPA project “Improvement of Children's Right through the System of Justice and Social Protection in Serbia”, funded by the EU, and implemented by the UNCEF in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy of the Republic of Serbia. The project was implemented from August 2014 to March 2017. The purpose of the Units is to ensure the best interest of children in situation when a child is identified as a victim or a witness of a crime and appears in the criminal or other court procedure. In this way, the state protects children who are important and infallible part of judicial proceedings from secondary victimization and traumatisation, given that the processes within institutions inevitably reflect on mental state of a child. Units were established in four cities: Belgrade, Niš, Novi Sad, and Kragujevac, and they operate at the regional level. This enables that all children, even those in rural areas, will be provided with adequate assistance and support during preparations for the hearing, during criminal proceedings, as well as in its aftermath. The role of the Units is multiple: along with the support to children, it also includes support to the judiciary agencies since the hearing may be performed with a help of professional personnel, psychologist, pedagogue or social worker. Since the members of the Units are trained for conducting forensic interviews according to the Protocol of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, their involvement by the judiciary becomes even more frequent. They try to avoid possible harmful effects of proceedings on children's health, their personality, growth and development. This paper particularly focuses on the legal position and protection of children as suggested by the international legal framework, and relevant legislation in Serbia, which present the basis for establishing the Units. Additionally, the paper pays special attention to psychological aspects of children's development and their position in the judicial proceedings. The so far results of the Units’ work has shown that 103 children have been given support in judicial proceedings, 23 children have been given the status of a particularly <b>vulnerable</b> <b>witness,</b> 108 info-sessions have been organized for professionals in judiciary and the social welfare system in order to introduce the Units and enable them to use services that Units provide. The results also suggest that predictability reduces the feeling of uncertainty and contributes to strengthening children's trust in the judicial proceedings. However, this is only the beginning. A lot of efforts and work needs to be done in order to use the full potential of the Units. In this respect it is relevant to make a shift from project financing to the State funding...|$|E
