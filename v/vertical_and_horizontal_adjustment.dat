50|$|A power side-view mirror (power side mirror, power wing mirror, {{or simply}} power mirror) is a side-view mirror {{equipped}} with electrical means for <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{from the inside}} of the automobile.|$|E
50|$|The {{side mirror}} is {{equipped}} for manual or remote <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{so as to}} provide adequate coverage to drivers of differing height and seated position. Remote adjustment may be mechanical by means of bowden cables, or may be electric by means of geared motors. The mirror glass may also be electrically heated and may include electrochromic dimming to reduce glare to the driver from the headlamps of following vehicles. Increasingly, the side mirror incorporates the vehicle's turn signal repeaters. There is evidence to suggest mirror-mounted repeaters {{may be more effective}} than repeaters mounted in the previously predominant fender side location.|$|E
5000|$|It may {{be noted}} from the diagram above {{that no matter}} how [...] "tight" [...] the heel bend, {{reversing}} the stick head over the ball, with a [...] "traditional" [...] style hockey stick head, always requires both a <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the toe side of the shaft rather than {{in the middle of the}} shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the shaft when stopping the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the heel side and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical shaft stop is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10° off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical.|$|E

40|$|A novel process {{enabling}} the simultaneous electron-beam exposure {{of different types}} of structures is presented, illustrated by the synchronous generation of filter gratings and waveguides. Optimized results for a precise adjustment of the interface waveguide-grating are shown, as well as the necessity for proximity correction achieved by dose assignment. The accommodation of the different address grids makes the pre-fixing of the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustments</b> possible. The structures are then transferred into the semiconductor by means of dry etching. The devices and their characteristic filter curves are presented...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the perception of body posture is altered in idiopathic scoliosis, a simple neurophysiologic experiment through laser line projection was conducted {{to test this hypothesis}} in three groups of individuals: 89 children with idiopathic scoliosis (IS), 50 children with congenital scoliosis (CS) and 45 controls without scoliosis. The subjects were instructed to adjust a laser line projection to the direction of gravity in <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> in <b>horizontal</b> projections in a dark environment. The performance, expressed as the deviation from the earth vertical (measured in degrees), was calculated by a computer. The three groups fulfilled the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustments</b> within the same accuracy. No relation with age, sex or severity of scoliotic deformity was found. Yet, the angle between <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> laser lines was significantly related with the severity of scoliosis, both in IS and CS. In contrast to our hypothesis, it was concluded that perception of postural control in IS is not altered. Therefore, this study indicates that IS {{is not likely to be}} caused by a dysfunction of postural control...|$|R
50|$|For older analog {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) technology, display lag is {{extremely}} low, {{due to the nature}} of the technology, which does not have the ability to store image data before display. The picture signal is minimally processed internally, simply for demodulation from a radio-frequency (RF) carrier wave (for televisions), and then splitting into separate signals for the red, green, and blue electron guns, and for timing of the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> sync. Image <b>adjustments</b> typically involved reshaping the signal waveform but without storage, so the image is written to the screen as fast as it is received, with only nanoseconds of delay for the signal to traverse the wiring inside the device from input to the screen.|$|R
50|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{range of}} a firearm sight is often advertised by the {{manufacturer}} using mils. For instance a rifle scope may be advertised as having a vertical adjustment range of 20 mils, which means that by turning the turret the bullet impact can be moved a total of 20 meters at 1000 meters (or 2 m at 100 m, 4 m at 200 m, 6 m at 300 m etc.). The <b>horizontal</b> <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> ranges can be different for a particular sight, for instance a scope may have 20 mils <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> 10 mils <b>horizontal</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Elevation differ between models, but about 10-11 mils are common in hunting scopes, while scopes made for long range shooting usually can have an adjustment range of 30-50 mils.|$|R
30|$|Website {{screenshot}} {{images were}} compared for both <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> similarity using luminosity histograms. The luminosity histograms for each matched image pair were compared for similarity by calculating the weighted mean {{between both the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> histograms. Next, both the average and maximum similarity values between histograms were empirically evaluated for clustering accuracy. Taking the average similarity score between the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> histograms performed best during our evaluation. Once the average <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> similarity score was determined, then the pairwise image distance was calculated as 1 - the pairwise image similarity.|$|R

40|$|Mandibular {{range of}} motion (ROM), <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal,</b> is often {{measured}} {{as a part of}} a diagnostic assessment of temporomandibular joint disorders. Ln the literature, a fixed ratio between the <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> the <b>horizontal</b> ROM has been suggested, i. e. 4 : 1. The ratio is frequently used to predict the vertical ROM on the basis of the <b>horizontal</b> ROM <b>and</b> vice versa. However, no scientific data are available to substantiate the ratio suggested. The aim of this study was to determine whether the fixed ratio of 4 : 1 exists and, if so, whether this ratio has a predictive value. <b>Vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> mandibular ROM was measured in 91 healthy subjects, 59 women, and 32 men (mean age 27. 2 years, s. d. 7. 4 years) using vernier callipers. We found a mean ratio between <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> ROM ranging from 6. 0 : 1 - 6. 6 : 1. On an individual basis the ratio ranged from 3. 6 - 15. 5. Correlations between <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> ROM were weak. On the basis of the results on this study it is concluded that the ratio between <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> ROM is approximately 6 : 1 rather than 4 : 1, and that the ratio has poor predictive value...|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> <b>horizontal</b> separation within the railway sector are relatively recent in many European countries, and, as a result, little analytical {{research has been}} carried out on their impact. The purpose of this working paper is to analyze the effects of these organizational reforms on efficiency, productivity and technical change in 16 national railway systems in Europe over the period 1985 - 2004.
