40|$|Abstract. Little {{is known}} about the {{existence}} of wandering Fatou compo-nents for rational maps in two complex variables.

40|$|We {{present the}} second part of a {{detailed}} statistical study focussed on the effects of tidal interactions and minor mergers on the radial and <b>vertical</b> <b>disk</b> structure of spiral galaxies. In the first part we reported on the sample selection, observations, and applied disk models. In this paper the results are presented, based on disk parameters derived from a sample of 110 highly-inclined/edge-on galaxies. This sample consists of two subsamples of 49 interacting/merging and 61 non-interacting galaxies. Additionally, 41 of these galaxies were observed in the NIR. We find significant changes of the <b>disk</b> structure in <b>vertical</b> direction, resulting in ~ 1. 5 times larger scale heights and thus vertical velocity dispersions. The radial disk structure, characterized by the cut-off radius and the scale length, shows no statistically significant changes. Thus, the ratio of radial to vertical scale parameters, h/z 0, is ~ 1. 7 times smaller for the sample of interacting/merging galaxies. The total lack of typical flat disk ratios (h/z 0) > 7 in the latter sample implies that <b>vertical</b> <b>disk</b> heating is most efficient for (extremely) thin disks. Statistically nearly all galactic disks in the sample (93 %) possess non-isothermal vertical luminosity profiles like the sech (60 %) and exp (33 %) distribution, independent of the sample and passband investigated.

However, tillage is difficult to combine with a growing crop, which limits its application. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how soil vertical cutting with minimum soil disturbance and mowing affect the growth and competitive ability of E. repens in a grass–clover crop. A tractor-drawn prototype with <b>vertical</b> <b>disks</b> was used to fragment E. repens rhizomes with minimal soil and crop disturbance. In experiments performed in 2014 and 2015 at a field site close to Uppsala, Sweden, the rhizomes were fragmented before crop sowing (ERF), during crop growth (LRF), or both (ERF+LRF). Fragmentation was combined with repeated mowing (yes/no) and four companion crop treatments (none, Italian ryegrass, white clover, and grass/clover mixture). The results showed that in the grass–clover crop, rhizome fragmentation reduced E. repens rhizome biomass production and increased Italian ryegrass shoot biomass. ERF and LRF both reduced E. repens rhizome biomass by about 38 % compared with the control, while ERF+LRF reduced it by 63 %. Italian ryegrass shoot biomass was increased by 78 % by ERF, 170 % by LRF and 200 % by ERF+LRF. Repeated mowing throughout the experiment reduced E. repens rhizome biomass by about 75 %. Combining repeated mowing with rhizome fragmentation did not significantly increase the control effect compared to mowing alone. We concluded that rhizome fragmentation using <b>vertical</b> <b>disks</b> can be used both before sowing and during crop growth to enhance the controlling effect of grass–clover crops on E. repens...|$|R

For a given total dust mass, grain growth is found to decrease the vertical height of the surface where the optical depth to the stellar radiation becomes unit and thus the local irradiation heating, while increasing the disk emission at mm and sub-mm wavelengths.

For a hotter disk atmosphere, the $f$-mode contributes less to the torque and remains confined near the midplane as it propagates away from the resonances. On the other hand, the excitation of the $g$-modes is stronger. As they propagate, they channel to the top of disk atmosphere and their group velocities decrease. The differences compared to previous studies may have implications in understanding the wave dynamics in a realistic disk structure. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to ApJ.
