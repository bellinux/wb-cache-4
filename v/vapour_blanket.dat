40|$|Purpose: With the {{spreading}} of Vapour Phase Soldering (VPS) technology {{it is important}} to understand and optimize the process itself. The paper presents a novel approach on the process zone characterization for direct feedback on the state of vapour, for better monitoring, control and understanding of the process. Design/methodology/approach: The simple model of condensation heating shows the importance of vapour concentration during condensation soldering. Different pressure sensors were applied in an experimental VPS station, where the hardware setup is focused for the current experiments. Static and dynamic pressure values are analyzed and correlated with additional thermal measurements. Findings: The results reveal the dynamics of the <b>vapour</b> <b>blanket</b> generation. The correlated measurements show different stages of the process initialization, highlighting better accuracy than sole temperature measurements of saturated vapour identification. It is possible to trace the height of the available saturated <b>vapour</b> <b>blanket</b> with static pressure measurements. Originality/value: The methods provide a completely novel approach from the aspect of process zone state variables and parameter characterization, focusing on pressure measurements. Practical implications: The VPS process may benefit from the more precise saturation detection, giving better control on the heat transfer, enabling more efficient production with the reduction of idle time, and resulting in better soldering quality. Social implications: Reducing the idle time of the VPS stations may result in better efficiency and smaller power consumption, reducing the environmental impact of the method. ...|$|E
30|$|Water, brine solution, oil, polymer etc. {{are used}} as {{conventional}} quenching media. Water and brine solution are restricted to quenching simple shapes and steels of comparatively low hardenability because of the occurrence of intolerable distortion, warpage and quench cracks [6]. On the other hand, convective cooling in oil is less intensive due to relatively high viscosity and lower heat capacity. A variety of different quenching oils tend to show a prolonged <b>vapour</b> <b>blanket</b> stage, a short nucleate boiling stage with a much lower cooling rate, and finally a prolonged convective cooling stage with a very modest cooling rate [1]. Polymer quenchants show low cooling rate and it cannot be used with some common additives and anti oxidants. Continuous monitoring of polymer quenchant is required for optimal performance {{and it is not}} suitable for steels requiring high temperature quenching [7]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new type of quenchants capable of producing desired property distribution, acceptable microstructure and residual stress distribution in section thicknesses of interest with avoidance of cracking and reduced distortion.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{addresses}} {{the study of}} the effect of the topographical length scales on the wetting behaviour and on its consequences in the hydrodynamic and thermal behaviour of impinging droplets. This work is part of a broader investigation to establish a systematic approach to design of micro-textured surfaces for cooling appli-cations based on spray and droplet impingement. The phenomena related to the wetting regime are strongly re-lated to the boiling mechanisms of the lamella but are not directly related to the heat transfer calculations. How-ever, controlling the droplet motion can be used to modify the contact area and residence time of the liquid over the surface, thus controlling the heat transfer mechanisms. This is the strategy followed here. For the set of sur-faces tested so far, the results show that the main topographical characteristics, namely the amplitude of the rough peaks, h, the distance between them, λR and the characteristic size of the peaks a seem to govern the wet-ting regimes and therefore the spreading and receding motion of the droplet, thus indirectly affecting the heat transfer to the surface. To cseparate the wetting from the heat transfer and boiling phenomena, complete wetting regime was promoted for all the surfaces tested here. So, while the characteristic dimensions of h, λR and a lead to a homogeneous wetting regime, (in this case the order of magnitude of h is much smaller than that of a and λR) increasing the ratio h/λR decreases the spreading diameter but also reduces the receding velocity, thus keep-ing the liquid for longer periods in contact with the surface. The averaged contact area of the lamella during the entire droplet/surface interaction is also larger. Consequently, the surface temperature is kept stabilized within lower values, for longer periods of time. However, these characteristic dimensions of the surface roughness will also interact with the boiling mechanisms of the lamella. The increase of h/λR performed at the expenses of a significant increase of h or a significant decrease of λR in may cause a strong effect in the nucleation mecha-nisms which becomes dominant regarding the cooling performance of the droplet. So, if the ratio h/λR ap-proaches a critical region for which, at sufficiently high heat fluxes, the cavities promote the formation of large vapour bubbles and/or strong interaction between them, a <b>vapour</b> <b>blanket</b> can be entrapped generating a dynamic droplet behaviour resembling that of the heterogeneous wetting and degrading the cooling performance. The characteristic size of a will act with the same trend of λR. In line with this, the cooling performance deterioration was correctly interpreted in previous works {{to be the result of}} the entrapment of a <b>vapour</b> <b>blanket.</b> However, this phenomenon is not a direct result of a heterogeneous wetting caused by surface topography, but instead is the consequence of the interaction of the roughness structures on the boiling mechanisms occurring within the la-mella...|$|E
40|$|International audienceExperiments were {{performed}} to highlight the influence of surface wettability on nucleate boiling heat transfer. Nanocoating techniques were used to vary the water contact angle from 20 ° to 110 ° by modifying nanoscale surface topography and chemistry. The bubble growth was recorded by a high speed video camera to enable {{a better understanding of}} the surface wettability effects on nucleation mechanism. For hydrophilic (wetted) surfaces, it was found that a greater surface wettability increases the vapour bubble departure radius and reduces the bubble emission frequency. Moreover, lower superheat is required for the initial growth of bubbles on hydrophobic (unwetted) surfaces. However, the bubble in contact with the hydrophobic surface cannot detach from the wall and have a curvature radius increasing with time. At higher heat flux, the bubble spreads over the surface and coalesces with bubbles formed at other sites, causing a large area of the surface to become <b>vapour</b> <b>blanketed.</b> The best heat transfer coefficient is obtained with the surface which had a water contact angle close to either 0 ° or 90 °. A new approach of nucleation mechanism is established to clarify the nexus between the surface wettability and the nucleate boiling heat transfer...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} and constructed which enabled material to be melted and heated to a maximum temperature of 1000 C and then flooded with a pre-heated liquid. A series of experiments to investigate the thermal interaction between molten metals (aluminium, lead and tin) and sub-cooled water were conducted. The cooling rates of the molten materials under conditions of flooding were measured with a high speed-thermocouple and recorded with a transient recorder. A simplified model for calculating heat fluxes and metal surface temperatures was developed and used. Experimental results yielded boiling heat transfer in the transition film and stable film regions of the classic boiling curve. Maximum and minimum heat fluxes were observed at nucleate boiling crisis and the Leidenfrost point respectively. Results indicate that heat transfer from molten metals to sub-cooled water {{is a function of}} temperature and coolant depth and not a direct function of the physical properties of the metals. Heat transfer in the unstable transition film boiling region suggests that boiling dynamics in this region where a stationary molten metal is under pool boiling conditions at atmospheric pressure would not initiate a fuel-coolant interaction. Low heat fluxes around the Leidenfrost point would provide efficient fuel-coolant decoupling by a stable <b>vapour</b> <b>blanket</b> to enable coarse mixing of the fuel and coolant to occur without appreciable loss of thermal energy from the fuel. The research was conducted by Gareph Boxley and was submitted for the degree of PhD at the University of Aston in Birmingham in 1980...|$|E
40|$|In general, steel {{processing}} covered {{heat treatment}} process to improve mechanical properties after machining process. The parameter of machining {{process can be}} set {{to improve the quality}} of the material surface according to standard quality. When material quenched in cooling media, there are three different stage during cooling process. The first stage is <b>vapour</b> <b>blanket</b> stage, the second is boiling stage and the last is cooling stage. The purpose of the research is to visualize the cooling process due to effect of surface roughness of medium carbon steel after machining in the water quenching. The speciment has diameter 20 mm and 90 mm in height make by turning process. In order to make different surface roughness on the specimen surface, two different parameter in turning process was applied. For coarse surface roughness the feed parameter was setup in 0. 4 mm/revolution and for the fine surface roughness the feed parameter was set up in 0, 2 mm/revolution with rotational speed of the workpiece is 250 rpm. The specimen was heated with heating temperatur 800 oC, 850 oC and 900 oC and homogenized for 3 hours in the furnace and than quenched in water cooling medium. By using transparant medium, the cooling process stage was recorded using camera Nikon D 7000 with shooting speed 8 frame per second (fps). By comparing frame by frame of the image taken from camera during cooling process, we can analyze the cooling process. The result show that the roughness surface of the specimen give a different effect of the cooling process stage. The coarse surface roughness show that the cooling process need more time than the fine surface roughness and the different of the cooling process very significant in the specimen with heating temperature 900 o...|$|E
