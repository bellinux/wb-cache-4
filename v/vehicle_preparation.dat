50|$|For 2007, Bright left FPR to {{join his}} {{struggling}} Britek Motorsport team and battled in the mid field. After two seasons with funds tightening, Bright leased out one of his two Racing Entitlement Contracts and focussed on just one car. Further to the team cutbacks Bright came to an arrangement with Stone Brothers Racing to do <b>vehicle</b> <b>preparation</b> and but most of his team equipment and workshop on the market, effectively shutting down Britek as a racing team. His form gradually improved at SBR and jumped forward when his older Britek BF Falcon was replaced with a SBR FG Falcon picking up a third at the Sydney 500 and leading the race, but by this stage Bright's major sponsor Fujitsu had announced they would be leaving the team.|$|E
50|$|Larkham {{spent the}} next four years driving Formula Holden/Brabham before {{spending}} 1994 out of the sport. Larkham's team then stepped into 5.0L Touring Cars in 1995 with a Ford EF Falcon using an innovative car design, bringing their open wheel experience and principles to touring car racing, though the team had a troubled season and failed to score a single point. Some of their innovations spread across the sport however. The team gradually improved, a highlight was third place at the 1997 Primus 1000 Classic at Bathurst, working themselves into a position where it could attract international quality co-drivers. By 1998 much of <b>vehicle</b> <b>preparation</b> was being handled by Stone Brothers Racing, promoting Larkham into a race winning combination, the win finally coming at the 1998 Surfers Paradise Indycar event. 1999 continued improved performances with Larkham taking pole position at the Bathurst 1000. During this time Larkham also first served on the board of TEGA.|$|E

50|$|The SUPARCO {{negotiated}} with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for {{the launch of the}} satellite and approval required from the United States Government for the launch of the Badr-I. The Air Force Strategic Command decided to fly the satellite by using one of its C-130 aircraft in 1986 to Florida, United States. The Delta 3000 was selected by NASA's administration as its launch <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Preparation</b> was made and its crew and satellite was stored at the aircraft, however, it was delayed due to unknown reasons. The Badr-I was never shipped to United States and its launch was delayed for until next four years. As aftermath of the Challenger disaster in 1986, the United States Government and NASA had halt all the flights of the rockets carrying spacecraft and satellite payloads until the investigations were thoroughly completed. The satellite was stored at the Instrumentation Laboratories (IL) and SUPARCO began to negotiate with other space powers. In 1990, representatives of Chinese government offered Government of Pakistan to launch the satellite on one of its Long March Rockets and its facility. SUPARCO did not want to wait any longer, therefore, the Air Force Strategic Command flew the satellite, in sub-assembly form, to People's Republic of China. The satellite was re-assembled by Air Force Strategic Command and Suparco's official who visited the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. The satellite was load at the Launch Area 2 and final preparations were made. The Chinese Government used Long March 2E, a three-stage orbital carrier rocket designed to commercial communications satellites, to launch the Badr-I who also took its first maiden flight with the launch of Badr-I in 16 July 1990.|$|E
40|$|Vehicles {{are tested}} in {{controlled}} and relatively narrow laboratory conditions {{to determine their}} official emission values and reference fuel consumption. However, on the road, ambient and driving conditions can vary over a wide range, sometimes causing emissions {{to be higher than}} those measured in the laboratory. For this reason, the European Commission has developed a complementary Real-Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure using the Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) to verify gaseous pollutant and particle number emissions during a wide range of normal operating conditions on the road. This paper presents the newly-adopted RDE test procedure, differentiating six steps: 1) vehicle selection, 2) <b>vehicle</b> <b>preparation,</b> 3) trip design, 4) trip execution, 5) trip verification, and 6) calculation of emissions.

This parameter measures {{the quality of the}} entire vehicle production process, i. e., component manufacturing and final assembly. The model also measures the proportion of manufacturing or assembly defects repaired by the automobile dealer prior to customer delivery. This conditional probability quantifies the ability of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>preparation</b> process to identify and repair defects prior to customer delivery.

40|$|Nanosatellite space {{launches}} could significantly {{benefit from}} an electrically powered launch complex, based on an electromagnetic coil launcher. This paper presents results of studies to estimate the required launcher parameters and some fixed facility issues. This study is based on electromagnetic launch, or electromagnetic gun technology, which is constrained to a coaxial geometry {{to take advantage of}} the efficiency of closely-coupled coils. A baseline configuration for analysis considers a payload mass of 10 kg, launch velocity of 6 km/s, a second stage solid booster for orbital insertion, and a payload fraction of about 0. 1. The launch facility is envisioned as an inclined track, 1 - 2 km in length, mounted on a hillside at 25 degrees aimed in the orbital inclination of interest. The launcher energy and power requirements fall in the range of 2000 MJ and 2 MW electric. This energy would be supplied by 400 modules of energy storage and magnetic coils. With a prime power generator of 2 MW, a launch rate of some 200 satellites per day is possible. The launch requires high acceleration, so the satellite package must be hardened to launch acceleration on the order of 1000 gee. Parametric evaluations compare performance parameters for a launcher length of 1 - 2 km, exit velocity of 4 - 8 km/s, and payloads of 1 - 100 kg. The EM launch complex could greatly reduce the amount of fuels handling, reduce the turn-around time between launches, allow more concurrence in launch preparation, reduce the manpower requirements for launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>preparation</b> and increase the reliability of launch by using more standardized vehicle preparations. Most importantly, such a facility could reduce the cost per launch and could give true launch-on-demand capability for nanosatellites...|$|E
40|$|The NASA Ames Research Center (Thermal Protection Materials and Systems Branch) is {{investigating}} new ceramic {{materials for the}} thermal protection of atmospheric entry vehicles. An incremental approach to proving the capabilities of these materials calls for a lifting entry flight test of a sharp leading edge component on the proposed SHARP (Slender Hypervelocity Aerothermodynamic Research Probe) vehicle. This flight test will establish the aerothermal performance constraint under real lifting entry conditions. NASA Ames has been developing the SHARP test flight with SSDL (responsible for the SHARP S I vehicle avionics), Montana State University (responsible for the SHARP S I vehicle airframe), the Wickman Spacecraft and Propulsion Company (responsible for the sounding rocket and launch operations), and with the SCU Intelligent Robotics Program, The SCU team was added well after {{the rest of the}} development team had formed. The SCU role was to assist with the development of a real-time video broadcast system which would relay onboard flight video to a communication groundstation. The SCU team would also assist with general <b>vehicle</b> <b>preparation</b> as well as flight operations. At the time of the submission of the original SCU proposal, a test flight in Wyoming was originally targeted for September 2000. This date was moved several times into the Fall of 2000. It was then postponed until the Spring of 2001, and later pushed into late Summer 2001. To date, the flight has still not taken place. These project delays resulted in SCU requesting several no-cost extensions to the project. Based on the most recent conversations with the project technical lead, Paul Kolodjiez, the current plan is for the overall SHARP team to assemble what exists of the vehicle, to document the system, and to 'mothball' the vehicle in anticipation of future flight and funding opportunities...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWe have conducted climate analyses of natural lightning activity at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (KSC/CCAFS). These {{analyses were conducted}} to improve forecasts of lightning related hazards for, and the planning of, space vehicle launches at KSC/CCAFS. If a space vehicle is hit by lightning during launch, the vehicle and payload may sustain irreparable damage. Lightning-based rules for conducting launch and <b>vehicle</b> <b>preparation</b> activities have been developed by launch managers at KSC/CCAFS. In this research, we investigated one aspect of these [...] the natural lightning launch commit criteria. Our goal was to improve the scientific basis for skillful forecasting of the probability of lightning hazards. Such forecasts have the potential to reduce lightning related risks to personnel and equipment, and to save millions of dollars in preparation and launch costs. Using cloud-to-ground lightning strike data from the National Lightning Detection Network during January 1989 through December 2008, we identified events in which the KSC/CCAFS natural lightning criteria for launches were violated [...] that is, when excessive lightning activity prevented or would have prevented launches from occurring. Based on these events, we developed daily and multi-day probabilities of lightning violations. We also developed and applied an objective statistical method for determining the seasonality of lightning and for identifying six lightning violation seasons through the course of the calendar year. These seasons were used as the basis for characterizing the temporal and spatial patterns associated with climate scale variations in lightning at KSC/CCAFS. We used atmospheric reanalysis data to analyze the physical processes that lead to interannual variability in: (a) lightning violations in each season; and (b) the start and end dates of the main lightning season. These analyses led to the identification of regional and global scale processes that tend to alter the probability of lightning violations, including: (1) shifts in the strength, latitude, and zonal extent of the Bermuda High; (2) alterations of regional scale divergence and convection, and (3) teleconnections to global scale climate variations. Several of these processes tend to be important in all or most of the six lightning violation seasons. The results of this study help form the foundation for improvements in the analysis and forecasting of natural lightning violations, and in the planning of launches at KSC/CCAFS.

40|$|The Ares I-X flight test, {{launched}} in 2009, {{is the first}} test of the Ares I crew launch vehicle. This development flight test evaluated the flight dynamics, roll control, and separation events, but also provided early insights into logistical, stacking, launch, and recovery operations for Ares I. Operational lessons will be especially important for NASA as the agency makes {{the transition from the}} Space Shuttle to the Constellation Program, which is designed to be less labor-intensive. The mission team itself comprised only 700 individuals {{over the life of the}} project compared to the thousands involved in Shuttle and Apollo missions; while missions to and beyond low-Earth orbit obviously will require additional personnel, this lean approach will serve as a model for future Constellation missions. To prepare for Ares I-X, vehicle stacking and launch infrastructure had to be modified at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) as well as Launch Complex (LC) 39 B. In the VAB, several platforms and other structures designed for the Shuttle s configuration had to be removed to accommodate the in-line, much taller Ares I-X. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>preparation</b> activities resulted in delays, but also in lessons learned for ground operations personnel, including hardware deliveries, cable routing, transferred work and custodial paperwork. Ares I-X also proved to be a resource challenge, as individuals and ground service equipment (GSE) supporting the mission also were required for Shuttle or Atlas V operations at LC 40 / 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. At LC 39 B, several Shuttle-specific access arms were removed and others were added to accommodate the in-line Ares vehicle. Ground command, control, and communication (GC 3) hardware was incorporated into the Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP). The lightning protection system at LC 39 B was replaced by a trio of 600 -foot-tall towers connected by a catenary wire to account for the much greater height of the vehicle. Like Shuttle, Ares I-X will be stacked on a MLP and rolled out to the pad on a Saturn-era crawler-transporter. While Ares I-X was only held in place by the four hold-down posts on its aft skirt during rollout, a new vehicle stabilization system (VSS) attached to the vertical service structure kept the vehicle from undue swaying prior to launch at the pad, LC 39 B. Following the launch, the flight test vehicle first stage was recovered with the aid of new parachutes resized to accommodate the five-segment-long first stage, which had a much greater length and mass than the Shuttle s reusable solid rocket boosters. After splashdown, recovery divers exercised extra care when handling the first stage to ensure that the flight data recorders in the fifth segment simulator were not damaged by exposure to sea water. The data recovered from the Ares I-X flight test will be very valuable in verifying the predicted environments and models used to design the vehicle. Lessons learned from Ares I-X will be shared with the Ares Projects through written and verbal reports and through integration of mission team members into the Project workforce...|$|E
