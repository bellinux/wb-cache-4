40|$|Ethylene {{evolution}} from plants inhibits Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, but the mechanism is little understood. In this study, the possible role of ethylene in Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation was clarified. •It was tested {{whether or not}} plant ethylene sensitivity affected genetic transformation; the sensitivity might regulate bacterial growth during co-cultivation and <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. For these experiments, melon (Cucumis melo) was used, in which ethylene sensitivity was controlled by chemicals, and Arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutants. •Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation was inhibited in ethylene-sensing melon, whereas, in Arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutant, it was enhanced. However, the ethylene sensitivity did not affect bacterial growth. <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression was inhibited by application of plant exudate from ethylene-sensitive plants. The inhibitory effect of the ethylene sensitivity on genetic transformation relieved the activation of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in A. tumefaciens with <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> inducer molecule (acetosyringone, AS) or A. tumefaciens mutant strain which has constitutive <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. •These results indicate that ethylene {{evolution from}} a plant inoculated with A. tumefaciens inhibited <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in A. tumefaciens through the ethylene signal transduction in the plant, and, as a result, Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation was inhibited...|$|R
30|$|Another vital {{factor that}} may {{contribute}} high transient transformation efficiencies might be full induction of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expressions in Agrobacterium. Transient transformation efficiencies of ice plant seedlings were 1.3 - to 1.7 -fold higher when root tips were removed {{in comparison to}} intact seedlings (Table  1). These data further support {{that the existence of}} wounded sites in plants may help with Agrobacterium infection by producing a phenolic compound to induce <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression and making plant cells vigorously divide to be competent for transformation. In addition, we have added 200  μM acetosyringone (AS) in our bacteria culture to fully induce <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expressions in Agrobacterium. In previous studies (Andolfatto et al. 1994; Ishimaru 1999; Konieczny et al. 2011), Agrobacterium strains were only cultured in rich media without additions of AS. In this study, Agrobacterium was specifically cultured in acidic minimal medium (AB-MES media), which contained glucose and low phosphate, and 200  μM AS to maximize <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in bacteria and may therefore result in successful and more effective transformation in ice plant callus and seedlings.|$|R
40|$|ChvE is a chromosomally encoded {{protein in}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens that mediates a sugar-related {{increase}} in virulence (<b>vir)</b> <b>gene</b> expression through {{the activities of}} the VirA/VirG two-component system, and has been proposed to be involved in both sugar utilization and chemotaxis towards sugars. The ChvE protein has homology to several bacterial periplasmic sugar binding proteins such as ribose-binding protein (RBP) and galactose/glucose-binding protein (GGBP) of Escherichia coli. In this study, we characterized the role of the chvE operon in sugar-related processes other than virulence and examined the biophysical properties of the ChvE protein. Further, ChvE mutants with altered <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression phenotypes have been isolated and characterized. Three distinct categories of mutants have been identified: those that cannot bind sugar, those that can bind sugar but have effects on both sugar utilization and <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression and, finally, those that can bind and utilize sugar in a wild type fashion but affect <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Examination of a homology model of ChvE shows the mutated residues associated with the latter two phenotypes lie in two overlapping solvent-exposed sites adjacent to the sugar-binding cleft where conformational changes associated with the binding of sugar might have a maximal affect on ChvE 2 ̆ 7 s interactions with VirA and other proteins. We propose that the third category of mutants define a surface of ChvE that interacts with the periplasmic domain of the sensor kinase, VirA. ...|$|R
50|$|Systems {{in which}} T-DNA and <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> {{are located on}} {{separate}} replicons are called T-DNA binary systems. T-DNA {{is located on the}} binary vector (the non-T-DNA region of this vector containing origin(s) of replication that could function both in E. coli and in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and antibiotic-resistance genes used to select for the presenceof the binary vector in bacteria, became known as vector backbone sequences). The replicon containing the <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> became known as the vir helper. Strains harboring this replicon and a T-DNA are considered disarmed if they do not contain oncogenes that could be transferred to a plant.|$|E

40|$|Expression of {{virulence}} factors by Bordetella pertussis is {{altered by}} environmental signals (antigenic modulation) and {{is dependent on}} an activator encoded by a <b>gene</b> called <b>vir.</b> We have used TnphoA (Tn 5 IS 50 L::phoA) gene fusions to define two sets of genes whose expression is either activated (vag loci) or repressed (vrg loci) by modulation signals. Both groups of genes appear to be regulated by the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> product in that, {{in the absence of}} modulators, null mutations in vir lead to the repression of vag gene fusions and derepression of vrg gene fusions. Mutants of B. pertussis were isolated that constitutively express virulence factors {{in the presence of the}} modulator MgSO 4, nicotinic acid, or low incubation temperature. We designate the gene that carries such mutations mod (modulation) and have characterized one (mod- 1) of these mod constitutive mutations. A method was developed for the insertional inactivation of the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> by using the integration of a suicide replicon. Inactivation of the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> in the mod- 1 mutant, followed by transcomplementation with the cloned wild-type <b>vir</b> <b>gene,</b> gives the Mod- 1 constitutive phenotype, showing that the mod- 1 mutation defines a <b>gene</b> distinct from <b>vir.</b> The <b>gene</b> carrying the mod- 1 mutation is linked to vir and was cloned on a recombinant cosmid (pLAF-C 1) which transcomplements the vir- 1 ::Tn 5 mutation in B. pertussis 347. Introduction of pLAF-C 1 into vir mutant and vir+ B. pertussis strains also gives the Mod- 1 constitutive phenotype, indicating that mod- 1 is a dominant allele. These data suggest that the mod gene product could have sensory functions for the environmental signals that affect the expression of vir-regulated genes of B. pertussis. The mod constitutive strains and plasmids described here also have applications in pertussis vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes tumors on plants only at {{temperatures}} below 32 °C, and virulence gene expression is specifically inhibited at temperatures above 32 °C. We show here that this effect persists even when the virA and virG loci are expressed under the control of a lac promoter whose activity is temperature independent. This finding suggests that one or more steps in the signal transduction process mediated by the VirA and VirG proteins are temperature sensitive. Both the autophosphorylation of VirA and the subsequent transfer of phosphate to VirG are shown to be sensitive to high temperatures (> 32 °C), and this correlates with the reduced <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression observed at these temperatures. At temperatures of 32 °C and higher, the VirA molecule undergoes a reversible inactivation while the VirG molecule is not affected. <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction is temperature sensitive in an acetosyringone-independent virA mutant background but not in a virG constitutive mutant which is virA and acetosyringone independent. These observations all support the notion that the VirA protein is responsible for the thermosensitivity of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. However, an Agrobacterium strain containing a constitutive virG locus still cannot cause tumors on Kalanchoe plants at 32 °C. This strain induces normal-size tumors at temperatures up to 30 °C, whereas the wild-type Agrobacterium strain produces almost no tumors at 30 °C. These results suggest that at temperatures above 32 °C, the plant becomes more resistant to infection by A. tumefaciens and/or functions of some other <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> products are lost in spit...|$|R
40|$|Three point {{mutations}} {{were isolated}} in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens virG gene by screening for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression {{in the absence of}} added phenolic inducing compounds. All three mutations were localized in the predicted amino-terminal phosphoryl receiver domain of the protein. One mutant (N 54 D) bypasses the requirement for VirA and phenolic inducers both for transcriptional activation of all tested vir promoters and for plant tumorigenesis. This mutant also activates <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression efficiently at neutral pH, indicating that the step in induction that is normally stimulated by acid pH occurs before or during VirG phosphorylation. The other two mutants (M 13 T and H 15 R) require VirA for activity but are sensitized to low levels of inducing stimuli...|$|R

50|$|The {{transfer}} DNA (abbreviated T-DNA) is the transferred DNA of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of {{some species}} of bacteria such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes.

50|$|L. monocytogenes {{can act as}} a {{saprophyte}} or a pathogen, {{depending on}} its environment. When this bacterium is present within a host organism, quorum sensing causes the up-regulation of several virulence genes. Depending on the location of the bacterium within the host organism, different activators up-regulate the virulence genes. SigB, an alternative sigma factor, up-regulates <b>Vir</b> <b>genes</b> in the intestines, whereas PrfA up-regulates gene expression when the bacterium is present in blood. Little is known about how this bacterium switches between acting as a saprophyte and a pathogen; however, several noncoding RNAs are thought to be required to induce this change.|$|E
40|$|Periplasmic deletions of the homodimeric Agrobacterium tumefaciens sensor {{histidine}} kinase VirA {{result in}} a loss of interaction with the wild type periplasmic domain in a yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting that this domain may contribute to dimerization. Modifications were made to the wild type periplasmic domain using mutagenic PCR. Two of the mutations, peri 5 and peri 6, were found to have enhanced and weak interactions respectively, relative to wild-type peri versus itself in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Further characterization of these mutants was done after substituting the wild type periplasmic domain of a 2. 6 kb virA fragment with these modified domains and cloning into a high copy vector, pYW 15 b. These mutant strains were assayed for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression and virulence in the virA null strain, A 348 - 3, carrying a PvirB:lacZ reporter fusion using a β-galactosidase assay. We found that in comparison to wild type VirA, the VirAperi 5 mutant has an elevated level of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in the absence of arabinose, while <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression is decreased in the presence of arabinose. This is a deviation from normal VirA behavior where the primary phenolic inducer signal is amplified in the presence of monosaccharides. Similar behavior was observed in a quantitative tobacco virulence assay. Clearly, {{there is a need to}} analyze these mutants further. Assuming that VirA requires dimer formation to function, our study implies that neither the peri 5 nor the peri 6 mutants seem to contribute to VirA dimerization, as evidenced by the ability of these mutant VirAs to function in <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression and virulence assays. We also provide evidence that yeast- 2 -hybrid interactions do not necessarily correlate with biological interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{virulence}} (vir) {{region of}} pTiC 58 was screened for promoter activities by using gene fusions to a promoterless lux operon in the broad-host-range vector pUCD 615. Active vir fragments contained the strongly acetosyringone-inducible promoters of virB, virC, virD, and virE and the weakly inducible promoters of virA and virG. Identical induction patterns were obtained with freshly sliced carrot disks, suggesting that an inducer is released after plant tissue is wounded. Optimal conditions for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction were pH 5. 7 for 50 microM acetosyringone or sinapic acid. The induction of virB and virE by acetosyringone was strictly dependent on intact virA and virG loci.

50|$|Many plant {{expression}} vectors {{are based on}} the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

50|$|T-DNA {{contains}} {{two types of}} genes: the oncogenic genes, encoding for enzymes involved in the synthesis of auxins and cytokinins and responsible for tumor formation; and the genes encoding for the synthesis of opines. These compounds, produced by condensation between amino acids and sugars, are synthesized and excreted by the crown gall cells and consumed by A. tumefaciens as carbon and nitrogen sources. Outside the T-DNA, are located the genes for the opine catabolism, the genes {{involved in the process}} of T-DNA transfer from the bacterium to the plant cell and the genes involved in bacterium-bacterium plasmid conjugative transfer. (Hooykaas and Schilperoort, 1992; Zupan and Zambrysky, 1995).The T-DNA fragment is flanked by 25-bp direct repeats, which act as a cis element signal for the transfer apparatus. The process of T-DNA transfer is mediated by the cooperative action of proteins encoded by genes determined in the Ti plasmid virulence region (<b>vir</b> <b>genes)</b> and in the bacterial chromosome. The Ti plasmid also contains the genes for opine catabolism produced by the crown gall cells, and regions for conjugative transfer and for its own integrity and stability. The 30 kb virulence (vir) region is a regulon organized in six operons that are essential for the T-DNA transfer (virA, virB, virD, and virG) or for the increasing of transfer efficiency (virC and virE) (Hooykaas and Schilperoort, 1992; Zupan and Zambryski, 1995, Jeon et al., 1998). Different chromosomal-determined genetic elements have shown their functional role in the attachment of A. tumefaciens to the plant cell and bacterial colonization: the loci chvA and chvB, involved in the synthesis and excretion of the b -1,2 glucan (Cangelosi et al., 1989); the chvE required for the sugar enhancement of <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> induction and bacterial chemotaxis (Ankenbauer et al., 1990, Cangelosi et al., 1990, 1991); the cel locus, responsible for the synthesis of cellulose fibrils (Matthysse 1983); the pscA (exoC) locus, playing its role in the synthesis of both cyclic glucan and acid succinoglycan (Cangelosi et at., 1987, 1991); and the att locus, which is involved in the cell surface proteins (Matthysse, 1987).|$|E
40|$|The {{virulence}} (<b>vir)</b> <b>genes</b> of Agrobacterium tumefaciens are {{induced by}} low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds and monosaccharides through a two-component regulatory system {{consisting of the}} VirA and VirG proteins. However, {{it is not clear}} how the phenolic compounds are sensed by the VirA/VirG system. We tested the vir-inducing abilities of 15 different phenolic compounds using four wild-type strains of A. tumefaciens [...] KU 12, C 58, A 6, and Bo 542. We analyzed the relationship between structures of the phenolic compounds and levels of vir gene expression in these strains. In strain KU 12, <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> were not induced by phenolic compounds containing 4 '-hydroxy, 3 '-methoxy, and 5 '-methoxy groups, such as acetosyringone, which strongly induced <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> of the other three strains. On the other hand, <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> of strain KU 12 were induced by phenolic compounds containing only a 4 '-hydroxy group, such as 4 -hydroxyacetophenone, which did not induce <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> of the other three strains. The <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> of strains KU 12, A 6, and Bo 542 were all induced by phenolic compounds containing 4 '-hydroxy and 3 '-methoxy groups, such as acetovanillone. By transferring different Ti plasmids into isogenic chromosomal backgrounds, we showed that the phenolic-sensing determinant is associated with Ti plasmid. Subcloning of Ti plasmid indicates that the virA locus determines which phenolic compounds can function as vir gene inducers. These results suggest that the VirA protein directly senses the phenolic compounds for vir gene activation...|$|E

The published genome sequence of Plasmodium vivax revealed the largest subtelomeric multigene family of human malaria parasites, the vir super-family, presently composed of 346 <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> subdivided into 12 different subfamilies based on sequence homologies detected by BLAST. Results A novel computational approach {{was used to}} redefine <b>vir</b> <b>genes.</b> First, a protein-weighted graph was built based on BLAST alignments. This graph was processed to ensure that edge weights are not exclusively based on the BLAST score between the two corresponding proteins, but strongly dependant on their graph neighbours and their associations. Then the Markov Clustering Algorithm {{was applied to the}} protein graph. Next, the Homology Block concept was used to further validate this clustering approach. Finally, proteome-wide analysis was carried out to predict new VIR members. Results showed that (i) three previous subfamilies cannot longer be classified as vir genes; (ii) most previously unclustered <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> were clustered into vir subfamilies; (iii) 39 hypothetical proteins were predicted as VIR proteins; (iv) many of these findings are supported by a number of structural and functional evidences, sub-cellular localization studies, gene expression analysis and chromosome localization (v) this approach can be used to study other multigene families in malaria.

40|$|The Agrobacterium VirG {{protein is}} {{normally}} expressed from two promoters {{in response to}} multiple stimuli, including plant-released phenolics (at promoter P 1) and acidic growth media (at promoter P 2). To simplify the analysis of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction, we sought to create Agrobacterium strains in which virG could be expressed in a controllable fashion. To study {{the possibility of using}} the lac promoter and repressor, we constructed a plasmid containing the lac promoter fused to the lacZ structural gene. A derivative of this plasmid containing the lacIq gene was also constructed. The plasmid not containing lacIq expressed high levels of beta-galactosidase. The plasmid containing lacIq expressed beta-galactosidase at very low levels in the absence of o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) and at moderate levels in the presence of IPTG. We also fused the lac promoter to a virG::lacZ translational fusion and found that IPTG elevated expression of this translational fusion to moderate levels, though not to levels as high as from the stronger of the two native virG promoters. Finally, the lac promoter was used to express the native virG gene in strains containing a virB::lacZ translational fusion. virB expression in this strain depended on addition of IPTG as well as the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> inducer acetosyringone. In a similar strain lacking lacIq, virB expression was greater than in a strain in which virG was expressed from its native promoters. Expression of virG from the lac promoter did not alter the acidic pH optimum for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction, indicating that the previously observed requirement for acidic media was not due solely to the need to induce P 2...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a {{widespread}} soil bacterium that elicits tumors on most dicots and some monocots through an interkingdom transfer of genetic information [...] T(transfer) -DNA.

Earlier studies indicate that the att (attachment) genes of A. tumefaciens are crucial in the ability of this soil phytopathogen to infect susceptible host plants. Mutations in many att genes, notably attR and attD, rendered the strain avirulent. These genes are located on pAtC 58. Previous work also has shown that derivatives of the wild-type strain C 58 cured of pAtC 58 are virulent as determined by qualitative virulence assays and, hence, pAtC 58 was described as nonessential for virulence. We show here that the absence of pAtC 58 in pTiC 58 -containing strains results in reduced virulence but that disruption of the attR gene does not result in avirulence or a reduction in virulence.

40|$|Most {{virulence}} (<b>vir)</b> <b>genes</b> of Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{that are}} required {{for the formation of}} crown gall tumors are expressed in response to such plant signal molecules as acetosyringone and lignin precursors. The phenolic signals are transduced through a receptor VirA protein in the inner membrane of the bacterial cell. The expression of these genes triggers the transfer of a specific DNA segment, called transferred DNA (T-DNA), from the Ti plasmid to plant cells, and its integration into their nuclear DNA. We show here that a group of aldoses (L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-lyxose, D-glucose, D-mannose, D-idose, D-galactose, and D-talose) can markedly enhance acetosyringone-dependent expression of <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> when the concentration of acetosyringone is limited (10 microM) but does not enhance the expression of noninducible genes. Likewise, a 2 -deoxy-D-glucose, a nonmetabolized sugar, is also effective. When a deletion was introduced into the virA gene in the region encoding the periplasmic portion of the VirA protein, enhancement by glucose disappeared, but vir expression was induced by acetosyringone in this mutant. These results suggest that these sugars directly enhance a signaling process initiated by phenolic inducers that results in an increase in expression of the <b>vir</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|E

We report here that certain sugars induce the <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> synergistically with phenolic inducers {{by way of}} a distinct regulatory pathway that includes VirA and a chromosomally encoded virulence protein, ChvE. Sequence comparison showed that ChvE is a periplasmic galactose-binding protein corresponding to the GBP 1 protein isolated from Agrobacterium radiobacter. Like homologous sugar-binding proteins in Escherichia coli, ChvE was required for chemotaxis toward galactose and several other sugars. These sugars strongly induced vir gene expression in wild-type cells when acetosyringone was absent or present in low concentrations. Mutations in chvE abolished vir gene induction by sugars and resulted in a limited host range for infection but did not affect vir gene induction by acetosyringone. A mutant lacking the periplasmic domain of VirA exhibited the same regulatory phenotype and limited host range as chvE mutants. These data show that the <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> are regulated by two separate classes of plant-derived inducers by way of distinct regulatory pathways that can be separated by mutation. Induction by sugars is essential for infection of some but not all plant hosts...|$|E
40|$|The {{virulence}} {{genes of}} Agrobacterium {{are required for}} this organism to genetically transform plant cells. We show that <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression is specifically induced by a small (< 1000 Da) diffusible plant cell metabolite present in limiting quantities in the exudates {{of a variety of}} plant cell cultures. Active plant cell metabolism is required for the synthesis of the vir-inducing factor, and the presence of bacteria does not stimulate this production. vir-inducing factor is (i) heat and cold stable; (ii) pH stable, although vir induction with the factor is sensitive above pH 6. 0; and (iii) partially hydrophobic. Induction of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression was assayed by monitoring beta-galactosidase activity in Agrobacterium strains that carry gene fusions between each of the vir loci and the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli. vir-inducing factor (partially purified on a C- 18 column) induces both the expression in Agrobacterium of six distinct loci and the production of T-DNA circular molecules, which are thought {{to be involved in the}} transformation process. vir-inducing factor potentially represents the signal that Agrobacterium recognizes in nature as a plant cell susceptible to transformation...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{activation}} of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens vir regulon is regulated by phenolics such as acetosyringone (AS), certain monosaccharides, and acidic conditions produced by wounded plant cells. The transmembrane protein VirA acts as an environmental sensor, mediating signal transduction upon perception of these stimuli. Although the periplasmic domain of VirA is not absolutely required for AS-dependent <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction, it is needed for interactions with the periplasmic sugar-binding protein ChvE that result in sugar-induced enhancement of phenolic sensitivity. In this report, we demonstrate that mutations within the periplasmic domain but outside the predicted ChvE binding region can drastically alter the sensitivity of VirA to As. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have characterized the roles of three individual amino acids in sugar-dependent AS sensitivity and have correlated the induction phenotype with the tumorigenic capacity of strains expressing mutant versions of VirA. Substitution of leucine for Glu- 255 abolishes sugar enhancement while replacement with aspartic acid results in a wild-type phenotype. This residue lies outside the predicted ChvE binding site and thus identifies a new region of the VirA periplasmic domain crucial for the enhancement of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction by carbohydrates. In the absence of inducing sugar, wild-type VirA protein appears {{to be subject to}} some form of inhibition that suppresses the maximal level of transcriptional activation; deletions within the periplasmic region relieve this suppression...|$|R
40|$|The {{flavonoid}} naringenin {{has been}} investigated as a possible <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> inducer in Agrobacterium mediated transformation in Passiflora mollissima, P. giberti and Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi. Thetransformation efficiency percentage of explants showing blue GUS expression {{and the extent of}} staining following inoculation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains EHA 105 and 1065, carrying gus and nptII genes was enhanced with the supplementation of the co-cultivation medium with naringenin. Supplementation of medium with 100 mM (strain EHA 105) and 300 mM (strain 1065) naringenin was most effective at enhancing mean (±s. e. m., n= 3) GUS activity in leaf explants (20. 3 ± 2. 4 %, strain EHA; 105; 6. 0 ± 0. 57 %, strain 1065) and nodal segments (16. 7 ± 2. 4 % strain EHA 105; 8. 3 ± 0. 57 % strain 1065) of P. mollissima. In P. giberti and N. tabacum maximum GUS activitywas obtained in leaf and root explants with 100 mM naringenin for both strains analysed. Additionally, when naringenin was added to Luria Bertani (LB) medium, both bacterial growth via optical density and colony forming units were higher when compared to control. This is the first report of the use ofnaringenin to enhance gene transfer from Agrobacterium to plants. These findings suggest that naringenin can be used as an alternative to acetosyringone for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction in Agrobacterium. This approachmay be especially useful in plants that are generally recalcitrant to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation...|$|R
