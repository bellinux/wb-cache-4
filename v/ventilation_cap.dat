It has a raised platform with a pine pulpit and seating for 1,000. The property has 288 numbered wooden [...] "tents" [...] placed in two and a partial third concentric ring around the arbor. Tent No. 1 is believed to date to the early-1830s. Rock Springs Camp Meeting Ground is the earliest camp meeting organization in North Carolina.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 February 1975, {{the news}} {{black-out}} was lifted. On 5 March, Chief Superintendent Booth and Ronald Whittle appeared together on both {{national and local}} television. The next day a headmaster at a local school told police that a pupil had brought him a piece of Dymotape that read [...] "DROP SUITCASE INTO HOLE" [...] and, subsequently, other pupils had found a torch wedged in the grilles of what was locally known as the [...] "glory-hole", one of the <b>capped</b> <b>ventilation</b> shafts of the old Harecastle Tunnel. The boys who found the torch in Bathpool Park {{had given it to}} the headmaster several weeks before, but neither had realised the significance of the find until the television broadcast.|$|R
50|$|The Animal Morgue (1934) is {{situated}} {{north of the}} Stable. The morgue is a cement-rendered concrete structure, square in plan, with a timber-framed pyramid roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A large metal <b>ventilation</b> fleche <b>caps</b> the ridge. A timber lean-to that is not significant shelters the entry doors. There are prominent stepped architraves around the exteriors of the windows. The interior walls are cement-rendered with coving to all corners. The floor is concrete, while the ceiling is white-painted cement sheet with dark- stained timber battens forming a geometric pattern. The ceiling features lattice timber ventilation panels and a skylight {{at the southern end}} made with translucent corrugated plastic sheeting. The double door is timber with multi-light glazed panels. The windows are multi-light, timber double-hung sashes and have external hinged timber-framed screens. There are small high level windows in the west wall. All glass in the building is obscured. A steel I-beam spans the width of the room from north to south. In the north-western corner is a concrete dissecting bench with drain and in the north-eastern corner is a similar bench with a ceramic sink and associated foot-operated tap. These tables drain to an integrated concrete surface gutter that runs around the western and northern edges of the floor. There is a central floor drain.|$|R
5000|$|The {{remains of}} a two small brick {{structures}} of unknown function are situated immediately north of the oven sites. Unknown Structure 1, located closest to the ovens and immediately above their adjacent rail spur cutting, is constructed of mortared orange bricks and measures approximately 2m x 3m. Metal artefacts of unknown function remain in situ within the structure, and efforts to identify these artefacts may provide information on the function and use of this structure. Unknown Structure 2 is situated 5m north of the first structure. It is constructed of roughly made though well mortared together cement bricks and measures 2m x 2m and is 2m in height. A cement [...] "capping" [...] has been fitted over the structure, with later bricks added above. The southern elevation features a small cement brick return. The function of this structure remains unknown, though the Unknown Structure 2 may be a <b>capped</b> <b>ventilation</b> shaft installed {{for one of the}} two tunnels dug during operations of the Francis Mine on this site between 1908 and 1923.|$|R
500|$|Beacon Hill Station was {{designed}} by architectural firm Otak and built by {{a joint venture between}} engineering firms Hatch Mott MacDonald and Jacobs Engineering Group. The station building houses entrances to four high-speed elevators that travel [...] to platform level in 20 seconds. Beacon Hill's [...] split island platform is located between the two Beacon Hill Tunnel tubes, with a small cross-tunnel passageway between the two sections of the platform. It serves Central Link's two tracks; the northbound tracks serves trains to University of Washington station, while the southbound tracks serves trains to Angle Lake station. As with all Link stations, electronic information signs above the platform offer real-time information about train arrivals and service alerts, in addition to announcements over an intercom. Beacon Hill's bus stops are located south of the station building on Beacon Avenue, with the northbound stop located adjacent to the station and the southbound stop accessible via a signaled crosswalk. The station does not include public parking, but is within walking distance of several private parking lots that require payment. ORCA card vending machines are located outside the station building, along with bicycle lockers and a bicycle cage with space for 48 bicycles. Emergency staircases and the <b>ventilation</b> shaft are <b>capped</b> by the east headhouse, located behind the station building and plaza on South Lander Street.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} order to {{investigate}} the effect of summer and winter natural ventilation air exchange on psychrometric results in closed and open type poultry houses and the possibility of increasing its efficiency. This research had been conducted in three poultry houses located at different altitude that had different dimensions, construction and insulation levels. Inside and outside air temperature and relative humidity measured by sensors and averages were calculated for 2 hourly periods in 24 hours in summer and winter season. The data obtained from the experiments indicated a significant relationship between the efficiency of ventilation and structural dimensions. The necessary summer ventilation rate was calculated as 4. 5 m 3 h- 1 kg- 1 body mass and the inside and outside dry-bulb temperature difference was accepted as 2 oC. The natural ventilation design characteristics and structural dimensions necessary to increase the efficiency of natural ventilation system in poultry houses should be with the roof slope not less then 20 o– 30 o, the ridge provided with continuous <b>capped</b> <b>ventilation</b> opening, the proportion of the effective outlet area to effective inlet area (A 2 /A 1) at least 1 / 2 or 1 / 3, the ridge height of the building not less then 4 - 5 m and the building width not exceed 12 meters...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Assessment of {{severity}} {{and site}} of care decisions for community-acquired pneumonia patients (CAP) {{are very important}} for patients’ safety and optimal use of resources. Late admission to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) leads to increase the rate of mortality in CAP. We aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the new expanded CURB- 65 score in comparison with other pneumonia severity scoring systems (PSI, CURB- 65) in predicting CAP patients’ outcomes. Methods: a prospective study included 250 consecutive patients hospitalized for CAP at Chest and Tropical medicine Departments and ICUs at Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt in the period between May 2016 and November 2016. Results: The mean age of patients was 59. 17  ±  14. 04  years, 56 % of all patients had comorbid diseases. As regards patients, outcomes (ICU admission rate, the median length of hospital stay, the overall 30 -day mortality rate and need for invasive mechanical ventilation) were 29. 6 %, 8  days 11. 2 % and 23. 6 % respectively. COPD and liver cirrhosis were significantly associated with increased the 30 -day mortality in our CAP patients. Mortality rate increased with the severity of liver cirrhosis. In the multivariate analysis (age ⩾  65  years, LDH >  230  u/L, Albumin <  3. 5  g/dL, Platelet count <  100  ×  109 /L, SBP <  90  mmHg or DBP ⩽  60  mmHg, septic shock and Confusion) were the independent predictors of the 30 -day mortality. Expanded CURB- 65 was correlated with severity of liver disease guided by Child Pugh score (r (0. 34), p-value (0. 01). The 30 -day mortality was lower in expanded CURB- 65 score (1 – 4) about 4. 1 % than PSI class (I–III) and CURB- 65 score (0 – 2). While, the 30 -day mortality was higher in expanded CURB- 65 score (5 – 8) about 25. 9 % than PSI class (IV–V) 14. 2 % and lastly CURB- 65 score (3 – 5) 18. 4 %. Expanded CURB- 65 score (5 – 8) was associated with more frequent ICU admission about 49. 4 % than other two scores. The expanded CURB- 65 scoring system was the best predictor of 30 -day mortality, ICU admission and need for mechanical <b>ventilation</b> in <b>CAP</b> patients as it had the highest sensitivity, negative predictive value and largest area under the ROC curve. Conclusions: Expanded CURB- 65 score is simple, objective and more accurate scoring system for evaluation of CAP severity and can improve the efficiency of predicting the mortality in CAP patients, better than CURB- 65 and PSI scores. Also, Expanded CUEB- 65 may generate new therapeutic and prognostic modality in CAP especially in patients with liver cirrhosis...|$|R
