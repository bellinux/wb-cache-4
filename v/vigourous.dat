As the Roman orator well said of Carthage: [...] "She was a figure of brass with feet of clay"--a noble and imposing object to the eye, but whom a <b>vigourous</b> push would level in the dust. Rome, on the contrary, young and <b>vigourous,</b> was a people of warriors. Every one of her citizens who was capable of bearing arms was a soldier. The manly virtues were held in the highest esteem, and the sordid love of wealth had not as yet enfeebled her strength or sapped her powers. Her citizens were men, indeed, ready to make any sacrifice for their country; and such being the case, her final victory over Carthage {{was a matter of}} certainty.|$|E

60|$|In {{the early}} spring the march commenced, the army {{following}} the coast line until it reached {{the mouth of the}} Ebro. The mountainous and broken country lying between this river and the Pyrenees, and now known as Catalonia, was inhabited by fierce tribes unconquered as yet by Roman or Carthaginian. Its conquest presented enormous difficulties. There was no coherence between its people; but each valley and mountain was a stronghold to be defended desperately until the last. The inhabitants, accustomed to the mountains, were hardy, active, and, <b>vigourous,</b> ready to oppose a desperate resistance so long as resistance was possible, and then to flee across their hills at a speed which defied the fleetest of their pursuers.|$|E

They would have attached to Carthage the but half subdued nations round her who now groaned under her yoke, ground down to the dust by the enormous tribute necessitated by the extravagance of the administration of the state, the corruption and wholesale peculation of its officials.|$|E
60|$|At this momentous crisis, Miss Cheggs proved {{herself a}} <b>vigourous</b> and useful ally, for not {{confining}} herself to expressing by scornful smiles a contempt for Mr Swiveller's accomplishments, she took every opportunity of whispering into Miss Sophy's ear expressions of condolence and sympathy on her being worried {{by such a}} ridiculous creature, declaring that she was frightened to death lest Alick should fall upon, and beat him, in the fulness of his wrath, and entreating Miss Sophy to observe how {{the eyes of the}} said Alick gleamed with love and fury; passions, it may be observed, which being too much for his eyes rushed into his nose also, and suffused it with a crimson glow.|$|E

Then the most <b>vigourous</b> efforts were made to get together their forces, but it was too late.

The time will doubtless come--that is, unless we cut her course short--that as Rome increases in wealth and in luxury she will suffer from the like evils that are destroying Carthage. Party exigencies will rise above patriotic considerations, and Rome will fall to pieces unless she finds some man strong and <b>vigourous</b> enough to grasp the whole power of the state, to silence the chattering of the politicians, and to rule her with a rod of iron.

He looked at her, {{for the first time since}} she had entered the house. A twinkling light showed itself furtively in his dreary gray eyes: he took a dusty old hand-screen from the sideboard, and made her a present of it! [...] "There," [...] he said with his dry humour, [...] "don't spoil your complexion before the kitchen fire." [...] The cook possessed a sanguine temperament, and a taste to be honoured and encouraged--the taste for reading novels. She put her own romantic construction on the extraordinary compliment which the doctor's jesting humour had paid to her. As he walked out, grimly smiling and thumping his big stick on the floor, a new idea illuminated her mind. Her master admired her; her master was no ordinary man--it might end in his marrying her.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid rocket motors {{usually have}} an aft-mixing chamber {{in order to}} improve {{combustion}} efficiency. The presence of a sudden expansion at the exit of the fuel port determines the formation of vortices, whose <b>vigourous</b> burning may drive acoustic waves in the chamber. The shedding of vortices itself is then affected by the flow fluctuations, producing a well-known feedback loop. A reduced-order model, introduced by Matveev and Culick in 2003, is here used to analyze this phenomenon. It is assumed that vortex burning is localized in space and time, and a kicked oscillator model is utilized. A one-dimensional model proposed by the authors is used to determine the values of the eingenacoustic modes and corresponding damping coefficients.

40|$|The {{realisation}} {{that the}} electroweak anomaly can induce significant baryon number violation at high temperature {{and that the}} standard models of particle physics and cosmology contain all the ingredients needed for baryogenesis has led to <b>vigourous</b> search for viable models. The conclusions so far are that the Standard Model of particle physics cannot produce baryon asymmetry of required magnitude. It has too little $CP$ violation and sphaleronic transitions wipe out any asymmetry produced if the Higgs is heavier than about 50 GeV, a range already excluded by accelerator experiments. We review the sphaleron solution, its connection to the high temperature anomalous rate and then summarise possibilities where phenomenologically testable extensions of the Standard Model may yet explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.

Much of the theoretical work in the literature has focused, for ex-ample, on geometric and structural properties of the unlabeled data in the context of particular algorithms, rather than probabilistic and statistical questions. This paper overviews the fun-damental statistical foundations for predictive modelling and the general questions associated with unlabelled data, highlighting the relevance of venerable concepts of sampling design and prior specification.

40|$|The {{industry}} of ergogenic supplements is increasing rapidly (Cole et al., 2003). Supplements may constitute an important aid for some <b>vigourous</b> exercise routines, {{but they may}} also be used as a hypothetical mean to achieve increases in muscular mass. This supposed effect of suplements can lead to its use by individuals who have high levels of drive for muscularity, a condition that is known to be associated with muscular dismorphy (or as it has been called recently vigorexia, Pope et al., 1997). Another psychological factor which can influence supplement consumption is exercise dependence, a borderline problem, as most studies present a prevalence of less than 10 % in regular exercisers (Palmeira & Matos, 2006). Symptoms like tolerance or continuity could lead to the use of ergogenic aids to maintain the exercise levels. Also of interest for the understanding of the use of suplements are exercise frequency, volume and intensity, which could explain the ratesof consumption on a more physicological level...|$|E

The authors have undertaken <b>vigourous</b> research and consulted little-known medical works of the period 1780 - 1830 (including a number by Shelley's own doctors), and have interwoven their examination {{with a description of}} early nineteenth-century attitudes towards venereal disease (which parallel in some respects present-day fears raised by the threat of AIDS). The book is not, however, simply an investigation of a biographical mystery. The authors' cardinal aim is to reveal the importance of the meaning of disease and healing in Shelley's poetry. They document through specific and concrete textual analysis {{the extent to which the}} image of venereal plague functions for Shelley as a metaphor of evil, and they show how his schoolboy fascination with the panacea and his fugitive ambition to be a doctor were transmitted into a passionate belief in the power of poetry to act as society's medicine...|$|E

After <b>vigourous</b> fluid resuscitation with iv fluids and treatment with anti-hystamine drugs, corticosteroids, beta-blockers and calcium-channell blockers she progressively recovered.

A sample of the consumed fish could be analysed, finding a very high level of hystamine concentration, conferming the diagnosis of sgombroid syndrome. A coronary angiography was performed and confermed the patient had a normal coronary tree, devoid of atherosclerotic lesions.
