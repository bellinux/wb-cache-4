40|$|Grape vine {{has been}} {{associated}} with the development of human society since ancient times. It was planted by humans near their dwellings as far as thousand years ago. The grape vine has since undergone many transformations and became worldwide spread and major agricultural produce which is grown for wine production, table grapes and decoration purposes. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to gather and summarise available knowledge about the use of botanical species of common grape vine and its hybrids in breeding and gardening practice. The works of czech authors as well as publications of foreign authors were investigated. It bacame apparent from the published works that <b>vine</b> <b>breeding</b> for resistance is a never ending process the aim of which is to select individual plants either resistant to pathogens or those with sufficient hardiness against them. Another difficult task of botanists and <b>vine</b> <b>breeding</b> experts is naming the individual species of grape vine. Countless species were discovered throughout the history however the number of names of species has exceeded the actual number of species multiple times. Nowadays, modern genetic anlyses are being used for species identification which significantly lessens the task of identifying the species. These analyses employ microsatelite markers which are the most commonly used DNA markers today. These analyses were developed over the past 10 - 15 years...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for pheasant population number decline in past several years might be loss of adaptability in populations originated from <b>breeding</b> <b>stations</b> caused by inbreeding depression. Due to fact that adaptability {{is a consequence of}} genetic structure of the populations, the aim of this paper was the analysis of genetic variability in pheasant population from <b>breeding</b> <b>station</b> Ristovaca using molecular markers. Allozyme variability of 20 putative gene loci was detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polymorphism was revealed in 5 loci: Est- 1, Pgd, Sod, Gpi- 2 and Odh. The values of genetic variability measures - heterozigosity polymorphism, fixation indices and H/P ratio indicate low level of genetic variability and possible presence of inbreeding depression within pheasant population...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 423 blood samples were {{collected}} (during 2009 and 2010) from all the ram holdings at three major Jordanian governmental Awassi <b>breeding</b> <b>stations</b> (Al-Khanasry, Al-Mushairfa and Al-Fjaje) and two private flocks. All blood samples were screened {{for the presence of}} mutations at the CNGA 3 gene (responsible for day blindness in Awassi sheep) using RFLP-PCR. The day blindness mutation was detected in all studied flocks. The overall allele and genotype frequencies of all studied flocks of the day blindness mutation were 0. 088 and 17. 49 %, respectively. The genotype and allele frequencies were higher in station flocks than the farmer flocks (0. 121, 24. 15 and 0. 012, 2. 32, respectively). Al-Mushairfa and Al-Khanasry stations have the highest genotype and allele frequencies for the day blindness mutation that were 27. 77, 30. 00 % and 0. 14, 0. 171, respectively. The investigated farmer flocks have low percentages (0. 03, 5. 88 % at Al-Shoubak and 0. 005 and 1. 05 %, at Al-Karak, respectively for genotype and allele frequencies) compared with the <b>breeding</b> <b>stations.</b> Ram culling strategy was applied throughout the genotyping period in order to gradually eradicate this newly identified day blindness mutation from Jordanian <b>Breeding</b> <b>station,</b> since they annually distribute a high percentage of improved rams to farmer’s flocks...|$|R
