From the photographic {{documentation of the}} Polish committee, {{it appears that the}} origin of components of the Smolensk North lighting system was unknown. This was not the Luch-2MU system as the Russians stated. The report from the inspection flight performed on 15 April 2010 stated that the approach lamps, depending on their location and on the altitude of an inbound aircraft, can be shaded by surrounding trees and shrubs when aircraft is at distance of 400, 700, and 800 m from the runway 26. The lamps of first group (900 m) had their lights filters shattered and, of three bulbs installed, one was serviceable.|$|E

The T-39D aircraft was subsequently introduced into the Basic Naval Aviation Observer (NAO), later Student Naval Flight Officer (SNFO) program. [...] Three versions of the T-39D were used throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s: one without radar for high altitude instrument navigation training and low altitude <b>visual</b> <b>navigation</b> training in the SNFO Intermediate syllabus, a second variant equipped with the APQ-126 radar from the LTV A-7 Corsair II for training primarily bombardier/navigators, reconnaissance attack navigators and electronic countermeasures officers in attack aircraft, and a third variant with the APQ-94 radar from the Vought F-8 Crusader for training radar intercept officers in fighter aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The XB-47 was {{designed}} to carry a crew of three in a pressurized forward compartment: a pilot and copilot, in tandem, in a long fighter-style bubble canopy, and a navigator/bombardier in a compartment in the nose. The copilot doubled as tail gunner (using a remotely controlled, radar-directed tail gun), and the navigator as bombardier. The bubble canopy could pitch up and slide backward, but as the cockpit was high off the ground, crew entrance was through a door and ladder {{on the underside of}} the nose. The extreme front of the nose was initially glazed to allow <b>visual</b> <b>navigation</b> and bomb sighting, but this was quickly and increasingly faired over with metal. Almost all production versions had a solid metal nose with no windows. A K-series bombsight provided integrated radar navigation and <b>visual</b> <b>navigation,</b> with the optical portion extending through the nose of the aircraft in a small dome.|$|E
