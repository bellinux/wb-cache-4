5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical <b>viewfinder</b> of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical <b>viewfinder</b> is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic <b>viewfinder</b> is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with a reflex <b>viewfinder</b> led to the {{introduction}} of the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera <b>viewfinder)</b> is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E

50|$|Some {{special purpose}} cameras {{do not have}} <b>viewfinders</b> at all. These are, for example, web cameras and video {{surveillance}} cameras. They use external monitors as their <b>viewfinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Simple {{reflecting}} <b>viewfinders</b> comprised a small forward-looking lens, a small mirror at 45° behind it, and a lens at the top; {{the user}} held the camera at waist level {{and looked down}} into the lens, where a small image could be seen. Such <b>viewfinders</b> were integrated into box cameras, and fitted to the side of folding cameras. These <b>viewfinders</b> were fitted to inexpensive cameras.|$|R
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and <b>viewfinder</b> protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
25|$|On August 25, 1981 Sony {{unveiled}} {{a prototype of}} the Sony Mavica. This camera was an analog electronic camera that featured interchangeable lenses and a SLR <b>viewfinder.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the <b>viewfinder</b> and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic <b>viewfinder</b> as opposed to an optical <b>viewfinder,</b> which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the <b>viewfinder,</b> and handles bright situations well.|$|E
50|$|While waist-level <b>viewfinders</b> {{have been}} common in box cameras since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, large <b>viewfinders</b> of the sort that are suitable for ttv photography became popular in the late 1920s and 1930s with medium format TLR and pseudo TLR cameras such as the Rolleiflex and the Voigtländer Brillant. Similar large, clear square <b>viewfinders</b> were popular in TLRs and pseudo TLRs until the mid-1960s. These medium format cameras became less popular with the advent of 35mm SLRs and compact cameras in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} Riga-made Minox had a brass chassis {{covered in}} a stainless steel shell, which telescopes to reveal or cover the lens and <b>viewfinder</b> windows, {{as well as to}} advance the film. It was equipped with a parallax correcting <b>viewfinder,</b> which was coupled to a Cooke triplet type Minostigmat 15mm f/3.5 lens. The lens was capable of focusing as close as 20cm, and, due to its small image size, provided such depth of field at full aperture that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary. The maximum focus zone was about one meter to infinity. In front of the lens was a metal foil curtain shutter, which was itself protected by a window. These were advanced features at the time for any camera, regardless of size.|$|E
25|$|Early DSLRs {{lacked the}} ability to show the optical viewfinder's image on the LCD display – a feature known as live preview. Live preview is useful in {{situations}} where the camera's eye-level <b>viewfinder</b> cannot be used, such as underwater photography where the camera is enclosed in a plastic waterproof case.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} years of {{production}} (until the Zenit-E of 1967) Zenit camera development coincided with that of the Zorki cameras. The Zenit-S had PC-synchro for external flash units (almost like the Zorki-S) and the Zenit-3M also had an RF-sibling, the Zorki-6. For an SLR, the Pentaprism of all classical Zenits was undersize, with the <b>viewfinder</b> showing about two-thirds of the actual frame-size.|$|E
25|$|Like SLRs DSLRs {{typically}} use {{interchangeable lenses}} (1) with a proprietary lens mount. A movable mechanical mirror system (2) is switched down (exact 45-degree angle) to direct {{light from the}} lens over a matte focusing screen (5) via a condenser lens (6) and a pentaprism/pentamirror (7) to an optical <b>viewfinder</b> eyepiece (8). Most of the entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism.|$|E

He showcased this belief by having nearly all his photographs printed only at full-frame and completely free of any cropping or other darkroom manipulation. He insisted that his prints were not cropped as they include the first few millimeters of the unexposed negative around the image area, resulting in a black frame around the developed picture.|$|E

25|$|In 1974 Minox {{introduced}} a very compact (100mm × 61mm × 31mm), glass fibre reinforced Makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by Professor Fischer of Vienna University: the Minox EL, {{the first one}} in Minox 35mm series. These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned <b>viewfinder,</b> two stroke film winder lever and a film rewind knob. The Minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film.|$|E
25|$|The reflex design {{scheme is}} the primary {{difference}} between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design scheme, the image captured on the camera's sensor is also the image that is seen through the view finder. Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that light through the view finder – hence the name Single Lens Reflex. While there are variations among point-and-shoot cameras, the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens, allowing the camera's screen {{to be used as}} an electronic <b>viewfinder.</b> However, LCDs can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight.|$|E
25|$|For a long time, DSLRs offered {{faster and}} more {{responsive}} performance, with less shutter lag, faster autofocus systems, and higher frame rates. Around 2016-17, specific mirrorless camera models started offering competitive or superior specifications in these aspects. The downside of these cameras being {{that they do not}} have an optical <b>viewfinder,</b> making it difficult to focus on moving subjects or in situations where a fast burst mode would be beneficial. Other digital cameras were once significantly slower in image capture (time measured from pressing the shutter release to the writing of the digital image to the storage medium) than DSLR cameras, but this situation is changing with the introduction of faster capture memory cards and faster in-camera processing chips. Still, compact digital cameras are not suited for action, wildlife, sports and other photography requiring a high burst rate (frames per second).|$|E

25|$|According to the {{majority}} of commentators, Hitchcock's films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the <b>viewfinder,</b> since he did not need to, though in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternate takes to consider. However, this view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by the book Hitchcock at Work, written by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of Cahiers du cinéma. Krohn, after investigating several script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock alongside inspection of storyboards, and other production material, has observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. A great example would be the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of North by Northwest which was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.|$|E
500|$|Thunderbirds Are Go is {{also the}} first film to have been shot with the [...] "Livingston Electronic <b>Viewfinder</b> Unit". Also known as [...] "Add-a-Vision", this system {{consisted}} of a <b>viewfinder,</b> connected to video monitors, {{that was used to}} capture an image directly from the shooting camera. This enabled production personnel to inspect filmed footage on the set with a higher definition than had been possible with a more basic system used for AP Films television series. Add-a-Vision also benefited the puppeteers, who were stationed several metres above the set on gantries and had until this point not been permitted a useful view of the marionette movements below them. Based on German video assist devices, Add-A-Vision was developed by John Read, director of photography for Thunderbirds, in collaboration with Prowest Electronics, and also incorporated a form of playback function to aid staff while viewing rushes.|$|E
