Napoleon allegedly chose Nansouty for his elegant manners and education, aristocratic posture and talent for administration. In his capacity as First Squire, Nansouty thus had to accompany the Emperor during the latter's short campaign in Spain (from November 1808 to early January 1809). There, {{he was in charge}} of several administrative tasks linked with managing the Emperor's stable services and suite and commanding his orderly officers. The Emperor's aides-de-camp had their own aides-de-camp, who were also placed under the command of the First Squire. Although never <b>very</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the Emperor in a campaign that included many battles, Nansouty himself never exercised a field command during this campaign, and in January 1809, he accompanied his master back to France, as the outbreak of the War of the Fifth Coalition was imminent.|$|E

It was an impressive debut by anyone's standards. Sheene had worked his way up to second place and threatening the leader, Mike Lewis, when the bike seized and spat its rider off over the handlebars. A rostrum position in the day's 250cc race was a great achievement, but an even better wasn’t <b>very</b> <b>far</b> <b>away.</b> Just one week later, and again at Brands, Sheene took his first race win, and he did it is style by an incredible 12 seconds.

The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, {{was assumed to be}} an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon): ...|$|E

500|$|In 1936, Gill and Monotype {{released}} an extremely bold sans-serif named Gill Kayo (from KO, or knockout, implying its solidity). This {{has often been}} branded as Gill Sans Ultra Bold, though in practice many letters vary considerably from Gill Sans. It is available in regular and condensed widths. Gill, who thought of the design {{as something of a}} novelty, considered naming it [...] "Double Elefans". Harling reviewed it as [...] "dismal" [...] and sarcastically commented that [...] "typographical historians of 2000AD (which isn't, after all, so <b>very</b> <b>far</b> <b>away)</b> will find this odd outburst in Mr Gill's career, and will spend much time in attempting to track down this sad psychological state of his during 1936." [...] Forty years later he described it as [...] "the most horrendous and blackguardly of these display exploitations". Some initial drawings of Kayo may have been prepared by Gill's son-in-law Denis Tegetmeier; it made a return to popularity in the graphic design of the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
500|$|The season {{confirms}} that the blue alien seen in the first season, and a recurring plot point this season, {{was a member of}} the Kree race, who play a significant role in Guardians of the Galaxy.

When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going." [...] When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to Guardians of the Galaxy, Whedon said [...] "It is a <b>very</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too."

500|$|In 1781, the {{astronomer}} William Herschel was searching {{the sky for}} elusive stellar parallaxes, when he observed what he termed a comet in the constellation of Taurus. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased {{in proportion to the}} power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope. However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his [...] "comet", his colleague, British Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, wrote to him, saying, [...] "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it." [...] The [...] "comet" [...] was also <b>very</b> <b>far</b> <b>away,</b> too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named Uranus after the father of Saturn.|$|E

40|$|The pseudo-spectra (or {{spectral}} instability) of non-selfadjoint operators is a {{topic of}} current interest in applied mathematics. For example, in computational fluid dynamics it affects {{the study of the}} stability of laminar flows. In fact, even for the most basic flows, the computations entirely fails to predict what is observed in the experiments. The explanation is that for non-normal operators the resolvent could be <b>very</b> large <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the spectrum, which makes computation of the eigenvalues impossible. The occurence of ``false eigenvalues'' is due to the existence of quasi-modes, i. e., approximate local solutions to the eigenvalue problem. The quasi-modes appear since the Nirenberg-Treves condition (Psi) is not satisfied for topological reasons...|$|R

He also revealed that on three occasions during the race, he believed that the possibility of him securing the victory had ended. Vergne, who finished in second, had mixed emotions, feeling that the victory was in his grasp but was happy that he secured a place on the podium and was in contention for the championship: [...] "We started <b>very</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> but I know I’m in the right team with the right car to win the championship. I think we’re coming back a little bit better and we’re getting stronger every race as a team." [...] Third-place finisher Bird said that it was [...] "a good race" [...] for everyone who watched the event on television and the sport. He felt the action observed in the race was positive for the series. Bird also said he was happy with the passing manoeuvre he performed on d'Ambrosio and reserved praise for his team.|$|E

"Back to December"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Yoann Lemoine, who directed the video for Katy Perry's [...] "Teenage Dream", and was filmed in late December 2010 before Christmas Day. In an interview with Country Music Television, Lemoine explained that he developed {{the idea for the}} video after being inspired from the film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. He also told MTV News that he wanted the video to be simple yet metaphorical. He added, [...] "I wanted to work on the coldness of feelings in a very visual way, playing with the snow, the distance and sadness." [...] He wanted to focus on Swift's look in the video so that she would come off as accessible, saying [...] "I wanted her to perform a very natural way, to make her look very European. This was the main challenge to me. All of Taylor's world is <b>very</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from my culture, but I saw something in her that could be very rough and heartbreaking; far from the princess glittery outfits and glam that she often goes for." [...] Lemoine was allowed {{to take control of the}} whole production of the video, although it was Swift's idea to have her character leave the letter for her beloved. Swift's love interest in the video was played by male model, Guntars Asmanis. Lemoine commented that Asmanis was the perfect fit for Swift's love interest, saying [...] "I wanted a boy that was fragile and beautiful. I didn't want to go for a hunk or a perfect cheesy boy that would have killed the sincerity of the video." [...] The music video premiered on January 13, 2011, on CMT and Great American Country. Footages of the school and baseball stadium in the video were filmed in Binghamton, New York, in MacArthur Park while scenes with Swift were shot in an old country mansion outside of Nashville.|$|E
