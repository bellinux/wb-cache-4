40|$|In wood industry, {{decorative}} <b>veneer</b> is {{a product}} of high added value. Although the technological process of sliced <b>veneer</b> is well known, its quality and price depend on many technological parameters of production, particularly on the quality of logs. The research, which was focused on the influence of visual defects of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) logs and the impact of climatic conditions in the drying phase of sliced <b>veneer</b> on the surface <b>veneer</b> waviness, was conducted in an industrial environment. The results indicate that the largest share of waved <b>veneer</b> was cut from cracked logs (71 %) and less from curved logs (20 %). The <b>veneer</b> was sorted manually by experienced controllers from this branch of industry. Their subjective criteria can affect the accuracy of classification of <b>veneer</b> and, consequently, the research results. Therefore, the possibility of using 3 D camera for measuring <b>veneer</b> waviness and grading the <b>veneer</b> into quality classes was examined...|$|R
50|$|One-and-½ inches {{became the}} common {{thickness}} of stone <b>veneer</b> in the 1930s. Panels of stone <b>veneer</b> were generally installed via mortar techniques, with steel rods drilled into {{the edges of}} panels providing support. The utilization of thin stone <b>veneer</b> for complete facades of buildings popped up in the 1940s. Stone <b>veneer</b> construction became {{much of what we}} see today in the 1950s. Transportation improved, so stone <b>veneer</b> was transported more efficiently and at lower costs than ever before. Methods to attach <b>veneer</b> to steel were developed; diamond-bladed tools became popular for developing thin stone <b>veneer,</b> while elastomeric sealant began to replace mortar techniques in the construction process. Thin stone <b>veneer</b> in the 1960s became more of a standardized look - in fact, standard education on stone <b>veneer</b> became available in The Marble Engineering Handbook and Marble-Faced Precast Panels, which were published by the Marble Institute of America and National Association of Marble Producers.|$|R

5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative <b>veneers.</b> The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles {{can be made from}} straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, <b>veneers,</b> parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face <b>veneers</b> {{of a higher}} grade than the core <b>veneers.</b> The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E
25|$|Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most {{commonly}} manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch <b>veneers</b> that are bonded {{together in a}} hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch <b>veneers</b> throughout.

Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured {{to a number of}} specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies and meets specifications.|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in the {{manufacture}} of three-dimensional laminated <b>veneer</b> products (LVP) is damage due to stretching and/or buckling of the <b>veneer.</b> To reduce or eliminate this problem, <b>veneer</b> densification or adding a strengthening layer to the <b>veneer</b> can be an alternative. To study how <b>veneer</b> modification influences the veneer-to-adhesive bond strength, three methods of modification were studied in relation to an unmodified reference veneer: (1) densified <b>veneer,</b> (2) <b>veneer</b> pre-bonded with paper and hot melt adhesive (HMA), (3) <b>veneer</b> pre-bonded with non-woven polypropylene (NW) fabric glued to the <b>veneer</b> (a) with a urea formaldehyde (UF) adhesive, (b) with a mixture of UF and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesive, and (c) with a PVAc adhesive. Densification, pre-bonding with paper, and NW with UF/PVAc adhesive mixture resulted in no or only a slight decrease in strength of the bond-line compared to the reference. NW glued with UF or PVAc adhesive showed a considerable reduction in the strength of the bond-line. The climatic cycling had no significant influence on the bond strength.

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Historically brick <b>veneer</b> {{houses have}} not {{performed}} well in earthquakes. However, modern construction using better brick-ties, which are screwed to studs {{and the use}} of bricks with internal holes allowing some mortar mechanical interlock, is expected to result in a better performance. BRANZ cyclically racked two large brick <b>veneer</b> rooms (including ceilings) using a system which allowed the total load carried by the brick <b>veneer</b> to be measured directly. One room incorporated windows and had a door opening, while the other had fully separated brick <b>veneer</b> elements. Brick <b>veneer</b> cracking patterns were identified and rationalised. It was determined that in-plane brick <b>veneer</b> slip was significantly resisted by perpendicular walls and the mortar in brick <b>veneer</b> holes acted as dowels which resisted slip along horizontal mortar cracks. Elemental tests were used to measured brick <b>veneer</b> tension bond and slip strengths and the in-plane brick-tie load versus deflection relationship. These were used to determine the theoretical <b>veneer</b> lateral load resisting strength and a model was calibrated by comparing with the measured room strengths. A new design philosophy is proposed. ...|$|R

50|$|In woodworking, <b>veneer</b> {{refers to}} {{thin slices of}} wood, usually thinner than 3 mm (1/8 inch), that {{typically}} are glued onto core panels (typically, wood, particle board or medium-density fiberboard) to produce flat panels such as doors, tops and panels for cabinets, parquet floors and parts of furniture. They are also used in marquetry. Plywood consists of three or more layers of <b>veneer,</b> each glued with its grain {{at right angles to}} adjacent layers for strength. <b>Veneer</b> beading is a thin layer of decorative edging placed around objects, such as jewelry boxes. <b>Veneer</b> is also used to replace decorative papers in Wood <b>Veneer</b> HPL. <b>Veneer</b> is also a type of manufactured board.|$|R
30|$|Zephyr strand board (ZSB) and zephyr strand lumber (ZSL) were {{produced}} using zephyr made from poplar <b>veneer</b> {{to investigate the}} greater utilization of low-density poplar as a structural material.

40|$|This is {{the second}} part of a large {{research}} initiative aimed at characterizing Changbai larch (Larix olgensis Henry) for <b>veneer</b> and high-valued product potential. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of the tree growth characteristics, particularly diameter at breast height (DBH) and radial growth from pith (or peeler core) to bark on clear wood and <b>veneer</b> properties. A population of 36 trees was chosen and classified into three DBH classes, namely 20, 25, and 30 cm, and crosscut into six segments each along the vertical stem. With the entire <b>veneer</b> ribbon peeled from the pith to bark for each segment, the effect of sapwood and heartwood on wood properties was revealed. The tree DBH and height were moderately and positively correlated. The tree DBH significantly affected properties of both clear wood and <b>veneer</b> in a similar pattern. For the larch <b>veneer</b> population, <b>veneer</b> mean ultrasonic propagation time (UPT) and density decreased but <b>veneer</b> mean dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) increased from the heartwood to sapwood or from the pith to bark. Among the three DBH classes, the 25 cm DBH yielded the highest mean <b>veneer</b> density and MOE, followed by the 20 cm DBH and 30 cm DBH. This was found to be caused by the radial evolution of <b>veneer</b> properties from the pith to bark in combination with the variation of <b>veneer</b> yield and stem position...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Non-destructive {{commercial}} ultrasonic grading provides laminated <b>veneer</b> lumber (LVL) manufacturers a {{means for}} sorting <b>veneer</b> based on average ultrasonic propagation time (UPT) and/or average dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEd). While this may provide reliable estimations of modulus of elasticity (MOE), {{little is known about}} the influence of <b>veneer</b> defects on strength properties of <b>veneer</b> and LVL. It was hypothesized that inclusion of <b>veneer</b> defect and growth ring pattern measures, obtained via optical scanning, would improve <b>veneer</b> and LVL static tensile MOE and strength (Ft) property predictions. Non-destructive and destructive testing on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) <b>veneer</b> and LVL was performed to evaluate improvements in <b>veneer</b> and LVL tensile MOE and Ft property predictions. Various models based solely on density, optical, and ultrasonic system measures, as well as various combinations of systems measures, were developed for individual <b>veneer</b> and LVL property predictions. 	The integration of optical and ultrasonic measures (i. e., combined system model) best explained the variation in <b>veneer</b> static tensile MOE and Ft. The combined system model best predicted average LVL static tensile MOE. LVL static Ft was best predicted by using overall average <b>veneer</b> measures comprising the entire LVL material, rather than the average of individually predicted <b>veneer</b> Ft used in assembling the LVL. Specifically, the combined system model, which included various specific average defect, growth ring pattern, and MOEd measures comprising the LVL material, best explained the variation in LVL static Ft values (R 2 = 0. 65) as compared to all other models. Results from this study suggest improved <b>veneer</b> and LVL Ft predictions can be achieved by integrating the existing ultrasonic and optical systems already existing in many manufacturing facilities. 	Additionally, the optical model which included average defect, growth ring, and density measurements within the LVL material better explained the variation in LVL static Ft values (R 2 = 0. 58), as compared to the MOEd (R 2 = 0. 52) and UPT (R 2 = 0. 31) models. As a result, the developed optical system showed promise as a suitable <b>veneer</b> grading system.
