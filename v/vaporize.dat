5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to <b>vaporize</b> atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to <b>vaporize</b> samples for analysis.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to <b>vaporize</b> methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately <b>vaporize</b> any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E

40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the experimental}} apparatus and the methods used {{in the investigation of}} the degree of fuel (kerosene) evaporation in two types of <b>vaporizing</b> elements in combustion chambers. The results are presented as dependences of the degree of fuel evaporation on the factors which characterize the functioning of the <b>vaporizing</b> elements: the air surplus coefficient, the velocity of flow and temperature of the air {{at the entrance to the}} <b>vaporizing</b> element and the temperature of the wall of the <b>vaporizing</b> element...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} <b>vaporized</b> {{hydrogen peroxide}} {{as an alternative}} to formaldehyde for space biodecontamination in a containment level 3 laboratory suite. The laboratory air pressure during the biodecontamination process was maintained at a slightly negative pressure. This was done as a preventive measure to ensure that hazardous <b>vaporized</b> hydrogen peroxide would not escape during the process. Parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, <b>vaporized</b> hydrogen peroxide concentration, and pressure within the laboratory suite were monitored during the biodecontamination. The success of the decontamination process was validated using spores of G. stearothermophilus, the most resistant microorganism to <b>vaporized</b> hydrogen peroxide (Kokubo et al., 1998; Meszaros, 2005; Rickloff & Orelski, 1989). This research demonstrates the usefulness of <b>vaporized</b> hydrogen peroxide as a space biodecontaminant...|$|R
5|$|In {{the outer}} Solar System, comets remain frozen and {{inactive}} and are extremely {{difficult or impossible}} to detect from Earth due to their small size. Statistical detections of inactive comet nuclei in the Kuiper belt have been reported from observations by the Hubble Space Telescope but these detections have been questioned. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to <b>vaporize</b> and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately <b>vaporize</b> itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It {{remains to be seen}} if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E
5|$|Hunters {{primarily}} {{attack the}} player by bracing themselves and firing bursts from their flechette cannon. Four flechettes can <b>vaporize</b> an ordinary human soldier. If {{they do not}} strike a living target, the flechette charge up for several seconds and then explode, dealing minor damage to everything nearby. Hunters may also conduct a charging attack or strike with their legs if the player gets too close. Hunters are vulnerable to all weapons, but to compensate, are still quite resilient, making explosives and the pulse rifle's charged energy ball the most attractive options. Objects thrown with the gravity gun are also effective, especially if the player catches some of their flechettes with the object before hurling it (one of the in-game Achievements). In outdoor environments, they can be run over with a vehicle.|$|E

50|$|The {{refrigerant}} liquid {{flows through}} the turboexpander where it is <b>vaporized</b> and the vapor undergoes an isentropic expansion which results in a low-temperature mixture of vapor and liquid. The vapor-liquid mixture is then routed through the evaporator where it is <b>vaporized</b> by heat absorbed from the space being cooled. The <b>vaporized</b> refrigerant flows to the compressor inlet to complete the cycle.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new simple method for {{measuring}} the <b>vaporized</b> volume and to evaluate the outcome of high-power potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) photoselective laser vaporization. A total of 65 patients, with a mean age of 67. 7 yr (range 53 to 85), were included in the primary analysis. The <b>vaporized</b> volume was calculated as the pre-operative volume minus the immediate postoperative volume plus the volume of the defect. For all patients, the subjective and objective parameters improved significantly after surgery. Six and 12 months after surgery, the group with a smaller <b>vaporized</b> volume (< 15 g) had a lower reduction of the mean International Prostate Symptom Score (P= 0. 006 and P= 0. 004) and quality of life index (P= 0. 006 and P= 0. 004) when compared to the group with a greater <b>vaporized</b> volume (≥ 15 g). There were no differences in the change of the maximum flow rate and post-void residual based on the <b>vaporized</b> volume. Our findings suggest that the subjective improvement, after a high-power KTP laser vaporization, may be dependent on the <b>vaporized</b> volume obtained after the procedure...|$|R
5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to <b>vaporize</b> the Earth's oceans, {{generating}} heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will <b>vaporize</b> in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
5|$|Thuan {{started an}} inquiry into the usage of {{chemical}} weapons on the protestors. The investigation exonerated the Diệm regime {{of the most serious}} allegations of using poison or mustard gas. Before the president was deposed in November, the inquiry's report declared that only tear gas was used, and that the liquid components of the grenades were poured onto the protestors after they had failed to <b>vaporize</b> as they were designed to. A further commission chaired by General Trần Văn Đôn prior to February 1964 concluded that the tear gas was left behind by French colonial forces in the 1950s. The tear gas used came in glass containers {{in the form of a}} liquid that was transformed into gaseous vapor upon activation by acid. The injuries were attributed to the acid failing to activate the liquid into gaseous form. United States Army chemists in Maryland confirmed that the tear gas had come from canisters dating back to French World War I stocks. During World War I, France had used tear gas containing a mixture of chloroacetone and ethyl bromoacetate against German troops at Ypres on the Western Front, which was known to strongly irritate mucous membranes.|$|E

5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to <b>vaporize</b> the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to <b>vaporize</b> Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

50|$|The liquid feed (at {{the bottom}} {{left in the}} diagram) is pumped up to the {{reaction}} pressure (5-45 atm) and is joined by a stream of hydrogen-rich recycle gas. The resulting liquid-gas mixture is preheated by flowing through a heat exchanger. The preheated feed mixture is then totally <b>vaporized</b> and heated to the reaction temperature (495-520 °C) before the <b>vaporized</b> reactants enter the first reactor. As the <b>vaporized</b> reactants flow through the fixed bed of catalyst in the reactor, the major reaction is the dehydrogenation of naphthenes to aromatics (as described earlier herein) which is highly endothermic and results in a large temperature decrease between the inlet and outlet of the reactor. To maintain the required reaction temperature {{and the rate of}} reaction, the <b>vaporized</b> stream is reheated in the second fired heater before it flows through the second reactor. The temperature again decreases across the second reactor and the <b>vaporized</b> stream must again be reheated in the third fired heater before it flows through the third reactor. As the <b>vaporized</b> stream proceeds through the three reactors, the reaction rates decrease and the reactors therefore become larger. At the same time, the amount of reheat required between the reactors becomes smaller. Usually, three reactors are all that is required to provide the desired performance of the catalytic reforming unit.|$|R

Utilizing ultra-high-speed optical imaging, the acoustic response of individual microbubbles to low-intensity diagnostic ultrasound was observed on clinically relevant time scales {{of hundreds of}} milliseconds after vaporization. It {{was found that the}} <b>vaporized</b> droplets oscillate non-linearly and exhibit a resonant bubble size shift and increased damping relative to uncoated gas bubbles due to the presence of coating material. Unlike the commercially available lipid-coated ultrasound contrast agents, which may exhibit compression-only behavior, <b>vaporized</b> droplets may exhibit expansion-dominated oscillations. It was further observed that the non-linearity of the acoustic response of the bubbles was comparable to that of SonoVue microbubbles.
