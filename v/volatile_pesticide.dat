40|$|LEACHP is a modular {{package for}} calculating the {{one-dimensional}} vertical water and solute flux in horizontally layered soils under transient conditions. Data from field {{studies conducted in}} a sandy soil (Vredepeel, The Netherlands) and in a loamy soil (Weiherbach, Germany) were used by five groups to simulate water flow and bromide and pesticide transport with the LEACHP model. Calibrated outputs were compared to the actual field values. Soil hydraulic properties derived from laboratory measurements performed best to predict soil moisture profiles of field soils. For small-scale lysimeters calibration was necessary to simulate drainage fluxes that were within {{the wide range of}} experimental values. These calibrated parameters failed to predict increased drainage volumes observed under additional irrigation. Measurement of all soil water balance terms would allow a more thorough evaluation of the hydraulic component of LEACHP. Bromide profiles were not well simulated on the sandy soil where considerable plant uptake was observed. Additionally, zones of immobile soil water might have been present. Residue profiles of the <b>volatile</b> <b>pesticide</b> ethoprophos in soil were best simulated by groups that accounted for volatilisation in their simulations. Different descriptions of the soil sorption process for the mobile pesticide bentazone between groups were dominated by different input of half-life values and hydraulic properties. Although bromide residue profiles were predicted reasonably well in the loamy soil, {{it was not possible to}} predict isoproturon dissipation during summer with degradation parameters calibrated in a winter simulation. Predictions of soil water content profiles and leaching volumes can be used with confidence especially after calibration given that preferential flow processes are not predominant. Although important input data for pesticide transformation and transport could be derived from extensive laboratory scale experiments, these did not represent all processes that could affect pesticide fate and behaviour under field conditions. Calibration did not significantly enhance the predictive capability of the solute transport simulations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel non-invasive sampling and analysis method {{that can be used to}} assess the presence of <b>volatile</b> <b>pesticides</b> on objects held in heritage collections. Vapour phase sampling was conducted using sampling tubes loaded with Tenax-TA™ and trapped analytes were determined using thermal desorption-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The results of this study are presented in a simple ‘decision tree’ diagram to provide the heritage sector with the best methods to identify the presence of pesticides in collections. To illustrate the use of the methodology developed, the results from two case studies in heritage institutions are presented. Results: Attempts were made to measure a range of pesticides, known to have been used in heritage collections, in the vapour phase including aldrin, camphor, chloronaphthalene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4, 4 ′-DDT), dichlorvos, dieldrin, endrin, a mixture of α-, β-, γ- and δ-hexachlorocyclohexane (hereafter referred to as HCH), naphthalene, and thymol.

In this case, liquid chromatographic analysis of swab samples from the mask yielded a positive identification of dichlorvos. Conclusions: The proposed non-invasive sampling methods require sampling of a volume of air around an object. To be detected the pesticide must possess suitable volatility. It was demonstrated that camphor, chloronaphthalene, naphthalene and thymol could be successfully trapped onto Tenax TA™ sorbent tubes and pseudo-quantitatively analysed using TD-GC-MS. Dichlorvos, HCH, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin were also trapped onto Tenax TA™ and qualitatively detected by TD-GC-MS. Although a key objective of the developed methods was non-invasive sampling, the low volatility of 4, 4 ′-DDT precluded it from vapour phase monitoring and hexane swabbing followed by HPLC analysis was required. </p...|$|R
40|$|Modelling is an {{economic}} way of assessing pesticide behaviour under field conditions; it is cheaper and faster than field experiments. Modelling attempts to generalize knowledge of pesticide field behaviour through identification {{of the most important}} pesticide/soil properties that can be measured in the laboratory. The technology to simulate volatilization of <b>volatile</b> <b>pesticides</b> that are incorporated or injected into the soil is well developed. However, modelling of volatilization rates from plant and soil surfaces before the first significant rainfall event after application is barely possible with current knowledge. The technology to simulate pesticide persistence in the plough layer is well developed; the PERSIST model has been tested at least 178 times, usually resulting in a slightly faster decline in the field than was simulated. In general, available pesticide leaching models are reliable enough to assess the leaching of the bulk of the dose (leaching levels above 1 %). The EU drinking water limit of 0. 1 μg L 1 implies leaching of less than 0. 1 % of a dose of 1 kg ha 1. At such a low leaching level, the validation status of the models is still low, mainly because preferential flow processes in both structured and unstructured soils and the factors controlling the transformation rate in subsoil are not well enough understood...|$|R

Gel permeation chromatography was used for sample pretreatment, viz. to separate the low-molecular-mass pesticides from the higher-molecular-mass fat constituents of the oil. A mixture of n-decane and the azeotropic mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane was found to give an adequate separation between the fat and the organophosphorus pesticides. The pesticide-containing fraction, monitored by a UV detector, was transferred on-line to the gas chromatograph using a loop-type interface. n-Decane (6 %, v/v) {{was added to the}} eluent in order to widen the application range of the transfer technique towards more <b>volatile</b> <b>pesticides.</b> After solvent evaporation through the solvent vapour exit and subsequent GC separation, the compounds were selectively detected with a thermionic or a flame photometric detector.

Organic artifact materials, such as wood, animal hide, basketry, textiles, paper, horn and bone, have traditionally been treated with pesticides to eradicate and prevent infestation by insects, rodents, and mold.

40|$|Groundwater {{contamination}} generically {{refers to}} modifications in biological, physical or chemical characteristics (e. g., salinity, temperature, etc.), {{the presence of}} undesirable solutes at significant concentrations, or radioactivity. It may be: (i) of natural origin, (ii) the result of human activity; or (iii) {{a combination of the}} previous two. Naturally occurring processes, such as decomposition of organic material in soils or leaching of mineral deposits, can result in increased concentrations of several substances such as manganese, sulphate, chloride, organic matter, fluoride, arsenic, nitrate, selenium, uranium, and radon. Sources of groundwater contamination due to human activities are widespread and include diffuse sources as well as point-sources of pollution, such as land application of animal manure containing contaminants (e. g., veterinary pharmaceuticals) and agrochemicals in agriculture, leakages from sewers or sanitation systems, from waste disposal sites, landfills, underground storage tanks and pipelines, and accidental spills in mining, industry, traffic, health care facilities and military sites. The exploitation of petroleum products and the development of the industrial chemistry have given rise to a large number of organic chemicals, many of which are found in the environment. Various studies have shown that anthropogenic chemicals such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, industrial chemicals, and fuel additives occur in groundwater. U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) investigations have assessed the occurrence, distribution, and benchmark exceedance of various contaminants in water from public-supply wells and domestic wells, including <b>pesticides,</b> <b>volatile</b> organic compounds, <b>pesticides</b> and nitrate. Chemical mixtures were frequently detected, often with concentrations of individual contaminants approaching human-health benchmarks. Chemical mixtures that most frequently occurred and had the greatest potential toxicity were composed of arsenic, strontium, uranium, radon, and nitrate. Many organic chemicals are known to have potential human health impacts, and some of these may occur in groundwater at relevant concentrations. The list of those for which guideline values and national quality standards have been developed has been continually extended and revised. Among these: mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes - BTEX), volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons (tetrachloroethene - PCE, trichloroethene - TCE), and pesticides.

The goal is to reduce labor costs and increase information content. This paper examines lotic system samplers, portable autonomous whole-water samplers, and autonomous submergible whole-water samplers.

40|$|Between May 1986 and January 1989, {{samples were}} taken on three {{occasions}} from the heavily polluted Scheldt estuary, {{in order to}} determine the pathways and fate of organic micropollutants. One group parameter (cholinesterase inhibition activity, CHOL) and 30 individual compounds (including chlorobenzenes, chloronitrobenzenes, <b>volatile</b> halocarbons and <b>pesticides)</b> were detected on at least one occasion. Another 10 organic pollutants were identified and quantified by GC/MS analysis. Many other, as yet unidentified, compounds were also present. The River Scheldt appeared to be the major source for most pollutants, although additional emissions along the estuary were also detected. Most pollutants were removed from the water during estuarine mixing (non-conservative behaviour), probably due to various processes, such as volatilization, degradation and photolysis. The fractional loss for most volatile halocarbons was ∼ 75 %, but in some cases 100 % (e. g., trichloromethane). The fractional loss for CHOL was seasonally dependent: 5 – 10 % in winter, and 35 – 40 % in summer months. For most compounds, reasonable agreement was found when observed sediment-water partition coefficients (K oc) were compared with predicted values. Pronounced deviations were observed, however, indicating non-equilibrium conditions, probably because of slow sorption kinetics. The concentrations measured in the inflowing freshwater were compared with recently published ecotoxicological freshwater quality objectives. The results show that some organic pollutants (e. g., hexachlorobenzene, CHOL, lindane, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane) exceeded the published ecotoxicological risk values in all samples, suggesting that these pollutants may have an impact on the ecosystem of the Scheldt estuary...|$|R

Study participants included 1, 642 residents, 18 - 64 years of age, who responded to a telephone survey concerning potential occupational and recreational exposures to pesticides and other chemicals, lifetime history of herpes zoster (shingles), and the recent occurrence of other common infectious diseases. Stratified and logistic regression analyses were used to compare the cumulative incidence of herpes zoster among Aberdeen residents and residents of nearby communities. There was little evidence of an overall increased risk of herpes zoster among Aberdeen residents during the period 1951 - 1994 [relative risk (RR), 1. 3; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 8 - 2. 1]. However, an elevated risk of herpes zoster was noted consistently among Aberdeen residents of younger ages as compared to residents of the nearby communities. The RR was 2. 0 (CI, 1. 0 - 4. 0) among those 18 - 40 years of age and was not affected by controlling for potential confounders. The RR of herpes zoster was also consistently elevated in all age groups for the period before 1985. No differences were noted between residents of Aberdeen and those of the nearby communities with respect to the recent occurrence of other common infectious diseases. These results support the plausibility of an association between exposure to the Aberdeen pesticides dumps site and immune suppression and the potential use of herpes zoster as a marker of immune suppression in studies of environmental chemical exposures...|$|R

In developed countries the most important indoor air pollutants are radon, asbestos, <b>volatile</b> organic compounds, <b>pesticides,</b> heavy metals, animal dander, mites, moulds and environmental tobacco smoke. However, in developing countries the most important indoor air pollutants are the combustion products of unprocessed solid biomass fuels used by the poor urban and rural folk for cooking and heating. Approximately half the world’s population and up to 90 % of rural households in developing countries still rely on unprocessed biomass fuels such as wood, dung and crop residues 2. A recent report of the World Health Organization (WHO) asserts the rule of 1000 which states that a pollutant released indoors is one thousand times more likely to reach people’s lung than a pollutant released outdoors 3. It has been estimated that about half a million women and children die each year from indoor air pollution in India 4. Compared to other countries, India has among the largest burden of disease due to the use of dirty household fuels and 28 % of all deaths due to indoor air pollution in developing countries occur in India 4. The type of fuels used by a household is determined maily by its economic status. In the energy ladder, biomass fuels namely animal dung, crop residues and wood, which are the dirtiest fuels, lie at the bottom and are used mostly by very poor people. Electricity, which is the most expensive, lies at the top of ladder and it is also the cleanest fuel. The 1991 National Census for the first time inquired about the fuel used for coking.

A novel {{experimental}} {{approach has}} been developed that permits to measure in the laboratory the atmospheric decay of low <b>volatile,</b> particle-bound compounds (<b>pesticides,</b> persistent organic pollutants (POP)) which react efficiently with OH-radicals in the atmosphere. The experimental approach makes use of trapped micro- and nanoparticles which are coated by monolayers of the low volatile compounds. Trapping is accomplished by storing the particles in an electrodynamic trap, which {{is surrounded by a}} controlled atmosphere. The temperature, pressure, humidity, and the chemical composition of the atmosphere can be adjusted to the atmospheric environment of interest. The particles can be exposed to reactive trace gases, such as OH radicals or ozone. The chemically induced changes of the adsorbates are time-resolved monitored by Raman spectroscopy. As a result, chemical processes, reaction products, as well as evaporation from the particle surface can be investigated. Alternatively, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can be used for the detection of such time resolved processes. The experiments allow us to derive kinetic data of particle-bound low volatile compounds. We have constructed and characterized all devices and components that are required for this novel experimental approach. This included a suitable particle trap, sources of OH radicals, and the efficient detection of time-resolved Raman spectra of stored particles. The components were commissioned by using simple, but realistic test systems. Raman spectra of particle-bound pesticides were measured and first kinetic experiments were performed. The setup is now ready to use for systems of environmental interest. (orig.)

40|$|Soil pollution, {{particularly}} by petroleum compounds {{is a very}} important global issue. It is typically a result of improper storage and disposal, historic careless spills, accidental spills, and leaks from tanks. This environmental damage can result in wide spread groundwater and surface water contamination, and limit soil use for agricultural purposes. There are a large number of brownfield sites across Canada. These are sites that have been previously used for industrial and commercial activities and have been contaminated with hazardous wastes. Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) in particular, has numerous sites due to a legacy of fuel oil use for power generation at abandoned, old and emerging mining fields. Data from the federal contaminated site inventory indicate that on federal owned sites in NL, there are over 3000 m³ of oil-contaminated soil. It has therefore become necessary to develop remediation technologies that are economically and technically feasible, environmentally friendly, fast, and applicable {{in a wide range of}} physical settings. A wide range of technologies have been developed over the past few decades for the remediation of contaminated sites. Some of these processes have been found to be successful in removing only a specific group of contaminants from the soil. As a result, combinations of different approaches are usually adopted for more effective remediation thereby leading to more expensive remedial operations. Surfactant-enhanced remediation technology, otherwise known as soil washing has proven to be an effective method to remove a mixture of contaminants such as heavy metals, petroleum compounds, <b>volatile</b> organic compounds, <b>pesticides</b> and herbicides as well as other hazardous and non-degradable substances from contaminated soils. Surfactant remediation relies on the ability of surfactant formulations to remove both organic and inorganic contaminants from soil and sediments by desorbing them from the solid to liquid phase. The technology removes contaminants via two mechanisms; one occurs below the Critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactants known as mobilization mechanism, and the other above the CMC known as solubilization mechanism. However, this technology has not been widely reported for the remediation of Bunker C fuel oil, a complex and recalcitrant petroleum compound that is persistent in the environment and extensively reported to be resistant to chemical and biological degradation, and therefore difficult to remediate. This research presents an assessment of the performance of soil washing technology for the remediation of Bunker C contaminated oil from weathered contaminated soil using patented surfactant formulations. Weathered soil are known to be more difficult to remediate than freshly contaminated soil hence, the study used weathered soil in order to be certain of the effects of soil washing on Bunker C removal. Specific research objectives include: (1) determining the micellar properties (Surface Tension and CMC) of the patented surfactants, (2) development of a reliable analytical method for the analysis of (heavy) petroleum hydrocarbons in soil, (3) evaluation of the parameters that govern the implementation of soil washing and an assessment of their effects on the washing of weathered Bunker C oil from contaminated soil at surfactants concentrations below the CMC (mobilization mechanism) using the multivariate experimental and statistical approach, (4) determination of the optimum conditions (optimization) for the removal of Bunker C oil with the tested surfactants. The research, in the course of analysing the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon in the soil using the Canada-Wide Standard (CWS) for Petroleum Hydrocarbon in soil is used for the analysis of petroleum hydrocarbon compounds found considerable variability and inconsistencies in the results. This could be due, in part, to the different gas chromatography (GC) conditions, soil properties, as well as and other steps involved in the method. These differences impacts the determination of the effectiveness of remediation at hydrocarbon-contaminated sites. The thesis therefore, developed validated the analytical method for the quantitative analysis of TPH in (contaminated) soil. The newly developed method was successfully applied for a faster and more reliable analysis of TPH of Bunker C oil in contaminated soil. It is expected that this research will lay a road map for further studies on the application, optimization and development of a treatment system protocol for the use of soil washing for Bunker C remediation. It should be noted that although Bunker C is the contaminant, the hydrocarbon composition of Bunker C makes it a good surrogate for other heavy oils...|$|R
