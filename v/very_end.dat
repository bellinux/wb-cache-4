5|$|All {{specimens}} of Majungasaurus {{have been recovered}} from the Maevarano Formation in the Mahajanga Province in northwestern Madagascar. Most of these, including all of the most complete material, came from the Anembalemba Member, although Majungasaurus teeth have also {{been found in the}} underlying Masorobe Member and the overlying Miadana Member. While these sediments have not been dated radiometrically, evidence from biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism suggest that they were deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, which lasted from 70 to 66 Ma (million years ago). Majungasaurus teeth are found up until the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the Maastrichtian, when all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, {{cities in}} the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation {{in the production of}} stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|Costa Gomes {{argued that}} African {{soldiers}} were cheaper and were {{better able to}} create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the 'hearts and minds' strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga {{on the eve of the}} Portuguese coup in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war.|$|E

5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either {{ends of the}} station hall and the two escalator tunnels.

Meanwhile, at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels {{at the end of the}} station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing {{to one of the}} two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several of his colleagues in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the <b>very</b> <b>end.</b> He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E

5|$|Much of our {{evidence}} for 4th century army unit deployments {{is contained in}} a single document, the Notitia Dignitatum, compiled c. 395–420, a manual of all late Roman public offices, military and civil. The main deficiency with the Notitia is that it lacks any personnel figures so as to render estimates of army size impossible. Also, it was compiled at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the 4th century; it is thus difficult to reconstruct the position earlier. However, the Notitia remains the central source on the late Army's structure due to the dearth of other evidence. The Notitia also suffers from significant lacunae and numerous errors accumulated from centuries of copying.|$|E
5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, where life in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the <b>very</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only at the <b>very</b> <b>end</b> of the film.|$|E
40|$|The paper proposes an {{extension}} of the symmetric Baxter-King band pass filter to an asymmetric Baxter-King filter. It turns out the optimal correction scheme of the ideal filter weights is the same as in the symmetric version, i. e, cut the ideal filter at the appropriate length and add a constant to all filter weights to ensure zero weight on zero frequency. Since the symmetric Baxter-King filter is unable to extract the band of frequencies at the <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> of the series, the extension to an asymmetric filter is useful whenever the real time estimation is needed. The paper assesses the filter’s properties in extracting business cycle frequencies, in comparison to the symmetric Baxter-King filter and symmetric and asymmetric Christiano-Fitzgerald filter, by using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the asymmetric Baxter-King filter is superior to the asymmetric Christiano-Fitzgerald filter for the whole sample space, including the <b>very</b> <b>ends</b> of a sample, thus indicating that the asymmetric Baxter-King filter should be preferred over the asymmetric Christiano-Fitzgerald filter in real time signal extraction exercises...|$|R
