40|$|This study explores how the {{leadership}} style affects the academic spin-off companies’ performance. We {{have studied the}} relative influence of vertical and shared leadership within new venture founders’ teams {{on the performance of}} spin-offs through a survey that has involved 30 spin-offs operating in five incubators located in the North East of Italy, partially reproducing an empirical research done by Ensley, Hmieleski and Pearce (2006) on American start-ups. We assume that the type of leadership has a direct influence on performance for spinoff firms given the lack of organizational structure, hierarchy and a consolidated network of relationships (Ensley et al., 2003; Ucbasaran et al., 2003). We propose a model that delineates a matrix of leadership styles between vertical leadership and shared leadership, enriched with the contributions of Likert (1961), Tannenbaum and Schmidt (1973) and Goleman (1998). Our results show that academic spin-off founders’ teams often haven’t formal leadership structures and <b>vertical</b> <b>directive</b> leadership that exercises strict control on knowledge workers could undermining economic performance of the firm, while the relation between shared leadership and performance in the context of academic spinoff deserves a more in-depth analysis...|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{designated}} TCAS II Enhanced, TCAS III was envisioned as {{an expansion}} of the TCAS II concept to include horizontal resolution advisory capability. TCAS III was the [...] "next generation" [...] of collision avoidance technology which underwent development by aviation companies such as Honeywell. TCAS III incorporated technical upgrades to the TCAS II system, and had the capability to offer traffic advisories and resolve traffic conflicts using horizontal as well as <b>vertical</b> manouevring <b>directives</b> to pilots. For instance, in a head-on situation, one aircraft might be directed, [...] "turn right, climb" [...] while the other would be directed [...] "turn right, descend." [...] This would act to further increase the total separation between aircraft, in both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> aspects. Horizontal <b>directives</b> would be useful in a conflict between two aircraft close to the ground where there may be little if any vertical maneuvering space.|$|R
