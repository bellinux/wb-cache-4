40|$|Abstract: An orifice is {{an opening}} {{provided}} in the vertical wall or horizontal bottom of a vessel or tank or a channel so that the fluid can discharge freely under atmospheric conditions. In the present investigations, flow through the stepped <b>vertical</b> <b>orifice</b> is experimentally determined and its analysis is carried out. The flow through the different orifices working under different relative heads (with overall head being maintained constant) is analysed and the discharge coefficient for the stepped orifice is determined. The relevance of the present research carried out with respect to inclined weir, researched by the authors is highlighted. The importance {{of this type of}} Non-coplanar vertical Rectangular slots wherein the relative orifices do not share the same plane is emphasized. The discharge coefficient for the Non-coplanar vertical Rectangular slots is found to vary within an acceptable percentage deviation from the mean coefficient of discharge. The experimental head-discharge plot also indicates the validity of the research work with most of the experimental values falling on the proposed equation for the flow through the Non-coplanar vertical Rectangular slots. ____________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of migrating adult salmonids to various placements of rectangular fishway orifices was {{studied at the}} Fisheries-Engineering Research Laboratory, on the Washington end of Bonneville Dam. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri), and coho salmon (O. kisutch) approaching a vertical wall had the the alternatives of entering rectangular orifices positioned either horizontally or vertically and either shallow (3 feet) or deep (9 feet). The responses of the three species to the various orifice conditions are analyzed. More migrants passed through shallow orifices than deep orifices, and more salmonids entered <b>vertical</b> <b>orifices</b> than horizontal orifices...|$|R
40|$|Bubble {{formation}} at variously inclined submerged nozzles, {{fed with}} a continuous gas flow rate, is investigated. The average liquid velocity induced by bubble motion is determined, {{leading to a}} simple correlation for estimation of the liquid velocities induced by the repeated passage of bubbles. An effective model for the prediction of bubble sizes at their detachment from <b>vertical</b> nozzle <b>orifices</b> is presented which encompasses a bound expansion stage, followed by an accelerated expansion phase, and ends by an original bubble detachment criterion. The existence of a liquid-phase effective entrainment velocity, generated by the continuous passage of the bubble stream, is quantified and included in the model. Model predictions are found to correlate well with experimental and literature data...|$|R
30|$|According to the {{experimental}} data of the orifice discharge coefficient for the flow through a <b>vertical</b> sharp-edged <b>orifice</b> obtained in the previous study of this work, a theoretical criterion for flow mechanisms of small orifice (viz. thick-walled orifice and nozzle) and large orifice (viz. thin-walled orifice) was proposed based on the ratio of orifice diameter to plate thickness. It can help explain the dissipation of the mechanical energy loss in the flow process for the two flow mechanisms under different operating regimes. The main parameters such as orifice diameter, plate thickness and liquid head were correlated, and a semi-empirical model for orifice coefficient and an empirical model with high precision at the stable region were developed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} novel experiments testing the relative efficiencies in passing juvenile salmon �parr � through a range of model fish passes incorporating devices such as <b>vertical</b> slots, <b>orifices,</b> weirs, and combinations of all three. The hydraulic parameters—head loss, velocity patterns, and turbulence structure—were measured under each set of test conditions. A significantly higher proportion of fish moved through submerged <b>orifices</b> and <b>vertical</b> slots than through overflow weirs for any given flow rate, velocity, and head loss. The <b>orifice</b> and <b>vertical</b> slot efficiencies were directly correlated to the velocities at their entrances. To reach the tested devices, salmon parr tended to remain {{near the bottom of}} the flume and followed paths providing them with low velocities and cover along the sides of the test arena. The movements of salmon approaching entrances were consistent with energy-conserving strategies. The paper presents a tentative approach for computing energy expenditure for a range of fish pass devices...|$|R
40|$|A major {{introduced}} run of {{sockeye salmon}} at Frazer Lake, Kodiak Island, Alaska, is perpetuated by an Alaska steeppass fishway at a 10 -m-high {{falls on the}} outlet river. Experimental modifications of the fishway, which was inadequate by 1970 as the salmon run increased, improved salmon entry and passage. Sockeye passage over 4 yr. was nearly equivalent in a steeppass of 60 m continuous length (22 % slope) and an adjoining steeppass with three resting pools, but significant year-to-year differences in passage occurred between steeppasses. Resting tanks were beneficial for holding slower or descending salmon without blocking passage of other salmon. An average entry of 142 sockeye in 15 min was achieved by guiding all salmon along a weir to an entrance tank with a <b>vertical</b> slot <b>orifice.</b> Chutes installed in the entry end of the steeppasses created a high-velocity stream for attraction and decreased salmon dropout from the entrance tank. Salmon passage in the original steeppasses with three resting pools was greater than in new steeppasses with a single resting pool. In 1985, sockeye passage of 2925 /h and 46806 /d exceeded fishway capacity requirements...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitede combustion enhancing geometries: {{ability to generate}} a detonation, wave speed, and time for shock formation. The evaluated geometries included flow-restricting orifice plates and a Schelkin spiral. The shock reflection was accomplished by a <b>vertical</b> fence (large <b>orifice)</b> placed in the last fourth of the tube length. The optimum geometry {{was found to be}} the orifice plate used in conjunction with the spiral. Detonations occurred when using ethylene in this configuration, but did not develop when using propane. Because propane's overall reaction rate is slower than that of simpler fuels, more large- and small-scale turbulence to further enhance combustion needs to be generated to create a detonation wave in a short distance when using complex hydrocarbons, such as propane.

50|$|The {{glans penis}} is the {{expanded}} cap of the corpus spongiosum. It is moulded on the rounded {{ends of the}} corpora cavernosa penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. At {{the summit of the}} glans is the slit-like <b>vertical</b> external urethral <b>orifice.</b> The circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona glandis, overhanging a deep retroglandular sulcus (the coronal sulcus), behind which is the neck of the penis. The proportional size of the glans penis can vary greatly. On some penises it is much wider in circumference than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, and on others it is narrower and more akin to a probe in shape.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{dissertation}} is to quantify the efficiency and operation of various types of fish passes for dams. This is achieved through a novel experiment of testing juvenile salmon in a scale model fish-passes with a range of small structures including <b>vertical</b> slots, <b>orifices,</b> weirs and combinations of all three. Direct comparisons of the efficiency of each type of fish pass in terms of upstream migration. Two identical physical models were constructed, one at the Fisheries Research Services Freshwater Laboratory at Almondbank, Perth, Scotland where observations were made of fish behaviour. The other model at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow tested only hydraulic conditions. The physical models were simplified representations of a reach of a river downstream of a dam, weir or any other obstruction to fish migration. A removable cross wall incorporating one of the types of pass tested divided the flume into two pools. A significantly higher proportion of fish moved through submerged <b>orifices</b> or <b>vertical</b> slots than through weirs for a given flow rate and velocity. The <b>orifice</b> and <b>vertical</b> slot passing efficiencies are directly correlated to the velocities existing in their vicinity. To reach the weir/slot/orifice devices, salmon parr tended also to stay {{near the bottom of the}} flume and followed a path along the sides of the arena, which provided them with low velocities and cover. In the vicinity of the weir/orifice/slot devices, the movements of salmon parr were consistent with energy-conserving strategies. Clearly, the extrapolations of results from the behaviour of small to large salmon remains cautious, the intention of this research being to characterise the behaviour of small salmon and to develop clear testable hypotheses about how large salmon may respond to water flow. Preliminary field tests were then conducted at Tongland Dam fish pass to test the main recommendation extrapolated from the parr behavioural study. The particular situation of this fish pass, which contains both weirs and orifices, allows a comparison between the two. Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags together with antennae installed at a weir and an orifice were used to individually monitor the movement of wild spawning salmon passing through the fish pass. The results of the field test are as yet, inconclusive...|$|R
