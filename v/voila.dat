25|$|Ullrich had 2 wins {{before the}} 1997 Tour; {{a stage in}} the Tour de Suisse and the {{national}} Road Race championship {{a week before the}} tour. He became favorite in the 1997 Tour de France. He started strongly, finishing second in the prologue behind Chris Boardman. On stage 9, the first mountain stage which was won by Laurent Brochard, Ullrich worked for Riis. Only on the last ascent when Richard Virenque attacked did Ullrich react. Riis struggled to keep up and finished 30 seconds behind Virenque, Marco Pantani and Ullrich. On stage 10 from Luchon to Andorra Arcalis, with Riis again falling back, Ullrich dropped back to the teamcar to ask permission to attack. He returned to the lead group and pushed up the climb leaving Pantani and Virenque. He finished a minute ahead which earned his first yellow jersey.

2500|$|As a child Arena {{listened to}} Spanish, Italian and French songs {{that were in}} her family's record collection. At five she was the flower girl at her cousin Gaetano's wedding, and at the {{reception}} she urged her father to approach the host {{so that she could}} sing – Daryl Braithwaite's version of [...] "You're My World" [...] – it was her first public performance. She received singing lessons from <b>Voila</b> Ritchie who recommended her to appear on a TV talent quest and variety show, Young Talent Time.

2500|$|Meg Cabot quotes the series' {{inspiration}} on her website stating: [...] "I {{was inspired}} to write The Princess Diaries when my mom, {{after the death of}} my father, began dating one of my teachers; they later went on to get married just as Mia’s mom does in the book! I have always had a 'thing' for princesses (my parents used to joke that when I was smaller, I did a lot of insisting that my 'real' parents, the king and queen, were going to come get me soon, and that everyone had better start being a LOT nicer to me) so I stuck a princess in the book just for kicks... and <b>VOILÀ!</b> The Princess Diaries was born." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 20. Finale. The {{final section}} {{begins with a}} soft woodwind chord {{followed}} by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment à bouches fermées (similar to the [...] "Humming Chorus" [...] from Puccini's later opera, Madama Butterfly) which repeats the theme from Pâle et blonde. Ophélie sings: Le <b>voilà!</b> Je crois l'entendre! – [...] "There he is! I think I hear him!". As she leans over the water, holding onto {{the branches of a}} willow [...] with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody (Theme of Hamlet's Love) from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Ophélie: Doute de la lumière – [...] "Doubt that the light illumines"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Real was {{released}} in 1993 and debuted in the top ten in the UK. Singles of the album featured [...] "Big Scary Animal" [...] and [...] "Lay Down Your Arms", a remake from the Graces.

2500|$|... 15. Trio. Ophélie {{enters with}} the Queen. (The Queen: Le <b>voilà!</b> Je veux lire enfin dans sa pensée [...] "There he is! I must {{know what is}} on his mind"). The Queen tells Hamlet, the altar awaits him, here is his betrothed. Hamlet looks away, without replying. The Queen persists. Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse! [...] "May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated {{marriage}} can be solemnized!"). Ophélie asks what he means. He responds: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie. [...] "No! Go to a nunnery, go, Ophélie."). The Queen asks whether he has forgotten all Ophélie's virtues. He replies he now feels nothing in his heart. Ophélie despairs (Ophélie: Cet amor promis à genoux [...] "The love that on your knees you swore"). She returns her ring to him (Theme of Hamlet's Love), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Ophélie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie [...] "No! Go to a nunnery, go, Ophélie"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Ophélie leaves, hiding her tears.|$|E
2500|$|Although Bill and I {{performed}} {{at a very}} young age, and Bill, I, Barry and John did a lot of frat parties at Brown University and clubs in Newport ... the most memorable performance of what I would view as the precursor of what The Cowsills would be was at Kings Park in Newport (right at the foot of Halidon Hall) at some carnival. The family angle just evolved ... first Bill and me, then Bill me and Barry, then Bill, me, Barry and John, then Bill, me, Barry, John and Mom, then Bill, me, Barry, John, Mom and Paul, then later, me, Paul, John, Barry, Mom and Susan, then back to Bill, me, Barry and John (very briefly in the end) and then to me, Paul, John and Susan. Our first real break came when we were playing the MK Hotel in Newport (in the basement there) and a guy from the [...] "Today Show" [...] saw us and asked if we wanted to be on the [...] "Today" [...] show. We weren't famous or anything but we were young and we were related and we were quite good. So we went on [...] "The Today Show" [...] (I doubt a tape exists of that but if it did it would be priceless to see) and someone from Mercury Records saw us, which ultimately led to our signing with that label and putting out [...] "Most Of All" [...] (a great [...] "school's out" [...] song that should have been our first hit in my opinion), which led to Artie Kornfeld and Steve Duboff. Mercury dropped us, but Artie and Steve had written [...] "The Rain, The Park and Other Things" [...] and we went in and recorded that song at A studios in New York and took the whole package to MGM, who decided wouldn't it just be terrific if their mother performed with them and, <b>voila,</b> the rest, as they say, is history.|$|E
