25|$|Alfonso granted {{constitutional}} charters to {{the towns}} of Betanzos, A Coruña, Baiona, Salvaterra de Miño, <b>Verín,</b> Monforte de Lemos, O Valadouro, Milmanda, Bo Burgo de Castro Caldelas, Melide, Sarria and Triacastela, sited in good harbors along the Galician coastline, by the Miño river, or at major crossroads in the country. These new reguengo villages (royal villages under direct royal political and economical control, and administered by their autonomous city councils), each one usually known as a burgo due to its walled circuits, constituted important attraction points for peasants, who could find better life conditions under the direct protection of the king than abroad {{under the authority of}} a bishop, a monastery or a nobleman; but they also attracted foreigners, most notably artisans and merchants, who brought new trends and knowledges. These burgs supposed a revolution in the social structure of the time, leading to economic diversification, removing the dominant autarky of the previous centuries, and facilitating the development of fishing and pre-industrial activities oriented toward the mass production of some resources, especially salted and dried fish, fish oil, and wine, marketed through the seaports north to England, and south to the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|During the Soviet rule {{one could}} observe what might seem {{motivation}} to simplify consonant shift further. Thus, for example, in a 1971 book by Aldonis <b>Vēriņš</b> Puķkopība ("Horticulture") the pl. gen. of narcise ("daffodil") is consistently spelled narcisu instead of narcišu.|$|R
30|$|The open {{reading frame}} of the YAP 1 gene was amplified from S. cerevisiae strain TMB 3500 (Almeida et al. [2009 b]), using primers YAP 1 -F and YAP 1 -R. The {{amplicon}} was ligated into p 426 GPD (Mumberg et al. [1995]) resulting in p 426 GPD-YAP 1 used for transformation of E. coli DH 5 α cells and followed by sequence verification. The cassette from p 426 GPD-YAP 1 was amplified using primers GPD-YAP 1 -F and CYC 1 t-YAP 1 -R. The amplified cassette was ligated into pUG 6 after restriction with Aat II and Pvu II, resulting in pUG 6 -YAP 1. Amplification of the two homologous regions (HR) used for integration of the YAP 1 cassette into the APJ 1 locus were performed from S. cerevisiae GSE 16 (Demeke et al. [2013 b]) with primers HR 1 -F/HR 1 -R and HR 2 -F/HR 2 -R. Amplicon for RH 2 was first ligated into pUG 6 -YAP 1 and transformed into E. coli DH 5 α cells resulting in pYAP 1 -HR 2. Amplicon for HR 1 was ligated into pYAP 1 -HR 2 and transformed into E. coli DH 5 α cells resulting in pYAP 1 -HR 2 -HR 1. The selection cassette (KanMX) flanked by the attB and attP sites was amplified from pJET 1, 2 -attB-KanMX-attP using attBP-F and attBP-R. The amplicon was ligated into pYAP 1 -HR 2 -HR 1 and transformed into E. coli NEB 5 -alpha resulting in p-intYAP 1. The nucleotide sequence of each amplicon was verified after every subsequent cloning step. S. cerevisiae strain GSE 16 was used for expression of the YAP 1 construct. In this strain, the expression cassette containing the transcription factor YAP 1 was integrated by linearization of the integrative cassette using Aat II and Not I, followed by transformation using a DMSO-modified version of the LiAc method (Hill et al. [1991]). The selection of colonies was done on YNB plates with 150  μg.mL− 1 geneticin G 418 (Sigma). Verification of the correct insertion (APJ 1 locus) was done by sequencing using primers <b>Ver.ins</b> 1 -F/Ver.ins 1 -R and <b>Ver.ins</b> 2 -F/Ver.ins 2 -R. The resulting strain was named GSE 16 -YAP 1.|$|R

2500|$|The {{hot springs}} (...) were known since the Roman period, when {{the town was}} Aquae Flaviae; the Waters of Flavius were an {{important}} social gathering point, but fell into disuse as the town was slowly abandoned by attacks. The spas belong to a vast area of hydrothermal springs that stretch from <b>Verín</b> (in Galicia) to Pedras Salgadas, 30km from Chaves (on the road to Vila Real). Despite its vastness and abundance of water, this thermal system is little utilized; of the nine groups of thermal springs there are only adequate installations in four of them: Chaves, Carvalhelhos, Vidago, Pedras Salgadas, and <b>Verín.</b> The waters of the spring, that are captured in three springs within Chaves, have mean temperatures of [...] (the hottest bicarbonate waters in Europe). The modern spa industry in Chaves use these waters for numerous treatments, including stomach, liver, intestinal, and kidney ailments, through oral ingestion. Many small guesthouses in the old part of the town are dependent on the influx of these visitors. The thermal spas are located between the castle and the river, {{in front of a}} large area of grass-covered park with playgrounds and tennis courts.|$|E
2500|$|Chaves (...) is a {{city and}} a {{municipality}} {{in the north of}} Portugal. It is 10km south of the Spanish border and 22km south of <b>Verín</b> (Spain). The population in 2011 was 41,243, in an area of 591.23km². The municipality is the second most populous of the district of Vila Real (the district capital, Vila Real, is 60km south on the A24 motorway). With origins in the Roman civitas Aquæ Flaviæ, Chaves has developed into a regional center. The urban area has 17,535 residents (2001).|$|E
2500|$|The {{region is}} {{dominated}} by the Quaternary Chaves sedimentary basin, a graben aligned on a north-northeast to south-southwest orientation bounded by the Hercynian massif and metamorphic schistose formations. Mixed with the schistose complex, there are bands of graphitic slates, mainly {{in the southern part of}} the urbanized area of Chaves and south-east of Faiões. To the north, and into Galicia, the basin extends into the depression of the <b>Verin</b> Basin. One of the oldest formations in the region, it dates back to the Ordovician period ( [...] between 488.3±1.7 to 443.7±1.5 million years ago), is composed of schist and graywacke deposits. During the Ordovician-Silurian geological periods quartzites and schists were formed, metamorphosed by Hercynian granitic intrusions, at the end of the Paleozoic.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} summer of 1169, Gerald took taifa and city of Badajoz {{after a long}} siege, but the {{garrison}} took refuge in the citadel, the alcazaba, the siege of which continued. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region {{at the expense of}} both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve his nominal vassal. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of León, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Gerald was captured by the Leonese majordomo, Fernán Ruiz de Castro, called el Castellano ("the Castilian"). He was an important person at court, who for a while held the highest military post in the capital (tenente turris Legionis, [...] "possessing the tower of León"). He was the king's brother-in-law, being married to Stephanie the Unfortunate, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VII by his second mistress, Urraca Fernández, and thus a half-sister of Ferdinand II. After the mêlée the Leonese had control of the town and the alcazaba, which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Ferdinand succeeded in gaining the valley of the upper Limia and the regions of Toroño (around Tuy), Capraria (around <b>Verín),</b> and Lobarzana (around Chaves) from Afonso in exchange for his release. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom. Ferdinand retained Cáceres, but Trujillo, Montánchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfragüe he gave to Fernán Ruiz.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning the French advanced in force to Monterey. Romana abandoned the position as they advanced, drew off to <b>Verin,</b> and then retired along the road towards Sanabria. He thus left it open to himself either to follow the road to Chaves, as agreed upon, or to retire into Spain through the mountains. Franceschi's cavalry and a battalion of French infantry overtook between two and three thousand men forming the rear of Romana's column. The latter drew up in a great square. Franceschi attacked the rear face with his infantry, passed with his cavalry round {{the sides of the}} square, and placed himself between it {{and the rest of the}} retiring column. He had with him four regiments of cavalry, and now hurled a regiment at each side of the square.|$|E
