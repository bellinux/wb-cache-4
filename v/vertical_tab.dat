40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{detection}} of the dust source region and monitoring of the transport of the dust plume from its primary outflow to final deposition. The application area is the Sahara desert and the eastern Mediterranean, where two dust events occurred during the period 4 – 6 February 2009, an unusual event for a winter period. The Aqua-MODIS and OMI observations clearly define the spatial distribution of the dust plumes, while the CALIPSO observations of total attenuated backscatter (TAB) at 532 [*]nm, depolarization ratio (DR), and attenuated color ratio (1064 / 532 [*]nm) on 5 February 2009 provide a clear view and vertical structure of the dust-laden layer. The dust source region is defined to be near the Chad-Niger-Libyan borders, using satellite observations and model (DREAM) output. This dust plume is vertically extended up to 2. 5 [*]km and is observed as a mass plume of dust from surface level to that altitude, where the <b>vertical</b> variation of <b>TAB</b> (0. 002 to 0. 2) and DR (0. 2 – 0. 5) implies dust-laden layer with non-spherical particles. CALIPSO profiles show that after the dust plume reached at its highest level, the dust particles start to be deposited over the Mediterranean and the initial dust plume was strongly attenuated, while features of dust were limited below about 1 – 1. 5 [*]km for latitudes northern of ~ 36 ° (Greek territory) ...|$|R

50|$|Printing control {{characters}} were first {{used to control}} the physical mechanism of printers, the earliest output device. An early implementation of this idea was the out-of-band ASA carriage control characters. Later, control {{characters were}} integrated into the stream of data to be printed.The carriage return character (CR), when sent to such a device, causes it to put the character {{at the edge of}} the paper at which writing begins (it may, or may not, also move the printing position to the next line).The line feed character (LF/NL) causes the device to put the printing position on the next line. It may (or may not), depending on the device and its configuration, also move the printing position to the start of the next line (whichever direction is first—left in Western languages and right in Hebrew and Arabic). The <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>tab</b> characters (VT and HT/TAB) cause the output device to move the printing position to the next tab stop in the direction of reading. The form feed character (FF/NP) starts a new sheet of paper, and may or may not move to the start of the first line. The backspace character (BS) moves the printing position one character space backwards. On printers, this is most often used so the printer can overprint characters to make other, not normally available, characters. On terminals and other electronic output devices, there are often software (or hardware) configuration choices which will allow a destruct backspace (i.e., a BS, SP, BS sequence) which erases, or a non-destructive one which does not. The shift in and shift out characters (SO and SI) selected alternate character sets, fonts, underlining or other printing modes. Escape sequences were often used to do the same thing.|$|R
40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{an assessment}} of the rotor blade vibration reduction capabilities of a novel L-shaped trailing edge Gurney Flap. Previous numerical and experimental works highlighted how such device is potentially suitable for performance enhancement and stall alleviation on rotorcraft. Moreover, these studies showed that the primary effect of this L-tab is represented by a modification of the reference airfoil mean line shape, both in terms of camber and chord length, this latter being related to the two counter rotating vertical structures developed past the <b>tab</b> <b>vertical</b> prong. Previously validated computational uid dynamics results are exploited to develop a physically based thin-line reduced order model, which successfully reproduces the mean line modifications induced by the L-tab, in addition to accurately capture the steady aerodynamic forces and the first harmonic of the unsteady loads generated by fixed configurations of the airfoil L-tab system and by oscillating motionsof the movable device, respectively. A similar thin-line linear model is also developed for a blade section equipped with a classical trailing edge ap. Comparisons of the aerodynamic loads generated by these two movable devices for equal input oscillating laws allow to estimate the ranges of reduced frequency where the L-tab is expected to perform better with respect to the trailing edge ap and vice-versa. These two reduced order models are then exploited to build up two separate three degrees of freedom linear aerostructural models for a blade equipped with a partial span L-tab or trailing edge ap. A higher harmonic control algorithm is then applied and compared between the two devices to reduce separately the 2 /rev, 3 /rev, 4 /rev and 5 /rev harmonics of the blade root rotating frame vertical force, apping and feathering moments. A significant reduction of the vibratory loads is obtained. Moreover, the attainment of similar results with a well known trailing edge device, such the classical ap taken under consideration, is a further confirmation of the potential feasibility of this novel L-tab as an effective alternative mean for vibration reduction on rotor blades...|$|R
