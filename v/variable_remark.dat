40|$|Introduction It {{is common}} in the {{literature}} on instrumental <b>variables</b> to <b>remark</b> upon the difficulty of knowing or demonstrating that a potential instrument is exogenous, in the sense of being uncorrelated with the disturbances [Bartels, 1991, Johnston, 1972]. It is also widely recognized that exogeneity is an assumption embedded in the model specification [Engle, et al, 1984], hence, it rests on subjective judgment and, like other structural assumptions of causation and "zero-restrictions", it cannot be tested in purely observational studies. The purpose of this note is to show that despite its elusive nature, exogeneity can nevertheless be given some empirical test. The test is not guaranteed to detect all violations of exogeneity but it can, in certain circumstances, screen away real bad choices of would-be instruments. 2 An Instrumental Inequality Definition 2. 1 (exogeneity) A variable z is said to be exogenous relative to an ordere...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} unmeasured variables in path models. Problems of estima-tion of the path coefficients of a path model are explored when unmeasured variables are utilized as both causes and effects (intervening variables). The paper concludes with a dis-cussion of conditions for the identification of a path model containing unmeasured <b>variables</b> and some <b>remarks</b> on the substantive interpretation of unmeasured variables. Beginning with H. M. Blalock's (1960; 1961 a; 1961 b) extension of Herbert Si-mon's (1957) seminal essay on spurious correlation, sociologists have become increas-ingly aware of the utility of linear causal models as a procedure for bridging the gap between sociological theory {{on the one hand}} *This is a revision of a paper presented at th...|$|R
40|$|We present exact {{results on}} the {{partition}} function of the q-state Potts model on various families of graphs G in a generalized external magnetic field that favors or disfavors spin values in a subset I_s = { 1, [...] .,s} of the total set of possible spin values, Z(G,q,s,v,w), where v and w are temperature- and field-dependent Boltzmann <b>variables.</b> We <b>remark</b> on differences in thermodynamic behavior between our model with a generalized external magnetic field and the Potts model with a conventional magnetic field that favors or disfavors a single spin value. Exact results are also given for the interesting special case of the zero-temperature Potts antiferromagnet, corresponding to a set-weighted chromatic polynomial Ph(G,q,s,w) that counts the number of colorings of the vertices of G subject to the condition that colors of adjacent vertices are different, with a weighting w that favors or disfavors colors in the interval I_s. We derive powerful new {{upper and lower bounds}} on Z(G,q,s,v,w) for the ferromagnetic case in terms of zero-field Potts partition functions with certain transformed arguments. We also prove general inequalities for Z(G,q,s,v,w) on different families of tree graphs. As part of our analysis, we elucidate how the field-dependent Potts partition function and weighted-set chromatic polynomial distinguish, respectively, between Tutte-equivalent and chromatically equivalent pairs of graphs.

40|$|The {{launch and}} entry suit (LES) {{is a life}} support suit worn during Orbiter ascent and descent. The impact of suit weight and {{restricted}} mobility on egress from the Orbiter during an emergency is unknown. An alternate suit - the advanced crew escape suite (ACES) - is being evaluated. The physiological responses to ambulatory exercise of six subjects wearing the LES and ACES were measured and compared to those measurements taken while unsuited. Dependent variables included heart rate and metabolic response to treadmill walking at 5. 6 km/h (3. 5 mph), and also bilateral concentric muscle strength about the knee, shoulder, and elbow. No significant (p greater than 0. 06) differences in heart rate or metabolic variables were measured in either suit while walking at 5. 6 km/h. Significant (p less than 0. 05) decreases in all metabolic <b>variables</b> were <b>remarked</b> when both suits were compared to the unsuited condition. There were no significant (p greater than 0. 05) differences among the three suit conditions at 30 or 180 deg/s for muscles about the elbow and knee; however, about the shoulder, a significant (p = 0. 0215) difference between the ACES and the unsuited condition was noted. Therefore, wearing a life support suit while performing Orbiter egress imposes a significant metabolic demand on crewmembers. Selective upper body strength movements may be compromised...|$|R
40|$|The {{central theme}} {{of this paper is}}, as the title itself shows, the econometric {{modelling}} of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), based on the concept Euromoney’ s country risk rating. This article contains three sections, the first part or the introduction is an approach of investment risk and, in particular, introduces a new element in modelling investment, namely country risk rating. Thus, a bridge is created towards the second section, which essentially deals with the econometric modelling of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Romania, after 1996, based on Euromoney’s data (ECR). The originality of this paper is underlined by the presence of a final model which includes, as an exogenous variable, country risk rating in assessing the FDI share of GDP as an endogenous <b>variable.</b> A final <b>remark</b> comments, from an economic perspective, the results of the econometric modelling...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue that}} must be settled in {{considering}} the structure and interpretation of wh-interrogatives is whether the wh-phrase in question occupies the CP-spec position at LF (after movement), or stays in its original [...] -position: it will {{be interpreted as a}}n operator in the former case, while it will be interpreted as a variable in the latter case. This paper provides critical reviews of two sets of discussions regarding this issue. (i) Pesetsky 1987, in proposing that a D-linked wh-phrase is interpreted as a <b>variable,</b> makes a <b>remark</b> that [NP which [...] . ] in English can be D-linked while [NP what] cannot. While this distinction seems to be quite useful in analyzing wh-interrogatives in English, this paper shows that the Japanese counterparts of [NP which [...] . ] and [NP what] do not exhibit the expected contrasts, which means that Japanese wh-words are not divided clearly into two groups in terms of 2 ̆ 7 D-linking 2 ̆ 7. (ii) Dayal 2002 reports that only some of the multiple interrogatives allow paired answers, and claims that they should be analyzed as containing a covert wh-movement. This paper shows that her discovery will not give us much help, since the multiple interrogatives which do not admit paired answers {{play a crucial role in}} her analysis, and their Japanese counterparts can in fact be followed by paired answers, contrary to our expectations...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{change is}} a central theme in {{virtually}} any explanation of the exceptional performance of the US economy {{over the past several}} years. Structural changes of uncertain magnitude and timing have increased the difficulty in forecasting, undermined confidence in our understanding {{of the structure of the}} economy, and increased the risk of measurement error with respect to key <b>variables.</b> In my <b>remarks,</b> I will offer a bridge from today’s discussion of structural changes to the implications for monetary policy, the subject of tomorrow’s agenda. In my view, the most important challenges to monetary policy related to structural change in this episode arise from possible changes in aggregate supply- specifically in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and in trend growth. The key challenge for monetary policymakers during this period, in my view, has been to allow the economy to realize the full benefits of the new possibilities while avoiding an overheated economy. More fundamentally, the challenge has been to adapt the strategy of monetary policy in light of the uncertainties associated with structural change. My focus is therefore not on structural change per se but rather on the uncertainty about key parameters likely to be heightened during a period of structural change. However, the key structural change during this episode- an increase in the underlying productivit...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the bimolecular formation and redissociation of complexes using classical trajectories and the survival {{probability distribution function}} P(E,J,t) of the intermediate complexes at time t {{as a function of}} the energy E and total angular momentum quantum number J. The P(E,J,t) and its deviation from single exponential behavior is a main focus of the present set of studies. Together with weak deactivating collisions, the P(E,J,t) and a cumulative reaction probability at the given E and J can also be used to obtain the recombination rate constant k at low pressures of third bodies. Both classical and quantum expressions are given for k in terms of P(E,J,t). The initial conditions for the classical trajectories are sampled for atom−diatom reactions for various (E,J) ’s using action-angle variables. A canonical transformation to a total J representation reduces the sampling space by permitting analytic integration over several of the <b>variables.</b> A similar <b>remark</b> applies for the calculation of the density of states of the intermediate complex ρ and for the number of states N* of the transition state as a function of E and J. The present approach complements the usual approach based on the rate of the reverse reaction, unimolecular dissociation, and the equilibrium constant. It provides results not necessarily accessible from the unimolecular studies. The formalism is applied elsewhere to the study of nonstatistical aspects of the recombination and redissociation of the resulting ozone molecules and comparison with RRKM theory...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{heterogeneity}} mostly {{dominated by}} differing light regimes affects {{the expression of}} phenotypic plasticity, which is important for plant growth and survival, especially in the forest understory. The knowledge about these responses to this heterogeneity is a key factor for forest restoration initiatives. In this study, we determine several phenotypic responses to contrasting light conditions in five native tree seedling species of La Cangreja National Park, Central Pacific of Costa Rica, four of them with threatened or relict populations. After 14 weeks at a medium gap condition (24 % of full sun), seedlings were transferred and acclimated for 11 weeks to three different natural light regimes: large gap (LG), medium gap (MG) and small gap (SG), corresponding to 52 %, 24 %, 9 % of the mean direct and indirect radiation at each site from full sun. Growth, biomass allocation and leaf gas exchange were measured after the acclimation period. Four species strongly reduced relative growth rate (RGR) in the lower light condition. Total biomass (TB) and RGR were different in Hymenaea courbaril and Platymiscium curiense. H. courbaril and Astronium graveolens had {{significant changes in the}} maximum assimilation rate, with a mean value in the LG of 11. 02 and 7. 70 µmolCO 2 /m²s, respectively. P. curuense showed the same trend and significant changes in RGR and biomass allocation. Aspidosperma myristicifolium and Plinia puriscalensis showed no adjustments to the light regimes in any of the measured <b>variables.</b> This study <b>remarks</b> the importance of determining the growth and physiological performance of these tree native species. It also demonstrates that the most threatened species are those with the less plastic responses to the light regimes, which stresses the difficult situation of their natural populations. This study highlights an urgent definition of the conservation and restoration needs of the degraded forests of the Costa Rican Central Pacific area, where these species dwell...|$|R
