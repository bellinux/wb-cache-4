5|$|The city of <b>Valletta</b> officially {{became the}} capital city of Malta and the seat of the Order on 18 March 1571, {{although}} it was still unfinished. By the end of the 16th century, <b>Valletta</b> was the largest settlement in Malta.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts and}} tribunals were {{initially}} housed in a building in Birgu. After the Order moved their headquarters to <b>Valletta,</b> a new Castellania {{was built in the}} new capital. Meanwhile, the original Castellania in Birgu was converted into the Inquisitor's Palace in 1574. The building of a Castellania was made in the original plans of <b>Valletta.</b> One of the plans for the Castellania was also to be built within the reserved area of the auberges of the knights, known as the Collacchio, but limiting access to a vast area in <b>Valletta</b> was found to be unpractical and the initiative was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} wind from the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from <b>Valletta,</b> Decrés hoping to use the cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with <b>Valletta</b> watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey the message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while <b>Valletta's</b> fortifications were well designed, they were not strong enough to withstand a heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling <b>Valletta's</b> original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and <b>Valletta's</b> land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right.|$|R

5|$|Auberge d'Italie was {{the third}} Italian auberge {{to be built in}} Malta. The first auberge was built in Birgu in the 1550s, on the site of an earlier {{building}} which had been used by the Langue of Italy. Following the transfer of the capital city from Birgu to <b>Valletta,</b> a second auberge was built in the centre of the new city in 1570–71. This building was eventually incorporated into the Grandmaster's Palace, and the present auberge began to be built in Strada San Giacomo (now Merchants Street). The original designs of both <b>Valletta</b> auberges were made by the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar.|$|E

5|$|Despite the modifications, it was {{realized}} that the walls of <b>Valletta</b> were {{not strong enough to}} withstand a long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of Floriana developed in the area between the Floriana Lines and the <b>Valletta</b> Land Front, and it is now a town in its own right.|$|E

5|$|On {{receiving}} this reply, Bonaparte immediately {{ordered his}} fleet to bombard <b>Valletta</b> and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic {{sites around the}} island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to <b>Valletta</b> once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. Although <b>Valletta</b> {{was strong enough to}} hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights. Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he {{and the rest of the}} expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June.|$|E

5|$|When Villeneuve {{arrived at}} Malta in September 1798, {{the island was}} already in turmoil: the {{dissolution}} of the Roman Catholic Church on the island under French rule had been highly unpopular with the Maltese population, who forced the French garrison to retreat into the fortress of <b>Valletta</b> on 2 September. By the start of October, British and Portuguese troops had supplemented the Maltese irregulars, while a naval squadron watched <b>Valletta</b> harbour, to prevent any French effort to resupply and reinforce the garrison. Although small quantities of material reached <b>Valletta</b> from France in early 1799, by the start of 1800 no ship had arrived for more than seven months, and the garrison was near starvation. In an effort to resupply the garrison, the French sent a convoy from Toulon in February 1800, but the ships were intercepted off Malta by a squadron under Nelson on 17 February and in the ensuing battle the flagship Généreux was captured and Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée was killed.|$|E

5|$|In January 1800, {{recognising}} that <b>Valletta</b> was {{in danger}} of surrendering if it could not be resupplied, the French Navy prepared a convoy at Toulon, consisting of Généreux, under Captain Cyprien Renaudin, the 20-gun corvettes Badine, Fauvette and 16-gun Sans Pareille and two or three transport ships. The force was under the command of Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée, recently exchanged under parole after being captured off Acre the previous year, and was instructed to approach <b>Valletta</b> along the Maltese coast from the southwest with the intention of passing between the blockade squadron and the shore and entering Malta before the British could discover and intercept them. The convoy sailed on 7 February. In addition to the supplies, the convoy carried nearly 3,000 French soldiers to reinforce the garrison, an unnecessary measure that would completely counteract the replenishment of the garrison's food stocks.|$|E
