The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A freon gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorders.|$|E
