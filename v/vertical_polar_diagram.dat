40|$|A {{new way of}} {{visualizing}} the Sommerfeld {{theory of}} propagation over a flat, imperfectly reflecting earth is presented. The Sommerfeld theory arises because the ray theory of propagation from a source {{in the presence of}} a flat, imperfectly reflecting earth is only an approximation. The ray theory involves the assumption that the Fresnel reflection coefficient of the earth does not vary rapidly with angle of incidence, and this assumption is not satisfied for glancing incidence of vertically polarized waves on the earth's surface at broadcasting wavelengths. The main object of the new presentation is to facilitate the solution of problems involving propagation near the surface of the earth partly over land and partly over sea, but these applications are not included in the paper. It is convenient to think of a two-dimensional problem in which the transmitter is a line source parallel to the earth's surface, having a <b>vertical</b> <b>polar</b> <b>diagram</b> of circular shape.

40|$|The <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram</b> [1] {{of a set}} {{of points}} (i. e. sites) is a {{partition}} of the plane. It is a locus approach for problems processing angles. Also, Dynamic <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram</b> problem is a problem in which some points can be added to or removed from the point set of the <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram.</b> Sadeghi et al. [4] introduced this problem and solved it using an algorithm which is optimal in the case that some points are deleted from the set. But this algorithm is not optimal when some new points are inserted into the diagram. In this paper, we present an algorithm to solve the Dynamic <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram</b> in optimal time in which we insert some new points into the diagram one by one. Our approach applies only on the regions that would be changed and solves the problem for each insertion in O(k + log n) time, in which 1 ≤ k ≤ n is the number of the sites which their regions would be changed. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the historical {{development of the}} methods of magnetic interpretation and explains why greater emphasis should be placed on graphical methods. Many graphical methods have been published but only one of them, Pirson's <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram</b> method, has widespread application to all magnetic interpretive problems. The <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram</b> method is especially applicable to magnetic problems of a regional nature where the disturbing body is very irregular in shape and cannot be approximated by a second order geometric form. A disturbing body of this description is present in the Los Angeles Basin. Previous attempts to match the observed magnetic anomaly curves across the Los Angeles Basin with the theoretical calculated curves by numerical methods have failed to obtain a close comparison. The <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram</b> method makes it possible to obtain a superposition of the calculated curves over the observed curves except {{in the vicinity of the}} Palos Verde Hills. The superposition was obtained only after there was complete agreement between the existing geologic, gravity; and seismic information along the profile across the Basin. The <b>Polar</b> <b>Diagram</b> method is one of the quickest and most straight forward of the graphical methods to use. It is applicable to most magnetic problems where the direction of the induced magnetism is parallel to the direction of the remanent magnetism. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{resistance}} of bone tissue is influenced {{not only by}} bone density parameters but also by bone architecture parameters, such as the microarchitecture and anisotropy of trabecular bone. We have developed and validated a fractal analysis method for studying bone microarchitecture on roentgenograms. This technique provides reproducible measurements of the fractal dimension (D) of bone, which reflects bone texture. The fractal dimension is determined in 36 different directions; the mean of these 36 values {{is representative of the}} image. A <b>polar</b> <b>diagram</b> gives the value of D according to the angle of analysis. By decomposing this <b>diagram</b> using <b>polar</b> Fourier Transform analysis, the parameters related to the shape of the <b>polar</b> <b>diagram</b> can be determined. This diagram image analysis technique has been used for other similar diagrams and applied to the results of our fractal analysis method. Diagram shape characterization may provide information on the angular distribution of results and therefore on the anisotropy of the images under study. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare roentgenograms of the calcaneus and radius in the same subjects to determine whether texture and anisotropy parameters discriminated between these two bones. Roentgenograms of the calcaneus and radius were obtained in ten nonosteoporotic subjects. The radius had a smaller fractal dimension than the calcaneus (mean +/- standard deviation: 1. 215 +/- 0. 025 and 1. 285 +/- 0. 066, respectively; p = 0. 014). Differences in the shape of the <b>polar</b> <b>diagram</b> were found between the two bones.

Our method allows quantitative characterization of texture and anisotropy differences between the calcaneus and radius. The smaller fractal dimension of the radius probably reflects the simpler architecture of this non weight-bearing bone.
