5|$|Stimulants and {{antidepressants}} (sedatives and depressants) {{may increase}} (decrease) the drug effects of amphetamine, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{standing}} waves alternately {{rise and fall}} in a mirror image pattern, as kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along with Whitehead, Cobb {{has sought}} to {{reconcile}} science and religion in places where they appear to conflict, {{as well as to}} encourage religion to make use of scientific insights and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any DVI-to-HDMI adapter can {{function}} as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and <b>vice</b> <b>versa).</b> Typically, the only limitation is {{the gender of the}} adapter's connectors and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparisons}} {{drawn to}} the nearby Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the two were shown to be very different biologically. Species that are rare in Monterey Bay are common on Davidson, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leicester City {{supporters}} share {{good relations}} with fans of European teams VfL Bochum and Anderlecht. Regularly, supporters travel over to Europe to support these two teams, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} {{influence of}} Latin versus Greek and <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> {{in this area}} and in the Balkans in general, is sometimes demarcated by the Jireček Line.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{and ships}} headed from Milne Bay to Buna and <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> {{had to pass}} close to Goodenough Island. An Allied {{presence}} on the island could provide warning of Japanese operations while denying the Japanese that opportunity. Goodenough Island also had flat areas suitable {{for the construction of}} emergency airstrips.|$|E
5|$|As well as English {{language}} synonyms, ADS also {{searches for}} English translations of foreign search terms and <b>vice</b> <b>versa,</b> {{so that a}} search for the French word soleil retrieves references to Sun, and papers in languages other than English can be returned by English search terms.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced or <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> (or, indeed, {{whether they were}} created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|Gregory legislated on the {{behaviour}} of {{the laity}} and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority {{and made it}} clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} noted that if Adams had written all the lyrics, and Lange all the music (or <b>vice</b> <b>versa),</b> the {{collaboration}} would have counted as Canadian content (as {{long as it was}} recorded by a Canadian artist such as Adams, or had it been recorded in Canada).|$|E
5|$|Today, the American record {{industry}} defines Latin music as {{any type of}} release with lyrics mostly in Spanish. Mainstream artists and producers tend to feature more on songs from Latin artists and it's also become more likely that English language songs crossover to Spanish radio and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is relatively inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue increases, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|All taxi cabs in Iloilo may {{be hired}} {{to get from}} the airport to Iloilo City Proper or <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> The taxi drivers will most likely opt for a fixed rate rather than using the taxi meter. The taxi fare going to the airport from Iloilo City Proper range between 350–400 pesos as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|And Yet It Moves {{focuses on}} moving the player {{character}} {{through a series}} of hazardous environments. The player possesses the ability to freely rotate the entire game world, transforming walls into floors and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> The game's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept. The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder.|$|E
5|$|Animal Coloration, or in full Animal Coloration. An {{account of}} the {{principal}} facts and theories relating to the colours and markings of animals, is a book by the English zoologist Frank Evers Beddard, published by Swan Sonnenschein in 1892. It formed part of the ongoing debate amongst zoologists about the relevance of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to the observed appearance, structure, and behaviour of animals, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carla Thomas {{claimed that}} the pair had planned to record another duet album in December the same year, but Phil Walden denied this. Redding had {{proposed}} to record an album featuring cut and rearranged songs in different tempos; for example, ballads would be uptempo and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> Another suggestion was to record an album entirely consisting of country standards.|$|E
5|$|Cyrus later {{explained}} that it usually took over an hour and half to transition from Miley to Hannah and <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> on the television series set, while on tour it took approximately two minutes. With the additional time, Cyrus was able to rest briefly, drink water, and prepare {{for the remainder of}} the show.|$|E
5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses. But {{the presence of a}} surfactant provides a decrease in surface tension, which permits stability of minute droplets of oil in the bulk of water (or <b>vice</b> <b>versa).</b>|$|E
5|$|In blood plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Ardrossan Railway, which was regauged in 1840, on alternate days a fast steamboat service ran between Ardrossan Pier and Liverpool, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> This connected with the Grand Junction Railway and London and Birmingham Railway's expresses to London. In 1841 the steamboat service was transferred from Liverpool to the new Port at Fleetwood, Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{that have}} been bred with {{selection}} pressure focused on uniformity and finer fiber diameter often do not perform as optimally as lamb producers, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> Shetland breeders find it imperative that the breed maintains a balance {{in its ability to}} produce both a quality fleece and carcass, managed relatively holistically.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1961, {{the second}} prototype, XP836, {{performed}} its first take off conventionally. Continuing {{tests of the}} two prototypes proceeded {{to close the gap}} between vertical take off and flight, a feat which was achieved on 8 September 1961. During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to horizontal flight and <b>vice</b> <b>versa,</b> including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.|$|E
5|$|Scrolling {{through a}} long list or menu is {{achieved}} by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> to go back. In either case, the list moves {{as if it is}} pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.|$|E
5|$|The Jean and Johnnie {{dance was}} an {{important}} part of Barbadian culture until it was banned in the 19th century. This was a popular fertility dance performed outdoors at plantation fairs and other festivals, and was functional in that it allowed women to show off to men, and more rarely, <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> The dance was eventually banned because the dance was associated with non-Christian African traditions.|$|E
5|$|The PSU {{represented}} by the point on the PPF where an efficient economy operates (which is obtained by tangency with the highest individual or social indifference curve, not shown in the graph) presents the priorities or choices of the modeled agent, such as the choice of having more butter produced and fewer guns, or <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} provinces, whose {{official}} title was changed from Inspector to Governor and <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> {{several times during}} Han, were responsible for inspecting several commandery-level and kingdom-level administrations. On {{the basis of their}} reports, the officials in these local administrations would be promoted, demoted, dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vistara uses Club Vistara as its frequent-flyer program; it {{operates}} as a value based program and awards points {{on the basis of}} money spent on tickets rather that miles travelled by passengers. On 29 January 2015, Vistara announced a partnership agreement with Singapore Airlines (SIA) which would allow Club Vistara members to earn and redeem miles with the KrisFlyer program on SIA and Silk Air flights and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Iowan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> Eastbound {{shipments}} were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. With {{the opening of}} the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem {{does not seem to have}} been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or <b>vice</b> <b>versa,</b> by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its negation.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or <b>vice</b> <b>versa</b> depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E
5|$|Armored and {{mechanized}} divisions normally {{made use}} of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or <b>vice</b> <b>versa.</b> Given {{the size of the}} forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.|$|E
