40|$|M. CommAn {{assessment}} {{of the impact of}} <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> on business performance. The impact of <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> on overall business performance is not certain. The concept of <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> has natural application to manufacturing concerns, significantly more so than to financial services companies such as life insurers. The uncertainty pertaining to the worth of <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> in a life insurance company is therefore even greater. The study examines the literature for evidence of the impact that <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> has on business performance and uses the findings from the literature to construct an empirical study in Momentum Group Limited, a South African life insurer. The literature does not conceptualise <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> as a definitive construct. There is however evidence of many concepts related to <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> and their impact on business performance was investigated in the literature review. The findings from the literature indicate that improvements to several components of business performance can be expected from <b>value</b> chain <b>management,</b> as well as a commensurate improvement in overall business performance. The empirical study was conducted with reference to the <b>value</b> chain <b>management</b> model that was implemented by Momentum for a specific customer group. A separate value chain was constructed by Momentum to service the needs of specialist investment brokers, and the activities in the value chain were aligned accordingly. The empirical study assessed the implementation success of this model, the improvement in business performance and the preferred organisational structur...|$|R

The complete concept of <b>Value</b> Based <b>Management</b> has a very broad scope and is designed to support an organisation in aligning the business strategy, business processes and decisions in order to create maximum value for its stakeholders. In order to get an understanding of the way the business is organized, to identify the most sensitive value drivers and to determine their impact on the creation of value, it is essential to qualitatively or quantitatively model the organization.
