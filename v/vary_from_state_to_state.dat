5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state,</b> it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E

25|$|The United States {{is one of}} few industrialized {{countries}} to have laws criminalizing adultery. In the United States, laws <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> Up until the mid 20th century most U.S. states (especially Southern and Northeastern states) had laws against fornication, adultery or cohabitation. These laws have gradually been abolished or struck down by courts as unconstitutional. Pennsylvania abolished its fornication and adultery laws in 1973.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{foster home}} {{licensing}} requirements <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state,</b> but are generally overseen by each state's Department of Child Protective Services or Human Services. In some states, counties have this responsibility. Each state's services are {{monitored by the}} federal Department of Health and Human Services through reviews such as Child and Family Services Reviews, Title IV-E Foster Care Eligibility Reviews, Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System and Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System Assessment Reviews.|$|E
25|$|As of 2013, Medicaid is {{a program}} {{intended}} for those with low income, but a low income {{is not the only}} requirement to enroll in the program. Eligibility is categoricalâ€”that is, to enroll one must be a member of a category defined by statute; some of these categories include low-income children below a certain wage, pregnant women, parents of Medicaid-eligible children who meet certain income requirements, and low-income seniors. The details of how each category is defined <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

25|$|Unlike Medicare, {{which is}} solely a federal program, Medicaid {{is a joint}} federal-state program. Each state {{operates}} its own Medicaid system, but this system must conform to federal guidelines {{in order for the}} state to receive matching funds and grants. The matching rate provided to states is determined using a federal matching formula (called Federal Medical Assistance Percentages), which generates payment rates that <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state,</b> depending on each state's respective per capita income. The wealthiest states only receive a federal match of 50% while poorer states receive a larger match.|$|E
25|$|Elections to the Senate {{are held}} on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, Election Day, and {{coincide}} with elections for the House of Representatives. Senators are elected by their state as a whole. In most states (since 1970), a primary election is held first for the Republican and Democratic parties, with the general election following a few months later. Ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> The winner is often the candidate who receives a plurality of the popular vote. In some states, runoffs are held if no candidate wins a majority.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 Republican presidential {{primaries}} {{were the}} selection processes in which voters of the Republican Party elected state delegations to the Republican National Convention. The national convention then selected its nominee {{to run for}} President of the United States in the 2012 presidential election. There were 2,286 delegates chosen, and a candidate needed to accumulate 1,144 delegate votes at the convention to win the nomination. The caucuses allocated delegates to the respective state delegations to the national convention, but the actual election of the delegates were, many times, at a later date. Delegates were elected in different ways that <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> They could be elected at local conventions, selected from slates submitted by the candidates, selected at committee meetings, or elected directly at the caucuses and primaries.|$|E

25|$|Often, {{masturbation}} in {{the sight}} of others is prosecuted under a general law such as public indecency, though some laws make specific mention of masturbation. In the UK, masturbating in public is illegal under Section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847. The penalty may be up to 14 days in prison, depending on a range of circumstantial factors. In the US, laws <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> In 2010, the Supreme Court of Alabama upheld a state law criminalizing the distribution of sex-toys. In the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, masturbating in public is a class 3 misdemeanour. In 2013, a man found masturbating openly on a beach in Sweden was cleared of charges of sexual assault, the court finding that his activities had not been directed towards any specific person.|$|E
25|$|Several {{countries}} such as Ireland, Latvia, Estonia, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Portugal, Singapore, Italy, Indonesia, India, Lithuania, Chile, Spain, Iceland, United Kingdom, Slovenia, Turkey and Malta have legislated against smoking in public places, often including bars and restaurants. Restaurateurs have been permitted in some jurisdictions to build designated smoking areas (or to prohibit smoking). In the United States, many states prohibit smoking in restaurants, and some also prohibit smoking in bars. In provinces of Canada, smoking is illegal in indoor workplaces and public places, including bars and restaurants. As of 31 March 2008 Canada has introduced a smoke-free law ban in all public places, as well as within 10 metres of an entrance to any public place. In Australia, smoke-free laws <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> Currently, Queensland has completely smoke-free indoor public places (including workplaces, bars, pubs and eateries) as well as patrolled beaches and some outdoor public areas. There are, however, exceptions for designated smoking areas. In Victoria, smoking is restricted in railway stations, bus stops and tram stops as these are public locations where second-hand smoke can affect non-smokers waiting for public transport, and since 1 July 2007 is now extended to all indoor public places. In New Zealand and Brazil, smoking is restricted in enclosed public places including bars, restaurants and pubs. Hong Kong restricted smoking on 1 January 2007 in the workplace, public spaces such as restaurants, karaoke rooms, buildings, and public parks (bars which do not admit minors were exempt until 2009). In Romania smoking is illegal in trains, metro stations, public institutions (except where designated, usually outside) and public transport.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there is}} no single test for this nexus at an {{international}} level. Some states use the concept of domicile, others nationality, and the remainder citizenship; also, definitions of domicile <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> That methodology has thus never been accepted outside the US. Also, if the litigants are from different states, relying on one personal law rather than another may be arbitrary. To cope with that difficulty, Currie advocated that the lex fori should be applied whenever his method produced what he called a [...] "true conflict".|$|E
2500|$|States are not {{required}} to participate. Those that do must comply with federal Medicaid laws under which each participating state administers its own Medicaid program, establishes eligibility standards, determines the scope and types of services it will cover, and sets the rate of payment. [...] Benefits <b>vary</b> <b>from</b> <b>state</b> <b>to</b> <b>state,</b> and because someone qualifies for Medicaid in one state, it does not mean they will qualify in another. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) monitors the state-run programs and establishes requirements for service delivery, quality, funding, and eligibility standards.|$|E
