Different concrete mixes with different coarse aggregates (both type and size) were conducted. Moreover different shapes and sizes of Vane probes were investigated.

The results reveal that the <b>Vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> with modified blades can be simply executed to measure workability of concrete anywhere with a good efficiency. Useful equations with good correlation coefficients are established between the well known standard tests include compacting factor, slump, VeBe and flow tests and the Vane yield method.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The field <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common in situ tests to obtain the {{undrained}} shear strength of soft clay. Uncoupling of the torque generated by the soil resistance along the vertical and horizontal planes of the vane has been done by conducting conventional direct shear test and newly developed vertical direct shear test on the soil. From the shear stress-displacement relationship of the direct shear tests, simple analysis is performed to simulate the field vane behavior at various depths. The results of the simulation agree well with those obtained from the field vane tests on soft Bangkok clay. The conventional method of computing the undrained shear strength of the field vane shear based on the maximum torque is close to the equivalent average value from the shear box tests. A special laboratory triaxial vane apparatus was also used to study the shear-ing behavior of the soft clay with the capability of Ko-consolidating the sample before conducting the <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> The results of the triaxial vane tests were also compared with the predictions.

40|$|The <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> <b>test</b> is {{a method}} of {{determining}} the in-situ undrained strength and remolded shear strength of cohesive soils. During the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> <b>test,</b> an increasing torque is applied until the surrounding soil goes to failure. When the torque at failure is known, the shear strength can be determined {{by means of an}} idealized and simplified formula which correlates torque and <b>shear</b> strength. Previous <b>tests</b> have shown that several aspects of cohesive soil material behavior such as anisotropy, strain softening (progressive failure) and strain rate, which are not incorporated in the simplified formula, affect the measured strength from the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> <b>test.</b> This implies that the interpretation of the undrained shear strength from the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> <b>test</b> is more complicated than the simplified and idealized formula used today. In this report, numerical simulations have been conducted in Plaxis 2 D and Plaxis 3 D in order to investigate to which extent progressive failure (softening), anisotropy and strain rate affect the measured strength from the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> <b>test.</b> The material models used were Mohr-Coulomb, Geofuture Soft Clay (a user defined material model developed by NTNU) and the total stress based NGI ADP model. The Mohr-Coulomb material model was applied in Plaxis 2 D and 3 D {{to determine the effects of}} progressive failure. From the Mohr-Coulomb simulations conducted, the effect of progressive failure from the 2 D and 3 D simulations were 2 % and 4 % respectively. The simulations conducted seem to suggest that the effect of progressive failure can be neglected when using the Mohr-Coulomb material model.

40|$|The shear {{strength}} of a material is generally measured via tests orientated in the vertical direction only due to accessibility issues in the field or to minimise the cost of laboratory testing.

Industry practice is to instead assume all soil materials are isotropic and utilise factors of safety to allow for any departure from the adopted strength value.

So it’s necessary to carry out the treatments of dehydration and drying for decreasing the wa-ter content. The objective {{of this study is to}} follow the natural drying evolution of the sediments by their mechanical characterization. Through the analysis of the physical and chemical properties (grading nature, moisture content, limits of Atterberg and organic matter content) of studied sediments, characterization of shear strength was carried out taking account the influence of water content. The relatively long process of natural drying is depending on the time and by the relation of Su-W which is established by two methods of testing in laboratory. This paper consists of the presentation of results performed with fall-cone test (FCT) and <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> (VST) on dam and marine sediments. Relationship between water content and undrained shear strength obtained from fall cone and from <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> is evaluated and given.

With all forces acting on the cylinder estimated, penetration depths are predicted from simple equations of motion for a single particle. Comparisons to experimental results show reasonable agreement between model predictions and measurements. The XBP studies follow the same methodology in investigating the soil shearing resistance as a function of penetration depth and velocity by finite element analyses.

Axi-symmetric conditions were simulated by these tests. Based on the test results, the performance of PVD in accelerating the consolidation process is quantified. The model test results are back-analysed using the finite difference method, in order to give an indication of an appropriate numerical modeling process which can be used to model other instances of similar process. In addition, the effect of sample size and the duration of the load increment period on consolidation in peaty clay is investigated. Tests were carried out in three different sizes of specimen dimensions. Values of c, were calculated by several methods found in the literature, after carrying out tests using different load increment periods. Load increment periods for different sample thicknesses were calculated according to Terzaghi theory, for time simulation tests. The time necessary to obtain a specified degree of consolidation was calculated by an appropriate equation. The values of c, obtained by these methods are of the same order for the time simulation tests. The secondary compression index of the peaty clay is found to be very high. The improvement of shear strength in peaty clay due to consolidation is also investigated. Shear strength of peaty clay was measured at the end of laboratory tests and the results were compared with the strength of sample taken prior to consolidation. Soil strength after the treatment was evaluated by undrained triaxial <b>tests,</b> <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> and consolidated drained triaxial tests. Soil strength before the treatment was evaluated only by <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> as sample preparation with the soft soil was not possible. Gain in shear strength in peaty clay due to consolidation is quantified...|$|R

The strength estimates are based on known in situ stresses and soil parameters derived from laboratory testing. The model may be applied, for example, in obtaining theoretical estimates of conventional undrained <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> strengths for comparison with field data and for use in stability analyses. However, the model incorporates a correction factor μv, analogous to Bjerrum 2 ̆ 7 s field <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> strength correction factor μ, intended to compensate for pore-pressure and shearing-rate effects. This correction factor must be evaluated before reliable torque or shear strength estimates {{can be made in}} any given case. To facilitate this, the paper presents correlations of μv with both liquid limit and plasticity index, based on world-wide data from clays and silts. The correlations are compared with independent data from Norwegian clay...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Algerian margin is a seismically active region, where {{during the}} last century, several large {{magnitude}} earthquakes took place. This study combines geotechnical and sedimentological data with numerical modelling to quantitatively assess the present-day slope stability of the Algerian margin. Geotechnical laboratory tests, such as cyclic triaxial tests, oedometric <b>tests</b> and <b>vane</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out on sediment cores collected on the study area. The liquefaction potential of a sediment column located about 30 km from the Boumerdès earthquake epicentre of 21 st May 2003 was evaluated theoretically for an earthquake of M w = 6. 8. We show that thin sand and silt beds such as those described on recovered sediment cores are {{the main cause of}} sediment deformation and liquefaction during earthquakes. Numerical calculations showed that the slope failure may occur during an earthquake characterised by a PGA in excess of 0. 1 g, and also that, under a PGA of 0. 2 g liquefaction could be triggered in shallow silty-sandy deposits. Moreover, comparison of the predicted slope failure with failure geometries inferred from seafloor morphology showed that earthquakes and subsequent mass movements could explain the present-day morphology of the study area...|$|R
