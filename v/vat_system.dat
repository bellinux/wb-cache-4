25|$|The {{advantage}} of the <b>VAT</b> <b>system</b> over the sales tax system is that under sales tax, the seller has no incentive to disbelieve a purchaser who says {{it is not a}} final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has no incentive to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive to deduct input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding an invoice quoting the VAT paid on the purchase, and indicating the VAT registration number of the supplier.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study evaluated <b>VAT</b> <b>systems</b> (Penumbra, Alameda, California) in a consecutive series of 30 patients with ALI.

The primary endpoint was improvement in blood flow across a lesion by improvement in Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score that was adapted to peripheral arteries. Concomitant balloon angioplasty or stent placement in addition to VAT was considered a complementary treatment. Additional thrombectomy treatments, such as thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, were considered technical failures. Target lesions were grouped anatomically into above-the-knee (ATK) or below-the-knee (BTK) lesions. RESULTS In 30 patients, 33 lesions (ATK, n = 13; BTK, n = 20) were treated.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the definitions of}} the main taxable events for the Value-Added Tax (VAT) based on a comparative approach to thelegislation of different countries (Spain, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Peru). In this regard, it analyzes which legislations offer definitions according {{to the principles of}} generality, fiscal neutrality and legal certainty for VAT. Moreover, it points out that the <b>VAT</b> <b>systems</b> of those countries do not require as a condition for the configuration of the taxable events that the transactions involve a «value added» or a final consumption. In the specificcase of «supplies of goods», the <b>VAT</b> <b>systems</b> have a similar definition of the taxable event, although there are a few differences. However, in the case of«supplies of services», which is the most important taxable event for VAT, there are important differences at the time each country defines it. This is not a desirable effect for the international trade of services, since the lack of harmonization produces double taxation or double non taxation...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "value-added tax" [...] {{has been}} criticized as the burden of it falls on {{personal}} end-consumers of products. Some critics consider {{it to be a}} regressive tax, meaning that the poor pay more, as a percentage of their income, than the rich. Defenders argue that relating taxation levels to income is an arbitrary standard, and that the value-added tax is in fact a proportional tax in that people with higher income pay more in that they consume more. The effective progressiveness or regressiveness of a <b>VAT</b> <b>system</b> can also be affected when different classes of goods are taxed at different rates. To maintain the progressive nature of total taxes on individuals, countries implementing VAT have reduced income tax on lower income-earners as well as instituted direct transfer payments to lower-income groups, resulting in lower tax burdens on the poor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Financial {{services}} {{have generally been}} exempt under value-added tax (<b>VAT)</b> <b>systems</b> due to the inability to identify the appropriate tax base, which is hidden in the financial margin. A cash-flow VAT approach represents one means of defining this tax base {{in a way that}} is compatible with credit-invoice VATs. This paper describes the use of a cash-flow VAT for a banking deposit/loan operation and indicates the practical difficulties blocking use of the full cash-flow method. It then describes a variant of the cash-flow system, referred to as the “Truncated Cash-Flow Method with Tax Calculation Account,” which is designed to overcome these difficulties. One of the most difficult areas in the operation of value-added tax (<b>VAT)</b> <b>systems</b> has been the treatment of financial services. A workable method of taxing such services has eluded tax authorities for decades. As a conse-quence, almost all the countries employing a VAT have opted to exempt financial services rendered to residents of their countries. Although the exemption approach has been widely adopted, there have been significant problems in its operation. The resulting tax cascading creates numerous economic distortions and adversely affects the competitive position of domestic institutions in international markets, while the definitions and allocations needed to operate the system have proven to be very complex. This paper presents an approach to applying a VAT to financial services that is designed to operationalize the cash-flow method. The cash-flow method has been considered a conceptually sound method of applying a VAT to financial services with some attractive attributes in the context of credit-invoice <b>VAT</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the method has also been seen to exhibit several fundamental difficulties, which have kept it from being used except in a few limited situations. The approach suggested here is designed to overcom...|$|R
40|$|Apportionment {{of input}} VAT and the {{mechanisms}} {{used to calculate}} apportionment have been a challenging issue {{since the inception of}} the Value-Added Tax Act No. 89 of 1991 in South Africa. This requirement to apportion input VAT has particular relevance to the retail industry due to the increase in the extension of credit which results in the receipt of taxable supplies (ordinary sales) and exempt supplies (interest income). As retailers are therefore making mixed supplies, they are required to apportion the input VAT paid on expenses. At present the standard method for input VAT apportionment in South Africa is the turnover basis however this method is not perceived as equitable by credit retailers. After an in-depth analysis of the retail industry in South Africa, its relevance to the South African economy and the impact of the requirement to apportion input VAT using the turnover method on listed companies within the South African retail industry, this paper analyses the treatment of VAT apportionment by the South African Revenue Service {{within the context of the}} Value-Added Tax Act No. 89 of 1991 and relevant South African case law. Recommendations for South Africa are then sought by studying the mechanisms for input VAT apportionment used in countries with <b>VAT</b> <b>systems</b> similar to that of South Africa. Included in this study are those countries which employ traditional <b>VAT</b> <b>systems</b> such as European Union member states and Mexico; and those countries which have implemented modern <b>VAT</b> <b>systems</b> such as New Zealand, Singapore, Australia and Canada. In addition, alternative approaches to address the root cause of the requirement to apportion input VAT used internationally are researched to the extent that these mechanisms have application to the retail industry in South Africa...|$|R
