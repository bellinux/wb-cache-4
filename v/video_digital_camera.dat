40|$|Kinematics {{studies the}} change of {{position}} of the body segments in space during a speci- fied time: motion is described quantitatively by linear and angular variables. The data are displayed graphi- cally. In this preliminary study the kinematics parameters at trot of an Italian horse breed are considered, {{in order to develop}} an objective method for gait analysis in field condition. Six Bardigiano mares were considered. Fourteen markers were glued {{on the left side of}} the standing mares at previously defined skel- etal reference points. The recordings were made using a <b>video</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> and analyzed using the SIMI Motion System. The obtained joint angle-time diagrams are similar to those found by other authors in other breeds. A horse showed an elbow motion diagram quite different from the others. The data were compared with judges scores. This study is a first step to obtain a reliable method for gait evaluation in this breed...|$|E
40|$|Automatic Fingerprint Recognition System (AFIS) mainly {{depends on}} the quality of the {{fingerprint}} captured during the enrollment process, even though a lot of techniques developed in literature for fingerprint matching, all most all system is influenced or affected by the quality of acquisition method. Automated fingerprint identification system requires fingerprint images in a special format. Normally it can't receive and process the photographic image or photo taken from virtual camera or cell camera. There are many special acquisition or sensing strategies to extract the ridge-and-valley structure of finger skin or fingerprint. Traditionally, in law or regulation enforcement packages, fingerprints were especially received offline. Fingerprint acquisition can be specially classified into groups as an offline and live scan. An offline acquisition technique gets input through inked affect of the fingertip on paper and digitized with the aid of the paper with an optical scanner or <b>video</b> <b>digital</b> <b>camera.</b> The live acquisition is received through the sensor that is having the ability to directly digitize the sensing tip of the finger. As the fingerprint sensing, image processing, signal processing, and communication technology advance, an increasing number of new technologies in this acquisition technology are arriving at the main facet. In this paper, we discuss different types of fingerprint acquisition technologies, which involve optical, ultrasonic, capacitance, passive capacitance, and active capacitance. This paper helps to identify new fingerprint acquisition technology...|$|E

Still <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> are less expensive because they have far less processing power and memory capacity than <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras.</b> Even with these limitations, some still <b>digital</b> <b>cameras</b> are also capable of capturing sequential images, such as a burst image. Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for interactively creating a VIDEO from one or more still images...|$|R

In {{clinical}} gait analysis gait events, such as {{initial contact}} and toe off, {{are needed for}} biomechanical data normalization and for several temporal/distance parameters estimation.

40|$|Color demosaicking of {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) data has been thoroughly studied for single-sensor still <b>digital</b> <b>cameras.</b> However, there has seemingly been little research on color demosaicking techniques for single-sensor <b>video</b> <b>digital</b> <b>cameras.</b> The temporal dimension of a color mosaic image sequence can reveal new {{information on the}} missing color components due to the mosaic subsampling, which is otherwise unavailable in the spatial domain of individual frames. This paper proposes a temporal approach to color demosaicking. A pixel of the current frame is matched to another in a reference frame via motion analysis, such that the CCD sensor samples different color components of the same object position in the two frames. The resulting inter-frame estimates of missing color components are fused with suitable intra-frame estimates to achieve a more robust color restoration. Our experimental results demonstrate clear advantages of the presented temporal color demosaicking approach over its intra-frame counterparts in reducing the color artifacts.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple but yet an {{effective}} new method for the problem of <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> identification. It is known that after an exposure time of 0. 15 seconds, the green channel is the noisiest of the three RGB colour channels [5]. Based on this observation, the <b>digital</b> <b>camera</b> pattern noise reference, which is extracted using only the green channel of the frames and is called Green-channel Photo Response Non-Uniformity (G-PRNU), is exploited as a fingerprint of the camera. The green channels are first resized to a standard frame size (512 x 512) using bilinear interpolation. Then the camera fingerprint is obtained by a wavelet based denoising filter described in [4] and averaged over the frames. 2 -D correlation coefficient {{is used in the}} detection test. This method has been evaluated using 290 video sequences taken by four consumer <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> and two mobile phones. The results show G- PRNU has potential to be a reliable technique in <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> identification, and gives better results than PRNU...|$|R
