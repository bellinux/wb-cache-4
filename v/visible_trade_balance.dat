(Economic Development and Policy Issues) The {{response}} of the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> to changes in currency movements has gained increasing interest among researchers, especially {{since the fall of}} the Bretton Woods system. Previous empirical studies that examined the {{response of}} the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> to exchange rate changes in South Africa employed aggregate trade data and provided mixed results. This dissertation uses disaggregated data with specific focus on the manufacturing sector. The purpose is to investigate the short and long run effects of the real exchange rate of the rand on the South African manufacturing <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> by adopting the elasticity approach of balance of payments adjustment. Using quarterly data from 1995 to 2010, the study seeks to test the existence of the J-curve effect and to show whether the Marshal–Lerner condition holds in the manufacturing sector. Johansen cointegration and vector error correction modelling techniques are employed in attaining the objectives of this study. In addition, impulse response functions are used to determine how the manufacturing <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> responds following shocks in its main determinants. The results show that real effective exchange rate (REER), real domestic and foreign income levels are important long run determinants of the manufacturing <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> and that a long run equilibrium relationship exists among these variables. A long run negative relationship was found between the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and the REER and between the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and real domestic income.

The results suggest that the bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> real exchange rate, domestic and foreign incomes are cointegrated. In the long-run, Malaysia's bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> are found to be responsive to the changes of bilateral exchange rate in the cases of the USA and Singapore but irresponsive for Japan. There is a clear evidence of the J-curve effect only in the case of Malaysia's <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> with the United States. The results also indicate that devaluation tends to be recessionary. The findings suggest that Malaysia could use undervalued exchange rate strategy to improve its <b>trade</b> <b>balances</b> with the United States and Singapore but not Japan. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{is to determine the}} causes of the countercyclicality of the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> in five small open economies, namely Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. In order to investigate the role of permanent and temporary changes in income in the determination of the <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> Blanchard-Quah variance decomposition procedure is applied. The results of analysis support the conclusion that transitory income shocks are major reasons for the change in the <b>trade</b> <b>balance,</b> and that negative correlation between the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and income is primarily due to transitory shocks. Thus, these results are more consistent with intertemporal models with the dichotomous view in which the aggregate demand shocks are responsible for cyclical variations in the <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> and income and aggregate supply is responsible for the long-run growth of the economy. ...|$|R
