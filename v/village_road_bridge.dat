50|$|The {{development}} of the shrine has been augmented by the passage of national highway (NH7) through the <b>village.</b> A <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> built in 1950s helped trading between Telangana and Rayalaseema regions of the Andhra Pradesh.

50|$|The {{eastern end}} of the bridge terminates at the town of Puqian with the western end at a small island {{containing}} a few villages including Hou Xi <b>Village.</b> A <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> is being constructed to connect the short distance between {{the western end of}} the island and a peninsula, the western shore of Dongzhai Harbour. Another main road is being constructed to connect the tip of this peninsula to Haikou.|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} earlier in Section 1, different public investment projects {{should be expected}} to have different implications on the urban–rural wage gap, and the cost of migration in the Yigong-daizhen villages. In particular, productivity improving projects such as irrigation system improvement, drainage system improvement, soil improvement, small-scale water conservation and terrace construction projects may be viewed productivity improving, potentially narrowing the urban–rural wage gap. Other programs such as <b>road</b> and <b>bridge</b> construction may be seen more as migration cost reducing. To account for program-specific heterogeneity across Yigong-daizhen projects, we will do two groups of comparisons. In the first group, we compare the impact of Yigong-daizhen projects on migration between villages with five types of ‘productivity improvement’ projects and villages that lack ‘productivity improvement’ projects. In the second group, we compare the impact of Yigong-daizhen projects between <b>villages</b> with <b>road</b> and <b>bridge</b> construction projects, and as such, are more likely to experience migration cost reduction, and <b>villages</b> without <b>road</b> and <b>bridge</b> construction projects during the survey periods.|$|R

5|$|The {{depression}} in the time affected several cities and parishes in Jamaica and Cuba, along with causing significant rainfall in southern Florida. Jamaica was the area hardest hit by the depression, claiming the lives of six people and causing about $1.802 million (1987 USD, $3 million in 2009 USD) in damage. The depression caused floods that washed out <b>villages,</b> <b>roads</b> and <b>bridges</b> and caused dozens of landslides on the island. The island also had several rivers overflow including the Rio Minho and Rio Dogna. The damage caused by the tropical depression was comparable to previous flood in June 1986.|$|R
50|$|The most passionate players {{involved}} {{over the}} years have built two medieval <b>villages</b> with <b>roads,</b> <b>bridges,</b> ditches, houses and inns at the Duché de Bicolline venue. Construction days are scheduled throughout spring and summer for those building new houses. These houses are built to resemble medieval buildings and to be as decorum as possible. Players are responsible for their own buildings and must follow standards of construction. With two villages that are composed of one hundred and ninety buildings, and more being added each year, Bicolline is making itself {{out to be one of}} the largest immersion medieval venues in the world. The demand for construction on the site is so great that the owner of Bicolline spends all year controlling applications, validating the plans for buildings, ensuring that projects are feasible, and so on.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} about 3 mi from Northampton town centre, {{close to the}} A45 trunk road which heads east to Wellingborough and Peterborough. The busy A45 also connects to {{junction}} 15 of the M1 London to Yorkshire Motorway {{by way of a}} flyover which eliminated a dangerous crossing of the main road. The motorway is adjacent to the south-west side of the <b>village</b> and a <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> connects Collingtree to the adjacent village of Milton Malsor, about a mile west in the South Northamptonshire Council area. Central London is about 64 mi south and it is about 64 mi south-east of Birmingham.|$|R
5000|$|Between {{this road}} {{crossing}} and the paired villages of Eastleach Martin and Eastleach Turville {{is the point}} at which the bourn becomes an all year river. Here it is crossed by a stone slab clapper bridge on a footpath close to a wide marshy area. A small spring rises close to the bridge. By the time the river passes between the Eastleach villages, each with their parish churches just a few hundred yards apart, the Leach has become a [...] "proper" [...] river, several yards (metres) wide. Between the <b>villages</b> a <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> and another [...] "clapper" [...] footbridge cross the river. It passes another old mill between the Eastleaches and Southrop (pronounced [...] "Suth-er-op") then skirts the hamlet of Fyfield. At the bridge at Southrop it divides into several channels, making a very attractive effect. From Southrop, the Leach forms the border between Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire.|$|R

40|$|Abstracts: We find various loading {{standards}} for bridges {{in different countries}} {{based on their own}} contexts. In the context of Nepal, the <b>road</b> <b>bridges</b> have been designed adopting the various codes. Many of the bridges have been designed based on IRC and AASHTO standards. Nepal Road Standard (NRS 2027), has adopted the IRC and AASHTO loadings. The NRS covers loadings for the highway and feeder roads. The standard does not cover the loading {{standards for}} rural roads in Nepal. Now we have more than 20, 000 km rural roads. This paper tries to review the live load standards which are being adopted in design of bridges in Nepal and recommend the live loads suitable for the <b>bridges</b> in rural <b>roads</b> specifically for district <b>roads</b> and <b>village</b> <b>roads.</b> For rural <b>bridges,</b> individual truck loading may be relevant rather than the train of loading. The 24 R IRC loading may be an appropriate loading for rural bridges in Nepal. This represents a heavy vehicle plying in rural roads in Nepal. 1...|$|R
30|$|Panel B of Table  8 {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} of ‘reducing cost’ as a mechanism of Yigong-daizhen projects. A dummy for “costs reduction” equals to one for <b>villages</b> with <b>road</b> and <b>bridge</b> construction projects during 1998 – 2002. These villages {{are more likely to}} experience migration cost reduction through better connectivity to neighbor cities and villages. The dummy equals to zero in villages without such type of projects. Similar to panel A, the dummy is interacted with the difference in difference term to measure the difference of Yigong-daizhen’s impact in villages with and without ‘costs reduction’ projects. Again, all the pairwise interactions and three main effects are included in the regressions.|$|R
