40|$|Fires {{in three}} P 3 {{aircraft}} oxygen systems have occurred: {{one in the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1984 and two in the U. S. Navy in 1998 and 2003. All three fires started in the aluminum manifold and check valve (MCV) assembly and produced similar damages to the aircraft in which they occurred. This paper discusses a failure analysis conducted by the NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Oxygen Hazards and Testing Team on the 2003 U. S. Navy VP 62 fire. It was surmised that the fire started due to heat generated by an oxygen leak past a silicone check <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> or possibly because of particle impact near the seat {{of one of the}} MCV assembly check valves. An additional analysis of fires in several check valve poppet seals from other aircraft is discussed. These burned poppet seals came from P 3 oxygen systems that had been serviced at the Naval Air Station (NAS) in Jacksonville following standard fill procedures. It was concluded that these seal fires occurred due to the heat from compression heating, particle impact, or the heat generated by an oxygen leak past the silicone check <b>valve</b> <b>seal.</b> The fact that catastrophic fires did not occur in the case of each check <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> fire was attributed to the protective nature of the aluminum oxide layer on the check valve poppets.

40|$|AbstractParasitoid wasps {{from the}} insect order Hymenoptera can be {{deployed}} successfully as biological control agents {{for a number}} of pests, and have previously been introduced for the control of corn pest insect species from the Lepidopteran genus Ostrinia. Organs on the ovipositor of parasitoid wasps have mechanical and tactile senses that coordinate the complex movements of egg laying, and the ovipositor of Hymenopteran insects have evolved associated venom glands as part of their stinging defense. The ovipositor of parasitic wasps has evolved an additional function as a piercing organ that is required for the deposition of eggs within suitable host larvae. The morphology and ultrastructure of sense organs on the ovipositor and sheath of Macrocentrus cingulum Brischke (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) are described using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Three types of sensilla trichodea were shown to be abundant on the outer sheath of the ovipositor, with types II and III being most distal, and the inner surface of the ovipositor covered with microtrichia, more densely near the apex.

40|$|The Rotating Cylinder Valve (RCV) Engine {{is a novel}} 4 {{cycle engine}} that is a {{practical}} alternative to conventional 2 and 4 stroke designs, in particular for small capacity single cylinder applications. It is primarily intended to address applications where emissions legislation is forcing manufacturers to abandon the traditional carburetted 2 stroke. It has particular benefits for the moped/light motorcycle market. The engine operates on a simple principle. The cylinder liner is rotated around the piston at half engine speed via a pair of bevel gears. A port {{in the side of}} this cylinder indexes with inlet and exhaust ports in the surrounding casing. This rotary valve serves the cylinder as the engine cycles through the conventional 4 stroke cycle. The main technical issue that has been addressed is the design of a practical rotary <b>valve</b> <b>seal.</b> The RCV seal design provides a gas-tight compression seal, accommodates large thermal distortions, and takes up both production tolerance and longer term wear. The design is low cost, and simple to assemble and service. The rest of the components within the engine are conventional. The RCV engine offers all the normal emissions advantages that a 4 stroke has over a conventional 2 stroke. It also has many benefits compared to a conventional poppet valve 4 stroke, in particular a predicted production cost comparable to a conventional 2 stroke. The design has other significant technical benefits, including excellent thermal distribution, and good breathing characteristics. For moped applications the rear wheel power output of the engine will be competitive with current 2 stroke designs and exceeds the power output of typical small capacity poppet valve 4 stroke designs...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the threat}} of {{terrorism}} involving toxic gasses, Draeger Safety, manufacturers of Breathing Apparatus (BA), found that the lung demand <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> on their BA may loose integrity if exposed to particular gases over time. Watson managed a ‘design-with’ collaborative approach to fully understand the needs of the medical/safety professionals and the various international testing and certificating bodies. This led to an innovative solution involving an elastomeric baffle which could be stretched over the valve, directing the wearers exhaust air in a controlled path around the exterior of the product ensuring that the air around the seals was constantly moving, preventing build up of corrosive toxic gas. Having worked on previous medical design research products, looking at pulmonary function and lung targeted drug delivery, for clients such as Profile Therapeutics and AstraZeneca, Watson was able to apply these principles to the exhaust function of the wearer to eliminate the build up of gasses. Hewitt provided industrial design input to the project. The Draeger Lung Demand Valve (LDV) ‘Boot’ highlighted the value of design thinking as opposed to a more traditional engineering-led approach.

40|$|Background: Following {{successful}} voice restoration after laryngectomy {{either by}} a voice prosthesis, a surgical shunt or microvascular laryngoplasty, a further goal in rehabilitation is {{the insertion of}} a tracheostoma valve, which enables the patient to speak without using his fingers for closure of the tracheostoma. One important disadvantage of the tracheostoma valves, which are available today, is the necessity of removal of the valve in case of coughing, because the valve could be thrown from the stoma by the strong air flow during coughing. As many laryngectomees suffer from chronic bronchitis, this coughing problem {{is one of the}} reasons why only few patients could be provided with this useful aid. Method: At the department of biomedical engineering of the faculty of medicine at the university of Groningen, the Netherlands, 1994 two prototypes of a tracheostoma Valve with an integrated cough lid were developed. These devices contain two separate valve systems: the normal speaking valve and a special coughing valve, which opens at a certain air flow and closes automatically after the coughing attack. Thus no manipulations are necessary during coughing, the patient can speak undisturbed. The ADEVA company (Lubeck, Germany) undertook the industrial production of this new type of tracheostoma valve creating different modifications of the prototype # 2. Patients:ln four series with 6 - 8 patients per group the modified tracheostoma valves were tested clinically and the occurring faults or lack of correct function eliminated by small changes in the production. Results: Meanwhile a suitable model for routine use is available, which was tested in 30 patients so far. This suitability was achieved by improvements in the valve mechanism, the <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> and the adjustment mechanisms for the individual pressure level of the speaking and the coughing valve. Conclusion: The newly developed tracheostoma valve with integrated coughing lid (Window((R)), ADEVA((R)) -medical Company, Lubeck, Germany) provides further improvement in speech rehabilitation of laryngectomees. The low acceptance of tracheostoma valves, which enable the patient to speak without using his fingers for closure of the tracheostoma, possibly may be raised by this new aid...|$|E
40|$|It is {{advantageous}} for gas-fed pulsed electric thrusters {{to employ}} pulsed valves so propellant is only flowing to the device during operation. The propellant {{utilization of the}} thruster will be maximized when all the gas injected into the thruster is acted upon by the fields produced by the electrical pulse. Gas that is injected too early will diffuse away from the thruster before the electrical pulse can act to accelerate the propellant. Gas that is injected too late will miss being accelerated by the already-completed electrical pulse. As a consequence, the valve must open quickly and close equally quickly, only remaining open for a short duration. In addition, the valve must have {{only a small amount}} of volume between the sealing body and the thruster so the front and back ends of the pulse are as coincident as possible with the valve cycling, with very little latent propellant remaining in the feed lines after the valve is closed. For a real mission of interest, a pulsed thruster can be expected to pulse at least 10 (exp 10) - 10 (exp 11) times, setting the range for the number of times a valve must open and close. The valves described in this paper have been fabricated and tested for operation in an inductive pulsed plasma thruster (IPPT) for in-space propulsion. In general, an IPPT is an electrodeless space propulsion device where a capacitor is charged to an initial voltage and then discharged, producing a high-current pulse through a coil. The field produced by this pulse ionizes propellant, inductively driving current in a plasma located near the face of the coil. Once the plasma is formed, it can be accelerated and expelled at a high exhaust velocity by the electromagnetic Lorentz body force arising from the interaction of the induced plasma current and the magnetic field produced by the current in the coil. The valve characteristics needed for the IPPT application require a fast-acting valve capable of a minimum of 10 (exp 10) valve actuation cycles. Since even 10 (exp 9) cycles is well above anything demonstrated, this lower value was selected as the design point for the present work. The <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> must remain leak-tight throughout operation, and the body must maintain a low internal leakage at relatively high operating temperatures. The full set of design requirements used for this program are summarized in Table 1. In this work, we describe two pulsed gas valves that have been fabricated to have long lifetime and demonstrate the characteristics listed above. The first is a miniaturized, conventional electromagnet-based valve while the second is a piezoelectric-based valve design. The conventional valve, shown in Fig. 1, is opened by use of a solenoid electromagnetic actuator. When current is applied to the solenoid coil, magnetic forces pull the plunger away from the valve seat, allowing fluid to flow through the valve. Removal of electrical current permits the spring and fluid pressure to seat the plunger, halting the flow of fluid. The valve body is fabricated from 304 L corrosion resistant steel (CRES) and while the parts that form the magnetic circuit are fabricated from 430 CRES. This material does not have optimum magnetic properties, but its corrosion resistance permits incorporation into a design without requiring an additional plating process. A viton O-ring compound (Parker V 0884 - 75), selected for its mechanical strength at elevated temperatures, was used for the valve seat seal. The design was based solely on the use of analytical sizing calculations, as opposed to a more rigorous finite element analysis. While this valve is small and relatively lightweight, it does not represent a design that is optimized for mass and/or a given volume envelope. The piezoelectric valve is a "puller" valve design. Applying a voltage to the piezo crystal causes it to elongate and pull a pintle off the seat, opening the valve. The <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> consists of the pintle with an external, spherically-formed tip fabricated from Inconel 625 and the seat fabricated from Inconel 718 and possessing a spherical surface that permits the pintle to align with the valve body centerline after each cycle, maintaining the circumferential metal-on-metal seal. The contact stress on the valve pintle is expected in the worst case to be 96. 5 MPa (14 ksi), which is well below the work hardening value of 413. 7 MPa (60 ksi) for Inconel 615. Results presented in this work will compare the performance of each valve, both {{to each other and to}} the valve design requirements given in Table 1. In general, both valves meet all the performance envelope requirements, but the piezoelectric valve consumes considerably less power and has a faster response time over the conventional solenoid-driven valves...|$|E
