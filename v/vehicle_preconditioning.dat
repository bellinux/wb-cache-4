40|$|European Type {{approval}} procedure defines a synthetic driving cycle (the NEDC) over which one vehicle per type {{has to be}} tested. Euro 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 differ (beside <b>vehicle</b> <b>preconditioning</b> and warm-up procedures introduced since Euro 3) only because limits for the different pollutants have been progressively lowered. This paper analyses {{through a number of}} experimental tests on spark-ignition cars, a hybrid and a conventional vehicle, the driving conditions responsible for most of the emissions and assesses how such conditions are reproduced by the type approval test. The engine conditions mostly responsible for emissions are: warm-up phase, full loads and transients. Only the warm-up is well covered by the NEDC for vehicles with more than 35 kW/ton power-weight ratio. Tests performed with the Honda Hybrid (the low environmental impact vehicle) and with the Alfa Romeo 147 1. 6 (the conventional vehicle) showed how on the NEDC most emissions are produced in the warm up phase and are of the same order of magnitude for both cars while on more realistic driving cycles (ARTEMIS cycles have been used here) the capacity of the Hybrid to mitigate the transients effects results in a much lower emission rate. Full load conditions are not kept under control by the Hybrid as by the conventional vehicle when the O 2 exhaust sensor is disabled and the air-fuel ratio is no more stoichiometric. Even though this paper has not tested all possible vehicles types, it shows that European type {{approval procedure}} has some weaknesses in accounting for the main causes of vehicle emissions. Any new procedure addressing better transients and full load conditions would help the diffusion of low emission vehicles like hybrids more than progressively lowering the allowed emission thresholds on current type approval procedure.

Dennoch bleiben Biokraftstoffe die wichtigste Alternative zu fossilen Kraftstoffen. Die Autoren diskutieren die Rolle der Biokraftstoffe im Verkehrssektor heute und in der Zukunft. Biofuels {{have been}} the only {{alternative}} fuel which has substantially contributed to supplying transport with energy. Biofuels enjoyed broad support, but now they have come under criticism. In order to obtain answers {{to the question of what}} role biofuels could play in the future fuel mix, the following aspects are analysed: competing uses of scarce biomass and biofuels; sustainability of biofuels, standards and certifi cation schemes; types and availability of biofuels; potentials for bioenergy and biofuels; and the technical compatibility of biofuels with <b>vehicles.</b> Finally, <b>preconditions</b> and necessary policy measures for the increased deployment of sustainable biofuels are examined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTen European {{laboratories}} {{worked together}} to study {{the influence of a}} lot of parameters of the measurement of light vehicle emission factors on vehicle bench, in order to improve the accuracy, reliability and representativeness of emission factors: driving patterns (driving cycles, gear choice behaviour, driver and cycle following), vehicle related parameters (technical characteristics of the vehicle, emission stability, emission degradation, fuel properties, <b>vehicle</b> cooling and <b>preconditioning),</b> <b>vehicle</b> sampling (method, sample size), and laboratory related parameters (ambient temperature and humidity, dynamometer setting, dilution ratio, heated line sampling temperature, PM filter preconditioning, response time, dilution air). The results are based on literature synthesis, on about 2700 specific tests with 183 vehicles and on the reprocessing of more than 900 tests. These tests concern the regulated atmospheric pollutants and pre-Euro to Euro 4 vehicles. We did not find any influence of 7 parameters, and find only a qualitative influence for 7 other parameters. 6 parameters have a clear and quantifiable influence and 5 among them allow us to design correction factors to normalise emission measurements: gearshift strategy, vehicle mileage, ambient temperature and humidity, dilution ratio. The sixth influencing parameter is the driving cycle, sometimes more significant than the fuel or the emission standard. The results allow us to design recommendations or guidelines for the emission factor measurement method...|$|R
40|$|Background: Short-term dietary {{restriction}} (DR) without malnutrition preconditions against surgical {{stress in}} rodents; however, the nutritional basis and underlying nutrient/energy-sensing pathways remain poorly understood. Objectives: We investigated the relative contribution of protein restriction (PR) vs. calorie restriction (CR) to protection from renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) {{and changes in}} organ-autonomous nutrient/energy-sensing pathways and hormones underlying beneficial effects. Methods: Mice were preconditioned on experimental diets lacking total calories (0 – 50 % CR) or protein/essential amino acids (EAAs) vs. complete diets consumed ad libitum (AL) for 1 wk before IRI. Renal outcome was assessed by serum markers and histology and integrated over a 2 -dimensional protein/energy landscape by geometric framework analysis. Changes in renal nutrient/energy-sensing signal transduction and systemic hormones leptin and adiponectin were also measured. The genetic requirement for amino acid sensing via general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN 2) was testedwith knockout vs. controlmice. The involvement of the hormone leptin was tested by injection of recombinant protein vs. <b>vehicle</b> during the <b>preconditioning</b> period. Results: CR-mediated protectionwas dose dependent up to 50 %withmaximal 2 -fold effect sizes. PR benefitswere abrogated by EAA re-addition and additive with CR, with maximal benefits at any given amount of CR occurring with a protein-free diet. GCN 2 was not required for functional benefits of PR. Activation and repression of nutrient/energy-sensing kinases, AMP...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral {{ischemia}} elicits a {{wide range}} of events, including complex activation of various intracellular signaling pathways. This study aims to investigate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the activation pattern of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in reponse to focal cerebral ischemia. Furtermore, the functional roles of the p 38 MAPK and the Src family kinases (SFKs) are investigated with specific signal transduction inhibitors in the rat in vivo. VEGF was found upregulated in several cell types including neurons, glia and vascular cells after both permanent and transient cerebral ischemia. VEGF-receptor 1 (VEGFR 1) was expressed in a similar manner, while VEGFR 2 expression was more restricted and confined to endothelial cells and glia. The main MAPK pathways, including extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p 38, were differentially activated by cerebral ischemia. ERK activation was present in blood vessels, suggesting a potential role in neovascularization. JNK was also activated in blood vessels in the infarcted hemisphere, possibly reflecting an interaction with ERK, whereas p 38 activity was absent in vessels. In neurons, ERK was activated in cortical cells up to days of survival, while no substantial JNK or p 38 activation was seen in ischemic neurons. Invading macrophages showed distinct activation of p 38 and to some extent also JNK but not ERK. Glia showed activation of all MAPK to a variable extent. Pretreatment with the p 38 -inhibitor SB 203580 before transient cerebral ischemia (ischemia-reperfusion) was investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The experiment group suffered worse infarcts and blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage than controls, which contrasts to previous studies. The results might be attributed to interference with protective effects of the <b>vehicle</b> or with <b>preconditioning</b> mechanisms. The SFK-inhibitor PP 2 significantly reduced infarct size after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, which is consistent with previously reported effects in permanent ischemia. Due to the multifunctional role of SFKs, it cannot be easily concluded in exactly what cellular context(s) SFKs are of importance to cerebral ischemia. In conclusion, the VEGF and MAPK systems of extra- and intracellular signaling are activated in focal cerebral ischemia. Manipulation of p 38 as well as SFK in vivo can influence the course of transient cerebral ischemia, which may be of significance {{to the understanding of the}} pathology of cerebral ischemia and to the development of therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend towards}} low-floor trams which {{appeared}} during the recent decades brought up {{a variety of different}} solutions in vehicle design. Usually the operators preferred the 100 % low-floor vehicles, paying particular respect to disabled passengers. These trams have a constant floor height of not more than 350 mm throughout the whole <b>vehicle.</b> An indispensable <b>precondition</b> for this is to abandon the wheelsets and the principle of placing the drive motors between the wheels. Thus all according vehicle designs have independent wheels instead of the previously used conventional wheelsets. Moreover, the 100 % low-floor design reduces drastically the maximal yaw angle of the bogies. In order to allow appropriate yaw movements within the vehicles, the carbodies had to be split into a number of articulated sections, with the motor and trailer bogies nearly fixed to them. In consequence the different drivetrain solutions became numerous. This thesis analyses and compares characteristic designs of multi-articulated trams that have been acquired by a large number of tram operators: the Combino and Variobahn design. In addition the 70 % low-floor, conventional motor bogie-based tram type Cologne is analysed, which has also been acquired in large numbers. The analyses were mainly performed by means of multibody simulation and were focused on• the running behaviour in tangent track,• the permissibility of the current track design regulations with regard to the derailment safety, and• the passenger comfort in curve entry transitions. For the latter analysis a general distinction was made between two design variants: on the one hand the curve entry for tracks within the street, without transition and superelevation ramp, {{and on the other hand}} the curve entry for autonomous tracks with curve transition and superelevation ramp. The results showed that the running behaviour in tangent track is satisfactory for all vehicles, and there is no increase in the derailment risk, either. However, the analyses showed also that each of the vehicles exceeds the jerk limits defined by the according VDV regulation. It could also be shown that there is an inadequacy in the regulation criterion for the comfort in curve transitions. The latest operational and biomechanical experience demonstrates that the main comfort criterion is not the jerk but rather the frequency of the lateral oscillations, the mean lateral acceleration – considered over a period of 2 s – and the product of the lateral acceleration in the curve at the moment of maximal jerk and the reaction time of the passengers. The consequences which are relevant for the running dynamics are:• The current track design regulations can be retained without exceptions, as long as the vehicle concept and the bogie design are appropriate. • The operators’ guidelines concerning door arrangement and vehicle capacity must not have negative influences on the running dynamics, the derailment safety and the comfort of passengers and staff. • When the choice of the curve radius is restricted by existing buildings then the track design parameters must be chosen in a way that the running safety is not endangered in any operational condition. • The definition of limit values for lateral acceleration, jerk and permissible human exposure to mechanical vibrations should be brought to a safe basis by means of multidisciplinary discussions with experts in medicine, biomechanics, physiology and vehicle design...|$|R
