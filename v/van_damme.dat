5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Damme</b> {{redesigned}} {{his final}} fight with Stallone, with the latter's approval. <b>Van</b> <b>Damme</b> {{was unhappy with}} the scripted fight, which had his character running away and only a brief confrontation between the pair.

5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude <b>Van</b> <b>Damme</b> star. Woo got along with <b>Van</b> <b>Damme</b> during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that <b>Van</b> <b>Damme</b> was up for it.|$|E
5|$|A year later, he {{made his}} feature film debut in the action film Double Team {{alongside}} Jean-Claude <b>Van</b> <b>Damme</b> and Mickey Rourke. The film was critically panned and his performance earned him three Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst New Star, Worst Supporting Actor and Worst Screen Couple (shared with <b>Van</b> <b>Damme).</b> Rodman starred in Simon Sez, a 1999 action/comedy and co-starred with Tom Berenger in a 2000 action film about skydiving titled Cutaway. In 1998, he joined the cast of the syndicated TV show Special Ops Force, playing 'Deke' Reynolds, a flamboyant but skilled ex-Army helo pilot and demolitions expert.|$|E

5|$|He opened 2005 with {{a second}} win in the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup. He won his first World Cross Country Championship medal soon after, {{finishing}} second to Bekele to take silver at the 2005 edition. On the track, he recorded a 5000m personal best of at the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha, and qualified to compete at the World Championships in both the 5000 and 10,000m. At the 2005 World Championships, he broke the national record in the 10,000 m final, but his time of 27:12.82 was only enough for sixth. The 5000 m final held little reprieve for the Eritrean as he finished in second last position. He ended the season on a positive note, however, improving his 10,000m best to 27:04.70 at the Memorial <b>Van</b> <b>Damme,</b> and winning the Great North Run with a world best time of 59:05 – which was only his second outing over the half marathon distance.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 Shaw Brothers film Brothers {{from the}} Walled City {{is set in}} Kowloon Walled City. The 1984 gangster film Long Arm of the Law {{features}} the Walled City as a refuge for gang members before they are gunned down by police.

The 1992 non-narrative film Baraka features several highly detailed shots of the Walled City shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film Crime Story starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted Walled City, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film Batman Begins {{was inspired by the}} Walled City. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film Re-cycle features a decrepit, nightmarish version of the Walled City, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee.

5000|$|Critics {{were mixed}} on Timecop, citing its various plot holes and inconsistencies. Roger Ebert called Timecop a low-rent Terminator.

[...] David Richards of The New York Times disparaged <b>Van</b> <b>Damme's</b> acting and previous films but called Timecop [...] "his classiest effort to date". Timecop holds a 43% and 5.2/10 average rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews, with 17 fresh reviews and 23 rotten. The site's consensus is: [...] "It's no Terminator, but for those willing to suspend disbelief and rational thought, Timecop provides limited sci-fi action rewards." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} meeting of the 2011 IAAF Diamond League, at the Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix, he won the 200 m with a time of 20.06 seconds. Dix took further 200m {{victories}} at the Eugene and London legs of the series, while Usain Bolt won the other three 200m mid-season legs. He achieved a 100/200 sprint double at the 2011 USA Track and Field Championships, winning in the absence of Tyson Gay and Wallace Spearmon. Running in both the events at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, he first secured the silver medal in the 100m final – defending champion Bolt was disqualified for a false start and Dix was runner-up to another Jamaican, Yohan Blake, in a comparatively slow 10.08 seconds. In the 200-meter final Bolt beat the field but Dix was the closest to him, running 19.70 seconds to take his second silver of the tournament. He attempted to gain a third medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay final, but a mid-race collision between Darvis Patton and Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey meant the American team's baton never reached Dix's final leg. At the Diamond League 200m final at the Memorial <b>Van</b> <b>Damme</b> he ran a personal best of 19.53 seconds. Blake was even faster (19.26), however, leaving Dix in second place even as he became the fourth fastest 200m runner of all-time and then won the league series.|$|E
