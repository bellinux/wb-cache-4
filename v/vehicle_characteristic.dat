40|$|There is {{evidence}} linking certain <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> to crash involvement and one possible mechanism behind {{this relationship is}} that these <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> infuence drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking behaviour. In order to investigate this, we conducted a roadside observation survey and a questionnaire-based study. Both revealed {{a significant relationship between}} vehicle performance and drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking behaviour. The causal direction of this relationship has important consequences. If drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk taking predicts their car choice, then it could be justifiably argued that individuals who take more risks when driving simply choose more powerful vehicles to facilitate their behaviour. However, if it is the case that <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> adversely influence drivers 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking propensity then this has implications for vehicle design. Results indicated that the causal pathway operates independently in both directions. Finally, we sought to determine which <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> influenced risk-taking intentions independently of other confounded characteristics. We found that high vehicle performance and a greater number of safety features led independently to greater intended risk taking in general, while higher internal car noise led to closer car following and more risky gap acceptance, but not to greater speed.

Market projections indicate a need for fleets of transports with supersonic or greater cruise speeds by the year 2000 to 2005.

Analyses led to a focus on the most promising vehicle concepts. These were concepts that used a kerosene-type fuel and cruised at Mach numbers between 2. 0 to 3. 2. Further systems study identified the impact of environmental constraints (for community noise, sonic boom, and engine emissions) on economic attractiveness and technological needs.

40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International To {{acquire a}} new fleet of vehicles, Army decisionmakers must {{consider}} many conflicting requirements including {{the needs of}} users, the vehicle’s life cycle implications in terms of reliability, maintainability, and survivability, and the design and production capabilities of the contractor. Army decision-makers choose appropriate <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristic</b> targets to maximize military objectives within an acquisition budget. This budgetary constraint is especially important when costly new technology is considered. Once product characteristic targets are decided, contractors bid for the design and production contract. This approach is limited if the military does not directly account for the contractors ’ design capabilities when targeting specific vehicle characteristics. This limitation can result in {{the inability of the}} winning contractor to meet {{some or all of the}} product targets, leading to costly delays in product delivery and potentially sub-optimal performance. An analytical tool that captures the tradeoffs among military objectives and models the design capabilities of suppliers can aid decision-makers during the acquisition process. This article builds on the Analytical Target Cascading methodology by developing extensions of Analytical Target Setting to facilitate requirements validation, developing acquisition decision models, and examining a case study for dual-use technology. These methods use comprehensive vehicle simulation models, which represent the contractor’s design capabilities, to drive vehicle target setting decisions. Conclusions will be drawn from previous research applied in the commercial sector to show how the military can take advantage of formalizing the links between engineering design decisions and non-technical decisions to reduce risk and improve quality of the final product...|$|E
40|$|A core {{political}} strategy for reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from road transportation in Germany is to incentivize the purchase of motor vehicles with relatively low tailpipe CO 2 emissions. Consequently, since mid- 2009, owners of new cars in Germany face an annual vehicle circulation tax that is partially levied according to vehicles' CO 2 emission index. In this paper, I estimate the effect of CO 2 -based vehicle circulation taxation in Germany on annual CO 2 combustion emissions from passenger cars and CO 2 climate costs using a nested logit approach on a novel panel-dataset containing registration, cost and <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristic</b> information on approximately 7, 000 unique vehicle models and approximately 19. 5 million new vehicle registrations in Germany from 2007 to 2013. This approach first yields vehicle model specific estimates for the elasticity of new vehicle registrations {{with regard to the}} circulation tax. These elasticities are used to estimate changes in new vehicle registrations by model, which are then combined with model-specific CO 2 emission factors and segment-specific annual distances driven to yield total emission changes attributable to the change in vehicle circulation tax. Finally, physical changes in emissions are converted into changes in monetary climate damages. Uncertainty in the elasticity of new vehicle registrations by segment with regard to vehicle circulation tax, the fuel economy and corresponding CO 2 emission indices of vehicles, distances traveled by market segment, and in the monetary damages resulting from CO 2 emissions are propagated through the analysis. Overall I find statistically significant, but relatively small reductions in CO 2 emissions and climate costs due to the change in taxation: When simulating the ceteris paribus effect of the most stringent taxation regime implemented in 2014 on the pre-tax change models available in 2008, median registrations are estimated to decrease by approx. 9, 500 vehicles, or 0. 3 per cent of total new registrations. In addition, changes in registrations of individual vehicle models within each market segment lead to a relatively small reduction of segment- specific CO 2 emission indices (0. 03 to 0. 1 per cent across segments). The reduction in new registrations and reduction in CO 2 emission indices decrease median CO 2 combustion emissions from newly registered vehicles by 35, 000 t (90 per cent confidence interval: 31. 000 to 39. 000 t), and climate costs by 2 ̆ 0 ac 1. 1 Million (90 per cent confidence interval: 2 ̆ 0 ac 0. 1 to 2. 2 Million), or 0. 4 per cent of total CO 2 emissions and climate costs from newly registered cars...|$|E
40|$|Kinematic and Compliance (K&C) {{parameters}} are used today {{to design and}} evaluate suspension systems in road vehicles. The reason for using K&C parameters to design and evaluate suspension systems are that the handling, steering and ride characteristics of the full vehicle are highly dependent on these parameters. Due to the complex nature of the overall vehicle system, the task of quantifying {{the effect of a}} single K&C parameter on the full <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> is considered a challenging but highly desirable task. This thesis suggests a method {{that can be used to}} investigate and map the different K&C parameters effect on the full <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> by means of full vehicle simulations done in simulation software with data collected from real vehicles measured at a K&C measurement rig. By means of this thesis it was found that the developed method could be used to identify and quantify individual K&C parameters effect on the full <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics.</b> To further improve the accuracy of the results and get a more complete mapping of the effects of K&C parameters on the full <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> more <b>vehicles</b> should be measured and included to get a wider, more accurate test range for each K&C parameter.

30|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is another factor mentioned by McKinnon [34] {{and also by}} Wu and Dunn [68]. This is the ratio of distance travelled to energy consumed and depends on <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics,</b> driving behaviour, and traffic conditions. With regard to <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics,</b> McKinnon [34] states that <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> show potential for decreased environmental impact. However, although Aronsson and Huge-Brodin [2] also suggest that more energy efficient technology {{is a way to}} reduce environmental impact, they mean that this method alone so far has proven insufficient. The EEA [12] also concludes that technology is one way of reducing CO 2 emissions, but that this alone {{will not be able to}} solve the problem. The potentially decreased environmental impact can be accomplished through for example engine and exhaust systems, aerodynamic profiling, reduction in vehicle tare weight and improved tyre performance [34], which in turn can be triggered by raising legal limits on vehicle weights and sizes [33]. Weijers et al. [63] agree that buying new vehicles that pollute less can be part of LSPs offerings.

40|$|Since 2000 many European {{countries}} have revised their car taxation. Most countries {{now have a}} CO 2 component in the tax they levy on acquisition, ownership or both. This thesis analyzes {{the effect of these}} changes on the average CO 2 emissions of new cars, {{with the use of a}} reduced-form panel regression model including fixed effects and a structural equation model (SEM). In the reduced-form model outcome, acquisition tax is the only tax variable that is significant at 10 % and it is also strongest in size. The SEM takes into consideration car characteristics as a mediator. Its results confirm and clarify the previous finding. While all <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics</b> have a significant effect on CO 2, only acquisition tax and gasoline price significantly work through the mediating <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics.</b> However, they do so through different modes. Acquisition taxes seem to shape the consumer’s choice of engine power (kW), while gasoline prices determine the share of diesel cars that are purchased. Ownership taxes based on CO 2 significantly reduce CO 2 intensity, but there is no significant effect that works through the <b>vehicle</b> <b>characteristics.</b> In order to achieve lower average CO 2 emissions of their car fleet, policy makers are advised to implement both CO 2 based ownership and acquisition taxes, which is not currently the case for all European countries...|$|R
