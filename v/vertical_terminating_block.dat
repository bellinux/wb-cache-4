50|$|Modern 110 blocks largely supplanted 66 {{blocks for}} new {{commercial}} installations {{at the end}} of the 20th century, as the capability for a circuit to carry digital data overlaid its ability to carry analog voice conversations. 110 block termination is almost always Category 5 (or higher) compliant, and capable of supporting 100 MHz (or faster) signaling. Compared to 110 and higher-density wire <b>terminating</b> <b>blocks,</b> 66 blocks are physically large; and because of their maximum 16 MHz Category 3 signaling compatibility, they are ill-suited for high speed (faster than 10BASE-T) data circuits. However, special Category 5e Certified 66 blocks are available from manufacturers such as Siemon which meet all standards for Cat5e termination.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the present state of}} the {{full-scale}} laboratory at the Vienna University of Technology. Regarding 1 : 1 simulations in the lab simple and quick-performance solutions for all of the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>terminating</b> planes (walls, ceiling and planes) are a prerequisite. Therefore, the development of an experimental level is illustrated first by implementing the Meroform-System. Then the working material of Lego-like building bricks is described. Thereafter, the possibilities resulting from the present laboratory infrastructure are considered by means of projects having already been performed. Finally, the medium-term extension plan for the experimental space within the Vienna Full-Scale Lab is presented and combined applications of different simulation techniques are enumerated...|$|R

40|$|Polyurethanes {{based on}} a 50 / 50 copoly(L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone) {{prepolymer}} and butanediisocyanate were made. Chain extending a diisocyanate terminated prepolymer with butanediamine was not possible due to the susceptibility of the lactide bond to aminolysis. Chain extension with butanediol resulted in a polymer with poor mechanical properties due to transesterification. When the copolymer prepolymer was chain-extended with an isocyanate <b>terminated</b> <b>block,</b> transesterification with the chain-extender was avoided and the mechanical properties were increased. When {{the length of the}} hard segments was increased the mechanical properties increased further. A L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone based polyurethane with a tensile strength and modulus of respectively 45 MPa and 60 MPa was made. The polymer contained no poly(L-lactide) crystals and was easy to process. Compared to the high molecular weight 50 / 50 copoly(L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone) the polyurethane showed better mechanical properties, is expected to have the same adhesive properties and is expected to have a slower degradation rate. These factors makes this polymer excessively useful for in-vivo tissue engineering in for instance meniscal reconstruction material, nerve guide and artificial skin...|$|R

5000|$|After {{a line of}} type was {{assembled}} {{into the}} stick a special blocking slug was inserted to seal the end. Then the stick was placed mold side down into the slot on the table, a clamp locked down to securely hold the stick and the Ludlow activated. The plunger would snap down into the pot with considerable force, injecting molten type metal into the mold at {{a high rate of}} speed to ensure the mold was filled before the metal solidified. If the stick was not properly filled out or mounted firmly, or the special <b>terminating</b> <b>block</b> was forgotten, a dreaded [...] "splash" [...] would result, often encasing the operator's toes in molten lead and leaving a mess that needed to be peeled off the Ludlow surfaces. Operators were encouraged to wear heavy boots with steel toes and be quick at removing one. It was also not uncommon for some of the type metal to be projected up onto the ceiling, no matter the height. As with the Linotype / Intertype machines, the Ludlow machines were often fitted with metal feeders to keep the pot filled to optimum level.|$|R
50|$|Unlike network firewalls, many {{personal}} firewalls {{are able}} to control network traffic allowed to programs on the secured computer. When an application attempts an outbound connection, the firewall may block it if blacklisted, or ask the user whether to blacklist it {{if it is not}} yet known. This protects against malware implemented as an executable program. Personal firewalls may also provide some level of intrusion detection, allowing the software to <b>terminate</b> or <b>block</b> connectivity where it suspects an intrusion is being attempted.|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} {{properties of}} block copolymer E 18 B 10 {{in aqueous solution}} have been studied.

The samples had E <b>blocks</b> <b>terminated</b> by methoxy groups but B <b>blocks</b> <b>terminated</b> either with hydroxy or with methoxy groups. Surface tensiometry {{was used to determine}} the critical micelle concentrations of the samples at several temperatures and thereby values of the enthalpy of micellization.

40|$|A {{range of}} {{metathesis}} substrates was assembled from triplets of unsaturated building blocks. The approach involved the iterative attachment of a propagating and a <b>terminating</b> building <b>block</b> to a fluorous-tagged initiating building block. Metathesis cascade chemistry {{was used to}} “reprogram” the molecular scaffolds. Remarkably, in one case, a cyclopropanation reaction competed with the expected metathesis cascade process. Finally, it was demonstrated that the metathesis products could be derivatised to yield the final products. At each stage, purification was facilitated {{by the presence of}} a fluorous-tagged protecting group...|$|R
5|$|Architectural styles evolve {{and change}} {{to suit the}} {{requirements}} of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect Henry Flitcroft, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his refacing of Buckingham Palace in 1913. Often the <b>terminating</b> <b>blocks</b> would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very {{far removed from the}} designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.|$|R

A short distance later, Route 41 comes in from the west and becomes concurrent with Route 154 for a short distance. Passing some large businesses in Ellisburg, a part of Cherry Hill, Route 41 and Route 154 intersect with Route 70, where Route 154's designation terminates.|$|R
