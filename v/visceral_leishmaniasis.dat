25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause <b>visceral</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having <b>visceral</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because <b>visceral</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of <b>visceral</b> <b>leishmaniasis.</b> CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis. Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop <b>visceral</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> a second time. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARYThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} blood meals of female sandflies captured in the municipality of Governador Valadares, an endemic area of <b>visceral</b> and cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis,</b> in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. From May 2011 to January 2012, captures were performed using HP light traps in four districts. There were 2, 614 specimens (2, 090 males and 524 females) captured; 97 engorged females were identified belonging to the species Lutzomyia longipalpis(82. 1 %) and Lutzomyia cortelezzii(17. 9 %). Considering simple and mixed feeding, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed a predominance of chicken blood (43. 6 %) in Lutzomyia longipalpis, showing the important role that chickens exert around the residential areas of Governador Valadares. This finding increases the chances of sandflies contact with other vertebrates and consequently the risk of leishmaniasis transmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{elimination}} of intracellular pathogens, such as Leishmania, requires a Th 1 type immune response, whereas a dominant Th 2 response leads to exacerbated disease. Experimental human zinc deficiency decreases Th 1 but not Th 2 immune response. We investigated if zinc and copper levels differ in different clinical forms of leishmaniasis, and if these trace metals {{might be involved}} in the immune response towards the parasite. Blood was collected from 31 patients with either localized cutaneous (LCL), mucosal (ML) or <b>visceral</b> (VL) <b>leishmaniasis,</b> as well as from 25 controls from endemic and non-endemic areas. Anti-Leishmania humoral and cellular immune response were evaluated by quantifying specific plasma IgG, lymphoproliferation and cytokine production, respectively. Plasma levels of Cu and Zn were quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A significant decrease in plasma Zn was observed in all three patient groups (p ML) immune response. Ex vivo production of parasite-induced IFN-gamma was negatively correlated to plasma Cu levels in LCL (r = - 0. 57, p = 0. 01). In vitro, increased Cu levels inhibited IFN-gamma production. 1. Zn deficiency in VL and ML indicate possible therapeutic administration of Zn in these severe forms of leishmaniasis. 2. Plasma Cu positively correlates to humoral immune response across patient groups. 3. Environmentally or genetically determined increases in Cu levels might augment susceptibility to infection with intracellular pathogens, by causing a decrease in IFN-gamma production...|$|R
