25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier (often op-amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifier</b> with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output.

25|$|Electronic {{amplifiers}} use {{current or}} voltage as input and output, so {{four types of}} amplifier are possible (any of two possible inputs with any of two possible outputs). See classification of amplifiers. The objective for the feedback amplifier may be {{any one of the}} four types of amplifier and is not necessarily the same type as the open-loop amplifier, which itself may be any one of these types. So, for example, an op amp (<b>voltage</b> <b>amplifier)</b> can be arranged to make a current amplifier instead.|$|E
25|$|Below, {{the voltage}} gain of the {{amplifier}} with feedback, the closed-loop gain AFB, is derived {{in terms of}} the gain of the amplifier without feedback, the open-loop gain AOL and the feedback factor β, which governs how much of the output signal is applied to the input (see Figure 1). The open-loop gain AOL in general may be a function of both frequency and voltage; the feedback parameter β is determined by the feedback network that is connected around the amplifier. For an operational amplifier, two resistors forming a voltage divider may be used for the feedback network to set β between 0 and 1. This network may be modified using reactive elements like capacitors or inductors to (a) give frequency-dependent closed-loop gain as in equalization/tone-control circuits or (b) construct oscillators. The gain of the amplifier with feedback is derived below {{in the case of a}} <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifier</b> with voltage feedback.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{conductive}} channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} offset {{correction}} techniques for <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifiers</b> and {{is divided into}} two different parts: 1) mismatch and 2) offset correction techniques. First a literature study is done on the subject mismatch with specially focus on the future. Mismatch of a transistor is determined by the mismatch factors σVT and σβ which are depend strongly on the inverse square root of the effective gate area. For these mismatch factors a future expectation will be given. The outcome is that the mismatch factors σVT and σβ will increase significantly if the transistor downscaling process continues. Also a deeper insight will be given about the amount of contribution of these mismatch parameters to the offset current of a transistor. Because the matching accuracy of the currents in the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> determines mainly the sensitivity of this special <b>amplifier.</b> <b>Voltage</b> sense <b>amplifiers</b> are used extensively in memories. For this reason a short paragraph about the memory architecture is written for more background information. Basically what the sense amplifier does is detecting the information which is located in the memory cells. This information is read out and results in a small voltage difference between two bitlines. The sense amplifier evaluates this small voltage difference and converts it into a logic level output signal. A basic <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> is the starting point in the further research to offset correction techniques. Different offset correction techniques are investigated and applied to this <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> First all the techniques are tuned to get the best performance in sensitivity. Then in the second step the different offset correction techniques are optimized in speed. Finally a comparison is made based on all the results. In this way the best offset correction techniques for the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> are found. The following offset correction techniques are investigated: threshold cancellation, β offset reduction, metastable offset correction and calibration. Threshold cancellation is an already known technique which is used often by <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifiers.</b> β offset reduction is also not new, but the technique is not really elaborated in practice realizations in the past. The metastable offset correction technique is a new designed technique which has some similarities with the threshold cancellation technique. Calibration is a general offline technique which adjusts the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> to a very sensitive system. Threshold cancellation cancels the threshold voltages of the two most important transistors in the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> Short circuit connections are applied to these transistors to find the real threshold voltages. These threshold voltages are measured and stored in capacitors. The capacitors are put in serial with the gates of the two transistors to cancel the threshold voltages. The technique operates quite well but is not really suitable for the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> if a high speed is required. β offset reduction uses a technique which turns on lightly the correct transistor during the decision of the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> Other transistors which could have β mismatch are turned on later when the decision is already made by the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> In this way the offset current due to only β offset can be reduced significantly. β offset reduction is a very simple technique which has a reasonable sensitivity. Furthermore the technique operates at high speed and does not have large power consumption. The metastable offset correction technique uses the metastable property of the two inverters in the sense amplifier. The two inverters in the sense amplifier are set into metastable states before the sense amplifier makes a decision. In this way the inverters are compensated for the offset. One of the inverters goes out the metastable state when a memory cell is read out and a decision is enforced by the sense amplifier. The technique is very suitable for the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> and gives good results in sensitivity and speed...|$|R
