5|$|Bismuth <b>vanadate</b> is an opaque yellow pigment in artists' oil and acrylic paint. This {{compound}} is a non-toxic lightfast {{substitute for}} lemon yellow pigments {{such as the}} cadmium sulfides and the lead/strontium/barium chromates. Unlike lead chromate+lead sulfate lemon, bismuth <b>vanadate</b> does not readily blacken with UV exposure.|$|E

50|$|Most fuels contain small {{traces of}} {{vanadium}}. The vanadium is oxidized to different <b>vanadates.</b> Molten <b>vanadates</b> present as deposits on metal can flux oxide scales and passivation layers. Furthermore, {{the presence of}} vanadium accelerates the diffusion of oxygen through the fused salt layer to the metal substrate; <b>vanadates</b> can be present in semiconducting or ionic form, where the semiconducting form has significantly higher corrosivity as the oxygen is transported via oxygen vacancies. Ionic form in contrast transports oxygen by diffusion of the <b>vanadates,</b> which is significantly slower. The semiconducting form is rich on vanadium pentoxide.|$|R
40|$|The solvothermal {{method for}} the {{synthesis}} of mixed iron and bismuth <b>vanadates</b> was proposed. Physicochemical properties of the obtained samples: oil absorption, pH of the aqueous extract, particle size, density, – were determined. Electrochemical studies ofthe inhibitory properties of <b>vanadates</b> relative to the steel substrate were conducted. It is established that the received mixed iron and bismuth <b>vanadates</b> {{may be used in}} the paint industry as a replacement for lead-bearing and chromate pigments...|$|R
5|$|Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in high temperature corrosion. During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding <b>vanadate</b> compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E
5|$|In decavanadate, each V(V) {{center is}} {{surrounded}} by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species − results in the preferential formation of the octahedral + species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH<2. + is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many <b>vanadate</b> compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and <b>vanadate</b> (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
40|$|A chimie douce {{method has}} been used to prepare <b>vanadates</b> (V 5 +) of various elements, {{trivalent}} (Al, Cr, Fe, In, Y, Bi), divalent (Co, Ni), monovalent (Li, Tl), and a combination of nickel and lithium. By varying several parameters, especially the pH during the synthesis, several types of <b>vanadates</b> have been obtained ranging from orthovanadates (VO 43 -) to decavanadates (V 1 O 286 -). The pH conditions required to prepare the various <b>vanadates</b> fall nicely within the expectations of the previously reported cation charge-pH diagram...|$|R

5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium <b>vanadate</b> (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium <b>vanadate</b> dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E
5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound <b>vanadate</b> ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E

25|$|Non-silicate {{minerals}} are {{subdivided into}} several other classes by their dominant chemistry, which included native elements, sulfides, halides, oxides and hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates, borates, sulfates, phosphates, and organic compounds. Most non-silicate mineral species are rare (constituting in total 8% of the Earth's crust), although some are relatively common, such as calcite, pyrite, magnetite, and hematite. There {{are two major}} structural styles observed in non-silicates: close-packing and silicate-like linked tetrahedra. The close-packed structures, which {{is a way to}} densely pack atoms while minimizing interstitial space. Hexagonal close-packing involves stacking layers where every other layer is the same ("ababab"), whereas cubic close-packing involves stacking groups of three layers ("abcabcabc"). Analogues to linked silica tetrahedra include SO4 (sulfate), PO4 (phosphate), AsO4 (arsenate), and VO4 (<b>vanadate).</b> The non-silicates have great economic importance, as they concentrate elements more than the silicate minerals do.|$|E
500|$|It was {{originally}} discovered in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río in 1801. He called the mineral [...] "brown lead" [...] and asserted that it contained a new element, which he first named pancromium and later, erythronium. However, {{he was later}} {{led to believe that}} this was not a new element but merely an impure form of chromium. In 1830, Nils Gabriel Sefström discovered a new element, which he named vanadium. It was later revealed that this was identical to the metal discovered earlier by Andrés Manuel del Río. Del Río's [...] "brown lead" [...] was also rediscovered, in 1838 in Zimapan, Hidalgo, Mexico, and was named vanadinite because of its high vanadium content. Other names that have since been given to vanadinite are johnstonite and lead <b>vanadate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Vanadium(V) oxide {{exhibits}} {{very modest}} acute toxicity to humans, with an LD50 of about 470mg/kg. [...] The greater hazard is with inhalation of the dust, where the LD50 ranges from 4–11mg/kg for a 14-day exposure. <b>Vanadate</b> (VO43−), formed by hydrolysis of V2O5 at high pH, appears to inhibit enzymes that process phosphate (PO43−).

The solutions containing the redox mixtures, when rapidly heated at 370 °C, ignite and undergo self-propagating,gas-producing, exothermic reactions to yield fine particle metal <b>vanadates.</b> Formation of crystalline <b>vanadates</b> was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction patterns, 27 A 1 nuclear magnetic resonance, IR and fluorescence spectra...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} use of electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), 51 VNMRspectroscopy and {{ab initio}} calculations {{has been proved}} to be a powerful tool for obtaining direct information of the structure and the chemistry of peroxo <b>vanadates</b> in solutions. The analysis of acid solutions containing monoperoxo <b>vanadates</b> showed the occurrence of exchange reactions between solvent molecules in the coordination sphere of the metal. On the other hand, bisperoxo <b>vanadates</b> appear to be less prone to coordinate more than one water or alcohol molecule. The bisperoxo complex [VO 5]y in the presence of histidine and histidine-like ligands, at near neutral conditions, has been studied. Coordination of one and two molecules of ligand is observed affording [VO 5 L]y and [VO 5 L 2]y, respectively.

2500|$|As f-f {{transitions}} are Laporte-forbidden, once {{an electron}} has been excited, decay {{to the ground}} state will be slow.

40|$|Several {{classes of}} <b>vanadates</b> can be {{synthesized}} by a 'chimie douce' method, {{which consists of}} a precipitation reaction occurring at a well-defined pH. An electrochemical investigation has shown that these compounds, depending on their amorphous/crystallized nature, can react with large amounts of Li, leading to reversible capacities as large as 900 mA h/g. Both electrochemical and in situ X-ray diffraction studies suggest that a mechanism of Li uptake/removal, different from the usual Li insertion/deinsertion process, is occurring in these <b>vanadates.</b> © 1999 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the low-temperature preparation of amorphous <b>vanadates</b> of general formula RVO 4 (R = In, Cr, Fe, Al, Y), and their electrochemical properties vs. Li are reported. A dissolution-reprecipitation process from a mixed solution of NH 4 VO 3 and R(NO 3) 3 {{was used to}} prepare these compounds. By appropriate annealing of the amorphous precursors, several crystallized <b>vanadates</b> were obtained as well. Among all of these <b>vanadates,</b> either amorphous or crystallized, only those with R = In and Fe are of potential interest as negative electrodes in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries since they display reversible capacities as large as 900 mAh/g. This different electrochemical behavior depending {{on the nature of}} the metallic element implies that R is not just a spectator with respect to the Li uptake into these materials. From both electrochemical and in situ x-ray diffraction data, a mechanism of Li uptake/removal different from the usual Li insertion/deinsertion process is proposed...|$|R
