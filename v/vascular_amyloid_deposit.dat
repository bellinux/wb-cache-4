40|$|The {{presence}} of abundant intraneuronal amyloid {{in the form}} of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the brains of Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia patients and the absence of extraneuronal amyloid {{in the form of}} <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> or senile plaques permit the purification of NFT without contamination with extraneuronal amyloid. Thus, we have isolated and determined the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide subunit of the amyloid fibrils of these NFT and describe their ultrastructure. The NFT, which consist of single and paired helical filaments, similar to those of Alzheimer disease, and occasionally triple helical filaments, are composed of multimeric aggregates of a polypeptide of 42 amino acids (A 4 protein).

Furthermore, the heterogeneity, or variation in polypeptide length, of the N-terminus of the amyloid of Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia is the same as in Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome.

40|$|Background: In {{cases with}} a long (> 1 year) {{clinical}} duration of prion disease, the prion protein can form <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits.</b> These cases do not show accumulation of 4 -kDa β-amyloid, which is observed in <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, amyloid is associated with inflammation and neurofibrillary degeneration, and it is elusive whether prion amyloid is associated with these changes as well. Objectives: The presence of inflammation and neurofibrillary degeneration was evaluated in prion amyloidosis. Material and Methods: Cortical areas of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD; n = 3), young sporadic CJD (n = 4), different Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker's disease patients (n = 5) and AD cases (n = 5) were examined using immunohistochemistry and specific stainings for amyloid. Results: In both AD and prion disease cases, which were negative for 4 -kDa β-amyloid, parenchymal and <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were positive for amyloid-associated proteins such as complement protein and were associated with microglia clusters. Tau and ubiquitin were found near prion plaques {{in some of the}} Gerstmann-Strussler-Scheinker's disease and sporadic CJD cases and also near <b>vascular</b> prion <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits.</b> In variant CJD cases, occasionally, microglia clustering was found in plaques but no ubiquitin or complement proteins and hardly tau protein.

40|$|Abstract Background Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is {{characterized}} by deposition of fibrillar amyloid β (Aβ) within cerebral vessels. It is commonly seen in the elderly and almost universally present in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In both patient populations, CAA is an independent risk factor for lobar hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and dementia. To date, definitive diagnosis of CAA requires obtaining pathological tissues via brain biopsy (which is rarely clinically indicated) or at autopsy. Though amyloid tracers labeled with positron-emitting radioligands such as [11 C]PIB have shown promise for non-invasive amyloid imaging in AD patients, to date they {{have been unable to}} clarify whether the observed amyloid load represents neuritic plaques versus CAA {{due in large part to}} the low resolution of PET imaging and the almost equal affinity of these tracers for both <b>vascular</b> and parenchymal <b>amyloid.</b> Therefore, the development of a precise and specific non-invasive technique for diagnosing CAA in live patients is desired. Results We found that the phenoxazine derivative resorufin preferentially bound cerebrovascular <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> over neuritic plaques in the aged Tg 2576 transgenic mouse model of AD/CAA, whereas the congophilic amyloid dye methoxy-X 34 bound both cerebrovascular <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> and neuritic plaques. Similarly, resorufin-positive staining was predominantly noted in fibrillar Aβ-laden vessels in postmortem AD brain tissues. Fluorescent labeling and multi-photon microscopy further revealed that both resorufin- and methoxy-X 34 -positive staining is colocalized to the vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) layer of vessel segments that have severe disruption of VSMC arrangement, a characteristic feature of CAA. Resorufin also selectively visualized <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> in live Tg 2576 mice when administered topically, though not systemically. Resorufin derivatives with chemical modification at the 7 -OH position of resorufin also displayed a marked preferential binding affinity for CAA, but with enhanced lipid solubility that indicates their use as a non-invasive imaging tracer for CAA is feasible. Conclusions To our knowledge, resorufin analogs are the fist class of amyloid dye that can discriminate between cerebrovascular and neuritic forms of amyloid. This unique binding selectivity suggests that this class of dye has great potential as a CAA-specific amyloid tracer that will permit non-invasive detection and quantification of CAA in live patients. </p...|$|R

40|$|Amyloid beta (A beta), {{the major}} {{constituent}} of the fibrils composing senile plaques and <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders, is a 39 - 42 -residue self-aggregating degradation peptide {{of a larger}} multidomain membrane glycoprotein designated amyloid precursor protein (APP). An array of biological functions has been assigned to different APP domains, including growth regulation, neurotoxicity, inhibitory activity of serine proteinases and promotion of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. A beta is generated through an as-yet-unknown catabolic pathway that by-passes or inhibits the cleavage of APP within the A beta sequence. We have identified a 16 kDa intermediate APP C-terminal fragment containing A beta in leptomeningeal vessels of aged normal individuals and AD patients by means of its immunoreactivity with a panel of four different anti-(APP C-terminal) antibodies, indicating a different pathway of APP processing. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} the APP C-terminal domain is the most likely to be involved in cell-matrix interactions. A 109 -amino-acid construct C 109 with a sequence analogous to the C-terminal of APP (positions 587 - 695 of APP 695), similar in length and immunoreactivity to the 16 kDa fragment, was found to promote cell adhesion. By use of synthetic peptides, this activity was initially located to the extracellular 28 residues of A beta. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the sequence RHDS (amino acids 5 - 8 of A beta, corresponding to residues 601 - 604 of APP 695 was responsible for the adhesion-promoting activity. The interaction is dependent on bivalent cations and can be blocked either by the tetrapeptides RHDS and RGDS or by an anti-(beta 1 integrin) antibody. Thus, through integrin-like surface receptors, APP or its derivative proteolytic fragments containing the sequence RHDS may modulate cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is {{characterized}} by the deposition of congophilic material within the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels of the brain and leptomeninges. The incidence of CAA increases with aging, and in its most severe stages, the <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> causes a breakdown of the blood vessel wall which results in spontaneous, often recurrent, lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. CAA is estimated to account for four to twenty percent of all nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhages. Besides this major complication, extensive CAA has been associated with ischemic white matter damage with progressive dementia, perivascular inflammation, and secondary vasculitis. CAA occurs as a sporadic disorder in the elderly and in association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with virtually all AD patients showing some degree of <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> in addition to parenchymal plaques. There are also familial forms of CAA such as hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type (HCHWA-D). The <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> in these disorders mainly consists of β -amyloid peptide (Aβ) that is produced by proteolytic cleavage from its precursor, which is the β -amyloid precursor protein (APP). The major Aβ species that is deposited in the vasculature is Aβ 40, while parenchymal amyloid is mainly composed of Aβ 42. One major difficulty in studying CAA is that it can be definitely diagnosed only postmortem. Moreover, spontaneous CAA occurs only in old primates and dogs, both of which are not practical models to study the pathogenesis and therapy of CAA. Rodents do not spontaneously develop CAA. The purpose of this thesis was to provide useful model systems to study the pathomechanism of <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> formation and associated pathology. To this end we generated and used mice that are transgenic for human genes bearing mutations that are well known to cause either hereditary Aβ -CAA or classical familial AD. In a first study we analyzed CAA and CAA-associated pathological changes in APP 23 transgenic mice. These mice overexpress human APP bearing the Swedish K 670 N/M 671 L double mutation, a typical early-onset AD-causing mutation, {{under the control of the}} neuron-specific Thy- 1 promoter. In addition to parenchymal amyloid plaques, APP 23 mice show consistent amyloid within leptomeningeal, neocortical, hippocampal, and thalamic vessel walls. Both CAA frequency and severity significantly increase with aging, demonstrating that not only more vessels are affected, but also that the amyloid burden of individual vessels increases with the progression of amyloid deposition. Cerebrovascular amyloid causes degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In severely affected vessels, SMCs are completely replaced by the amyloid. Similar to humans, <b>amyloid</b> <b>depositing</b> APP 23 mice develop spontaneous hemorrhages, some of them being recurrent. The bleedings are associated with amyloid-laden vessels and therefore, their anatomical distribution appears very similar to that of CAA. In aged mice, a quantitative analysis revealed a positive correlation between hemorrhages and CAA. Interestingly, no significant relationship between hemorrhages and total amyloid load was observed. Occasionally, CAA-associated vasculitis is seen in animals with extensive <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid.</b> In a second study, we generated transgenic mice that express human APP E 693 Q under the control of the same neuron-specific Thy- 1 promoter (APPDutch mice) that has been used in APP 23 mice. In HCHWA-D patients, the APP E 693 Q Dutch mutation causes severe CAA with recurrent cerebral hemorrhagic strokes often leading to death early in their fifties, or to dementia in patients that survive the strokes. In contrast to AD patients that show parenchymal amyloid plaques, HCHWA-D patients exhibit few parenchymal <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits.</b> Similar to HCHWA-D, aged APPDutch mice show extensive Aβ deposits mainly within the walls of leptomeningeal vessels followed by cortical vessels. Parenchymal Aβ deposits are mostly absent. In severely affected vessels, the SMCs are completely displaced by the amyloid. In regions with CAA, fresh and old hemorrhages are observed, and activated perivascular microglia and reactive astrocytes are found. To examine the mechanism that leads to the almost exclusive <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> formation in APPDutch mice, we compared the mice with transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type (wt) human APP using the same neuronal promoter (APPwt mice). As they age, APPwt mice develop parenchymal plaques with limited <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits.</b> A biochemical analysis of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels revealed significant higher Aβ 40 : 42 ratios in <b>amyloid</b> <b>depositing</b> and pre-depositing APPDutch mice compared to APPwt mice. To demonstrate that the high Aβ 40 : 42 ratio in APPDutch mice is linked to the almost exclusive <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> deposition, we crossed APPDutch mice with mice that overexpress human presenilin- 1 bearing the G 384 A mutation (PS 45 mice) that is known to dramatically increase the production of Aβ 42. Strikingly, young APPDutch/PS 45 double-transgenic mice develop massive diffuse and compact parenchymal amyloid with only very little CAA. Thus, shifting the Aβ 40 : 42 ratio towards Aβ 42 is sufficient to redistribute the amyloid pathology from the vasculature to the parenchyma. A third series of experiments using neurografting techniques was performed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the initiation of cerebral amyloidosis in vivo. Cell suspensions of transgenic APP 23 and wild-type B 6 embryonic brain tissue were injected into the neocortex and hippocampus of both APP 23 and B 6 mice, respectively. In wild-type hosts, APP 23 grafts did not show <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> up to 20 months after grafting. Interestingly, transgenic and wild-type grafts in young APP 23 hosts develop amyloid plaques as early as three months after grafting. Although the majority of the amyloid is of the diffuse type, some compact and congophilic amyloid plaques are observed in the wild-type grafts. These congophilic amyloid lesions are surrounded by neuritic changes and gliosis, comparable to the amyloid-associated pathology that has previously been described in APP 23 mice. These results support the importance of neuronally secreted Aβ for the development of cerebral amyloidosis which can be initiated distant from the site of Aβ production, a finding that supports the observation of the above mentioned APPDutch mouse model. In summary, we demonstrate that APP 23 and APPDutch mice recapitulate CAA and CAAassociated pathology observed in humans and thus are valuable models for studying the human disease. Our results stress the importance of neuronally secreted Aβ for the development of CAA and emphasize the Aβ 40 : 42 ratio as an important factor in determining parenchymal versus <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> deposition. The understanding that different Aβ species can drive amyloid pathology in different cerebral compartments not only provides insights into the pathomechanism of sporadic and familial CAA but also has implications for current anti-amyloid therapeutic strategies...|$|R

As most Alzheimer disease cases occur well past midlife, {{the current study}} examined adoptive transfer of anti-Aβ antibodies to 19 - and 23 -month old APP-transgenic mice. Methods We investigated the effects of weekly anti-Aβ antibody treatment on radial-arm water-maze performance, parenchymal and <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> loads, {{and the presence of}} microhemorrhage in the brain. 19 -month-old mice were treated for 1, 2 or 3 months while 23 -month-old mice were treated for 5 months. Only the 23 -month-old mice were subject to radial-arm water-maze testing. Results After 3 months of weekly injections, this passive immunization protocol completely reversed learning and memory deficits in these mice, a benefit that was undiminished after 5 months of treatment. Dramatic reductions of diffuse Aβ immunostaining and parenchymal Congophilic <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were observed after five months, indicating that even well-established <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> are susceptible to immunotherapy. However, cerebral amyloid angiopathy increased substantially with immunotherapy, and some deposits were associated with microhemorrhage. Reanalysis of results collected from an earlier time-course study demonstrated that these increases in vascular deposits were dependent on the duration of immunotherapy. Conclusions The cognitive benefits of passive immunotherapy persist in spite of the presence of <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> and small hemorrhages. These data suggest that clinical trials evaluating such treatments will require precautions to minimize potential adverse events associated with microhemorrhage. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLoss of {{cortical}} {{grey matter}} is a diagnostic marker of many neurodegenerative diseases, {{and is a}} key mediator of cognitive impairment. We postulated that cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), characterised by cortical <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits,</b> is associated with cortical tissue loss independent of parenchymal Alzheimer's disease pathology. We tested this hypothesis in patients with hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis–Dutch type (HCHWA-D), a monogenetic disease with minimal or no concomitant Alzheimer's disease pathology, {{as well as in}} patients with sporadic CAA and healthy and Alzheimer's disease controls. MethodsIn this observational case-control study, we included six groups of participants: patients diagnosed with HCHWA-D using genetic testing; healthy controls age-matched to the HCHWA-D group; patients with probable sporadic CAA without dementia; two independent cohorts of healthy controls age-matched to the CAA group; and patients with Alzheimer's disease age-matched to the CAA group. De-identified (but unmasked) demographic, clinical, radiological, and genetic data were collected at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA), at Leiden University (Leiden, Netherlands), and at sites contributing to Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The primary outcome measure was cortical thickness. The correlations between cortical thickness and structural lesions, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent time-to-peak (BOLD-TTP; a physiological measure of vascular dysfunction) were analysed to understand the potential mechanistic link between <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> and cortical thickness. The radiological variables of interest were quantified using previously validated computer-assisted tools, and all results were visually reviewed to ensure their accuracy. ResultsBetween March 15, 2006, and Dec 1, 2014, we recruited 369 individuals (26 patients with HCHWA-D and 28 age-matched, healthy controls; 63 patients with sporadic CAA without dementia; two healthy control cohorts with 63 and 126 individuals; and 63 patients with Alzheimer's disease). The 26 patients with HCHWA-D had thinner cortices (2 · 31 mm [SD 0 · 18]) than the 28 healthy controls (mean difference − 0 · 112 mm, 95 % CI − 0 · 190 to − 0 · 034, p= 0 · 006). The 63 patients with sporadic CAA without dementia had thinner cortices (2 · 17 mm [SD 0 · 11]) than the two healthy control cohorts (n= 63, mean difference − 0 · 14 mm, 95 % CI − 0 · 17 to − 0 · 10, p< 0 · 0001; and n= 126, − 0 · 10, − 0 · 13 to − 0 · 06, p< 0 · 0001). All differences remained independent in multivariable analyses. The 63 patients with Alzheimer's disease displayed more severe atrophy than the patients with sporadic CAA (2 · 1 mm [SD 0 · 14], difference 0 · 07 mm, 95 % CI 0 · 11 to 0 · 02, p= 0 · 005). We found strong associations between cortical thickness and vascular dysfunction in the patients with HCHWA-D (ρ=– 0 · 58, p= 0 · 003) or sporadic CAA (r=– 0 · 4, p= 0 · 015), but not in controls. Vascular dysfunction was identified as a mediator of the effect of hereditary CAA on cortical atrophy, accounting for 63 % of the total effect. InterpretationThe appearance of cortical thinning in patients with HCHWA-D indicates that <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid</b> is an independent contributor to cortical atrophy. These results were reproduced in patients with the more common sporadic CAA. Our findings also suggest that CAA-related cortical atrophy is at least partly mediated by vascular dysfunction. Our results also support the view that small vessel diseases such as CAA can cause cortical atrophy {{even in the absence of}} Alzheimer's disease, a conclusion that can help radiologists, neurologists, and other clinicians who diagnose these common geriatric conditions.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} distribution, morphology, and density of <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> in {{patients}} with Alzheimer's disease (AD), tissue sections from various areas of {{the central nervous system}} of 14 patients with AD and from 20 nondemented aged controls were investigated immunohistochemically using anti-beta protein antiserum. beta-protein <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were present not only in the cores of the senile plaques and in the <b>vascular</b> wall (<b>amyloid</b> angiopathy), but also in various sized plaque-shaped fibrillary, perivascular, subpial, and subependymal <b>deposits.</b> <b>Amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> were found mainly in the cerebral cortex in nondemented controls, while in AD they were distributed widely in the regions that were not affected in nondemented controls.

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by the accumulation of extracellular insoluble amyloid, primarily derived from polymerized amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. We characterized the chemical composition of the Aβ peptides deposited in the brain parenchyma and cerebrovascular walls of triple transgenic Tg-SwDI mice that produce a rapid and profuse Aβ accumulation. The processing of the N- and C-terminal regions of mutant AβPP differs substantially from humans because the brain parenchyma accumulates numerous, diffuse, nonfibrillar plaques, whereas the thalamic microvessels harbor overwhelming amounts of compact, fibrillar, thioflavine-S- and apolipoprotein E-positive <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits.</b> The abundant accretion of <b>vascular</b> <b>amyloid,</b> despite low AβPP transgene expression levels, suggests that inefficient Aβ proteolysis because of conformational changes and dimerization may be key pathogenic factors in this animal model. The disruption of amyloid plaque cores by immunotherapy is accompanied by increased perivascular deposition in both humans and transgenic mice. This analogous susceptibility and response to the disruption of <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> suggests that Tg-SwDI mice provide an excellent model in which to study the functional aftermath of immunotherapeutic interventions.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>vascular</b> and parenchymal <b>amyloid</b> <b>deposits</b> in Alzheimer disease (AD), normal {{aging and}} Down {{syndrome}} are mainly {{composed of a}} 4 kDa polypeptide (A 4), which derives from a larger precursor protein (APP). There is evidence that APP is a transmembrane glycoprotein present in most tissues, but the characteristics of APP in intact cells are not yet known. In order to investigate this issue, we examined the immunoreactivity of fibroblasts of human and nonhuman cell lines with antisera raised to synthetic peptides corresponding to A 4 and to two other domains of the APP. All three antisera recognized a 130 kDa polypeptide (APP- 130) in immunoblots from all cell lines. In fibroblasts, an additional polypeptide of 228 kDa (APP- 228) was recognized by the antiserum to A 4. In immunoblots of two dimensional gels, APP- 130 showed a pI of 6. 2, while APP- 228 failed to focus in the pH range of 4. 7 – 7. 0. Sequential extractions of cells with buffer and with Triton X- 100 indicate that APP- 130 is extractable with nonionic detergents at high ionic strength, whereas 228 kDa APP is a cystolic component. Immunofluorescence staining is consistent with an intracellular perinuclear and plasma membrane localization. It is concluded that APP- 130 and APP- 228 are two forms of the APP which result from extensive posttranslational modifications of a smaller original gene product. It is likely that APP undergoes similar posttranslational modifications in different cell types...|$|R
