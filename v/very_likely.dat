5|$|The 1812 Louisiana Hurricane {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} New Orleans, Louisiana, during the War of 1812. It was the worst storm of {{the early history of}} New Orleans and was <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> the hurricane which made the closest landfall known to affect the city.|$|E
5|$|The band plead {{not guilty}} on the charges. A Polish {{interpreter}} explained the court proceedings to the musicians over a speakerphone {{after which they}} entered their pleas in English. Spokane County Superior Court Judge Annette Plese set their trial date for December 18, though she said that date is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> to be postponed.|$|E

5|$|The {{overwhelming}} probability is {{that the}} next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> not even {{visible to the naked}} eye. Nevertheless, the prospect of a supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well-studied as Eta Carinae arouses great interest.|$|E
5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn. Bellman, already in poor health from alcoholism, went into decline, drinking increasingly heavily. His drinking <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> contributed to his gout, which troubled him badly in 1790. He also caught tuberculosis: the disease had already killed his mother, and by the winter of 1792, he was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, but it is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> that Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor. Higham {{suggests}} {{that because of the}} lack of proper facilities in East Anglia, it is likely that he was baptised by Paulinus at Edwin's centre of authority in Northumbria. The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E

5|$|It {{seems likely}} that Urbicus planned his {{campaign}} of attack from Corbridge, advancing north and leaving garrison forts at High Rochester in Northumberland and possibly also at Trimontium as he struck towards the Firth of Forth. Having secured an overland supply route for military personnel and equipment along Dere Street, Urbicus <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> set up a supply port at Carriden for the supply of grain and other foodstuffs before proceeding against the Damnonii.|$|E
5|$|Many riders {{were named}} as contenders, {{including}} Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong {{was considered an}} overall favorite, {{and it was also}} noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> to gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{the name}} of Lady Saigō's mother nor her dates of birth or death are {{recorded}} in any existing documents, although {{it is known that}} she was the elder sister of Saigō Kiyokazu. Lady Saigō's father was Tozuka Tadaharu of Tōtōmi Province, under direct control of the Imagawa clan. The marriage between Tadaharu and his wife was <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> arranged by the Imagawa clan.|$|E

5|$|Radio {{signals from}} {{spacecraft}} {{in orbit around}} Mars and on its surface {{have been used to}} estimate the mass of Juno from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of Mars. Juno's orbit appears to have changed slightly around 1839, <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> due to perturbations from a passing asteroid, whose identity has not been determined.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stars in}} Serpens {{have been found}} to have planets. The brightest, Omega Serpentis, located between Epsilon and Mu, is an orange giant with a planet of at least 1.7 Jupiter-masses. NN Serpentis, an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and a red dwarf, is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> to have two planets causing variations in the period of the eclipses. Although it does not have a planet, the solar analog HD 137510 has been found to have a brown dwarf companion within the brown-dwarf desert.|$|E
5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls. It seems <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> that the gilding of the shields {{was part of}} Michelangelo's original scheme, since they are painted to resemble {{a certain type of}} parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E

5|$|The CIA used {{surveillance}} {{photos and}} intelligence reports {{to determine the}} identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling. In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was custom-built to hide someone of significance, <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> bin Laden. Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife and family.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of Julian's army at Strasbourg {{can only be}} partially reconstructed. Ammianus gives the names of only five regiments in {{his account of the}} battle itself. But at other points of Ammianus' narrative of Julian's campaigns in Gaul, and also in Zosimus' history, there are mentions of other regiments in his comitatus, which were <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> at Strasbourg also.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Siletzia began in 1906 with Arnold's description and naming {{of a small}} exposure {{on the north side}} of the Olympic Peninsula near Port Crescent. Though this exposure is small, he recognized as <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> that much more of it was buried under younger deposits. With recognition that similar rock exposed at other outcrops is part of the same formation, the name Crescent Formation is now generally applied to all early and middle Eocene basalts on the Olympic Peninsula and Puget Lowland.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been much earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it <b>very</b> <b>likely</b> that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, {{extended}} observations {{with the}} Kepler space telescope showed only low-amplitude variations (0.033 magnitudes). Thermal modeling based on infrared observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes suggest that Nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavors forced precession of the rotation. The thermal model {{also indicates that}} the surface roughness of Nereid is <b>very</b> high, <b>likely</b> similar to the Saturnian moon Hyperion.|$|R
