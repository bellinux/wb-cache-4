25|$|The Sonoran Desert {{has more}} species of rattlesnakes (11) than {{anywhere}} else in the world. The most common species is the extremely venomous Mojave rattler, which is considered the world's most dangerous rattlesnake. The largest rattle snake species here is the Western diamondback rattlesnake, while other species include the Black-tailed rattlesnake, Tiger rattler and Sidewinder rattler. Palm Springs is home to Tarantulas and various Scorpion species, including the <b>Vinegaroon.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Vinegaroons</b> are carnivorous, nocturnal hunters feeding {{mostly on}} insects, millipedes, scorpions, and {{terrestrial}} isopods [...] but sometimes on worms and slugs. Mastigoproctus sometimes preys on small vertebrates. The prey is crushed between special teeth {{on the inside}} of the trochanters (the second segment of the [...] "legs") of the front appendages. They are valuable in controlling the population of cockroaches and crickets.|$|R
5000|$|Thelyphonida is an {{arachnid}} order comprising invertebrates {{commonly known}} as whip scorpions or <b>vinegaroons</b> (also spelled vinegarroons and vinegarones). They are often called uropygids {{in the scientific community}} based on an alternative name for the order, Uropygi (which may then also include the order Schizomida). The name [...] "whip scorpion" [...] refers to their resemblance to true scorpions and possession of a whiplike tail. [...] "Vinegaroon" [...] is based on their ability when attacked to discharge an offensive liquid which contains acetic acid, producing a vinegar-like smell.|$|R
5000|$|Amblypygi is {{an ancient}} order of {{arachnid}} chelicerate arthropods also known as whip spiders and tailless whip scorpions (not {{to be confused with}} whip scorpions and <b>vinegaroons</b> that belong to the related order Thelyphonida). The name [...] "amblypygid" [...] means [...] "blunt rump", a reference to a lack of the flagellum ("tail") that is otherwise seen in whip scorpions. They are harmless to humans. Amblypygids possess no silk glands or venomous fangs. They rarely bite if threatened, but can grab fingers with their pedipalps, resulting in thorn-like puncture injuries.|$|R

40|$|There were 193 schizomids (hubbardids) {{collected}} from the soil (0 - 7 cm depth) during a 12 month study of a primary upland forest (37. 5 +/- 16. 8 ind/m(2) /month) near Manaus. They were represented by Surazomus brasiliensis (Kraus 1967) and an undescribed species of a new genus (96 % and 4 % of the total catch, respectively). About 68 % of all specimens of S. brasiliensis inhabited the organic soil layer (0 - 3. 5 cm depth) where monthly catches of juveniles were positively correlated with soil temperature. Females were twice as abundant as males. The lack of a distinct reproductive period {{and the presence of}} juveniles (in particular the first nymphal instar) and adults (both sexes) throughout the year indicate a plurivoltine mode of life. Few specimens were caught on the soil surface, and none were on tree trunks or in the canopy.

About 75 % of all specimens inhabited the mineral subsoil (3. 5 - 7 cm depth) where monthly catches were negatively correlated with temperature and moisture content of the soil Females were almost twice as abundant as males. The lack of a distinct reproductive period {{and the presence of}} juveniles and adults (both sexes) throughout the year indicate a plurivoltine mode of life. No specimens were caught on or above the soil surface. Abundances of E. janetscheki are compared with those of the Schizomida (tartarids) and Thelyphonida (<b>vinegaroons)</b> from the same study sites. E. janetscheki also represented the palpigrads obtained from the soil of three other upland forest types in Central Amazonia (0 - 14 cm depth) and accounted for 0. 1 - 0. 3 % of the total arthropod fauna...|$|R

About 74 % of all specimens of S. mirim inhabited the organic soil layer (0 - 3. 5 cm. depth) where monthly catches of juveniles were negatively correlated with temperatures of the soil.

5000|$|In 1882 {{the town}} of <b>Vinegaroon,</b> Texas is run by Judge Roy Bean (Walter Brennan) who calls himself [...] "the only law west of the Pecos."

The nearest court was 200 mi away at Fort Stockton, and there was little means to stop illegal activity. A Texas Ranger requested that a local law jurisdiction be set up in <b>Vinegaroon,</b> and on 2 August 1882, Bean was appointed {{justice of the peace}} for the new Precinct 6 in Pecos County. His first case, however, had been heard on 25 July 1882, when Texas Rangers brought in Joe Bell to be tried. One of his first acts as a justice of the peace was to [...] "shoot ... up the saloon shack of a Jewish competitor". Bean then turned his tent saloon into a part-time courtroom and began calling himself the [...] "Law West of the Pecos." [...] As judge, Bean relied on a single lawbook, the 1879 edition of the Revised Statutes of Texas. When newer law books showed up, Bean used them as kindling.|$|E

50|$|The Westerner is a 1940 American film {{directed}} by William Wyler and starring Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, and Doris Davenport. Written by Niven Busch, Stuart N. Lake, and Jo Swerling, {{the film is}} about a self-appointed hanging judge in <b>Vinegaroon,</b> Texas who befriends a saddle tramp who opposes the judge's policy against homesteaders. The film is often remembered for one of Walter Brennan's best performances, as Judge Roy Bean, which led to his winning his record-setting third Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. James Basevi and Stuart N. Lake also received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Black and White and Best Story respectively.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the related}} orders Schizomida, Amblypygi, and Solifugae, the vinegaroons use only six legs for walking, {{with the first}} two legs serving as antennae-like sensory organs.

They have one pair of eyes {{at the front of the}} cephalothorax and three on each side of the head, a pattern also found in scorpions. Vinegaroons have no venom glands, but they have glands near the rear of their abdomen that can spray a combination of acetic acid and caprylic acid when they are bothered. The acetic acid gives this spray a vinegar-like smell, giving rise to the common name <b>vinegaroon.</b>|$|E
