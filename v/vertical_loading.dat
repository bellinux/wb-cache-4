2500|$|The Pratt truss was {{patented}} in 1844 by two Boston railway engineers, Caleb Pratt {{and his son}} Thomas Willis Pratt. [...] The design uses vertical {{members for}} compression and diagonal members to respond to tension. The Pratt truss design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel. [...] This continued popularity of the Pratt truss is {{probably due to the}} fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. [...] This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as slenderness effects related to buckling under compression loads [...] (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design. [...] Therefore, for given planar truss with a fixed depth, the Pratt configuration is usually the most efficient under static, <b>vertical</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|E

The {{influence}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> on steel reinforced concrete column is analyzed, {{based on the}} maximum lateral displacement of 2 different steel reinforced concrete columns under different <b>vertical</b> <b>loads.</b> The <b>vertical</b> <b>loads,</b> the section properties of the steel reinforced concrete column and horizontal loads are the influencing factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{equivalence}} principle, the concentrated <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> {{which acts}} on the Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement(CRCP) transverse crack is translated into the equivalent half-wave sine load by Fourier transform. According to the translation {{principle of the}} force, the half-wave sine <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> acting on the CRCP transverse crack is decomposed to the half-wave sine <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> and the torsion force acting {{on the center of}} CRCP. Lastly, the deflection, torsional displacement and stress formulas of CRCP under the concentrated <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> with hollow foundation are put forward, which is {{on the basis of the}} small deflection theory of elastic thin plate and torsion theory. The results show that increasing the slab thickness is the most effective measure to reduce maximal deflection, distortion displacement and stress of CRCP concentrated <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> with hollow foundation...|$|R
3000|$|For {{the second}} assumption, the {{position}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> {{is assumed to be}} applied at the top center of column. Before column rocking, the assumption is reasonable. But once rotation of the column occurs, {{the position of}} <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> deviates from the center of column head. Because the theoretical model is mainly obtained based on the small rotation angle, the offset distance of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> is small. While the position of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> makes a little effects on the restoring moment. Equation (71) changes into Ph+N([...] Δ - Δ _d)=M^+_bc with taking the partial compression into consideration. Δ _d is the offset distance of <b>vertical</b> <b>load.</b> The theoretical moment may be overestimated without considering the partial compression based on the above formula. All in all, {{it should be noted that}} the above assumptions should be improved in the future study in order to make the theoretical model more accurate.|$|R
2500|$|The Humanistic Approach to {{job design}} was a {{reaction}} to [...] "worker dissatisfaction over Scientific Management" [...] and focused on providing employees with more input {{and an opportunity to}} maximize their personal achievement as referenced by Jex and Britt. Jobs should also provide intellectual stimulation, opportunities for creativity, and greater discretion over work-related activities. Two approaches used in the Humanistic Approach to job design are job rotation and job enrichment. Job rotation allows employees to switch to different jobs which allows them to learn new skills and provides them with greater variety. According to Jex and Britt, this would be most effective for simple jobs that can become mundane and boring over time. Job enrichment is focused on leveraging those aspects of jobs that are labeled motivators, such as control, intellectual challenge, and creativity. The most common form of job enrichment is <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> where additional tasks or discretion enhances the initial job design. While there is some evidence to support that job enrichment improves motivation, {{it is important to note}} that it is not effective for all people. Some employees are not more motivated by enriched jobs.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the launch}} of the first {{prototype}} [...] "Goronta" [...] CD player by Sony at the Japanese Audio Fair in 1982, Sony showcased the <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> design. Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including Alpine/Luxman, Matsushita under the Technics brand, Kenwood and Toshiba/Aurex. For the early <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman, Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand). Kenwood added their [...] "Sigma Drive" [...] outputs to this design as a modification. A picture of this early design can be seen on the Panasonic Web site. The <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> is similar the one common in cassette decks, where the holder opens, and disc is dropped to it. The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study how it {{influence}} the horizontal bearing capacity of the disk pile when there exists a <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> a group of model tests has been designed. Three double-disk piles {{were used in the}} test, and the distance of the two disks is 5 times as the disk diameter. First drew a <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> V= 200 N/ 300 N/ 400 N on the top of pile 1 / 2 / 3 respectively, then put on the horizontal load stage by stage. And by the test, we can study the differences of the pile bearing properties such as changes in the pile bending moment, the horizontal and vertical deformation on the top. Experiment showed that when the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> is quite small（V= 200 N, 300 N）, the existence of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> {{has little to do with}} horizontal bearing capacity. When a <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> increases to a certain value（V= 400 N）, The maximum bending moment and horizontal displacement of the pile under the same horizontal load reduce, which indicates that the disks of the pile play a significant role in bearing combined loading...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{present study}} {{examined}} the activity and the gait characteristics of the gluteus medius and the trunk stability muscles during the stance phase of gait on level ground when a <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> corresponding to 0 %, 1 %, or 2 % of body weight {{was placed on the}} lower extremities during the swing phase of the gait. [Methods] The subjects were 40 young males aged between 21 and 30 years. The <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> corresponding to 0 %, 1 %, 2 % of weight, which was measured with an electronic scale, was placed bilaterally 3 cm above from {{the upper part of the}} lateral malleous. Electrodes were symmetrically attached to the gluteus medius, erector spinae, external oblique, and internal oblique muscles. [Results] There were significant differences in the activities of the left gluteus medius, bilateral external oblique, and right internal oblique muscles among the <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> of 0 %, 1 %, and 2 % during gait. [Conclusion] Increases in <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> were accompanied by changes in the activities of the internal and exter-nal oblique abdominal muscles to ensure the stability of the trunk under the different loads. Gait was only possible with the activity of the gluteus medius muscle and the trunk muscles resisting the different <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> rather than activating other muscles of the lower extremities in terms of energy efficiency...|$|R

50|$|The slope {{statistic}} of the IRI {{was chosen}} for backward compatibility with roughness measures in use. It is the average absolute (rectified) relative velocity of the suspension, divided by vehicle speed to convert from rate (e.g. m/s) to slope (m/km).

Although it is not optimized to match any particular vehicle with full fidelity, it is so strongly correlated with ride quality and road loading that most research projects that have tested alternate statistics have not found significant improvements in correlation.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} automated parameter fitted {{analytical model}} that numerically predicts the load-displacement response of wood frame shear walls subjected to static monotonic loading {{with and without}} <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> is presented. This analytical model referred to as Analytical Model of wood frame SHEar walls subjected to <b>Vertical</b> <b>load</b> (AMSHEV) {{is based on the}} kinematic behavior of wood frame shear walls and captures significant characteristics observed from experimental testing through appropriate modeling of three failure mechanisms that can occur within a shear wall under static monotonic load: 1) failure of sheathing-to-framing connectors, 2) failure of vertical studs, and 3) uplift of end studs from bottom sill. Previous models have not accounted for these failure mechanisms as well as the inclusion of <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> which has shown to reveal beneficial effects such as increasing the ultimate load capacity and limiting uplift of the wall as noted in experimental tests.
