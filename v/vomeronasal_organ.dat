5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ</b> in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ.</b>|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ.</b> This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
50|$|Olfaction in {{salamanders}} {{plays a role}} in territory maintenance, {{the recognition}} of predators, and courtship rituals, but is probably secondary to sight during prey selection and feeding. Salamanders have two types of sensory areas that respond to the chemistry of the environment. Olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity picks up airborne and aquatic odors, while adjoining <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> detect nonvolatile chemical cues, such as tastes in the mouth. In plethodonts, the sensory epithelium of the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> extends to the nasolabial grooves, which stretch from the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. These extended areas seem {{to be associated with the}} identification of prey items, the recognition of conspecifics, and the identification of individuals.|$|R
5000|$|Human sebum gains a new compound, {{along with}} pentanol and methyl {{butanoate}} whose chemical structure {{resembles that of}} many insect attack pheromones. When a mammal smells the new compound in human sebum with its <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs,</b> its amygadala subconsciously makes the animal want to attack the humans. This causes a sensation for the animal like an [...] "itch" [...] that goes away when the animal smashes something, like {{in the case of}} Atilla, Jackson's chimpanzee. Later the itch returns and the animal once more becomes violent.|$|R
5|$|Their {{sense of}} smell, while {{much better than}} that of humans, {{is not quite as}} good as that of a dog. It is {{believed}} to {{play a key role in}} the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the <b>Vomeronasal</b> <b>organs,</b> also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.|$|R
5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, but not with haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ</b> (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E
5|$|Major urinary {{proteins}} (Mups), {{also known}} as α2u-globulins, are a subfamily of proteins found in abundance in the urine and other secretions of many animals. Mups provide a small range of identifying information about the donor animal, when detected by the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ</b> of the receiving animal. They belong to a larger family of proteins known as lipocalins. Mups are encoded by a cluster of genes, located {{adjacent to each other}} on a single stretch of DNA, that varies greatly in number between species: from at least 21 functional genes in mice to none in humans. Mup proteins form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a ligand-binding pocket that accommodates specific small, organic chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ.</b> The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E

Denervating the olfactory and <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> produced no changes in prey capture behavior in Cerastes cerastes. Occluding {{the eyes of the}} denervated specimens resulted in significant decreases in strike distance, diversity of strike angle and strike accuracy, demonstrating the importance of visual stimuli for target acquisition in this species.

50|$|Chanaresuchus has a low, {{elongate}} skull that {{is characteristic}} of proterochampsians. The skull is quite broad posteriorly with a narrow snout, varying in length from around 165mm to 260mm in the largest individuals. The nares are slit-like and positioned away {{from the tip of}} the rostrum, farther up the skull. The premaxilla is slightly down-curved. The skull table is highly ornamented in larger specimens, with the dermal bones well sculptured. The palate of Chanaresuchus has two elongate choanae. Two small openings anterior to the choanae may be anterior palatine foramina that could have been used for access to <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs.</b> The secondary palate formed between these two sets of openings may have been an adaptation for breathing through the snout while underwater.|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of alpha-gustducin, a G protein alpha subunit involved in bitter and sweet taste transduction, {{was investigated in}} chemosensory tissues of adult mice. By immunohistochemistry, alpha gustducin was absent in the olfactory neuroepithelium. Instead, alpha gustducin was expressed in a subset of bipolar cells in the proliferative zone of the vomeronasal neuroepithelium {{as well as in}} taste buds. Northern blot analysis confirmed the presence of alpha gustducin in isolated <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs.</b> Moreover, immunohisto- chemistry revealed the {{expression of}} alpha gustducin in scattered cells of the nasal respiratory epithelium.

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ</b> (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ</b> (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ</b> to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E

In these experiments c-fos expression was used as a marker of neural activity to identify the contribution of vomeronasal sensory input during mating behavior in male golden hamsters, either intact or with <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> removed (VNX). Inexperienced hamsters were either stimulated with a receptive female and allowed to mate, exposed to female hamster vaginal fluid (HVF), which contains stimuli known to act through the VN system, or placed in a clean cage alone.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at validating the sexual {{attractiveness}} of hexadecanol and hexadecyl acetate, two putative pheromone compounds, from preputial gland secretion of mice. These two compounds {{have been reported to}} be among the major components of preputial gland secretion in both sexes but higher in quantity in males than females. In this study, we show that castration suppressed the production of the two compounds, further suggesting their association with maleness. Adding preputial gland secretion and the synthetic analogs of the two compounds to castrated male urine at their physiological levels in intact males increased the attractiveness of castrated male urine to female mice, showing that the two compounds were indeed male pheromones. Furthermore, their sexual attractiveness disappeared upon removing the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> (VNOs) from female recipients. Replenishing castrated male urine with preputial gland secretion and the two compounds at their physiological levels in females increased the attractiveness of castrated male urine to males. Such a reversal of sexual attractiveness for hexadecanol and hexadecyl acetate suggests that they had opposing dual effects in sexual attractiveness in a dosage-dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of vomeronasal dElprivation on strikeinduced chemosensory searching (SICS) in rattlesnakes we used a newly {{developed}} technique to anesthetize the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs.</b> We compared rate of tongue flicking after striking prey in avomic rattlesnakes to vomic controls. Avomic rattlesnakes exhibited significantly fewer tongue flicks after striking prey than did vomic controls. However, avomic subjects still exhibited a significantly higher rate of tongue flicking (RTF) than did subjects that were presented with prey but not allowed to strike indicating that the increase in RTF seen in avomic snakes reflects a component of predatory behavior that is released by the strike and not dependent upon further vomeronasal activation. A second experiment was conducted to examine the role of the vomeronasal system (VNS) in location of envenomed prey. Disruption of the VNS chemoreception significantly reduced the number of poststrike tongue flicks, significantly increased the latency to locate the prey item and significantly increased the latency to commence swallowing the prey item, indicating that normal expression of these behaviors is dependent upon a functioning vomeronasal system...|$|R
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organ.</b> Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E

40|$|Among various arvicoline rodents, {{reproduction}} is influenced {{to varying degrees}} by social factors, including behavioral or chemical cues. Since previous research suggested that chemosignals from adult males reproductively activate female pirie voles (Microtus pine-torum), we sought to determine specifically what types of stimuli promote the activation response. In these experiments, females were exposed to unfamiliar adult males, or to some combination of cues from males, or were housed alone. Using uterine mass {{as a measure of}} reproductive activation, we found that females were not activated by exposure either to male urine by itself or to male-soiled bedding by itself, but full contact with a male clearly resulted in heavier uteri. Females whose <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> were surgically excised failed to undergo reproductive activation when housed with males. Finally, females allowed physical contact by being housed directly underneath males had heavier uteri than did females whose housing allowed contact only with the chemical cues from males. Among female arvicoline rodents, it appears that there exists a physiological continuum between absolute dependence on both contact and chemical cues from males vs. absolute independence for reproductive activation. The present results place female pine voles closer to the former extreme than to the latter...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} interspecies, intersexual, and age-related changes in {{size of the}} vomeronasal neuroepithelium (VNNE) of two species of greater bushbabies (genus Otolemur, Infraorder Lorisiformes, Suborder Strepsirrhini). Tissue blocks containing the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> of nine O. crassicaudatus (8 adults, 1 neonate) and ten O. garnettii (9 adults, 1 neonate) were studied by means of serial paraffin sectioning and computer-based reconstruction of VNNE volume. In addition, the immunoreactivity of the VNNE to two neuronal markers, neuron-specific beta tubulin (BT) and olfactory marker protein (OMP) was compared between species, sexes, and ages. Results indicated that a clear VNNE is present at birth in both species, and OMP immunoreactivity was verified in O. garnettii at birth. Male and female adults of both species showed OMP-immunoreactive and BT-immunoreactive neurons in the VNNE. Immunohistochemical findings indicated that all males and the youngest females had the thickest VNNE, especially at the marginal junctions with the receptor-free epithelium. Results of a 2 -way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, species x sex) revealed {{no significant differences in}} VNNE length or volume between species, but O. crassicaudatus had significantly (p < 0. 05) greater palatal length.

40|$|Male {{and female}} Cordylus cordylus can {{discriminate}} between tiles labeled {{by their own}} pheromones and tiles labeled by individuals {{of the same sex}}, as shown by elevated tongue-flick rates in which the tongue contacts only air above the tiles labeled by other individuals and tongue-flicks in which the tongue contacts the tiles themselves. Potential pheromone sources for these discriminations are the femoral glands, cloacal glands, generation glands, ventral skin, and excretory products. Although studied in few species, pheromonal discriminations between self and other individuals, familiar and unfamiliar individuals, and kin and unrelated individuals appear to be broadly distributed in lizards, occurring in Iguania and in both Gekkonoidea and Scincomorpha within Scleroglossa. Both sexes of C. cordylus defend territories against both sexes. An ability to distinguish pheromones of other individuals of the same sex from self-produced pheromones would allow detection of intruders, but pheromonal discriminations among individuals would be more useful. Adaptive functions of pheromonal discriminations for residents and nonresidents and discriminatory abilities required are discussed. Tongue-flicks touching labeled tiles differed between experimental conditions, suggesting vomerolfactory discrimination, but the interpretation of a similar difference for tongue-flicks that contacted no substrate is problematical. Such air tongue-flicks might indicate sampling of volatile molecules for delivery to the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs.</b> Experiments are needed to conclusively determine the sensory bases of the discriminations and the role of air tongue-flicks.

They keep their tongues constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment. In water-dwelling snakes, such as the anaconda, the tongue functions efficiently underwater.|$|E
25|$|Chemoreception in {{crocodiles}} {{is especially}} interesting because they hunt in both terrestrial and aquatic surroundings.

Behavioural and olfactometer experiments indicate that crocodiles detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and use their olfactory system for hunting. When above water, crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx. Crocodiles close their nostrils when submerged, so olfaction underwater is unlikely. Underwater food detection is presumably gustatory and tactile.|$|E
40|$|Located at the {{anterior}} {{portion of the}} nose, the paired <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> (VNO) detect odors and pheromones. In vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) odor responses are mainly mediated by phospholipase C (PLC), stimulation of which elevates diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates a transient receptor potential channel (TRPC 2) leading to cell depolarization. In this study, we used a natural stimulus, urine, to elicit odor responses in VSNs and found urine responses persisted in TRPC 2 −/− mice, suggesting {{the existence of a}} TRPC 2 -independent signal transduction pathway. Using perforated patch-clamp recordings on isolated VSNs from wild-type (WT) and TRPC 2 −/− mice, we found a PLC inhibitor blocked urine responses from all VSNs. Furthermore, urine responses were reduced by blocking DAG lipase, an enzyme that produces arachidonic acid (AA), in WT mice and abolished in TRPC 2 −/− mice. Consistently, direct stimulation with AA activated an inward current that was independent of TRPC 2 channels but required bath Ca 2 + and was blocked by Cd 2 +. With the use of inside-out patches from TRPC 2 −/− VSNs, we show that AA activated a channel that also required Ca 2 +. Together, these data from WT and TRPC 2 −/− mice suggest that both DAG and its metabolite, AA, mediate excitatory odor responses in VSNs, by activating two types of channels, a TRPC 2 and a separate Ca 2 +-permeable channel...|$|R
40|$|It is {{currently}} thought that New World monkeys, prosimians, and humans {{are the only}} primates to possess <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> (VNOs) as adults. Recent studies of the human VNO suggest that previous investigations on Old World primates may have missed the VNO. We examined nasal septa from the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) grossly and histologically for comparison with nasal septa from humans, Old World monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemistrina) and prosimian primates (Microcebus murinus, Otolemur garnettii). Grossly, chimpanzees had depressions on the nasal septum similar to fossae reported anterior to the VNO openings in humans. Histologically, chimpanzees and humans had bilateral epithelial tubes which were above the superior margin of the paraseptal cartilages (vomeronasal cartilage homologue). The epithelial tubes had a homogeneous ciliated epithelium. These structures were thus positionally and structurally identical to the human VNO and unlike the well-developed prosimian VNOs which were surrounded by vomeronasal cartilage. Macaques had no structures which resembled the VNO of either the prosimians or humans. The results demonstrate that the VNO is present postnatally in the chimpanzee and is almost identical to the human VNO in its anatomical position and histological structure. This in turn suggests that the reported absence of the VNO {{in at least some}} adult Old World primates is artifactual, and that further study may provide evidence for its existence in other species...|$|R
40|$|SIX 1 {{homeodomain}} {{protein is}} one of the essential key regulators of sensory organ development. Six 1 -deficient mice lack the olfactory epithelium, <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs,</b> cochlea, vestibule and vestibuloacoustic ganglion, and also show poor neural differentiation in the distal part of the cranial ganglia. Simultaneous loss of both Six 1 and Six 4 leads to additional abnormalities such as small trigeminal ganglion and abnormal dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The aim {{of this study was to}} understand the molecular mechanism that controls Six 1 expression in sensory organs, particularly in the trigeminal ganglion and DRG. To this end, we focused on the sensory ganglia-specific Six 1 enhancer (Six 1 - 8) conserved between chick and mouse. In vivo reporter assays using both animals identified an important core region comprising binding consensus sequences for several transcription factors including nuclear hormone receptors, TCF/LEF, SMAD, POU homeodomain and basic-helix-loop-helix proteins. The results provided information on upstream factors and signals potentially relevant to Six 1 regulation in sensory neurons. We also report the establishment of a new transgenic mouse line (mSix 1 - 8 -NLSCre) that expresses Cre recombinase under the control of mouse Six 1 - 8. Cre-mediated recombination was detected specifically in ISL 1 / 2 -positive sensory neurons of Six 1 -positive cranial sensory ganglia and DRG. The unique features of the mSix 1 - 8 -NLSCre line are the absence of Cre-mediated recombination in SOX 10 -positive glial cells and central nervous system and ability to induce recombination in a subset of neurons derived from the olfactory placode/epithelium.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the unique saiga nose in vocal production has been neglected so far. Rutting male saigas produce loud nasal roars. Prior to roaring, they tense and extend their noses in a highly stereotypic manner. This change of nose configuration includes dorsal folding and convex curving of the nasal vestibulum and is maintained until the roar ends. Red and fallow deer males that orally roar achieve a temporary increase of vocal tract length (vtl) by larynx retraction. Saiga males attain a similar effect by pulling their flexible nasal vestibulum rostrally, allowing for a temporary elongation of the nasal vocal tract by about 20 %. Decrease of formant frequencies and formant dispersion, as acoustic effects of an increase of vtl, are assumed to convey important information {{on the quality of}} a dominant male to conspecifics, e. g. on body size and fighting ability. Nasal roaring in saiga may equally serve to deter rival males and to attract females. Anatomical constraints might have set a limit to the rostral pulling of the nasal vestibulum. It seems likely that the sexual dimorphism of the saiga nose was induced by sexual selection. Adult males of many mammalian species, after sniffing or licking female urine or genital secretions, raise their head and strongly retract their upper lip and small nasal vestibulum while inhalating orally. This flehmen behaviour is assumed to promote transport of non-volatile substances via the incisive ducts into the <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> for pheromone detection. The flehmen aspect in saiga involves the extensive flexible walls of the greatly enlarged nasal vestibulum and is characterized by a distinctly concave configuration of the nose region, the reverse of that observed in nasal roaring.

40|$|Vomerolfaction, {{mediated}} by paired <b>vomeronasal</b> <b>organs</b> (VNOs), {{is a highly}} important chemical sense in squamates (snakes and lizards). The VNOs of squamates are only accessible via ducts that open into the oral cavity, and snakes and lizards engage in tongue-flicking to gather chemicals from the environment and transport them into the oral cavity for delivery to these ducts. Unfortunately, the biomechanics of chemical delivery to the VNOs has been poorly understood. I conducted a comparative study of the morphology of the oral cavity and tongue {{that led to a}} robust hypothesis of chemical delivery in squamates. I found that regardless of tongue form, which is considerably variable, the mechanism of chemical delivery is fundamentally the same for most squamates. The sublingual plicae (raised structures {{on the floor of the}} mouth) act like pistons within a chamber (or chambers in squamates with forked tongues) created by the sublingual plicae and features of the palate. They apply pressure on the foretongue forcing the chemical laden fluid coating it around the margins of the foretongue towards the ducts of the VNOs. Given this mechanism, I also found features that would act to maintain the discrete nature of chemical signals from the left and right sides of the foretongue allowing for tropotaxis (movement of an animal in response to differential signal intensities from paired sensory organs), which has already been established as the major selective force behind the deeply forked tongue of snakes and some squamates. Lastly, my investigations of the ultrastructure of the surfaces of the foretongue involved in chemical gathering in squamates yielded two major findings. First, there is a high level of desmosome junctions between the layers of squamous epithelial cells making this tissue resistant to the shear stresses that the tongue encounters during chemosensory tongue-flicking. Second, I found a feature unique to snakes and anguimorph lizards, the microfacet (small bumps, 0. 5 - 3 ̆e 2. 5 μm, formed by packets of lipid pushing up the surface of the epithelial cells). This synapomorphy supports an anguimorph origin of snakes, a long standing hypothesis that has encountered recent controversy. ...|$|R
