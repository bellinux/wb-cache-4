Special attention {{is given to}} the interactions of these parasites with gut and hemolymph molecules and the effects of the organization of midgut epithelial cells on the parasite development. The <b>vector</b> <b>insect's</b> permissiveness to T. cruzi, which develops in the vector gut, largely depends on the host nutritional state, the parasite strain and the molecular interactions with trypanolytic compounds, lectins and resident bacteria in the gut. T. rangeli invades the hemocoel and once in the hemolymph, can be recognized and activates the defense system of its <b>insect</b> <b>vector,</b> i. e., the prophenoloxidase system, phagocytosis, hemocyte microaggregation, superoxide and nitric oxide activity and the eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway.

40|$|Interactions between <b>vector</b> <b>insects,</b> plant {{viruses and}} host plants {{are complex and}} diverse. Although much {{work has been done}} to study the {{tripartite}} relationships, their roles in biological invasions have been rarely explored. The limited case studies available indicate that the interactions may be mediated by the host plant susceptibility to viruses, the suitability of host plants to <b>vector</b> <b>insects,</b> and the insects’ capacity to utilize host plants. When a host plant is highly susceptible to the virus but shows a low level of suitability to the insect, and the insect has a strong capacity to use different host plants, an indirect mutualistic relationship is likely to occur between vector insect and plant virus via their shared host plants. This kind of mutualism can contribute to the widespread invasion of <b>vector</b> <b>insects</b> as well as the epidemics of plant viruses. In view of the significance of the tripartite interactions in biological invasions, future effort should be made to investigate comparatively many more combinations of different species, and various technologies can be used to reveal the physiological and molecular mechanisms of the interactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{epigenetic}} {{regulation of}} gene expression {{has been recognized}} {{as an alternative to}} genetic mutation for the conversion of environmental stressors, such as the presence of parasites, into heritable phenotypic changes. The activation of immune responses in insects involves the orchestrated expression of genes that mediate pathogen recognition and immunity-related signalling, which in turn induces the synthesis of effector molecules such as antimicrobial peptides. This transcriptional reprogramming is regulated by DNA methylation and the acetylation and deacetylation of histones, which operate before transcription begins, and by microRNAs, which control protein synthesis posttranscriptionally. Therefore, research on epigenetic regulation at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ and organism levels in insects represents an emerging field to understand the regulation of complex parameters such as longevity, fecundity and reproduction. Microbial parasites and parasitic wasps have evolved strategies to interfere with the epigenetic mechanisms of their host insects to favour their own development. The impact of parasites on host insect epigenetics is a growing area of research because it influences phenomena such as host-parasite coevolution, the transmission of diseases by <b>vector</b> <b>insects,</b> and the control of endogenous symbionts. This research field could also pave the way for the development of novel strategies to control pest and <b>vector</b> <b>insects...</b>|$|E

40|$|Rice dwarf virus (RDV), with 12 {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) genome segments (S 1 to S 12), replicates in and {{is transmitted}} by <b>vector</b> <b>insects.</b> The RDV-plant host-vector insect system {{allows us to}} examine the evolution, adaptation, and population genetics of a plant virus. We compared the effects of long-term maintenance of RDV on population structures in its two hosts. The maintenance of RDV in rice plants for several years resulted in gradual accumulation of nonsense mutations in S 2 and S 10, absence of expression of the encoded proteins, and complete loss of transmissibility. RDV maintained in cultured insect cells for 6 years retained an intact protein-encoding genome. Thus, the structural P 2 protein encoded by S 2 and the nonstructural Pns 10 protein encoded by S 10 of RDV are subject to different selective pressures in the two hosts, and mutations accumulating in the host plant are detrimental in <b>vector</b> <b>insects.</b> However, one round of propagation in insect cells or individuals purged the populations of RDV that had accumulated deleterious mutations in host plants, with exclusive survival of fully competent RDV.

40|$|Abstract-Insect {{vector control}} {{has proved to}} be an {{effective}} method for reducing the transmission of disease-causing organisms to human populations in many tropical countries. A variety of methods have been employed to suppress vector populations, including the application of biological control agents and the elimination of breeding sites, with a continuing and heavy reliance on the use of chemical insecticides. However, the development of insecticide resistance by <b>vector</b> <b>insects,</b> the cost of developing and registering new insecticidal compounds, and the increase in legislation to combat the detrimental effects of insecticidal residues on the environment, have emphasised the need to assess a variety of alternatives to vector control.

Previous cytopathologic and genetic data revealed that tubular structures, {{constructed by the}} nonstructural viral protein Pns 10, contain viral particles and are {{directly involved in the}} intercellular spread of RDV among cultured leafhopper cells. Here, we demonstrated that RDV exploited these virus-containing tubules to move along actin-based microvilli of the epithelial cells and muscle fibers of visceral muscle tissues in the alimentary canal, facilitating the spread of virus in the body of its <b>insect</b> <b>vector</b> leafhoppers.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} largely assumed that the {{individual}} experience of disease <b>vector</b> <b>insects</b> may affect host choice and, as a consequence, have an important influence on parasite transmission. In particular, it is speculated that <b>vector</b> <b>insects</b> {{should be able to}} learn and remember the most and/or less defensive hosts, shifting their preference accordingly. Nevertheless, despite the invested efforts in testing the capacity to learn and remember information of blood-sucking insects, only little conclusive information has been obtained hitherto. Recently, the ability of Rhodnius prolixus to associate a behaviourally neutral odour to the perspective of either obtaining a blood-meal or being punished has been demonstrated, the same odour becoming attractant or repellent for the bugs, respectively, according to the individual previous experience. The present work represents a step forward {{in the study of the}} cognitive abilities of Chagas disease vectors and their influence on host choice. We tested whether or not bugs bias their choice for a host based on the association of its odour with a negative experience. Our results show that whereas naïve bugs presented no preference when confronted to the odour of two different hosts, bugs previously exposed to the contingency of the odour of one host and a mechanical perturbation mimicking defensive behaviour, biased their preference towards the other host. This constitutes the first evidence of olfactory conditioning to host odours in triatomine bugs, vectors of Chagas disease and one of the few available up to date on haematophagous insects.
