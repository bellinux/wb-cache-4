2500|$|Women Strike for Peace (WSP, {{also known}} as Women for Peace) was a women's peace activist group in the United States. In 1961, nearing the height of the Cold War, around 50,000 women marched in 60 cities around the United States to {{demonstrate}} against the testing of nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women's peace protest during the 20th century. Another group action was led by Dagmar Wilson , when about 1,500 women gathered {{at the foot of}} the Washington Monument while President John F. Kennedy watched from the White House. The protest helped [...] "push the United States and the Soviet Union into signing a nuclear test-ban treaty two years later". Due to the time period the group's leaders had been brought up in, in-between the First-wave feminism and the Second-wave feminism their actions and pleas leaned towards female self-sacrifice rather than towards their self-interests. However, they pushed the power of a concerned mother to the forefront of American politics, transforming the mother from a [...] "passive <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> to active fighter for peace".|$|E

He was represented with 8 paintings in the Philippine Section at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904, where his painting titled A <b>Victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>War</b> received an Honorable Mention. He taught at the Philippine Normal School from 1918 to 1926. Before World War II, his landscapes were found in classrooms all over the Philippines. In 1941 his Tienda del Barrio won Second Honorable Mention in the Filipiniana Category at the National Art Competition sponsored by the University of Santo Tomas.|$|E

In one event, when walking around Bethlehem CT, to get to Torrington with his master, he noted how close he was to his mother in Plymouth, that night he made a run for it, running about twenty miles through woods, properties, farms, and in one case chased by dogs for a few miles, finally met his mother the next morning in Plymouth, the moment he contacted her, he realized it was morning and had to leave. He was <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> at New Haven Fort, and when finished, he moved to Bristol to start apprenticeship with Eli Terry.|$|E
5000|$|Curry's few semi-political {{paintings}} evolved out of {{his personal}} experiences rather than created as a display of social commentary. The Return of Private Davis completed in 1940 was first witnessed {{near his home in}} 1918, and a similar study was made in France during 1926. Schmeckenbier relates this painting to the Baptism: [...] "a rural religious ceremony whose tragedy is intensified by the realization that this son of the fresh green Kansas prairies was sacrificed on a battlefield whose ideological remoteness was as dramatic as its geographical makeup." [...] The painting does not express a political spectacle, rather Curry's personal feelings. Conversely, Parade to War depicts departing soldiers rather than the return of a <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Curry was working in a time period fraught with turmoil; he was working during the Great Depression, which was flanked on each side by a World War. He was inspired by a massive anti-war sentiment that was reflected in literary works such as All Quiet on the Western Front. Curry experienced personally the effects of war and portrays personal tragedy, suffering and death in these paintings.|$|E
50|$|During the Battle of Monte Cassino in the Italian Campaign of World War II (January-May 1944) the Abbey made up {{one section}} of the 161-kilometre (100-mile) Gustav Line, a German {{defensive}} line designed to hold the Allied troops from advancing any farther into Italy. The abbey itself, however, was not captured by the German troops as part of their fortifications as Albert Kesselring, the German commander, wished to prevent the historical place from becoming a <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> The Gustav Line stretched from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic coast in the east, with Monte Cassino itself overlooking Highway 6 and blocking the path to Rome. On 15 February 1944 the abbey was almost completely destroyed in a series of heavy American-led air raids. The Commander-in-Chief Allied Armies in Italy, General Sir Harold Alexander of the British army ordered the bombing. The bombing was conducted because many reports from the British commanders of the Indian troops on the ground suggested that Germans were occupying the monastery, and it was considered a key observational post by all those who were fighting in the field. However, during the bombing no Germans were present in the abbey. Subsequent investigations have since confirmed that the only people killed in the monastery by the bombing were 230 Italian civilians seeking refuge there. Only after the bombing were the ruins of the monastery occupied by German Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) of the 1st Parachute Division, because the ruins provided excellent defensive cover, aiding them in their defence.|$|E
