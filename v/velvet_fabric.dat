Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue <b>velvet</b> <b>fabric</b> he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E

50|$|The {{industrial}} {{history of}} the site begins in 1873, when Arthur Loop founded a company that produced cotton twine on the premises. Although business boomed after the railroad arrived in 1875, the company closed in 1883 {{with the death of}} one of its major backers. The site was taken over in 1892 and expanded by the Boston Finishing Works, which specialized in the finishing of unprocessed cotton cloth. That company closed in 1906, and the site was next used for the production of corduroy and <b>velvet</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In 1930 the site was converted into an automotive maintenance and repair facility, and in 1936 it was purchased by Cornish Wire, which manufactured electrical wires and cabling until 1960. This business declined through the 1970s and 1980s, and its last owner closed it in 2000. In 2005, the town's historic commission ordered the demolition of most of its post-1930 buildings, retaining only the older buildings of the complex.|$|R

5000|$|In the Middle Ages {{the wearing}} of a hood {{was a sign that}} the woman was married. Their forms were {{subjected}} to their respective fashions. Old Bavaria developed the Rococo cap that was in its original form made from white linen and had the hair almost entirely enclosed in a small, circular cap form and fastened with a bow on the top. The ribbon bow at the neck gradually evolved from a functional bow to a mere symbol of a bow, as is typical of a Riegelhaube. With the abolition of the feudal dress code {{at the end of the}} 18th century citizens were allowed in the open streets to wear textiles made with silver and gold. Caps were now being made with precious brocade and <b>velvet</b> <b>fabrics</b> and embroidered with beads and threads of precious metals. The size of the head cover at the same time grew smaller and smaller, becoming held with only [...] "hood pins" [...] made of silver.|$|R
30|$|The fabric {{design and}} {{construction}} can also impact the flammability of soft furnishings. For jacquard woven fabrics, the design can affect the peak heat release rate (PHRR) even if the basic yarn composition within the fabric remains unchanged. For example, design patterns with large motifs may have different burning characteristics than those with small motifs ([Horrocks et al. 2001]). This is extremely important as the PHRR is often a critical performance metric for soft furnishing standards/regulations. One of the approaches to prevent heat transfer through the fabric (to the highly flammable foam core) is to use “pile” fabric structure that have raised fibers on the base fabric. Ignition of pile fibers creates what is called “surface flashing”, {{which is a very}} rapid spread of flames {{across the surface of the}} soft furnishing due to the easy ignitability and rapid consumption of these fibers. With low heat generating fibers, the flame spreads rapidly and consumes the raised fibers without igniting the base <b>fabric.</b> Pile or <b>velvet</b> <b>fabrics</b> are examples of such materials commonly used in residential upholstered furniture.|$|R
5000|$|The {{furnishings}} were of {{an exclusive}} design chosen specially by the housekeeper and a fabric expert from Paris. The wall fabrics are of satin brocade in apricot cream colour; {{they were also}} fitted under the expert's guidance. The walls of the drawing hall, next to the outer hall, were very elegantly furnished with satin fabrics featuring [...] "buttoned braiding at the skirting boards". Numerous lights, elegantly designed, were fitted {{on the walls and}} ceilings. The white marble fitted fireplace, fixed with ornate brass, completed the scene. The staircase in the hall was fitted with a red carpet and the walls of the hall were embellished with coloured <b>velvet</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The dining room walls were covered with curtains made with satin fabrics which added to the grandeur of the dining room along with an elaborate chandelier and a fireplace fitted with black marble. The silver room was fitted with shelves, from flooring to the roof, filled with [...] "tureens, entry dishes, epergnes, teapots and cutlery". The fittings in the bathroom were all made of brass, and the bathtubs were of porcelain.|$|R

40|$|Comfort {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing the performance of apparel such as knitted elastic clothing, woven elastic shirts and elastic <b>velvet</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The compressive behavior of knitted elastic fabric affects the excellence in comfort. This study aimed to investigate the comfort of knitted elastic fabric based on compressive load. For this purpose, fabrics were produced with three different stitch densities (loop sizes), and compressive load tests were applied at three various penetration depths. According to these parameters, 9 fabric samples were prepared. Each sample was tested 30 times; therefore, the total number of examined cases was 270. The compressive load was measured using special designed tools, which were installed on the Instron tensile tester. The effects of penetration depth and loop size on compressive load were evaluated by using the CCD statistical model with four repeats of each experiment. The results indicate that the loop size and penetration depth have significant influence on the compressive load, which is modeled by a third order equation with R 2 of 0. 999 between applied model and experimental data. Consequently, the comfort could be predicted in terms of loop size and penetration depth. Utilizing this method can help apparel manufactures produce knitted elastic clothing with high comfort, according to the end use of garment...|$|R

Attempts are made to relate these scattering characteristics to the physical and the geometrical structure of velvet...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of {{e-commerce}} or virtual prototyping of textile fabrics and garments, tactile stimulators could be very pertinent and useful tools for the industry. The challenge is to stimulate the human hand using a tactile device in order to simulate the textile fabric touch. The principle of the tactile device is described. The kinds of fabrics investigated are pile fabrics, such as velvet. In this study, the illusion of pile is given when touching the smooth plate of the tactile device by modulating the coefficient of friction between the plate and the finger during an active movement. The control signal is qualitatively designed from some tribological features identified in this study as <b>velvet</b> <b>fabric</b> characteristics. The influence of each tribological feature on the tactile rendering is studied via psychophysical studies comparing real and simulated fabrics. The best rendering needs a simulation with three specific features: a coefficient of friction, which depends on the finger movement direction; a transition phase for the change of movement direction; and small amplitude variations of the coefficient of friction with about one millimeter wavelength...|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{material}} science gained in microgravity research requires processing a sample in a high performance furnace. One such furnace currently being designed is the Quench Module Insert (QMI). The Principle Investigators, for whom the furnace is proposed, require high temperature gradients in their cylindrical samples to achieve the science objectives. One of the components critical to achieving high sample axial temperature gradients in the Quench Module Insert is a high performance cold zone to extract {{the heat from the}} sample. This cold zone employs a compliant, sliding thermal interface based on a Vel-Therm felt. This felt provides a conductive path between the Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA) exterior surface and the interior surface of the water cooled chill block while allowing movement of the sample relative to the chill block. The Vel-Therm felt is composed of long polymer-based fibers affixed to a thin flexible substrate layer. The fibers are oriented perpendicular to this substrate giving the felt the appearance of a <b>velvet</b> <b>fabric.</b> The Vel-Therm felt heat extraction capability was quantified in earlier tests performed in an inert gas environment. The current activity, described in this paper, is intended to characterize the extraction capability of Vel-Therm felt in a vacuum environment similar to the QMI environment. This testing is necessary to quantify the thermal performance of the Vel-Therm felt and the sensitivity of that performance to key variables. The data derived from these tests will be incorporated into the current thermal models {{to improve the quality of}} the models and reduce uncertainty of the analytical results. In addition, the data will be used to help select the appropriate Vel-Therm felt and set proper operating limits as well as assess the performance range of the furnace. The objective of this test is to measure the heat extraction rate of the Vel-Therm felt as specified by the effective heat transfer coefficient. Therefore, the test setup was designed to force the bulk of the heat transfer through the area where the Vel-Therm felt was applied. A heat source, consisting of a ceramic heating element encased in a Copper (Cu) housing is mounted on four isolated support rods. A 6 -layer molybdenum radiation shield is used to insulate against heat loss from the heater and prevent heat exchange between the hot and cold sides of the test apparatus. The Vel-Therm felt is affixed to the surface of the cold sink, a water-cooled Cu chill block. An adjustable plate supports and isolates the cold sink from above and is used to control the amount of the deflection of the Vel- Therm when in contact with the Cu heating element housing. The primary means of establishing the power being conducted through the felt is to measure the energy being transferred to the water passing through the chill block. Analysis was performed to support the assumption that the source and sink surfaces were approximately isothermal under the specific test conditions. As a check on the amount of power passing through the felt, the power supplied to the heater was also measured. Thermocouples were strategically located throughout the test apparatus for measurement purposes. A bell jar was lowered over the assembly to impose vacuum conditions. Currently, variables tested have been fiber compression and fiber type and surface temperatures (both the hot and cold side temperatures are hypothesized to be important to the performance of the Vel-Therm.) Selected runs were repeated to ensure consistency and repeatability. Results obtained thus far reveal that Vel-Therm performance is significantly degraded by fibers being exposed to high compression. It also shows that performance is somewhat negatively impacted by previous compression, thereby, raising the question of repeatability. In addition, early results show a significant dependence on temperature. A computer aided mathematical analysis of the test setup is ongoing. The results will be correlated to actual results. The correlation will examine such details as parasitic loses, conduction down the power leads and many other concerns...|$|E
