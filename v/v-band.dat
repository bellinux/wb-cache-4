Three <b>V-bands</b> of "dioctahedral-type" (in the range 3580 – 3520 cm- 1) are characterized by the bulk number of charges of the two adjacent cations: two bands due to OH groups adjacent to an octahedral vacancy and bonded to Fe 2 +Al 3 +square or Fe 2 +Fe 3 +square (range 3580 – 3540 cm- 1); a band due to OH groups bonded to Fe 3 +Fe 3 +square at 3530 cm- 1.

40|$|Abstract. We have {{monitored}} the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric {{variations of the}} classical T Tauri star (CTTS) AA Tau {{over a period of}} a month. The light curve consists of more than 260 measurements in each of the B and <b>V-bands</b> over a continuous time period of 30 days and more than 180 measurements in the R and I-bands. This provides unprecedented detail of the photometric variations of a CTTS on timescales ranging from hours to weeks. We find that AA Tau’s light curve is quite unlike that of most other CTTS. It exhibits a roughly constant brightness level, interrupted by quasi-cyclic fading episodes with an amplitude of 1. 4 mag in BVRI filters. We interpret this behaviour as resulting from quasi-periodic occultations of the stellar photosphere by opaque circumstellar material.

40|$|The class CSs of all semigroups {{that are}} {{embeddable}} in completely simple semi-groups forms a quasivariety. That is, {{it is the}} class of all semigroups that satisfy some set of implications. One of the problems considered in this dissertation involves establishing a set of implications which defines the quasivariety CSs, and determining whether or not CSs can be characterized by a finite set of implications. The development of the free completely simple semigroup on a given semigroup plays the vital part in solving this problem. The free completely simple semigroup (C,γ) on a given semigroup which satisfies certain implications (Qn), n> 1 is constructed, {{and a set of}} implications which defines CSs is obtained by an extensive study of this free completely simple semigroup (C,γ). One of the major results of Malcev concerning group embeddable semigroups is employed in solving {{the other part of the}} problem. It is proved that no finite set of implications will define CSs. The model of the free completely simple semigroup (C,γ) on a given semigroup S is also used to determine the embeddability of S into a completely simple semigroup of right quotients of S. If V is a proper subvariety of the variety of all semigroups then the class of all semigroups of V which are embeddable in completely simple semigroups forms a quasivariety. As for CSs, similar questions concerning V∩ CSs are treated and a finite set of implications which defines the members of V∩ CSs is presented. For n> 1, the class (CS(Nn)) s of all semigroups that are embeddable in completely simple semigroups over nilpotent groups of class n forms a quasivariety. The approach of Neumann and Taylor regarding semigroups that are embeddable in nilpotent groups is followed in obtaining a finite set of implications which defines (CS(Nn)) s. In addition, a structural description of the members of (CS(Nn)) s is obtained.

40|$|Between 1999 and 2001, three {{measurements}} changed Cosmology forever: {{the discovery}} of Cosmic Acceleration (Riess et al. 1998, Perlmutter et al. 1999) indicated that {{the density of the}} Universe is dominated by some kind of repulsive energy of unknown nature (namely Dark Energy). The measurement of the first acoustic peak in the CMB temperature anisotropy spectrum (de Bernardis et al. 2000) combined with the precise determination of H 0 (Freedman et al. 2001) gave strong constraints on the flatness of space-time. These measurements contributed to solve the persisting disagreements between the observations that were favouring a low density of matter, and theoretical motivations for a higher-density (critical) Universe. It favoured the emergence of the Standard Model of Cosmology (CDM) that describes nearly all of today's observations with only a handful of free parameters (Planck Collaboration et al. 2013 b). Cosmology has now entered an era of precision measurements, and the goal of observations is now to hunt for "tensions" within the cosmological model. The case of Supernova cosmology is very characteristic of this situation. The measurement of luminosity distances to SNe-Ia as a function of their redshift allowed one to discover (with less than 100 supernovae) the acceleration of cosmic expansion. Today, SNe-Ia are still the most sensitive probe to w, the Dark Energy equation of state parameter, and growing number of SNe-Ia are being detected and studied by several Collaborations all over the world, in order to pin down the value of w, and to start ruling out Dark Energy models. The precision on w is now as low as 7 % (Conley et al. 2011, Sullivan et al. 2011) with nearly 1000 SNe-Ia in the Hubble diagram. Unfortunately, the measurement is now dominated by systematic uncertainties, the dominant source of systematics being the photometric calibration of the imagers used to measure the SNe-Ia fluxes. This work is about photometric calibration. This is a rather esoteric subject, which is seldom chosen by PhD students. But the thing is that, to improve on the current results, astronomers {{have no choice but to}} revisit the ancient calibration schemes. Since 2005, most Dark Energy Collaborations (with the invaluable help of the HST calibration program) have launched ambitious calibration efforts, redefined primary standards and metrology between those standards and their science images and push down their error budget well below 1 % (e. g. Betoule et al. 2012). One suspect however, that these techniques, which rely on observations of stellar calibrators, will not allow one to reach the calibration requirements of future surveys. For this reason, several groups in the world are working on experimental laboratory sources, that would allow one to inject very well characterised light into the telescope optics and derive, from these measurements, the telescope throughput as a function of wavelength. Since 2007, LPNHE cosmology group has been involved in the construction of a spectro-photometric calibration system for the last generation of wide field imagers (Barrelet and Juramy 2008). In particular, the team has designed and built two devices: SnDICE (Supernovae Direct Illumination Calibration Experiment) and SkyDICE (SkyMapper Direct Illumination Calibration Experiment), the first installed in the enclosure of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on top of Mauna Kea, and the other in the dome of SkyMapper (Siding Springs Observatory, NSW, Australia). I started my PhD a few months after the project was funded. I was involved in nearly all stages of the project, in particular the integration and the calibration of the device on our test bench, as well as the installation and commissioning at Siding Springs. I then spent my third year analysing the commissioning data. We have shown that it is possible to build a LED based light source that samples evenly the full visible wavelength range. The stability of the source is remarkable, ranging from a few 10 − 4 for a few of the LEDs, to 10 − 3 for the less stable channels. I have detailed the spectrophotometric characterisation of the device on our test bench at LPNHE. More importantly, I have shown that it is possible to build a smooth spectrophotometric model of each LED, that can predict the LED spectrum at any temperature (in a temperature range representative of what is measured in the telescope enclosure). Each of these models comes with an uncertainty budget that accounts for (1) -the finite number of spectroscopic and photometric measurements and (2) -the test bench uncertainties. Finally, I have described a method to calibrate the effective passbands of the imager, and monitor their fronts from series of calibration frames taken with SkyDICE. This method takes into account all the test bench uncertainties are propagate them as exactly as possible to the final result. It is currently being applied to the real SkyDICE dataset, and what has been presented here is a set of tests performed on (realistic) simulated datasets. A important result of this work is that, despite the fact that the LEDs are not monochromatic sources, we are able to control the position of the filter fronts with an accuracy well below 1 -nm. Regarding the passband inter-calibration, we have computed the expected uncertainties affecting our estimates of the passband normalisation, relative to the r-band. These uncertainties actually depend on how we interpret the uncertainties that affect the calibration of the NIST photodiode. In the best-case scenario, where the NIST uncertainties are all positively correlated, we have shown that after a few calibration runs, we get down to a precision of 0. 4 % in the u and <b>v-bands</b> (near-UV) and of 0. 3 % in the other bands. Depending on how we estimate the CALSPEC uncertainties (which are themselves uncertain), this result is either a major improvement on CALSPEC, or on par with what can be obtained with CALSPEC. In any case, this means that by using routinely a DICE source to calibrate a survey telescope, we should be able to test the CALSPEC flux scale. The analysis of the SkyDICE commissioning dataset is still ongoing. The main missing ingredient is the control of the relative positions of the telescope and the sources, as well as an estimate of the pollution of the calibration frames. These two aspects of the analysis are actively worked on, and the first constrains should be published soon. La cosmologie est maintenant entré dans une ère de mesures de précision, et l'objectif des observations est maintenant la chasse aux contradictions au sein du Modèle Cosmologique. La mesure des distances de luminosité de SNe Ia en fonction de leur décalage vers le rouge a permis de découvrir l'accélération de l'expansion cosmique. Aujourd'hui, les SNe-Ia sont encore la sonde la plus sensible à w, l'équation d'état de l'énergie noire, et le nombre croissant de SNe-Ia sont détectés et étudiés par plusieurs collaborations partout dans le monde, afin d'affiner la mesure du valeur de w. La précision sur w est maintenant aussi bas que 7 %, avec près de 1000 SNe-Ia dans le diagramme de Hubble. Malheureusement, la mesure est désormais dominé par les incertitudes systématiques, la principale source de la systématique en étant l'étalonnage photométrique des imageurs utilisés pour mesurer le flux des SNe Ia. Ce travail de thèse a pour sujet l'étalonnage photométrique. Pour améliorer les résultats actuels, les astronomes n'ont pas d'autre choix que de revoir les systèmes d'étalonnage anciens. Depuis 2005, les collaborations sur l'énergie noire ont lancé des efforts d'étalonnage ambitieux, redéfini les standards primaires et la métrologie entre ces standards et leurs images scientifiques pour pousser le budget d'erreur bien inférieure à 1 %. Depuis 2008, le groupe de Cosmologie de l'LPNHE a été impliqué dans la construction d'un système d'étalonnage spectrophotométrique pour la dernière génération des imageurs grand-champ. En particulier, l'équipe a conçu et construit SkyDICE (SkyMapper Direct Illumination Calibration Experiment), installé dans le dôme du télescope SkyMapper (Observatoire Siding Springs, Australie). Dans ce projet nous avons montré qu'il est possible de construire une source lumineuse à base des LEDs qui échantillonnent uniformément toute la gamme des longueur d'ondes visible du télescope SkyMapper. La stabilité de la source est remarquable, allant de quelques 10 - 4 pour la majorité des LEDs, à 10 − 3 pour les canaux les moins stables. J'ai détaillé l'étalonnage spectrophotométrique de l'appareil sur notre banc de test au LPNHE. Plus important encore, j'ai montré qu'il est possible de construire un modèle spectrophotométrique de chaque LED, qui peut prédire le spectre des LEDs à n'importe quelle température T. Chacun de ces modèles est livré avec un budget d'incertitude que représente (1) -le nombre limité de mesures spectroscopiques et photométriques et (2) -les incertitudes du banc de test. Enfin, j'ai décrit une méthode pour calibrer les bandes passantes effectives de l'imageur, et de surveiller les filtre avec des sériés d'images d'étalonnage prises avec SkyDICE. Cette méthode prend en compte toutes les incertitudes du banc d'essai et le propage aussi exactement que possible. Le méthode est actuellement appliqué à l'ensemble de données réelles de SkyDICE, et ce qui a été présenté ici est un ensemble de tests effectués sur des ensembles de données simulées. Un résultat important de ce travail est que, malgré le fait que les LEDs ne sont pas des sources monochromatiques, nous sommes en mesure de contrôler la position des fronts de filtre avec une précision bien inférieure à 1 -nm. En ce qui concerne la bande passante étalonné, nous avons calculé les incertitudes affectant nos estimations sur la normalisation de la bande passante, par rapport à la bande r. Dans le meilleur scénario, où les incertitudes sont tous corrélés positivement, nous avons montré que, après quelques analyses d'étalonnage, nous nous attelons à une précision d'environ 0, 4 % dans les bandes u et v et d'environ 0, 3 % dans les autres bandes. L'analyse de l'ensemble de données des SkyDICE est toujours en cours et le premier contraintes seront publiés bientôt...|$|R

5000|$|Catalogues of Double Periodic Variables {{are given}} by Mennickent, Otero and Kołaczkowski (2016), Pawlak et al. (2013) and Poleski et al. (2010). Some few {{examples}} are given below.The following list contains selected double periodic variables {{that are of}} interest to amateur or professional astronomy. Unless otherwise noted, the given magnitudes are in the <b>V-band.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the V {{band and}} E band spectrum, {{wireless}} systems can utilize the significantly larger allocated spectrum and channels to deliver multi-Gigabit data rates. This enables a simple, robust, and low cost modem and radio design. Thus, <b>V-Band</b> and E-Band, millimeter-wave wireless systems provide significant cost advantages over 6-38 GHz wireless systems - allowing scaling capacity to Gigabit capacities, without additional radio equipment and licensing fees ...|$|E

[...] This would include [...] "720 LEO <b>V-band</b> satellites at 1,200 kilometers, and another constellation in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) of 1,280 satellites." ...|$|E
50|$|The bolometric {{correction}} {{scale is}} {{set by the}} absolute magnitude of the Sun and an adopted bolometric magnitude for the Sun. The choice of adopted solar absolute magnitude, bolometric correction, and absolute bolometric magnitude are not arbitrary, although some classic references have tabulated mutually incompatible values for these quantities. The bolometric scale historically had varied somewhat in the literature, with the Sun's bolometric correction in <b>V-band</b> varying from -0.19 to -0.07 magnitude.|$|E
5000|$|... 104 Aquarii (abbreviated 104 Aqr) {{is a star}} in the {{equatorial}} constellation of Aquarius. 104 Aquarii is the Flamsteed designation, although it also bears the Bayer designation A2 Aquarii. Based on an annual parallax shift of only 3.89 ± 0.25 milliarcseconds, the distance to this star is about [...] At that range, the brightness of the star in the <b>V-band</b> is reduced by 0.10 magnitudes as a result of extinction caused by intervening gas and dust.|$|E
