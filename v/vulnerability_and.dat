5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The <b>vulnerability</b> <b>and</b> {{seasonal}} availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, it was {{believed}} the B-1 could be in operation before the ATB, covering the transitional period between the B-52's increasing <b>vulnerability</b> <b>and</b> the ATB's introduction. Reagan decided the best solution was to procure both the B-1 and ATB, and on 2 October 1981 he announced that 100 B-1s were to be ordered to fill the LRCA role.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, {{in which}} {{biological}} <b>vulnerability</b> <b>and</b> adverse environmental events {{are seen to}} interact. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|The company {{enters the}} black forest of Mirkwood without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders {{and then from}} the dungeons of the Wood-elves. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the {{travellers}} are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A thrush had overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's <b>vulnerability</b> <b>and</b> reports it to Lake-town defender Bard. His arrow finds the chink and slays the dragon.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Skanderbeg {{celebrated the}} event by dining off letnica (Ohrid trout), a fish found in Lake Ohrid {{that was sent}} to the Byzantine {{emperors}} every Friday for their supper meal. The twelve captured officers were ransomed for 40,000 ducats. Skanderbeg distributed this amount through his force, with every man receiving his fair share. He then besieged Ohrid for a short time before returning to Albania; the Venetian Senate hailed the campaign as a victory despite not being able to take Ohrid. The crusade seemed to have gone well for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope and handed the money raised for the crusade to the Venetians. Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's <b>vulnerability</b> <b>and</b> sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced Şeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Krujë.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent any}} action against his testament's {{provisions}} for his son's succession and the regency, Theodore {{on his deathbed}} demanded an oath to be taken by Senate, army, people and clergy, both those present at court and those absent elsewhere in the state. Immediately after his death, George Mouzalon, aware of his <b>vulnerability</b> <b>and</b> his complete lack of support, called an assembly of the leading nobles, officials, and military commanders. He offered to resign from his post in favour of any person that the assembly chose, but the dignitaries, led by Michael Palaiologos, dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay on and even accepted {{to take an oath}} of loyalty to him {{as well as to the}} young emperor. It was a sham, as a conspiracy by the leading aristocratic families was well under way to depose him, in which Palaiologos apparently played a covert but leading role.|$|E

25|$|The {{short-term}} psychological {{injuries to}} the victims include feelings of fear, helplessness, sadness, disorientation, isolation, <b>vulnerability,</b> <b>and</b> desperation. If left untreated, the psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly. Causes of death {{as the result of}} sexual violence include suicide and murder.

25|$|Agonistic {{attacks are}} {{motivated}} not by hunger nor fear {{but rather by}} aggression; designed to kill or drive off a competitor away from a territory or food source.

Even when pressed until {{the death of the}} victim, agonistic attacks normally leave the victims body uneaten, at least for some time.|$|E
25|$|The pilots {{liked the}} Fw 190 {{very much as}} far as handling, {{performance}} and armament was concerned.

Especially against bombers the Fw 190 was by far superior because of its heavy armament, its lower <b>vulnerability,</b> <b>and</b> its better protection for the pilot. All these features were favourable for bomber and schlachtflieger operations.|$|E

The complex-wide <b>vulnerabilities</b> <b>and</b> concerns were identified in the Fina 7 Report Complex-Wide Review of DOE ~ Low-Leve 7 Waste Management ES&H Vu 7 nerabilities, of May 1996. This Corrective Action Plan was prepared to identify and allow tracking of actions necessary to address these complex-wide <b>vulnerabilities</b> <b>and</b> concerns, including their time-lines, milestones, and their relative resource impacts. The Corrective Action Plan establishes the Task Initiatives of the Implementation Plan through which {{the resolution of the}} six complex-wide <b>vulnerabilities</b> <b>and</b> three concerns will be accomplished.
