In December 2008, Bernard Madoff was arrested for running a US$50 billion Ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one. Several feeder hedge funds, of which the largest was Fairfield Sentry, channeled money to it.

Program verification is called formal if both the semantics of the specifications and the program execution are defined formally as mathematical entities. The verification is called automatic if it is performed automatically without interaction or with limited interaction with a user. Our approach is targeted towards the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the preservation of heap-topological properties. It is also aimed towards the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the effects and the frame properties of the program statements.

40|$|Abstract: There are {{two main}} streams for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> digital systems: Theorem proving methods such as term {{rewriting}} are used for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> data oriented systems, and model checking of temporal logics is usually used for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> control dominated systems. While theorem proving is an inherently interactive verification method, model checking is performed automatically. In this paper, we investigate for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> algorithms for computing the discrete cosine transform by means of term rewriting and model checking. We show {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of both approaches at different abstraction levels of the design. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite many {{advances}} that enable {{the application of}} model checking techniques to the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> large systems, the state-explosion problem remains the main challenge for scalability. Composi-tional verification addresses this challenge by decomposing the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> a large system into the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> its components. Recent techniques use learning-based approaches to automate com-positional verification based on the assume-guarantee style reasoning. However, these techniques are only applicable to finite-state systems. In this work, we propose a new framework that interleaves abstraction and learning to perform automated compositional <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> infinite-state systems. We also discuss the role of learning and abstraction in the related context of interface generation for infinite-state components. ...|$|R
