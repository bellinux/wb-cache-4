40|$|Implied <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> have mushroomed {{over the}} last decade in {{international}} equity markets. Specifically, newly created <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> follow the VIX methodology implemented by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange in 2003. In this thesis, we construct two different sets of implied <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> for the US fixed-income market and analyze whether documented properties of equity-based <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> apply to fixed-income <b>volatility</b> <b>indices.</b> The first set of <b>volatility</b> <b>indices,</b> which are named interest rate <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> (IRVIXs), reflect the market expectations of volatility of short-term interest rates over both short- and long-term horizons (from one to ten years). To this end, we use the implied volatilities of caplets (floorlets) recovered from the implied volatility quotes of caps (floors). Based on IRVIXs, we investigate two stylized facts of equity-based <b>volatility</b> <b>indices,</b> namely, the negative correlation with the underlying asset and the presence of implied volatility spillovers across international equity markets. We find that IRVIXs are negatively correlated with the underlying forward interest rates and that there is evidence of implied volatility transmission not only across international equity markets but also across equity and fixed-income markets. The second set of fixed-income <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> that we develop in this thesis capture the market expected volatility of five-year and ten-year Treasury notes and 30 -year Treasury bond futures over the remaining 30 days. These are named Treasury bond <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> (TBVIXs). We calculate TBVIXs based on the concept of the model-free implied variance derived by Britten-Jones and Neuberger (2000), which is closely related to the VIX formula. We employ the Treasury bond <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> to investigate whether two additional features of equity-based <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> which {{have been reported in the}} literature hold. On the one hand, we obtain that TBVIXs spike upward during unexpected market and global events such as the Kuwait invasion by Iraq or the more recent Lehman Brothers failure. On the other hand, we find evidence that TBVIXs fall following scheduled news announcements about macroeconomic fundamentals such as the nonfarm payrolls report or Federal Open Market Committee meetings. Thus, these findings are consistent with the empirical evidence from equity-based <b>volatility</b> <b>indices.</b> References: Britten-Jones, M., Neuberger, A., 2000.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} cross-market {{dependence}} between five popular equity indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, DAX 30, FTSE 100, and Nikkei 225), and their corresponding <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> (VIX, VXN, VDAX, VFTSE, and VXJ). In particular, we propose a dynamic mixed copula approach which {{is able to}} capture the time-varying tail dependence coefficient (TDC). The findings indicate the existence of financial contagion and significant asymmetric TDCs for major international equity markets. In some situations, although contagion cannot be clearly detected by stock index movements, it can be captured by dependence between <b>volatility</b> <b>indices.</b> The results imply that contagion is not only reflected in the first moment of index returns, but also the second moment, i. e. the volatility. Results also show that dependence between <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> is more easily influenced by financial shocks and reflects the instantaneous information faster than the stock market indices...|$|R

40|$|Price {{volatility}} {{analysis has}} been reported in the literature for most competitive electricity markets around the world. However, no studies have been published yet that quantify price volatility in the Ontario electricity market, which is the focus of the present paper. In this paper, a comparative volatility analysis is conducted for the Ontario market and its neighboring electricity markets. <b>Volatility</b> <b>indices</b> are developed based on historical volatility and price velocity concepts, previously applied to other electricity market prices, and employed in the present work. The analysis is carried out in two scenarios: in the first scenario, the <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> are determined for the entire price time series. In the second scenario, the price time series are broken up into 24 time series for each of the 24 h and <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> are calculated for each specific hour separately. The <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> are also applied to the locational marginal prices of several pricing points in the New England, New York, and PJM electricity markets. The outcomes reveal that price volatility is significantly higher in Ontario than the three studied neighboring electricity markets. Furthermore, comparison of {{the results of this study}} with similar findings previously published for 15 other electricity markets demonstrates that the Ontario electricity market is one of the most volatile electricity markets world-wide. This high volatility is argued to be associated with the fact that Ontario is a single-settlement, real-time market...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} couple of decades, the number of <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> has {{increased}} rapidly. These indices seek to represent the market’s expectation of realized volatility over the coming month, based on the prices of options traded on each underlying equity index. Although the dynamics of realized volatility spillover have been studied extensively, very few studies exists that examine the spillover between these <b>volatility</b> <b>indices.</b> By using DAG-based structural vector autoregression, this paper provides evidence that implied volatility spillover differs from realized volatility spillover.

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the modelling and trading of three daily market implied <b>volatility</b> <b>indices</b> issued on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) using evolving combinations of prominent autoregressive and emerging heuristics models, with the aims of introducing an algorithm that provides a better approximation {{of the most popular}} U.

A heterogeneous autoregressive process (HAR) is combined with a genetic algorithm–support vector regression (GASVR) model in two hybrid algorithms. The algorithms’ statistical performances are benchmarked against the best forecasters on the VIX, VXN and VXD <b>volatility</b> <b>indices.</b> The trading performances of the forecasts are evaluated through a trading simulation based on VIX and VXN futures contracts, {{as well as on the}} VXZ exchange traded note based on the S&# 38;P 500 VIX mid-term futures index.

For robustness purposes, we build two trading strategies based on the aforementioned forecasts, which further confirm that the SSA-HW and the ARI-SSA-HW are able to generate significantly higher net daily returns in the out-of-sample period...|$|R

The frequency of regime shifts in volatility expectations is affected by the onset of financial crises, which have the effect of increasing the likelihood of regimes driven by lower autoregressive effects and faster speeds of adjustment.

40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} efficiency, {{information}} content and unbiasedness of volatility forecasts {{based on the}} VIX/VXN implied <b>volatility</b> <b>indexes,</b> RiskMetrics and GARCHtype models at the 5 -, 10 - and 22 -day time horizon. Our empirical application focuses on the S&P 100 and NASDAQ 100 indexes. We also deal with the information content of the competing volatility forecasts in a market risk (VaR type) evaluation framework. The performance of the models is evaluated using LR, independence, conditional coverage and density forecast tests. Our results show that volatility forecasts based on the VIX/VXN indexes have the highest information content, both in the volatility forecasting and market risk assessment frameworks. Because they are easy-to-use and compare very favorably with much more complex econometric models that use historical returns, we argue that options and futures exchanges should compute implied <b>volatility</b> <b>indexes</b> and make these available to investors. ...|$|R

Particularly, VIX undervalues (overvalues) volatility when market return {{is expected to be}} negatively (positively) skewed. Alternatively, they develop a model-free generalized <b>volatility</b> <b>index</b> (GVIX). With no diffusion assumption, GVIX is formulated directly from the definition of log-return variance, and VIX is a special case of the GVIX. Empirically, VIX generally understates the true volatility, and the estimation errors considerably enlarge during volatile markets. In addition, the spread between GVIX and VIX (GV-Spread) follows a mean-reverting process.|$|E
