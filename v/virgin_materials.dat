40|$|Changes in Pd- 110 /Pd- 108 ratios {{as well as}} the {{concentration}} of silver, gold, zinc, cobalt, iridium and lithium- 7 / 6 ratios have been measured using neutron activation analysis (NAA) and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) on a set of four samples of particulate palladium exposed to high-pressure deuterium gas in the hollow core of Arata-Zhang cathodes. Three samples were from cathodes producing excess heat (10 ’s of megajoules) over a period of several-months electrolysis, while the fourth was virgin powder from the same batch as that of the active samples. If a nuclear process is the source of these changes, then multi-isotope elements such as silver, zinc, and iridium should show significant deviations in their isotopic ratios from the natural terrestrial values. Surface trace lithium did indeed show such differences from that of the <b>virgin</b> <b>material.</b> The Ag- 109 / 107 ratio is currently under study by accelerator mass spectroscopy (AMS) for the one sample showing the greatest difference in Ag- 109 content from that of the <b>virgin</b> <b>material.</b> Since these variations may have explanations unrelated to nuclear reactions, these results are not yet definitive.

50|$|San Francisco's Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance also {{contributes}} to the San Francisco Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most greenhouse gases attributed to waste {{are the result of}} energy consumed in lifecycle stages upstream from the landfill (materials extraction, pre-manufacture, manufacture, and transport), not from the landfill itself. In 2001, San Francisco’s actions to divert materials from Altamont landfill into recycled products reduced greenhouse gas emissions from these upstream lifecycle stages by the equivalent of 768,000 tons of carbon dioxide, vs. manufacturing these same products from <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b> This shift away from <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> represents a 75-80% savings in net greenhouse gas emissions for paper, glass, copper, and steel, and a 97.5% savings for aluminum. The recycling of paper has an additional carbon sequestration effect through forest conservation. Diversion of organic material into composting also reduces greenhouse emissions, since applying compost as a soil amendment helps to sequester carbon. In this vein, San Francisco’s mandatory recycling and composting ordinance supports the city’s 2002 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Resolution to reduce emissions to 20% less than 1990 levels by no later than 2012.|$|E

50|$|The few {{standards}} for CCS were developed more than 40 {{years ago and}} have changed little since. Some of the current standards evolved from 2D planar geosynthetics, and as such, {{do not reflect the}} composite behavior of 3D geometry of CCS, nor do they test long-term parameters such as: dynamic loading, permanent plastic deformation, effect of temperatures, environmental durability, etc. On the other hand ISO/ASTM procedures have been developed for testing polymers in the space and automobile industries, as well as for other geosynthetic products. These new {{standards for}} CCS were proposed and under discussion by leading experts in geosynthetics in ASTM technical committee D-35. The stated goal is to set new industry standards that more accurately reflect 3D cellular confinement system geometry and material performance in the field rather than lab tests of individual strips and <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> that are typically used today. Although international guidelines require the use of the most updated applicable standards, only one geocell manufacturer has done so to date. An example of one such standard is the SIM - Stepped Isothermal Method (ASTM D-6992) was specifically created for the accelerated creep testing of polymers. This test is important as creep resistance is critical to maintaining confinement, and the functioning of the geocell in the project over time.|$|E

Among the major causes of inefficiencies related to waste are biased tax policies and regulations, which comprise indirect subsidisation of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials.</b> Heavier taxation of <b>virgin</b> <b>materials</b> and less taxation of labour contribute to changes in relative factor prices which better reflect the social value of the resources, without increasing the overall costs.

40|$|Materials that pyrolyze at {{elevated}} temperature have been commonly used as thermal protection materials in hypersonic flight, and advanced pyrolyzing materials {{for this purpose}} continue to be developed. Because of the large temperature gradients that can arise in thermal protection materials, significant thermal stresses can develop. Advanced applications of pyrolytic materials are calling for more complex heatshield configurations, making accurate thermal stress analysis more important, and more challenging. For non-pyrolyzing materials, many finite element codes are available and capable of performing coupled thermal-mechanical analyses. These codes do not, however, have a built-in capability to perform analyses that include pyrolysis effects. When a pyrolyzing material is heated, one or more components of the original <b>virgin</b> <b>material</b> pyrolyze and create a gas. This gas flows away from the pyrolysis zone to the surface, resulting in a reduction in surface heating. A porous residue, referred to as char, remains {{in place of the}} <b>virgin</b> <b>material.</b> While the processes involved can be complex, it has been found that a simple physical model in which <b>virgin</b> <b>material</b> reacts to form char and pyrolysis gas, will yield satisfactory analytical results. Specifically, the effects that must be modeled include: (1) Variation of thermal properties (density, specific heat, thermal conductivity) as the material composition changes; (2) Energy released or absorbed by the pyrolysis reactions; (3) Energy convected by the flow of pyrolysis gas from the interior to the surface; (4) The reduction in surface heating due to surface blowing; and (5) Chemical and mass diffusion effects at the surface between the pyrolysis gas and edge gas Computational tools for the one-dimensional thermal analysis these materials exist and have proven to be reliable design tools.
