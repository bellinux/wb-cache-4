An initial VAD decision is used to control the noise estimate update in the spectral subtraction algorithm. The more accurate VAD after the first spectral subtraction is then used to reprocess the original noisy speech again via spectral subtraction to reduce the noise while not attenuating the speech. Auditory masking thresholds were used to weight the spectral subtraction to avoid the introduction of musical noise artifacts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} noise-robust voice activity detection (VAD) utilizing the periodicity of the signal, full band signal energy and high band to low band signal energy ratio. Conventional VADs are sensitive to a variably noisy environment especially with low SNR, and also result in cutting off unvoiced regions of speech as well as random oscillating of <b>output</b> <b>VAD</b> decisions. To overcome these problems, the proposed algorithm first identifies voiced regions of speech and then differentiates unvoiced regions from silence or background noise using the energy ratio and total signal energy. The performance of the proposed VAD algorithm is tested on real speech signals. Comparisons confirm that the proposed VAD algorithm outperforms the conventional VAD algorithms, especially {{in the presence of}} background noise...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, first, major speech {{characteristics}} are highlighted using a running spectral filter (RSF) [27]. Next, masks are composed using {{the first and}} second derivatives of the log power spectra of the RSF output through heuristic rules. These masks, which consist of binary values, are then multiplied by spectra, expressed in decimal form, to obtain speech period candidates. Since not all subband signals may contribute to the VAD decision, we consider obtaining the speech period candidates for individual subbands. These speech period candidates, together with the log power spectra, are input into a DNN to obtain the <b>VAD</b> <b>output.</b> The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to a DNN-based VAD method that utilizes the log power spectra alone.|$|E
30|$|Usually, VADs {{look for}} clues of speech {{presence}} (i.e., harmonicity, periodicity, energy, long-term variability) {{but do not}} give any idea about if the found speech region is useful for recognition, or how many bands include speech information. As mentioned before, exactly separating the noise and the speech is not possible. Therefore, an output speech of a robust VAD may not cover the same speech/speaker information as its clean equivalent does. Especially for the low SNR signals, directly using the <b>VAD</b> <b>output</b> is not suitable, because of the nonlinear transformation effect of the additive noise on the low energy frames [35]. Missing data approach tries to compensate this issue; however, its performance highly depends on the estimation of the spectral mask, where a poor estimation reduces the recognition performance [36].|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the first}} {{real-time}} implementation and perceptual {{evaluation of a}} singular value decomposition (SVD) -based optimal filtering technique for noise reduction in a dual microphone behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid is presented. This evaluation was carried out for a speech weighted noise and multitalker babble, for single and multiple jammer sound source scenarios. Two basic microphone configurations in the hearing aid were used. The SVD-based optimal filtering technique was compared against an adaptive beamformer, which is known to give significant improvements in speech intelligibility in noisy environment. The optimal filtering technique works without assumptions about a speaker position, unlike the two-stage adaptive beamformer. However this strategy needs a robust voice activity detector (VAD). A method to improve {{the performance of the}} VAD was presented and evaluated physically. By connecting the <b>VAD</b> to the <b>output</b> of the noise reduction algorithms, a good discrimination between the speech-and-noise periods and the noise-only periods of the signals was obtained. The perceptual experiments demonstrated that the SVD-based optimal filtering technique could perform as well as the adaptive beamformer in a single noise source scenario, i. e., the ideal scenario for the latter technique, and could outperform the adaptive beamformer in multiple noise source scenarios. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} two decades heart disease has been the highest single cause of death for the human population. With an {{alarming}} number of patients requiring heart transplant, and donations not able to satisfy the demand, treatment looks to mechanical alternatives. Rotary Ventricular Assist Devices, VADs, are miniature pumps which can be implanted alongside the heart to assist its pumping function. These constant flow devices are smaller, more efficient and promise a longer operational life than more traditional pulsatile VADs. The development of rotary VADs has focused on single pumps assisting the left ventricle only to supply blood for the body. In many patients however, failure of both ventricles demands that an additional pulsatile device be used to support the failing right ventricle. This condition renders them hospital bound while they wait for an unlikely heart donation. Reported attempts to use two rotary pumps to support both ventricles concurrently have warned of inherent haemodynamic instability. Poor balancing of the pumps’ flow rates quickly leads to vascular congestion increasing the risk of oedema and ventricular ‘suckdown’ occluding the inlet to the pump. This thesis introduces a novel Bi-Ventricular Assist Device (BiVAD) configuration where the pump outputs are passively balanced by vascular pressure. The BiVAD consists of two rotary pumps straddling the mechanical passive controller. Fluctuations in vascular pressure induce small deflections within both pumps adjusting their outputs allowing them to maintain arterial pressure. To optimise the passive controller’s interaction with the circulation, the controller’s dynamic response is optimised with a spring, mass, damper arrangement. This two part study presents a comprehensive assessment of the prototype’s ‘viability’ as a support device. Its ‘viability’ was considered based on its sensitivity to pathogenic haemodynamics and the ability of the passive response to maintain healthy circulation. The first part of the study is an experimental investigation where a prototype device was designed and built, and then tested in a pulsatile mock circulation loop. The BiVAD was subjected to a range of haemodynamic imbalances as well as a dynamic analysis to assess the functionality of the mechanical damper. The second part introduces the development of a numerical program to simulate human circulation supported by the passively controlled BiVAD. Both investigations showed that the prototype was able to mimic the native baroreceptor response. Simulating hypertension, poor flow balancing and subsequent ventricular failure during BiVAD support allowed the passive controller’s response to be assessed. Triggered by the resulting pressure imbalance, the controller responded by passively adjusting the <b>VAD</b> <b>outputs</b> in order to maintain healthy arterial pressures. This baroreceptor-like response demonstrated the inherent stability of the auto regulating BiVAD prototype. Simulating pulmonary hypertension in the more observable numerical model, however, revealed a serious issue with the passive response. The subsequent decrease in venous return into the left heart went unnoticed by the passive controller. Meanwhile the coupled nature of the passive response not only decreased RVAD output to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure, but it also increased LVAD output. Consequently, the LVAD increased fluid evacuation from the left ventricle, LV, and so actually accelerated the onset of LV collapse. It was concluded that despite the inherently stable baroreceptor-like response of the passive controller, its lack of sensitivity to venous return made it unviable in its present configuration. The study revealed a number of other important findings. Perhaps the most significant was that the reduced pulse experienced during constant flow support unbalanced the ratio of effective resistances of both vascular circuits. Even during steady rotary support therefore, the resulting ventricle volume imbalance increased the likelihood of suckdown. Additionally, mechanical damping of the passive controller’s response successfully filtered out pressure fluctuations from residual ventricular function. Finally, the importance of recognising inertial contributions to blood flow in the atria and ventricles in a numerical simulation were highlighted. This thesis documents the first attempt to create a fully auto regulated rotary cardiac assist device. Initial results encourage development of an inlet configuration sensitive to low flow such as collapsible inlet cannulae. Combining this with the existing baroreceptor-like response of the passive controller will render a highly stable passively controlled BiVAD configuration. The prototype controller’s passive interaction with the vasculature is a significant step towards a highly stable new generation of artificial heart...|$|R
30|$|Two {{methods were}} {{selected}} to compare {{the performance of the}} proposed VAD algorithm. One of these methods was the noise tracking algorithm proposed in [21] (called Rangachari’s method from here on). This algorithm works on the frequency bins of the conventional spectrum, but, to make a fair comparison, it was modified to work on the mel spectrum, similar to the algorithm proposed in this paper. Also, the noise tracking algorithm does not explicitly indicate the speech-active regions (although it gives a speech presence probability, it is not suitable to use it directly as a <b>VAD</b> <b>output).</b> Therefore, after the noise spectrum was estimated, and the speech was enhanced with the spectral subtraction method, the frames that had an energy higher than the average energy of all frames were accepted as speech regions. All of the other parameters were the same as given in [21].|$|E
30|$|Robustness against {{background}} noise {{is a major}} research area for speech-related applications such as speech recognition and speaker recognition. One of the many solutions for this problem is to detect speech-dominant regions by using a voice activity detector (VAD). In this paper, a second-order polynomial regression-based algorithm is proposed with a similar function as a VAD for text-independent speaker verification systems. The proposed method aims to separate steady noise/silence regions, steady speech regions, and speech onset/offset regions. The regression is applied independently to each filter band of a mel spectrum, which makes the algorithm fit seamlessly to the conventional extraction process of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The k-means algorithm is also applied to estimate average noise energy in each band for spectral subtraction. A pseudo SNR-dependent linear thresholding for the final <b>VAD</b> <b>output</b> decision is introduced based on the k-means energy centers. This thresholding considers the speech presence in each band. Conventional VADs usually neglect the deteriorative effects of the additive noise in the speech regions. Contrary to this, the proposed method decides {{not only for the}} speech presence, but also if the frame is dominated by the speech, or the noise. Performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a continuous noise tracking method, and another VAD method in speaker verification experiments, where five different noise types at five different SNR levels were considered. The proposed algorithm showed superior verification performance both with the conventional GMM-UBM method, and the state-of-the-art i-vector method.|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic mock circulatory {{systems have}} low {{flexibility}} to allow tests of different cardiovascular devices and low precision when a reference model must be reproduced. In this paper a new bench is described. It combines the computer {{model of the}} environment in which the device will operate and the electro-hydraulic interfaces by which device and computer are connected. A models library provided with basic functions allows implementing many layouts of the bench, which in turn depend both on the device properties and the desired experiment. In case of an apical LVAD evaluation, the bench can reproduce right and left ventricles, pulmonary and systemic circulations, inlet and outlet LVAD cannulas. An interface forces the instantaneous calculated flow at the VAD input and feeds back the measured pressure to the computer; another interface works in a similar -but complementary- way at the <b>VAD</b> <b>output.</b> The paper focuses on the operating principle of the electro hydraulic interfaces which represent a relevant component of the bench, on the RT-Linux-based software architecture, on the models of the basic elements of the bench. A patent is under preparation. At the moment, only a portion of the bench has been developed. It consists of a piston-cylinder mechanism, which mimics the elastance-based mechanism of a natural ventricle, and a hydraulic circuit representing the arterial load according to a modified windkessel model and the venous return according to the Guyton's model. The pump is driven by a real-time simulation of the cardiovascular system. This preliminary layout allowed testing the piston-cylinder mechanism, its control, and the software. This electro-hydraulic interface has been used to reproduce a pulsatile pump working in different modes. The hybrid model approach can support the development of new cardiac assist devices from their computer model to their manufacture. <br/...|$|E
