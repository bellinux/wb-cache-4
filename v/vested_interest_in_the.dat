5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E

This can be supported by new forms of direct democracy and public participation that has decisive power, as well as awareness-raising regarding the opportunities that sustainable mobility can provide [57].|$|R

25|$|Salleh was {{represented}} by Anthony Lester, QC, who objected to the tribunal's composition. It was argued Abdul Hamid had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case's outcome, since if Salleh was impeached, he would remain Lord President. It was also claimed that the tribunal was improperly constituted because two of the judges were relatively junior, and that the two foreign judges were from countries not noted for judicial independence. Salleh demanded to be tried by peers of equal standing – retired Lord presidents, if need be. He also demanded that the tribunal make its hearings public. All of these claims were rejected by the tribunal, and Salleh withdrew from the proceedings.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, the Public Service Administration of Chicago {{recommended}} {{restructuring the}} Atlanta City Council.

Her goal was to bring city representation into compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act and apportion the council seats relative to {{the demographics of the}} city. This would give blacks fair representation in the city government. Commission chair Emmet J. Bondurant and vice-chair Hamilton began work July 1, 1971. Governor Jimmy Carter signed the new charter into law on March 16, 1973. The new charter separated the city's legislative and executive branches, but shrunk the size of the City Council.

25|$|In {{the final}} years of Philip's reign, Spain entered the initial part of the {{conflict}} that would become known as the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). The result was a decisive Spanish victory in the Holy Roman Empire that would lead to a recommencement of the war with the Dutch shortly after Philip's death. Europe was anticipating a fresh election for the position of Emperor upon the likely death of Matthias, who was heirless. Spain and Austria's common Habsburg ancestry influenced Spain's involvement in the convoluted politics of the Empire: on the one hand, Philip had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> success of his cousin Ferdinand of Bohemia, who intended to follow Matthias to the throne; on the other, Philip had hopes of appointing one of his own family, such as Prince Philip, to the Imperial throne and worried that a failed bid by Ferdinand might reduce collective Habsburg prestige.|$|E
25|$|The 1961 Stanley Cup Finals {{were almost}} not {{televised}} in Canada at all. At that time, the CBC only had {{rights to the}} Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs' games; home games only during the season and all games in the playoffs. However, with both the Canadiens and Maple Leafs eliminated in the semi-finals, the CBC's worst nightmare became reality. The CBC had to conceive a way to carry the Finals between the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings or face public revolt. According to lore, the CBC {{found a way to}} link their Windsor viewers as having a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Finals with the across the river Red Wings. Thus, CBC was able to carry the series after inking special contracts with the Red Wings and Black Hawks as a service to the Windsor market. From Windsor, CBC linked the signal to Toronto and they relayed the coverage Dominion-wide. From there, Canadians were able to see the Finals with nary a glitch in the coverage.|$|E

25|$|During this period, the MWRC {{networked}} {{with community}} cultural leaders through the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Cultural Centre (KALACC), an Aboriginal organisation {{that supports the}} traditional practices of the 30 language groups in the Kimberley. Oscar revealed the significance of their support in the alcohol restriction campaign:It was really important to let elders know what was happening. We liaised with cultural leaders and elders through KALACC. KALACC helped facilitate approval from elders for the alcohol restrictions.The role of KALACC was critical; {{it would have been}} very interesting had they not supported the campaign. The support of KALACC managed some of the forces in the community.Oscar’s move to get the backing of elders and cultural leaders was a major factor in persuading the Director of Liquor Licensing to impose the alcohol restrictions and should not be underestimated. Certain sectors of the community were against the restrictions and the support from elders gave the MWRC campaign the legitimacy it needed in enduring strong criticism. In the face of fierce opposition from some members of her community who had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sale of alcohol, Oscar stood firm.

500|$|As the sinologist {{historian}} Derk Bodde points out, Su Song's {{astronomical clock}} {{did not lead}} to a new generation of mass-produced clockworks throughout China since his work was largely a government-sponsored endeavor for the use of astronomers and astrologers in the imperial court. Yet the mechanical legacy of Su Song did not end with his work. In about 1150, the writer Xue Jixuan noted that there were four types of clocks in his day, the basic waterclock, the incense clock, the sundial, and the clock with 'revolving and snapping springs' ('gun tan'). The rulers of the continuing Yuan Dynasty (1279–1368 AD) had a <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advancement of mechanical clockworks. [...] The astronomer Guo Shoujing helped restore the Beijing Ancient Observatory beginning in 1276, where he crafted a water-powered armillary sphere and clock with clock jacks being fully implemented and sounding the hours. [...] Complex gearing for uniquely Chinese clockworks were continued in the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), with new designs driven by the power of falling sand instead of water to provide motive power to the wheel drive, and some Ming clocks perhaps featured reduction gearing rather than the earlier escapement of Su Song. [...] The earliest such design of a sand-clock was made by Zhan Xiyuan around 1370, which featured not only the scoop wheel of Su Song' device, but also a new addition of a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated, much like new European clocks of the same period.|$|E
