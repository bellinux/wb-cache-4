This paper presents a more lightweight framework- both communication scheme and conferencing software- to overcome these deficiencies.

Voice <b>over</b> <b>IP</b> (VoIP) refers to technology {{making it possible to}} transfer voice data <b>over</b> an <b>IP</b> network, thus making it possible to make phone calls and <b>videoconferences</b> <b>over</b> the Internet. As Internet is a public network where it is very easy to intercept or manipulate data traversing through the nodes, {{there is a need for}} security mechanisms to protect the traffic. ...|$|R
40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of computers (nodes) that cooperate to forward packets for each other over a multihop wireless network. Users of such networks may wish to use demanding applications such as <b>videoconferencing,</b> Voice <b>over</b> <b>IP,</b> and streaming media when they are connected through an ad hoc network. Because overprovisioning, a common technique in wired networks, is often impractical in wireless networks for reasons such as power, cost, and government regulation, Quality of Service (QoS) routing is even more important in wireless networks than in wired networks. Though a number of QoS-routing protocols have been proposed for use in ad hoc networks, security of such protocols has not been considered. In this paper, we develop SQoS, a secure form of QoS-Guided Route Discovery for on-demand ad hoc network routing. SQoS relies entirely on symmetric cryptography. Symmetric cryptographic primitives are three to four orders of magnitude faster (in computation time) than asymmetric cryptography. In addition, we show that in general, existing QoS-Guided Route Discovery can, for a single Route Discovery, transmit a number of packets exponential in the number of network nodes, creating an opportunity for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. SQoS limits this overhead to be linear in the number of network nodes by providing the source with control over which Route Requests are forwarded...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a simulation {{analysis for the}} evaluation of the admission region of a IEEE 802. 11 e network adopting the EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) mechanism. In particular, this study gives an estimate of the number of QoS-aware applications, namely <b>videoconference</b> and Voice <b>over</b> <b>IP</b> (VoIP), that can be admitted to the transport service offered by the EDCA while satisfying their QoS require-ments. The traffic sources adopted for the simulation are obtained from measurement campaigns led on the emulation of VoIP and videoconfer-ence services based respectively on the G. 723. 1 and the H. 263 codecs. The results emphasize the bottleneck role played by the Access Point when services producing symmetrical traffic are conveyed over an 802. 11 e ac-cess network. Furthermore, the QoS parameters experienced in a mix of VoIP, videoconference and TCP traffic under EDCA are compared with those obtained when the DCF mechanism is adopted. This comparison clearly highlights the efficiency in traffic differentiation of the EDCA algorithm. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the simulation analysis aimed at evaluating the admission region of a IEEE 802. 11 e draft 4. 0 standard, adopting the EDCF (Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function) access control mechanism.

In the study, the ideal radio channel model is assumed. Furthermore, the traffic sources are obtained from traffic data acquired by means of measurement campaigns made during emulation of VoIP and videoconference services, based respectively on G. 723. 1 and H. 261 codec. Finally the QoS parameters experienced by a mix of VoIP, videoconference and TCP traffic transmitted according to the EDCF mechanism are compared with those obtained when the DCF mechanism is adopted. The result of this comparison clearly highlights the efficiency in the traffic differentiation of the EDCF mechanism...|$|R
