The declaration of a national emergency lasted for about 19 months. The emergency was declared as a result of mounting political pressure exerted upon the government from opposing political parties which were striving to fight corruption, inflation and economic chaos in the country. Indira Gandhi's government, rather than taking this as a political challenge, resorted to declaring a national emergency and imprisoning the opposition party leaders, including all dissenting <b>voices</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> media.|$|E

25|$|In either case, the <b>voices</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Well {{reveal that}} Corypheus' dragon {{is the key}} to {{stopping}} him; it is not a true Archdemon but a facsimile of one, and Corypheus has invested so much of his power in creating it that if the beast is killed, then Corypheus' ability to leap into other bodies would be disrupted, rendering him vulnerable. The Inquisitor then confronts Corypheus as he reopens the Breach, forcing a final confrontation, and defeats Corypheus and his dragon, resealing the Breach permanently and hurling the darkspawn magister to the Fade, destroying his physical body in the process. After finding Corypheus's orb destroyed, a dismayed Solas departs the Inquisition. The epilogue, narrated by Morrigan, details the outcomes of the Inquisitor's decisions for the Mage-Templar war, the Grey Wardens, and the leadership of Orlais. Depending on the player's choices, either Cassandra, Leliana or Vivienne can be appointed as the new Divine, taking on the title of Divine Victoria.|$|E

500|$|The {{publication}} of A Community of Witches did not signal {{the end of}} Berger's studies {{on the subject of}} American Paganism, and over the following several years she would publish several more volumes detailing her work in this area. In 2003, she co-authored a book delving deeper into the results of the Pagan Census that she had undertaken with Andras Corban Arthen. Entitled <b>Voices</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pagan Census: A National Survey of Witches and Neo-Pagans in the United States, it was co-written with Leigh S. Shaffer, a fellow professor of sociology at West Chester University, and also with Evan A. Leach, then an associate professor of management at West Chester. Like A Community of Witches, <b>Voices</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pagan Census was published by the University of South Carolina Press in their series on 'Studies in Comparative Religion', and in his preface to the book, the series editor Frederick M. Denny referred to it as the [...] "sequel" [...] to Berger's earlier work.|$|E

In these passages, Atwill sees a parody of Jesus’ sayings in Matt. 23:13-33, 24:27-25:1 and Luke 11:43-52.|$|R
