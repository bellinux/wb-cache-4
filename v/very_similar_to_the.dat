5|$|The Wiesbaden {{class was}} the first German light cruiser design to mount 15cm guns, though the Pillau class was {{completed}} with guns of this caliber first. The Wiesbaden-class ships were otherwise <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> preceding Graudenz class; they were slightly larger, but had the same speed and identical armor protection.|$|E
5|$|The black-{{shoulder}}ed kite is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> related raptor species, the letter-winged kite (E.scriptus) {{but has the}} black mark above and behind the eye, a white rather than grey crown, and shows all-white underparts in flight except for the black patch at the shoulder and dark wingtips.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization was <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.|$|E
5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blue wildebeest has been discovered. Dating back to around 3000 BC, it was found in Hierakonopolis (Nekhen), {{which used to be}} the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at that time. This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and was associated with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western United States in this regard.|$|E

5|$|The HOS are issued, {{among other}} industry-related {{regulations}}, by the FMCSA. In this instance, federal regulations {{apply only to}} interstate commerce. Commerce which does not involve the crossing of state lines is considered intrastate, and is {{under the jurisdiction of}} the respective state's laws. However, most states have adopted intrastate regulations which are identical or <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> federal HOS regulations.|$|E

The class {{comprised}} two ships: , named after the Norse god Odin, and , named after the Norse god of the same name.

The tools used in the movie, which were <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ones {{employed}} in 1943, came from Transylvania. The barbed wire fences of the concentration camps are genuine ones built by the Nazis in Romania which can be differentiated from the ones used for cattle by their denser spacing.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile {{great spotted woodpecker}}s often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great spotted woodpecker. The Sind woodpecker is <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted woodpecker in the same way.|$|E
