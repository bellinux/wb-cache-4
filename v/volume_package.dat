5000|$|The Vancouver Police was at {{the centre}} {{of one of the}} biggest scandals in the city's history in 1955. Feeling {{frustrated}} that blatant police corruption was being ignored by the local media, a reporter for the Vancouver Daily Province switched to a Toronto-based tabloid, Flash. He wrote a sensational article alleging corruption {{at the highest levels of}} the police department in Vancouver, specifically, that a pay-off system had been implemented whereby gambling operations that paid the police were left alone and those that did not were harassed. After the Flash article appeared in Vancouver, the allegations could no longer be ignored, and a Royal Commission, the Tupper Commission, was struck to hold a public inquiry. Chief Constable Walter Mulligan fled to the United States, another officer from the upper ranks committed suicide, and still another attempted suicide rather than face the inquiry. Other scandals and public inquiries plagued the force before and since this one, dubbed [...] "The Mulligan Affair", but none were so dramatic. An earlier inquiry into corruption in 1928 was ambiguous in its conclusions as to the extent of the problem. The last major inquiry into policing in Vancouver focused largely on police accountability. Judge Wally Oppal (later provincial Attorney General), submitted the results of his report in 1994 in a four <b>volume</b> <b>package</b> entitled Closing the Gap: Policing and the Community.|$|E

50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a theoretical {{weight of a}} package. This theoretical weight is {{the weight of the}} package at a minimum density chosen by the freight carrier. If the package is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the <b>volume</b> of the <b>package</b> as if it were of the chosen density (what the package would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the true <b>volume</b> of the <b>package.</b> The freight carrier will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine the <b>package</b> <b>volume.</b> If the <b>package</b> is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the true <b>volume</b> of the <b>package.</b> However, if the package is of any other shape, then the calculation of volume will be more than the true <b>volume</b> of the <b>package.</b>|$|R

Solar air heaters, because of their simple in design, are cheap and most widely used collection devices of solar energy. The thermal efficiency of a solar air heater is significantly low because of the low value of the convective heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate and the air, leading to high absorber plate temperature and high heat losses to the surroundings. This paper presents the study of heat transfer in a solar air heater by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The effect of Reynolds number on Nusselt number is investigated.

A commercial finite <b>volume</b> <b>package</b> ANSYS FLUENT 12. 1 is used to analyze and visualize {{the nature of the}} flow across the ribbed duct The fluid in the duct was air, and the average heat transfer coefficients were determined by measuring the overall heat transfer coefficients of the duct. To attain fully developed conditions at the entrance and exit, the duct was built with additional lengths before and after the test section. The walls of the air side were ribbed with an array of short ribs. The second wall of the duct was well insulated and can be considered adiabatic. The results are presented in dimensionless form, in terms of Nusselt numbers and friction factors as functions of the Reynolds number.

The fluid is assumed to be Newtonian, incompressible, non-fouling and isothermal.

The rotating filter in a closed housing was found to produce high viscous drag (shear stress) compared to rotating disk. Increasing the rotation speed of the filter increase the static pressure inside the filter due to centrifugal force induced inside it. Therefore, a back pressure phenomenon may be raised.
