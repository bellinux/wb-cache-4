The results of experimental rearing, which took place in 2014 and consisted of two parts, are included. In the first part, the impact of the exchange rate of the water in the tanks on change of hydrochemical parameters. For the experiment three variants in duplicate were prepared, with different flow rate for each one. The volume of water in the tanks was set to 100 liters and the number of fish was 150 fish/tank. Water change rate within the first variant was set for 1 / 3 of <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> within the second variant for 1 / 3 of <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> and within the third variant for 3 / 3 of <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> Each day was measured oxygen content, water temperature and pH, and samples for laboratory analysis were being taken. The results were analyzed by analysis of variance. No statistically significant difference has been found between monitored parameters, therefore these flow rates had no impact on the change of hydrochemical parameters for each variant. In {{the second part of the}} experiment was compared the effect of three different feed mixtures on growth parameters and development of fish. The same conditions of the rearing environment were maintained, but stocking density was reduced to 50 fish/gutter and a uniform water change rate of 3 / 3 <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> was set.

Through the videotaping of four intersections that have significant bicycle traffic around Xiaozhai in Xi’an, China, it is ascertained that bicycle capacity varies linearly (but limited by an asymptote domain) associated with the adjustment of these parameters. The analytical results indicate that the impact saturation flow of lane groups containing right-turning vehicles and pedestrian flow at signalized intersections on bicycles is being underestimated.

The investigations are performed for a single-component study of lead on New Zealand clinoptilolite at 25 ± 1 °C. The results show a constant operating CEC of 1. 00 ± 0. 015 meq. g- 1 which is independent of the operational parameters listed above.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of iron species from iron (III) chloride solutions {{with a strong}} acid cation resin has been investigated {{in relation to a}} variety of water and wastewater applications. A detailed equilibrium isotherm analysis was conducted wherein models such as Langmuir Vageler, Competitive Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, Dubinin Astakhov, Sips and Brouers-Sotolongo were applied to the experimental data. An important conclusion was that both the bottle-point method and solution normality used to generate the ion exchange equilibrium information influenced which sorption model fitted the isotherm profiles optimally. Invariably, the calculated value for the maximum loading of iron on strong acid cation resin was substantially higher than the value of 47. 1 g/kg of resin which would occur if one Fe 3 + ion exchanged for three “H+” sites on the resin surface. Consequently, it was suggested that above pH 1, various iron complexes sorbed to the resin in a manner which required less than 3 sites per iron moiety.

Filters with a wide efficiency range are considered. Predicted concentration reductions are provided for indoor-generated particles containing dust mite and cat allergen, for environmental tobacco smoke particles, and for outdoor-air fine mode particles. Additionally, this paper uses a simple model and available data to estimate the energy and total costs of the filtration options. Predicted reductions in cat and dust-mite allergen concentrations range from 20 % to 80 %. To obtain substantial, e. g., 50 %, reductions in indoor concentrations of these allergens, the rate of airflow through the filter {{must be at least}} a few indoor <b>volumes</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> Increasing filter efficiencies above approximately ASHRAE Dust Spot 65 % does not significantly reduce predicted indoor concentrations of these allergens.

Increasing the filter efficiency above ASHRAE 85 % results in only modest predicted incremental decreases in indoor concentration.

The goal was to significantly reduce the use of excess methanol while maintaining a high methanol:glyceride molar ratio inside the RD reactor by recycling a small amount of methanol within the system. Reactant conversion rate and product yield were used as the criteria for the reactor evaluation. The effect of the methanol:glyceride ratio was studied on a laboratory-scale perforated-tray RD reactor system. Product parameters such as methyl ester content, glycerides, and methanol content were analyzed. Preliminary results showed that the RD reactor with a methanol:glyceride ratio of 4 : 1 (molar), in which the use of methanol was cut down by 66 %, gave a satisfactory biodiesel yield and oil conversion rate at a column temperature of 65 °C. Total reaction time in the pre-reactor and RD column was about 3 min, which is 20 to 30 times shorter than in typical batch processes. The productivity of the RD reactor system was about 6. 6 m 3 biodiesel per m 3 reactor <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> which is 6 to 10 times higher than that of batch and existing continuous-flow processes...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{assessment}} of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) within a microclimate box and its influence on the material degradation. IAQ is concerned with maintaining acceptable temperature, humidity and oxygen levels and low pollutant levels in the rooms, cabinets or other enclosed spaces, for humans to live and work, while meeting legal guidelines. In the microclimate box it is concerned with maintaining an acceptable environment for the conservation of historic objects. As a reference we should first consider the composition of outside air. This is contains approximately 78 % nitrogen, 21 % oxygen and 1 % argon, and varying amounts of water vapour depending on local climate. Further it contains smaller quantities carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides and small particles depending on local pollution levels. Temperature varies by season, time of day and location. Historically records have been kept of some of these parameters of more than 100 years as part of weather monitoring and prediction. The indoor climate in a room in a house, office or museum is modified by the building construction, heating and cooling, and by occupants and objects within the building. An unheated building is buffered from the outdoor climate by the insulation effect of the building itself, but may contain localised microclimates due to airflow (draughts) and solar radiation through the windows. Heating and cooling may be passive, by natural convection and conduction, or active airflow of heated or cooled air. Occupants and objects within the building interact with the Indoor Air Quality, for example breathing in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide, or outgassing of volatile materials, such as paints. An IAQ engineer has a range of instruments to monitor the indoor climate. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) can be measured using electronic sensors and if necessary logged at regular intervals over a longer period. Airflows from a heating and ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) system can be measured with an anemometer. Several anemometer types exist and they can measure air velocity and if the aperture size is known, air <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> Air <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> allows the calculation of room air changes per hour, which is related to the dilution of pollutants in the air by the HVAC system. Examples of pollutants which can be measured include carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and particulates e. g. PM 10 s, bacteria, moulds and yeasts. Gaseous particulates, such as CO and CO 2 follow an exponential dilution curve due to the air changes and particulates follow a greater that exponential dilution curve as settling of particles also plays a role. In a sealed microclimate, these air changes are not present, so the buffering effect is enhanced, but the active dilution of pollutants is not present. Published studies have focussed mostly on the buffering effect, while some recent studies, for example at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, measure the gaseous pollutants present. Further {{there is a lot of}} information in the literature about the influence of pollutants in outside air causing an enhanced rate of material degradation on historic buildings. This study will bring together these sources of information to assess how the air within microclimate boxes could cause an enhanced rate of chemical degradation of historic objects. <br/...|$|E
40|$|As NASA {{proceeds}} {{with its}} effort to develop a Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) that will provide life support to crews during long duration space missions, it must {{address the question of}} facility and system closure. The concept of closure as it pertains to CELSS and engineering specifications, construction problems and monitoring procedures used in the development and operation of a closed plant growth facility for the CELSS program are described. A plant growth facility is one of several modules required for a CELSS. A prototype of this module at Kennedy Space Center is the large (7 m tall x 3. 5 m diameter) Biomass Production Chamber (BPC), the central facility of the CELSS Breadboard Project. The BPC is atmospherically sealed to a leak rate of approximately 5 percent of its total <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> 24 <b>hours.</b> This paper will discuss the requirements for atmospheric closure in the facility, present CO 2 and trace gas data from initial tests of the BPC with and without plants, and describe how the chamber was sealed atmospherically. Implications that research conducted in this type of facility will have for the CELSS program are discussed...|$|R
40|$|School {{buildings}} in Italy traditionally haven’t a cooling plant {{as during the}} peak summer period they are closed. Otherwise nowadays the teaching period has been expanded and the classrooms in many cases are used also for recreations of pupils free from school by local authorities. During months like June or September also in North Italy are present periods of high diurnal temperature and humidity. Consequently {{at least in the}} design of new school building some kind of cooling strategy is needed and considering the limited economic budget for functioning of this kind of institutions have to be low energy demanding. In this context night natural ventilation seems a promising solution able to provide cooling when requested. Even if its cooling capacity is limited, an optimized design process can lead to comfortable and controllable conditions for the occupants and can reach relevant decreases in energy consumption. As a case study the authors assumed the design of a new school building near Treviso in the North-East Italy. The purpose of the work is to analyse for northern Italian climate the performances of natural ventilation strategies such as stack chimney effect and wind induced cross ventilation by means of computational fluid dynamics simulation (CFD). Through a climatic analysis the mean wind directions and velocities and the mean ambient temperature fluctuations have been calculated. After the climatic analysis a urban CFD simulation has been performed to investigate wind behavior near the school building. A first design step was the sizing of openings and ventilation chimney by means of normographs and after that an internal CFD simulation has been performed with the aim of evaluate air flow patterns inside the classrooms. Vent placement and ventilation chimney shape and height have been verified and optimized considering a night ventilation flow pattern during summer. The internal analysis has highlighted that during a typical summer night the air moves across the school room entering from the bottom window and going out from the top chimney, providing an air changes value of 9 <b>volumes</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> This night summer air flow pattern lead to a surface temperatures reduction of about 2, 2 °C and to an air temperatures reduction of about 4, 7 °C...|$|R
