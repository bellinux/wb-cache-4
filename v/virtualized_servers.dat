40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceServer {{virtualization}} {{has become}} the modern trend in various industries. Industries are resorting to the deployment of <b>virtualized</b> <b>servers</b> in order to cut the cost of additional, expensive hardware and consolidate the servers on minimal hardware for easier management and maintenance. <b>Virtualized</b> <b>servers</b> are often seen connected to disk arrays in many industries ranging from small to medium business to large data centers. In such a setup, assuring a low latency of data access from the disk array {{plays an important role}} in improving the performance and robustness of the overall system. Caching techniques have been researched and used in the past on traditional processors to reduce the number of memory accesses and have proven benefits in alleviating the response times of applications. The research done in this paper explores caching on the hypervisor and analyzes the performance of data cache locking technique in hypervisor caches. The research aims at reducing the Input / Output (I/O) latency in a server virtualized Storage Area Network (SAN) setup, which thereby increases the performance of applications running on the <b>virtualized</b> <b>servers.</b> The authors introduce a miss table that can determine the blocks of data in the hypervisor cache that need to be locked. Way cache locking method is used for locking, such that only selected lines of cache are locked (not the entire cache). The proposed cache locking technique is later evaluated with the introduction of a small victim buffer cache and probability based cache replacement algorithm. Valgrind simulation tool was used to generate memory traces by virtual machines (VMs). Experimental results show an improved cache hit percentage and a considerable reduction in the I/O response time due to the proposed cache locking technique when compared to the results without hypervisor cache locking...|$|E

40|$|Computer systems & NetworksVirtualization enables {{flexible}} resource provisioning {{and improves}} energy efficiency through consolidating <b>virtualized</b> <b>servers</b> into {{a smaller number}} of physical servers than that of the <b>virtualized</b> <b>servers.</b> Therefore, it is becoming an essential component for the emerging cloud computing model. Currently, virtualized environment including cloud computing systems bills users for the amount of their processor time, or the number of their virtual machine instances. However, accounting based only on the depreciation cost of server hardware is not an economically proper model because the cooling and energy cost for datacenters has already exceeded the cost to own servers. This paper suggests an estimation model to account energy consumption of each virtual machine without any dedicated measurement hardware. Our estimation model estimates the energy consumption of a virtual machine based on the in-processor events generated by the virtual machine. Based on the estimation model, this paper also proposes the virtual machine scheduling algorithm that is able to provide computing resources according to the energy budget of each virtual machine. The suggested schemes are implemented in the Xen virtualization system, and the evaluation shows the suggested schemes estimate and provide energy consumption with errors less than 5 % of the total energy consumption. ope...|$|E
