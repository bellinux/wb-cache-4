In countries such as UK and the Republic of Ireland, Eurasian badger (Meles meles) vaccination field trials are becoming part of the TB control strategies [9]. Field vaccination trials are also ongoing in Spain, where the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) is regarded as the main driver of animal TB at the wildlife-livestock inter-face [10 - 12]. In Mediterranean Spain, modeling of tuberculosis in wild boar populations predicted that over 70 % of the an-nual cohort of wild boar piglets would be needed to be vaccinated in order to significantly reduce the prevalence of the disease and eventually eradicate the infection [13].

40|$|In Europe, the {{elimination}} of wildlife rabies using oral rabies vaccination [ORV] of foxes for more than 30 years has been a success story. Since a comprehensive review on {{the scope of the}} different oral rabies vaccine baits distributed across Europe has not been available yet, we evaluated the use of different vaccine baits over the entire period of ORV [1978 - 2014]. Our findings provide valuable insights into the complexity of ORV programs in terms of vaccine related issues. More than 10 oral vaccines against rabies were used over the past four decades. Depending on many factors, the extent to which oral rabies virus vaccines were used varied considerably resulting in huge differences in the number of vaccine doses disseminated in ORV campaigns as well as in large spatial and temporal overlaps. Although vaccine virus strains derived from the SAD rabies virus isolate were the most widely used, the success of ORV campaigns in Europe cannot be assigned to a single oral rabies virus vaccine alone.

The Arctic variant of rabies virus has been present in red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations in Ontario, Canada, since the mid- 1950 s (1, 2). During 1954 – 2006, more than 57, 000 rabid animals were reported in Ontario, and, on average, 1, 000 – 2, 000 humans received rabies postexposure treatment (3, 4).

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of demographic parameters {{are critical to}} the management of wildlife populations, including management programs focused on controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases. Rabies managers in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have applied a simple raccoon (Procyon lotor) abundance index (RAI) based on cumulative catch of unique raccoons per unit area to determine vaccine-bait distribution densities. This approach was designed to allow for both the collection of biological samples and to index raccoon abundance to determine bait densities for oral rabies programs. However, postbaiting surveillance data indicate that, on average, only 30 % of raccoons sampled have vaccine induced rabies antibody titers, suggesting that bait densities may not be well calibrated to raccoon densities. We trapped raccoons using both capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and the standard RAI to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} current index-based methodology for estimating raccoon density. We then developed a resource selection function from spatial data collected from radio-collared raccoons to standardize trap placement within the existing RAI protocol, and evaluated the performance of this modified RAI approach relative to CMR for estimating raccoon population size. Both abundance and density estimates derived using the RAI consistently underestimated raccoon population sizes compared with CMR methods. Similarly, although the use of resource selection models to inform trap placement appeared to improve the accuracy of the RAI, the effectiveness of this method was inconsistent because of an inability to account for variance in detection probabilities. Despite the logistical advantages of using indices to estimate population parameters to determine <b>vaccine</b> <b>bait</b> distribution densities, our results suggest that adjustments may be necessary to more accurately quantify raccoon abundance, which should improve the effectiveness of rabies management in the United States. In particular, {{estimates of}} detection probabilities are needed to more precisely quantify abundance estimates and ensure appropriate vaccine coverage rates...|$|E
40|$|To improve both {{safety and}} {{stability}} of the oral vaccines used {{in the field to}} vaccinate foxes against rabies, a recombinant vaccinia virus, which expresses the immunizing G protein of rabies virus has been developed by inserting the cDNA which codes for the immunogenic glycoprotein of rabies virus into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus. The efficacy of this vaccine was tested by the oral route, primarily in foxes. The immunity conferred, a minimum of 12 months in cubs and 18 months in adult animals, corresponds to the duration of the protection required for vaccination of foxes in the field. Innocuity was tested in foxes, domestic animals, and in numerous European wild animal species that could compete with the red fox for the <b>vaccine</b> <b>bait.</b> No clinical signs or lesions were observed in any of the vaccinated animals during a minimum of 28 days post vaccination. Moreover, no transmission of immunizing doses of the recombinant occurred between foxes or other species tested. To study the stability of the vaccine strain, baits containing the vaccine were placed in the field. Despite considerable variations of environmental temperatures, the vaccine remained stable for at least one month. Because bait is taken within one month, it can be assumed that most animals taking the baits are effectively vaccinated. To test the field efficacy of the recombinant vaccine, large-scale campaigns of fox vaccination were set up in a 2200 km 2 region of southern Belgium, were rabies was prevalent. A dramatic decrease in the incidence of rabies was noted after the campaigns.

40|$|International audienceAbstractRABORAL V-RG® is an oral rabies <b>vaccine</b> <b>bait</b> that {{contains}} an attenuated (“modified-live”) recombinant vaccinia virus vector vaccine expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein gene (V-RG). Approximately 250 million doses have been distributed globally since 1987 without any reports of adverse reactions in wildlife or domestic animals {{since the first}} licensed recombinant oral rabies vaccine (ORV) was released into the environment to immunize wildlife populations against rabies. V-RG is genetically stable, is not detected in the oral cavity beyond 48  h after ingestion, is not shed by vaccinates into the environment, and has been tested for thermostability under a range of laboratory and field conditions. Safety of V-RG has been evaluated in over 50 vertebrate species, including non-human primates, with no adverse effects observed regardless of route or dose. Immunogenicity and efficacy have been demonstrated under laboratory and field conditions in multiple target species (including fox, raccoon, coyote, skunk, raccoon dog, and jackal). The liquid vaccine is packaged inside edible baits (i. e., RABORAL V-RG, the vaccine-bait product) which are distributed into wildlife habitats for consumption by target species. Field application of RABORAL V-RG {{has contributed to the}} elimination of wildlife rabies from three European countries (Belgium, France and Luxembourg) and of the dog/coyote rabies virus variant from the United States of America (USA). An oral rabies vaccination program in west-central Texas has essentially eliminated the gray fox rabies virus variant from Texas with the last case reported in a cow during 2009.

Fish-meal polymer baits, widely used for wildlife species, were less preferred. In Egypt, a commercial dog-food-meal bait coated with beef tallow and dry cheese was consumed at a rate approaching that of a chicken-head bait. The percentage baits that were actually eaten after they had been offered to dogs, ranged from 71 - 96 % for household dogs tested in Mexico, 65 - 91 % for confined dogs (beagles and mixed breeds) tested in the United States, and 32 - 88 % for farmer-owned dogs tested in Egypt.

40|$|The {{spread of}} rabies in {{terrestrial}} wildlife throughout the United States is primarily controlled through oral rabies vaccination. Relatively low bait acceptance and seroconversion rates by some target species have prompted investigation into {{an alternative to}} the RABORAL V-RG bait currently used. In Canada, ONRAB Ultralite baits are used to vaccinate raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Comparative studies between RABORAL V-RG and ONRAB found higher seroconversion rates among raccoons that ingested ONRAB, suggesting that it may be a suitable alternative. However, ONRAB has not been evaluated in many rabies reservoir species, including coyotes (Canis latrans). Vaccination of coyotes is a critical element in preventing reemergence of canine strain of rabies in the United States. We evaluated flavor preference of ONRAB Ultralite oral rabies <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> by coyotes. Preferences among bait types differed (Friedman c 2 ¼ 13. 28; df ¼ 5; P ¼ 0. 02). Of the 6 bait flavors evaluated, cheese ranked the highest, followed by fish, chicken, sugar-vanilla, egg, and bacon flavors. Pairwise trials among the top 3 flavors (cheese, fish, and chicken) showed no difference (Friedman c 2 ¼ 3. 00; df ¼ 2; P ¼ 0. 22). Our research suggests that among the bait flavors we evaluated, cheese, fish, or chicken-flavored baits may be an appropriate flavor for delivery of ONRAB Ultralite baits to coyotes...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{geographic}} {{cells of}} rabies cases were identified within southern Ontario. Some had regular 3 -year peaks, whereas others had weak cycles with mean periods {{of up to}} 9 years. Incidence of rabies was related to soil types (highest on sandy and clay loams), land use (abundant where hay and pasture were dominant), and drainage (poor drainage supported only low levels of rabies). A spatial stochastic simulation model {{is being used to}} evaluate risks and tactics associated with reduction of rabies by use of <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits.</b> The model indicated that persistence of rabies is unlikely in areas with < 4, 000 km 2 of contiguous fox habitat. In sensitivity tests the model was most affected by the values of four input parameters: rate of contact among foxes, incubation period of rabies, fox density, and a density-dependent feedback that reduces fox recruitment when density approaches or exceeds a predetermined "carrying capacity. " In a majority of model experiments, a sin-gle vaccination of 60 % of a fox population eradicated rabies, but only if vaccination took place just after a rabies outbreak, when the number of both foxes and rabid animals was reduced. Rabies control will probably be applied to individual cells or clusters of cells rather than to the entire 98, 000 km 2 enzootic zone, at least at first. If rabies is eradicate...|$|R
40|$|ONRAB® is a {{recombinant}} human adenovirus type 5 (HAd 5) with the rabies glycoprotein gene incorporated into its genome. ONRAB® {{has been used}} in Canada as an oral rabies vaccine in target wildlife species such as: red fox (Vulpes vulpes), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and striped skunk (Mepthis mephitis). We evaluated the safety of ONRAB® in non-target wildlife species likely to contact the <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> during oral rabies vaccine campaigns in the United States. We investigated the effects of oral inoculation of high titer ONRAB®, approximately ten times the dose given to target species, in wood rats (Neotoma spp.),eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestri), and fox squirrels (Sciurus niger). We performed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on fecal swabs, oral swabs, and tissues, including lung, liver, kidney, small intestine, large intestine, and when appropriate nasal turbinates, to detect ONRAB® DNA from inoculated animals. By seven days post-inoculation, turkeys, opossums, and cottontails had all stopped shedding ONRAB® DNA. One wood rat and one fox squirrel still had detectable levels of ONRAB® DNA in fecal swabs 14 days post-inoculation. Real-time PCR analysis of the tissues revealed some ONRAB® DNA persisting in certain tissues; however, there were no significant gross or histologic lesions associated with ONRAB® in any of the species studied. Our results suggest that many non-target species {{are not likely to be}} impacted by the distribution of ONRAB® as part of oral rabies vaccination programs in the United States...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the UK and Ireland, {{research}} on the control of bovine tuberculosis in badgers includes {{the development of a}} palatable bait for oral delivery of a vaccine and a means of its deployment in the field. In the present study, we carried out field deployment of bait according to the established method of bait marking in early spring and early summer to compare the effects of seasonality on bait uptake rates. All baits contained rhodamine B (RhB) which was subsequently detected in the hair and whiskers of captured badgers. During the 8  days of bait feeding at 14 badger setts, 99 % of baits deployed in spring, and 100 % of those deployed in summer were removed. The presence of RhB in captured badgers indicated high rates of uptake amongst adult badgers in spring (93 %) and summer (98 %). Only cubs captured in summer showed evidence of having taken bait (91 %). Between 67 % and 100 % of each social group was estimated to have taken bait. The detection of RhB in 96 % of badgers captured at outlier setts, where bait was not fed, suggested that deployment at main setts alone may be sufficient to target a relatively high proportion of the badger population. The number of baits deployed per marked badger suggested that a similar level of uptake might be achievable using fewer baits. The results clearly demonstrate the potential value of the bait-marking methodology for delivering <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> to badgers during spring and summer, but that deployment in early summer is necessary to target cubs...|$|R
