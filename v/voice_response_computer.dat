5000|$|River Trail was {{announced}} at the Intel Developer Forum in September 2011, and demonstrated using a Firefox extension developed by Intel. Brendan Eich, the original author of JavaScript, promised that he would promote River Trail within Ecma International, saying [...] "The demo shows a 15x speedup over serial JavaScript. It lights up the ridiculously parallel hardware in modern CPUs and GPUs, for audio, video, image processing, automated <b>voice</b> <b>response,</b> <b>computer</b> vision, 3D gaming, etc. - all written in memory-safe, clean, functional JavaScript, without threads and their data races and deadlocks." [...] Because River Trail leverages Intel's OpenCL SDK [...] it can exploit multiple CPU cores as well as data parallel instructions (ex. AVX, SSE) and the speedup can be greater than the CPU core count would imply.|$|E

We first explain the terminologies involved such as an interactive <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> system, <b>computer</b> telephony integration, information management, and religious domain. Then we look at how information is managed through an interactive <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> system. IVR application supports two kinds of communications, i. e. real time communication and message type communication. Users could make either a real time communication or a message type communication as needed. Real time communication includes accessing databases {{in order to get}} instant and updated information within the real time during the call is made through the system. Message type communication includes voice mail application using telephone recording. The suitability of using interactive <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> for institution of religious domain is studied, and we also describe a few options for the implementation of the system...|$|R

40|$|Human assistance, {{as well as}} {{automated}} service, {{is necessary}} for providing more convenient services to customers on the Internet-based commerce system. Call centers have been typically human-based service systems. However, the services of existing public switched telephone network-based call centers are not enough {{to meet the needs}} of customers on the Internet. Most of them have been designed without considering the interaction involved in shopping on the Internet. In our research, we design a call center named IMC (Internet-based multimedia call center) that can be integrated with an Internet shopping mall. It contains 2 parts: an Internet multimedia dialogue system and a human agent assisting system. The Internet multimedia dialogue system is an Internet and multimedia version of the interactive <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> service of <b>computer</b> telephony integration-based call centers because it provides access to the multimedia Web page along with the recorded voice explanation through the Internet. The human agent assisting system aims to select the most appropriate human agents in the call center and support them in providing high-quality individualized information for each customer. IMC is a real-time, human-embedded system that can provide high-quality services cost-effectively for Internet commerce...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with chronic}} non-cancer pain who are {{prescribed}} and are taking opioids {{can have a}} history of long term high dose opioid use without effective pain relief. In those without good pain relief, reduction of prescribed opioid dose may be the desired and shared goal of both patient and clinician. Simple unsupervised reduction of opioid use is clinically challenging, and very difficult to achieve and maintain. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of different methods designed to achieve reduction or cessation of prescribed opioid use for the management of chronic non-cancer pain. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 8 th April 2013, as well as bibliographies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Included studies had to be randomised controlled trials comparing opioid users receiving an intervention with a control group receiving treatment as usual, active control, or placebo. The aim of the study had to include a treatment goal of dose reduction or cessation of opioid medication. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We sought data relating to prescribed opioid use, adverse events of opioid reduction, pain, and psychological and physical function. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies provided information on 86 participants. One compared electroacupuncture with sham acupuncture for 20 minutes twice a week for six weeks; {{there was no difference between}} treatments. The other followed 11 weeks of cognitive behavioural therapy with either therapeutic interactive <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> through a <b>computer</b> for four months or usual treatment; the active group had a significant reduction in opioid use, while the usual care group had a significant increase. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Both included studies were at significant risk of bias because of their small size, together with other important issues, including blinding. Because of this risk and the paucity of relevant studies, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of interventions for opioid withdrawal in chronic non-cancer pain...|$|R

RESULTS: The cellular approach was comparable to human-administered interviews in reliability and validity and yielded higher self-reported levels of drug use.
