5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted <b>very</b> <b>slowly,</b> with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds <b>very</b> <b>slowly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is removed}} from the body <b>very</b> <b>slowly,</b> mainly through urine. Smaller amounts of lead are also {{eliminated}} through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat.|$|E

5|$|One {{strategy}} is to minimise actual motion, as when predators such as tigers stalk prey by moving <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids the need to camouflage motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was reported}} at 12.44° declination and 17.163 hours right ascension, and at an ecliptic latitude of 34.9° (the ecliptic latitude changes <b>very</b> <b>slowly),</b> {{placing it in}} the constellation Ophiuchus as observed from the Earth on May 21, 2011.|$|E
5|$|GameSpots {{retrospective}} on real-time strategy history {{said the}} game's AI was unintelligent and predictable, and Scott Love said a difficulty setting would {{have increased the}} game's longevity. Reviewers found the pathfinding poor. Both Scott Love and the J-Man said the game runs <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> during large battles.|$|E
60|$|At {{this they}} both put their heads {{over the side}} of the buggy and looked down. Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either. But they were {{floating}} <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> slowly--so <b>slowly</b> that it could no longer be called a fall--and the children had ample time to take heart and look about them.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Turnbull {{eyed him}} indignantly, and then, {{sitting in a}} <b>very</b> upright position, <b>slowly</b> filled his pipe, and declining a proffered match rose and took one from the mantel-piece.|$|R
5000|$|Extreme Close-Up - A camera {{would show}} an object <b>very</b> {{close-up}} and <b>slowly</b> {{zoom out to}} show the entire item. The team had to guess all three in 30 seconds.|$|R
5|$|Limited by {{poor quality}} {{locomotives}} and the bumpy, cheaply laid track which followed {{the contours of}} the hills, trains ran <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> in the area; in 1882 trains took 20 minutes to travel the short distance from Quainton Road to Westcott, and 50 minutes from Westcott to Brill.|$|E
5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|When hunting a {{web spider}} in the prey's web, a P. schultzi walks <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> towards the prey and then, when {{two to three}} {{centimetres}} away, pauses for some minutes. During this time the P. schultzi quivers very quickly with its whole body at regular intervals. In almost all cases the prey stays motionless. P. schultzi never plucks the web as Portia fimbriata does.|$|E
50|$|Kizomba {{is known}} for having a slow, insistent, {{somewhat}} harsh yet sensuous rhythm {{as the result of}} electronic percussion. It is danced accompanied by a partner, <b>very</b> smoothly, <b>slowly</b> and sensuously, and with neither tightness nor rigidity. There are frequent simultaneous hip rotations coordinated between dance partners, particularly in the quieter refrains of the music. Several individuals with a love of the Kizomba culture have been promoting it in other countries.|$|R
6000|$|... [ALARCOS moves hastily to the Chamber, {{which he}} enters; [...] {{the stage for}} some seconds is empty; a shriek is then heard; [...] ALARCOS re-appears, <b>very</b> pale, and <b>slowly</b> {{advances}} {{to the front of}} the stage.] ...|$|R
50|$|In mid-October, {{the ninth}} storm of the season, a Category 2 hurricane, struck Nicaragua. Because it moved <b>slowly,</b> <b>very</b> heavy {{rainfall}} fell in its path, {{although there is}} no known damage or deaths from the hurricane itself.|$|R
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> to the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the cells}} in our bodies cannot be {{replaced}}, or can be only replaced <b>very</b> slowly—more <b>slowly</b> than they die. This decrease in cell number affects {{some of the most}} important tissues of the body. [...] Muscle cells are lost in skeletal muscles and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age. [...] Loss of neurons in the substantia nigra causes Parkinson's disease, while loss of immune cells impairs the immune system.|$|R
60|$|Yet it availed not, {{for the men}} of Abi were a multitude, and {{the royal}} guard but <b>very</b> few. <b>Slowly,</b> an ever-lessening band, they were pressed back, first to {{the walls of the}} old temple of Sekhet, and then within its outer court. Now all who were left of them, not fifty men under the command of Mermes, strove to hold the gate. Desperately they fought, and one by one went down to death beneath the rain of spears.|$|R
60|$|Two {{minutes later}} the square sail was hoisted, and the foot boomed out on the port side. Every eye was now fixed on the brigantine, but to their {{disappointment}} they {{saw that she was}} still, though <b>very</b> much more <b>slowly,</b> drawing ahead.|$|R
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky <b>very</b> <b>slowly.</b> The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, moving <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> towards the coast.|$|E
5|$|Further delay meant play {{began after}} the tea break, and the pitch played <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> {{because of the}} excess moisture, which also caused there to be little bounce in the surface. With Australia not looking to chase the runs because the time {{available}} was not reasonable, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately swept him for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp, who completed the catch. Johnson fell for six to leave Australia at 10/1.|$|E
60|$|Mr Swiveller replied {{by taking}} {{from his pocket}} a small and <b>very</b> greasy parcel, <b>slowly</b> {{unfolding}} it, and displaying a little slab of plum-cake extremely indigestible in appearance, and bordered with a paste of white sugar {{an inch and a}} half deep.|$|R
50|$|A college boy starts {{suffering}} {{with the}} problem of hair loss but does not take it seriously, later it gets serious because his career as a model was getting affected due to lesser hair.First half of the film is mostly about youth and college life, this is where the problem of hair fall starts. Second half shows tricks and techniques of growing hair and is presented <b>very</b> sarcastically, <b>slowly</b> moving towards a love plot ending it all on a positive note.|$|R
60|$|When {{the wine}} had been handed round, the old squire {{motioned to the}} {{servants}} to leave the room, and then, having first whispered something in the ear of Miss Lee that caused her to turn <b>very</b> red, he <b>slowly</b> {{rose to his feet}} {{in the midst of a}} dead silence.|$|R
5|$|Hansa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Royal Dockyard in Danzig in 1868. She was the first ironclad warship {{to be built in}} a German shipyard; her {{predecessors}} had all been built in French and British shipyards. The ship was launched on 26 October 1872 and moved to the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin for fitting out work. The work proceeded <b>very</b> <b>slowly,</b> and Hansa was not commissioned into the German fleet until 19 May 1875, {{two and a half years}} after her launch. By comparison, all of the earlier foreign-built ironclads were completed in less than a year.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly <b>very</b> <b>slowly.</b> He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium decays <b>very</b> <b>slowly</b> {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E
50|$|Education in Afghanistan is <b>very</b> poor but <b>slowly</b> improving. The {{literacy}} rate for females is merely 24.2%. There are around 9 million {{students in the}} country. Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females. Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country. About 21% of these are females.|$|R
50|$|There are safety {{concerns}} with martial arts breaking, so one should seek out an instructor. There are many small {{bones of the}} foot and hand which need to be <b>very</b> carefully and <b>slowly</b> conditioned for safety. Repeated damage to the extensor capsules of the knuckles can lead to long term problems with dexterity.|$|R
40|$|International audienceKetolides are {{effective}} not only against macrolide-sensitive bacteria but also against some macrolide-resistant strains. Here we present data regarding a new ketolide with an alkyl-aryl side chain at C- 13 of its lactone ring. It behaves {{as a strong}} inhibitor of protein synthesis in a model coupled transcription/translation system, although it {{does not affect the}} accuracy of translation. In addition, detailed kinetic analysis shows that it <b>slowly</b> forms a <b>very</b> tight, <b>slowly</b> reversible complex with prokaryotic ribosomes, a property that could be correlated with its superior activity compared with erythromycin against both in vivo and in vitro...|$|R
