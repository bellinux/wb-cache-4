50|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} that they had asphyxiated. The fault was traced to a breathing <b>ventilation</b> <b>valve,</b> located between the orbital module and the descent module, that had been jolted open as the descent module separated from the service module, 12m 3s after retrofire. The two were held together by explosive bolts designed to fire sequentially; in fact, they had fired simultaneously. The explosive force of the simultaneous bolt firing caused the internal mechanism of the pressure equalization valve to loosen a seal that was usually discarded later and which normally allowed for automatic adjustment of the cabin pressure. The valve opened {{at an altitude of}} 168 km, and the resultant loss of pressure was fatal within seconds. The valve was located beneath the seats and was impossible to find and block before the air was lost. Flight recorder data from the single cosmonaut outfitted with biomedical sensors showed cardiac arrest occurred within 40 seconds of pressure loss. By 15m 35s after the retrofire, the cabin pressure was zero, and remained there until the capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere.

30|$|Three {{different}} artificial fault cases, {{produced by}} the PCA-based AFG method, will be introduced and run in ACCEPT; One fault corresponding to an open window during night, one during day and finally a ventilation fault during day. The reason for introducing both a daytime and a night time open window fault is that naturally more operations such as <b>ventilation</b> <b>valve</b> opening occur in the daytime. This ultimately translates to a more direct effect on {{a broader range of}} variables. It is thus anticipated that ACCEPT will be more capable of detecting an “open window fault” during the daytime than at nighttime since more variables will provide its indication. The ventilation fault is introduced since Fig.  2 states that “Dampers not working properly” is one of the typical faults. The open window fault is not directly related to this table, but will be be considered more energy consuming than the duct leakage due to its inherent nature. The open window fault generation is instead justified by Fig.  1 where it is revealed that 16 % of total energy consumption comes from space heating - thus faults in the heating system can be costly.|$|E
40|$|Background: If {{at the end}} of anaesthesia, {{the gases}} on the {{anaesthetic}} machine are not turned off, they continue to flow through the breathing circuit and may dry out the carbon dioxide absorbent in the absorber. At the beginning of the next anaesthetic procedure, the desiccated absorbent decomposes the volatile anaesthetic, resulting in the formation of toxic gas mixtures, which are dangerous for the patient. In such circumstances, the measured level of the volatile anaesthesic in the breathing circuit differs from the selected value. In the paper, we analyse potentially dangerous possible directions of continuous flow of fresh gas mixture in different anaesthetic breathing circuits. 				Methods: In {{the first part of the}} study, we simulated the continuous flow of gases in a Sulla anaesthesia machine using an experimental method in a simulation setting. In the second part, we analysed whether a retrograde flow through the absorber was possible in a convential anaesthetic breathing circuit and in the Fabius GS, Cato, Julian and Primus circuits with the Y-piece connector open or closed. Information on users’ requests for maintenance services due to discrepancies between the desired and measured levels of the volatile anaesthetic in the breathing circuit were obtained from the manufacturer’s local servicing agent. 				Results: In a Dräger ISO 8 circle system (Sulla anaesthetic machine) with a standard gas supply connector, a retrograde flow is not possible. If the Y-piece connector is left open, the gases are vented to the outside via the absorber and the inspiratory tube. If the Y-piece connector is closed or open, the absorbent in the canister dries because of the continuous flow of gas. A retrograde flow is possible only in those Sulla anaesthetic machines where the fresh gas inlet is located below the inspiratory valve. A retrograde flow of gases causing absorbent desiccation can occur in a Cato, Julian, Fabius GS, or Primus anaesthetic machines with the Y-piece connector closed. Maintenance engineers point out that problems are reported mostly on Monday mornings before the first operation. 				Conclusions: After completed anaesthesia, the fresh gas inlets on the anaesthetic machine must always be closed. Especially in older machines, the carbon dioxide absorber must be checked before the first operation on a Monday morning. In new-generation machines, we must make sure that the emergency <b>ventilation</b> <b>valve</b> is closed after the end of anaesthesia...|$|E

30|$|The faulty {{data set}} is {{generated}} from the 21 × 25921 dimensional training data set by running through the PCA-based AFG method. Tfaulty∈Rn×a is generated by subtracting a fault parameter of 30 from the values in the one score vector (of length 25921) 12 times of duration 108 time steps (9 h), on random weekdays. Since the fault is introduced during night, {{the beginning of the}} fault is at 22 : 00 and ending is 07 : 00. The fault parameter of 30 represents an arithmetic adjustment from the retained score vector reflecting the main correlation trend in the data set. The vector will thus increase in variance along a straight line (since PCA produces linear principal components). The unit of the score vector values in the score space is not easily interpretable but is revealed when projecting to the observation space. Here we have a “line” spanning itself in 21 dimensions and the unit of the slope of the line would involve 21 factors. Each point on the line would consist of 21 numbers readily interpretable in physically understandable units. A hypothetical unit of the slope could be °C pr. (ppm * %) if we only had three dimensions. Setting the parameter to 30 is intended to serve as a proxy for an abrupt fault evolution, and can be characterized by an equivalent temperature- and a CO 2 -level drop and accompanying reactions by the different valve openings which preserve the correlations. This means that when CO 2 and temperature drops, the <b>ventilation</b> <b>valves</b> close and the radiator valves open (due to low temperature). In the ventilation fault case documented later in this paper a gradual introduction will be implemented by letting the fault parameter be a vector of length 108 (9 h duration).|$|R

The Chartis system {{has proven to be}} useful for determining whether CV is present or absent, but this system can also erroneously indicate the absence of CV, which can lead to BLVR failure. Here, we describe low-flow Chartis phenotype in the target lobe resulted in difficult judgment of existence of CV. Consequently, BLVR with EBVs implanted into the right upper bronchus failed to reduce lung volume or induce atelectasis. Inserting another EBV into the right middle bronchus blocked the latent CV, which led to significant lung volume reduction in the right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML) and to improve the pulmonary function, 6 -min walking distance, and St George respiratory questionnaire scores over a 2 -week follow-up period. Low flow in the target lobe is a unique Chartis phenotype and represents the uncertainty of CV, which is a risk factor for the failure of BLVR using EBVs. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility and might be able to resolve the problem by blocking the RUL and RML between which the CV occurs.

In this study we report our experience with manual <b>ventilation</b> using bag <b>valve</b> mask (BVM) in patients with neuroparalysis due to common krait bite.   Methods:This prospective study was conducted between June 2009 and December 2009. All consecutive patients with diagnosis of common krait bite who were manually ventilated by BVM were studied. The duration of ventilation and complications associated with ventilation were noted. Polyvalent anti snake venom was administered as per the "national snake bite protocol" and patients were followed up until final outcome. Results: Thirty-four patients (70. 6 % men) were studied. All patients except two came from rural areas and they were hospitalized between June and September. Majority of patients were bitten during the night while sleeping on the floor. The mean time interval between bite and arrival to hospital was 4. 4 hours. Ptosis (100 %) was he most common clinical finding followed by ophtalmoplegia (80 %) and limb muscle weakness (74 %). Twenty-four patients (70 %) developed respiratory symptoms and 20 (59 %) were intubated and manually ventilated by BVM. Mean duration of assisted ventilation was 34. 6 ± 12. 8 hours.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONEmphysema is {{a leading}} cause of {{disability}} and death. Patients who require ventilator support as a result of respiratory failure have limited treatment options. We report a successful outcome for a ventilator dependent patient in whom endobronchial valves were inserted into lobes assessed as being without collateral ventilation. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 54 year old male patient had been ventilator dependent for two months due to respiratory insufficiency from emphysema. Prior to admission, FEV 1 was 0. 89 L (25 % predicted) and RV was 4. 5 L (205 % predicted). CT scan showed destruction of right lower and middle lobes and left lower lobe. Chartis assessment showed the absence of collateral <b>ventilation.</b> Zephyr endobronchial <b>valves</b> were placed in left and right lower lobes. Lung volume reduction bilaterally was confirmed on chest X-ray and CT scan the following day. On day three, ventilator support was discontinued and there was no requirement for supplementary oxygen. At 30 days post procedure, the RV reduced to 3. 2 L (142 % predicted) and the FEV 1 increased to 1. 32 L (38 % predicted). DISCUSSIONHyperinflation in emphysema compromises lung function. For this ventilator dependent patient, there were no other treatment options. Endoscopic lung volume reduction was successfully achieved by bilateral lower lobe placement of Zephyr endobronchial valves with a prior assessment using Chartis to determine the absence of collateral flow in the targeted lobes. The patient achieved an impressive 48 % improvement in FEV 1 and a 29 % reduction in RV.
