40|$|Iris is a {{specific}} elastase inhibitor expressed in the salivary glands of the hard tick Ixodes ricinus. It belongs to the superfamily of serpins and interferes with both haemostasis and the immune response of the host. In this study, we first show that Iris is expressed in nymphs {{but not in the}} female midgut nor in males. We also show that Iris is present in the saliva. To examine its potency as anti-tick vaccine candidate, we set up three models of I. ricinus infestation on immunized animals: nymphs on mice, and adults and nymphs on rabbits. We report the rise of neutralizing antibodies following immunization of rabbits and mice. This comes with a significant protective immunity against ticks in rabbits only, resulting in a 30 % mortality rate and a diminution of weight gain in both nymphs and adults and a prolongation of blood feeding time in adults. This is the first report on an anti-tick vaccine trial on I. ricinus using a protein able to interact with both host immunity and haemostasis, as a <b>vaccinating</b> <b>antigen.</b> Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|When primary {{immunity}} is boosted {{not by the}} homologous but by a crossreacting vaccine, {{the newly}} formed antibodies react better with the primary antigen than with the antigen actually eliciting the response. This phenomenon bears the name of Original Antigenic Sin (1). It is shown {{that the number of}} antibody molecules produced against the original and the <b>vaccinating</b> <b>antigen</b> is the same; that each of these molecules is capable of reacting with both antigens; that the activity of an antiserum can be completely absorbed with either antigen; that both residual and adsorbed-dissociated fractions of antibody exhibit the same relative affinities towards the two antigens as did the native serum; that, unlike standard primary and secondary responses, the population of antibody molecules characterizing the Original Antigenic Sin is homogeneous; that each molecule has a lower equilibrium constant (i. e. higher avidity) against the original antigen than against the antigen stimulating the present response; and that all equilibrium constants are typical of secondary antibody. It is concluded that the Original Antigenic Sin is a partial anamnestic response, a related antigen stimulating that sector only of the originally primed cells which is destined to produce cross-reacting antibody. A hypothesis is developed according to which the basic difference between primary and secondary reactivity rests on the presence of a trapping mechanism that allows anamnestic production of antibody against lower doses of the homologous antigen. Such a mechanism is capable of cross-trapping related antigens, thus preventing a standard primary response and allowing manifestations of Original Antigenic Sin...|$|E
40|$|The adenylate cyclase-hemolysin of Bordetella {{pertussis}} {{consists of}} a cell-invasive N-terminal adenylate cyclase domain linked to a C-terminal RTX hemolysin containing extensive glycine-rich repeats. The toxin is an essential virulence factor required {{in the initial stages}} of infection. Adenylate cyclase-hemolysin was also shown to be a potent <b>vaccinating</b> <b>antigen</b> inducing protection against B. pertussis colonization of the mouse respiratory tract. This protective activity depends on a posttranslational fatty-acylation modification. We used a set of deletion derivatives of the recombinant adenylate cyclase-hemolysin to localize the protective epitopes on the 1, 706 -residue toxin. We show that specific anti-adenylate cyclase-hemolysin antibodies present in the sera of B. pertussis-infected mice and humans are directed predominantly against the modification-and-repeat portion of the toxin, contained in the last 800 residues of the adenylate cyclase-hemolysin. These antibodies appear to recognize conformational epitopes present only in a structure formed by the intact C-terminal half of the toxin. There was no correlation between the capacity of the truncated adenylate cyclase-hemolysin derivatives to induce both toxin-neutralizing antibodies upon immunization of mice and protective immunity. However, only the truncated proteins which were recognized by the sera of infected mice and humans and which had their last 800 residues intact had the capacity to induce protection of mice against colonization by B. pertussis. This indicates that the structure of the modification-and-repeat region of adenylate cyclase-hemolysin is critical for its protective activity.

Bactericidal activity of freshly drawn heparinized blood against the organism was determined after each vaccination. In all cases bactericidal activity of the blood of vaccinated rabbits was higher than for nonvaccinated rabbits. The in vitro bactericidal activity of the blood was determined in two separate experiments.

40|$|Serum {{samples from}} Aotus trivirgatus subsp. griseimembra monkeys {{obtained}} {{at different stages}} of a vaccination experiment were analyzed for total antibody titer to Plasmodium falciparum and were used for identifying protective antigens of the human malaria parasite. Total malarial antibody titers were higher in serum samples from protected monkeys (<b>vaccinated</b> with <b>antigen</b> in an adjuvant) than in those from unprotected monkeys (<b>vaccinated</b> with either <b>antigen</b> or adjuvant only). Parasite proteins were labeled with [3 H]isoleucine, solubilized with nonionic detergent, and reacted with immune Aotus sera. Immunoprecipitates obtained were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Thirteen protein antigen bands in the molecular weight range 73, 000 to 180, 000 were resolved. Serum samples obtained from protected Aotus monkeys reacted more intensely with these proteins than samples from unprotected monkeys did. Evidence is presented that the protective antigen is not a single, normally nonimmunogenic, protein that is recognized only in protected monkeys. Rather, the present data indicate that a heightened immune response to multiple proteins correlated with in vivo protection to P. falciparum in Aotus monkeys.

40|$|A {{successful}} anti-blood stage {{malaria vaccine}} trial {{based on a}} leading vaccine candidate, the major merozoite surface antigen- 1 (MSP 1), is reported here. The trial was based on Plasmodium cynomolgi, which is a primate malaria parasite which is highly analogous to the human parasite Plasmodium vivax, in its natural host, the toque monkey, Macaca sinica. Two recombinant baculovirus-expressed P. cynomolgi MSP 1 proteins, which are analogous to the 42 - and 19 -kDa C-terminal fragments of P. falciparum MSP 1, were tested by immunizing three groups of three animals each with either p 42, p 19, or both together. The vaccines were delivered subcutaneously in three doses at 4 -week intervals with complete and incomplete Freund’s adjuvants. Very high antibody titers were obtained against both <b>vaccinating</b> <b>antigens</b> as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (106 and above) and against whole parasites as measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay (> 105), achieving, in most animals, about a 10 -fold increase from the first to the last immunization. A blood stage challenge with P. cynomolgi parasites led, in three adjuvant-treated and three naive control animals, to blood infections which were patent for at least 44 days, reaching peak densities of 0. 6 and 3. 8 %, respectively. In contrast, all except one of the nine animals in the three vaccinated groups were highly protected, showing either no parasitemia at all or transient parasitemias which were patent for only 1 or 2 days. When the three p 19 -vaccinated monkeys were rechallenged 6 months later, the protective efficacy was unchanged. The success of this trial, and striking analogies of this natural host-parasite system with human P. vivax malaria, suggests that it {{could serve as a}} surrogate system {{for the development of a}} human P. vivax malaria vaccine based on similar recombinant analogs of the P. vivax MSP 1 antigen...|$|R
40|$|Protective {{immunity}} of BALB/c mice immunized with {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) large T antigen (TAg) against SV 40 -transformed, TAg-expressing mKSA tumor cells is critically dependent on both CD 8 + and CD 4 + T lymphocytes. By depleting mice of T-cell subsets {{at different times}} before and after tumor challenge, we found that at all times, CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells both were equally important in establishing and maintaining a protective immune response. CD 4 + cells do not contribute to tumor eradication by directly lysing mKSA cells. However, CD 4 + lymphocytes provide help to CD 8 + cells to proliferate and to mature into fully active cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Depletion of CD 4 + cells by a single injection of CD 4 -specific monoclonal antibody at any time from directly before injection of the <b>vaccinating</b> <b>antigen</b> to up to 7 days after tumor challenge inhibited the generation of cytolytic CD 8 + lymphocytes. T helper cells in this system secrete the typical Th- 1 cytokines interleukin 2 (IL- 2) and gamma interferon. Because in this system TAg-specific CD 8 + cells secrete only minute amounts of IL- 2, it appears that T helper cells provide these cytokines for CD 8 + T cells. Moreover, this helper effect of CD 4 + T cells in mKSA tumor rejection in BALB/c mice does not simply improve the activity of TAg-specific CD 8 + CTL but actually enables them to mature into cytolytic effector cells. Beyond this activity, the presence of T helper cells is necessary even in the late phase of tumor cell rejection {{in order to maintain}} protective immunity. However, despite the support of CD 4 + T helper cells, the tumor-specific CTL response is so weak that only at the site of tumor cell inoculation and not in the spleen or in the regional lymph nodes can TAg-specific CTL be detected...|$|E

Cattle were vaccinated with whole cells, disrupted cells and pili fractions of three strains of Moraxella bovis. Mice were vaccinated with pili fractions of three strains.

In an attempt to correlate the response seen after vaccination and challenge with a pili fraction of M. bovis, vaccinated cattle and mice were grouped on the basis of signs of disease manifested and compared on the basis of serological responses. Serum samples were tested for antibodies by a gel diffusion precipitin test.

40|$|Among the {{potentially}} <b>vaccinating</b> <b>antigens,</b> the products excreted/secreted by the parasite T. gondii {{have been demonstrated}} to be excellent candidates. The molecular cloning {{of one of these}} antigens (P 24) present in excreted/secreted antigens (ESA) has recently been carried out in our laboratory. The recombinant antigen P 24 corresponds to a native molecule of 23 kD. We were interested in determining the main epitopes of the P 24 antigen eliciting a T lymphocyte response using synthetic peptides derived from the primary structure of P 24. Five peptides: 64 - 79, 88 - 109, 170 - 193, 194 - 208 and 231 - 250 were synthesized according to their hydrophobicity, mobility and accessibility profiles. The presence of T lymphocyte epitopes in these peptides has been examined in the rat model. The determination of T cell epitopes was carried out using T lymphocytes from infected rats, and from ESA and P 24 expression vaccine virus immunized rats. The results showed that the stimulation of T cells with these peptides varied according to the period after Toxoplasma infection. The main T cell stimulation was obtained with the 88 - 109, 170 - 193 and 194 - 208 peptides. When Fisher rats were immunized with ESA, a most significant stimulation was achieved with the 170 - 193 and 194 - 208 peptides. In addition, T lymphocytes primed with P 24 expressed vaccine virus immunization were more stimulated with the 88 - 109 and the 194 - 208 peptides. This study showed that P 24 -derived peptide-specific T cells were elicited in the three experimental situations, although no antibody response against the 23 -kD native antigen was evidenced in the Fisher rat model. However, the native antigen (presented by irradiated parasites) can induce a proliferative response of the 170 - 193 peptide-specific T lymphocytes, confirming that this peptide contains an important T cell epitope. The adoptive transfer into athymic rats of T helper cells recovered from 170 - 193 peptide-immunized Fisher rat conferred a significant protection to infected nude rats despite the fact that no antibody production was observed...|$|R
40|$|A microimmunofluorescence {{test was}} used to study {{antibody}} responses to various spotted fever group and typhus group rickettsiae during Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and epidemic typhus (ET). Patients with RMSF reacted most strongly to Rickettsia rickettsii; those with ET reacted predominantly to R. prowazekii. The degree of cross-reaction to other rickettsial strains varied from patient to patient, but a particular pattern of cross-reaction was consistently observed in serial sera from the same patient. Fresh isolates from three Montana RMSF cases were indistinguishable from each other and from strain R of R. rickettsii used as a standard antigen in all tests. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were usually present in high titer in early-convalescent-phase sera from RMSF, as well as ET, patients.

Immunization was performed with an N-terminal region of the SERA antigen (serine repeat antigen protein), SERA 1, that contains a 262 -amino-acid fragment including amino acids 24 to 285 of the 989 -amino-acid SERA protein. Vaccinations were carried out with the recombinant protein mixed with either Freund's, MF 75. 2, or MF 59. 2 adjuvant. A control group that did not receive SERA 1 but only MF 75. 2 adjuvant was included. Monkeys <b>vaccinated</b> with the <b>antigen</b> MF 59. 2 mixture produced low anti-SERA 1 titers and were not protected. Monkeys <b>vaccinated</b> with <b>antigen</b> and Freund's adjuvant had, in general, a higher average anti-SERA 1 titer (107, 278) than did monkeys immunized with SERA 1 and MF 75. 2 (40, 143), yet monkeys in both groups were well protected. Monkeys that received only MF 75. 2 developed neither detectable anti-SERA 1 nor anti-P. falciparum antibodies prior to or 10 days after parasite challenge, yet were apparently protected against infection. Monkeys vaccinated with either SERA 1 and Freund's, SERA 1 and MF 75. 2, or MF 75. 2 alone and that had been challenged but did not develop a countable parasitemia were treated with a curative dose of mefloquine 100 days after parasite challenge and then rechallenged 40 days later. None of the five rechallenged monkeys that had originally received SERA 1 and Freund's developed a countable parasitemia. Only one of five rechallenged monkeys that originally received SERA 1 and MF 75. 2 developed a high countable parasitemia, while two animals developed a barely countable parasitemia. Four of the rechallenged monkeys that had originally received only MF 75. 2 developed a moderate to high countable parasitemia.

Nuclear transformation with reporter genes showed that transgenic carrot roots accumulate high levels of foreign protein in edible tissues, indicating their potential as a delivery vector. However, prior to attempts at large scale production, more effective immunocontraceptive antigen-adjuvant formulations are probably required before plant-based immunocontraception can become a major tool for immunocontraceptive control of overabundant vertebrate pests.

Splenocyte proliferative responses upon antigen stimulation were higher in groups immunized with NLA OF NcESA combined with CpG, showing increased IL- 12 levels. Also, mice vaccinated with NcESA or NcESA+CpG demonstrated higher IFN-gamma levels and IFN-gamma/IL- 10 ratio. After lethal challenge, mice immunized with NLA+CpG or NLA had lower Morbidity score and body weight changes in comparison to other groups, and animals did not succumb during acute infection. In contrast, NcESA+CpG or NcESA groups exhibited the highest morbidity scores, body weight impairment and mortality rates, associated with greatest brain parasite burden and inflammation.

Because both cellular and humoral immune responses were induced, P 42 and P 95 are promising candidates for a recombinant subunit vaccine and P 46 is a promising candidate for a DNA vaccine against PEP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Influenza {{vaccines}} {{are most}} effective when the antigens in the vaccine match those of circulating influenza strains. The {{extent to which the}} vaccine is protective when circulating strains differ from vaccine antigens, or are mismatched, is uncertain. We propose to systematically review the cross-protection offered by influenza vaccines against circulating influenza A or B viruses that are not antigenically well-matched to vaccine strains. Methods/Design This is a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis. Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting laboratory-confirmed influenza among healthy participants <b>vaccinated</b> with <b>antigens</b> of influenza strains that differed from those circulating will be included. The primary outcome is the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or viral culture). The secondary outcome is the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza through antibody assay (a less sensitive test than PCR or viral culture) alone or combined with PCR, and/ or viral culture. The review will be limited to RCTs written in English. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, previous influenza reviews, and the reference lists of included studies to identify potentially relevant RCTs. Two independent reviewers will conduct all levels of screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (using the Cochrane risk of bias tool). If appropriate, random effects meta-analysis of vaccine efficacy will be conducted in SAS (version 9. 2) by calculating the relative risk. Vaccine efficacy will be calculated using the following formula: (1 - relative risk × 100). The results will be analyzed by type of vaccine (live attenuated, trivalent inactivated, or other). Subgroup analysis will include the effects of age (children, adults, older participants), and influenza A versus influenza B on the results. For influenza B we will also consider variable degrees of antigenic mismatch (lineage and drift mismatch). Discussion Our results can be used by researchers and policy-makers to help predict the efficacy of influenza vaccines during mismatched influenza seasons. Furthermore, the review will be of interest to patients and clinicians to determine whether to get immunized or support immunization for a particular influenza season. </p...|$|R
40|$|High-risk {{neuroblastoma}} {{remains a}} clinically challenging disease. Here, {{we report that}} a multifaceted immunotherapeutic approach including syngeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), adoptive transfer of sensitized T cells (from syngeneic donors <b>vaccinated</b> to tumor <b>antigens),</b> and early posttransplantation tumor vaccination can effectively treat mice with established neuroblastoma. Vaccination was {{an important component of}} this immunotherapy, as it resulted in enhanced and prolonged tumor-specific CD 8 T-cell activity and improved antitumor efficacy. Surprisingly, CD 4 cell depletion of mice given sensitized T cells resulted in better tumor-free survival, which was associated with an early increased expansion of CD 8 T cells with an effector phenotype, increased numbers of tumor-reactive CD 8 T cells, and increased tumor infiltration by CD 8 T cells. However, in the absence of CD 4 T cells, development of long-term tumor immunity (memory) was severely compromised as reflected by diminished CD 8 T-cell recall responses and an inability to resist tumor rechallenge in vivo. Based on these results, a major challenge with this immunotherapeutic approach is how to obtain the ideal initial antitumor response but still preserve antitumor immune memory. These data suggest that identification and selective depletion of immune inhibitory CD 4 T cells may be a strategy to enhance early antitumor immunity and induce a long-lasting tumor response after HSCT...|$|R
40|$|Background. Immunity to {{chlamydia}} {{is thought}} to rely on interferon (IFN) ––secreting T helper cells type 1 (Th 1) with an additional effect of secreted antibodies. A need for Th 1 -polarizing adjuvants in experimental chlamydia vaccines has been demonstrated, and antigen conformation has also been reported as being important for raising protective immunity. Methods. C 57 BL/ 6 mice vaccinated with native refolded Chlamydia muridarum major outer membrane protein (MOMP) adjuvanted with either Th 1 -promoting cationic adjuvant formulation 1 (CAF 01) or T helper cells type 2 –promoting aluminum hydroxide (alum) received a genital inoculation of 1. 5 105 inclusion-forming units of C. muridarum. The role played by CD 4 T cells in MOMP/CAF 01 -raised immunity was investigated by depleting CD 4 T cells in <b>vaccinated</b> mice, and <b>antigen</b> conformation dependence was evaluated by vaccination with recombinant MOMP. Results. Mice vaccinated with MOMP/alum displayed a strong anti-MOMP humoral response with high IgG 1 titers, low levels of IFN- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) –, and only a slight reduction in chlamydial load. Mice vaccinated with MOMP/CAF 01 displayed high titers of IgG 2 b, IFN-, and TNF- and a profoundly reduced vaginal chlamydial load, compared with control mice. The protection was CD 4 T cell dependent and was not dependent on MOMP conformation...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, HLA class I tetramers have been {{successfully}} used to demonstrate anti-vaccine CD 8 CTL proliferation in cancer patients <b>vaccinated</b> with tumor <b>antigens.</b> Frequencies of CTL as low as 10 (- 6) among CD 8 cells were observed even in patients showing tumor regression. Little {{is known about the}} role of tumor-antigen-specific CD 4 T cells in the context of these anti-vaccine responses. Therefore, we developed a very sensitive approach using fluorescent class-II-peptide multimers to detect antigen-specific CD 4 T cells in vaccinated cancer patients. We produced HLA-DP 4 multimers loaded with the MAGE- 3 (243 - 258) peptide and used them to stain ex vivo PBL from melanoma patients injected with dendritic cells pulsed with several class I and class II tumor antigenic peptides, including the MAGE- 3 (243 - 258) peptide. The multimer(+) CD 4 T cells were sorted and amplified in clonal conditions; specificity was assessed by their ability to secrete IFN-gamma upon contact with the MAGE- 3 antigen. We detected frequencies of about 1 x 10 (- 6) anti-MAGE- 3. DP 4 cells among CD 4 cells. A detailed analysis of one patient showed an anti-MAGE- 3. DP 4 CD 4 T cell amplification of at least 3000 -fold upon immunization. TCR analysis of the clones from this patient demonstrated a polyclonal response against the MAGE- 3 peptide...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} archaeosomes, prepared from the total polar lipids extracted from Methanobrevibacter smithii, as adjuvants for combination (multivalent) vaccines. Groups of Balb/c mice were immunized subcutaneously at day 0 and 21 {{with one of the}} following vaccines: a trivalent vaccine formulated by the simultaneous co-encapsulation of bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin (OVA) and hen egg lysozyme (HEL) into archaeosomes (CEC vaccine); an univalent archaeosome vaccine (UVE vaccine) containing either BSA, OVA or HEL; or an admixture vaccine (AMC vaccine) consisting of the three UVE vaccines. Serum specific antibody (IgG + M) responses were determined at day 32, 112 and 203, and specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 a responses were determined at day 112. Mice immunized with the CEC or AMC vaccine developed strong and sustained specific antibody responses to all three antigens at a magnitude similar to those seen in control mice immunized with UVE vaccines. Moreover, the serum BSA-, OVA-, and HEL-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 a levels in the CEC and AMC immunized mice were overall comparable to those of the UVE immunized control mice. Boosting CEC and AMC <b>vaccinated</b> mice with <b>antigens</b> alone at day 203 elicited strong antibody memory responses, comparable to those in the UVE vaccinated groups.

40|$|The larvae of the fly Lucilia cuprina cause a {{cutaneous}} myiasis in mammalian hosts, particularly sheep. The glycoprotein, peritrophin- 95, {{isolated from}} Lucilia cuprina larval peritrophic matrix, {{is a candidate}} vaccine antigen. This protein induced an immune response in vaccinated sheep that inhibited larval growth. Recombinant forms of peritrophin- 95 were produced in bacteria and baculovirus-infected insect cells. The bacterial protein was not glycosylated and incorrectly folded whereas the insect cell-expressed protein was glycosylated and probably correctly folded. Sheep immunised with purified native peritrophin- 95 generated strong larval growth inhibitory activity in their sera, whereas sheep immunised with either recombinant form of peritrophin- 95 generated only relatively weak inhibitory activity. Ingested ovine antibodies to native peritrophin- 95 mediated the anti-larval growth activity and this was independent {{of the presence of}} ovine complement. The activity was associated with IgG and IgG but not IgM. There were strong antibody responses to both the correctly folded native peritrophin- 95 polypeptide and the oligosaccharides present on this glycoprotein. Immuno-affinity isolation of antibody to the peritrophin- 95 polypeptide and antibody to peritrophin- 95 oligosaccharides demonstrated that the larval growth inhibitory activity resided with both antibodies. Lectin blots and ELISA data showed substantial differences between the oligosaccharides attached to native peritrophin- 95 and insect cell-expressed recombinant peritrophin- 95. It was concluded that the oligosaccharides attached to native peritrophin- 95 and its unique polypeptide structure are essential for the induction of larval growth inhibitory activity in the sera of sheep <b>vaccinated</b> with this <b>antigen...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pigs {{suckling}} dams {{that have}} been <b>vaccinated</b> with pilus <b>antigen</b> are protected against challenge with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains that express the same pilus antigen. However, some ETEC strains express more than one pilus antigen. Pregnant swine were vaccinated either with E. coli HB 101 that harbored a recombinant plasmid coding for F 41 expression (F 41 +) or with the HB 101 parent strain that carries the pHC 79 vector (F 41 -). Suckling pigs born to vaccinated dams were challenged with ETEC that expressed either K 99, F 41, or both pilus antigens. Production of F 41 in vivo was demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay of sections of ileum and by seroconversion against F 41 antigen by pigs challenged with F 41 + and K 99 + F 41 + ETEC strains. The F 41 + vaccine protected against challenge with an F 41 + ETEC strain. In contrast, F 41 + vaccination did not protect against challenge with K 99 + or K 99 + F 41 + ETEC strains. The F 41 - vaccine did not protect against challenge with any strain used. The results indicate that K 99 + F 41 + ETEC strains produce F 41 antigen in the small intestine during disease and that F 41 + vaccination can be a protective antigen if the challenge strain expresses only F 41 antigen, but that F 41 + vaccination may not protect against strains that produce both K 99 and F 41 antigens...|$|R
40|$|Correlates between {{immunological}} {{parameters and}} protection against Bacillus anthracis infection in animals <b>vaccinated</b> with protective <b>antigen</b> (PA) -based vaccines could provide surrogate markers {{to evaluate the}} putative protective efficiency of immunization in humans. In previous studies we demonstrated that neutralizing antibody levels serve as correlates for protection in guinea pigs (S. Reuveny et al., Infect. Immun. 69 : 2888 - 2893, 2001; H. [*]Marcus et al., Infect. Immun. 72 : 3471 - 3477, 2004). In this study we evaluated similar correlates for protection by active and passive immunization of New Zealand White rabbits. Full immunization and partial immunization were achieved by single and multiple injections of standard and diluted doses of a PA-based vaccine. Passive immunization {{was carried out by}} injection of immune sera from rabbits vaccinated with PA-based vaccine prior to challenge with B. anthracis spores. Immunized rabbits were challenged by intranasal spore instillation with one of two virulent strains (strains Vollum and ATCC 6605). The immune competence was estimated by measuring the level of total anti-PA antibodies, the neutralizing antibody titers, and the conferred protective immunity. The results indicate that total anti-PA antibody titers greater than 1 [*]× 105 conferred protection, whereas lower titers (between 104 and 105) provided partial protection but failed to predict protection. Neutralizing antibody titers between 500 and 800 provided partial protection, while titers higher than 1, 000 conferred protection. In conclusion, this study emphasizes that regardless of the immunization regimen or the time of challenge, neutralizing antibody titers are better predictors of protection than total anti-PA titers...|$|R

Determination of antibody titers in the serum from bird vaccinated with AI-H 5 N 1 vaccine consisting of 2 or 3 different AI virus isolates difficult to be meassured if the antigen for HI test is uncalibrated yet. Furthermore, the determination of a minimum protective antibody titer against the challenge of AI virus circulating in the field at this time needs to be done. This study aims to determine the H 5 N 1 AI virus antigen for standart HI test and the minimum titre of antibodies that able neutralize virus infection. As much as 55 chickens were divided into 11 groups, 10 groups vaccinated with commercial AI vaccine and AI H 5 N 1 field isolat antigen.

40|$|Swine {{influenza}} viruses (SIV) naturally infect {{pigs and}} can be transmitted to humans. In the pig, genetic reassortment to create novel influenza subtypes by mixing avian, human, and swine influenza viruses is possible. An SIV vaccine inducing cross-protective immunity between different subtypes and strains circulating in pigs is highly desirable. Previously, we have shown that an H 3 N 2 SIV (A/swine/Texas/ 4199 - 2 / 98 [TX 98]) containing a deleted NS 1 gene expressing a truncated NS 1 protein of 126 amino acids, NS 1 ▴ 126, was attenuated in swine. In this study, 4 -week-old pigs were vaccinated with the TX 98 NS 1 ▴ 126 modified live virus (MLV). Ten days after boosting, pigs were challenged with wild-type homologous H 3 N 2 or heterosubtypic H 1 N 1 SIV and sacrificed 5 days later. The MLV was highly attenuated and completely protected against challenge with the homologous virus. Vaccinated pigs challenged with the heterosubtypic H 1 N 1 virus demonstrated macroscopic lung lesions {{similar to those of}} the unvaccinated H 1 N 1 control pigs. Remarkably, vaccinated pigs challenged with the H 1 N 1 SIV had significantly lower microscopic lung lesions and less virus shedding from the respiratory tract than did unvaccinated, H 1 N 1 -challenged pigs. All vaccinated pigs developed significant levels of hemagglutination inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers in serum and mucosal immunoglobulin A antibodies against H 3 N 2 SIV <b>antigens.</b> <b>Vaccinated</b> pigs were seronegative for NS 1, indicating the potential use of the TX 98 NS 1 ▴ 126 MLV as a vaccine to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals...|$|R
40|$|Pasteurella multocida is a {{bacterial}} pathogen that causes rhinitis (snuffles), pneumonia, otitis media, septicemia, metritis, {{and death in}} domestic rabbits. Currently, there are no effective vaccines to prevent infection by this organism. Subcutaneous (s. c.) immunization with either exotoxin or thiocyanate extracts of P. multocida induces partial protection in rabbits. Since disease begins at mucosal sites, induction of local immunity may be important in preventing systemic disease. Little is known concerning the efficacy of intranasal (i. n.) administration of these antigens in inducing protective mucosal immunity to P. multocida in rabbits. The {{purpose of this study}} was twofold: (i) to investigate the effectiveness of vaccination with purified P. multocida toxin (PMT) and a potassium thiocyanate extract of P. multocida (CN) in combination and (ii) to evaluate the efficacy of administration of these antigens i. n. versus s. c. Forty-eight rabbits were randomly divided into eight different treatment groups. Rabbits received either one or both antigens by either s. c. or i. n. administration. Following vaccination, each group received an i. n. challenge of P. multocida. Rabbits <b>vaccinated</b> with both <b>antigens</b> i. n. or s. c. had a 100 % survival rate, few or no bacteria in the liver and lungs, high serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibody titers, and significant numbers of IgG antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in the spleen and tracheobronchial lymph node.
