40|$|Ig 61. [...] In four normal {{subjects}} {{measurements of}} steady state diffusing capacity for CO (DLco) by an alveolar sample technique {{and of the}} degree of uneven <b>ventilation</b> by <b>nitrogen</b> washout were made simultaneously followed by measurement of DLco by rebreathing. A methacholine-histamine aerosol was then given. After this aerosol uneven ventilation worsened and steady state DLco fell, while rebreathing DLco did not change. Relief of uneven ventilation by isoproterenol was followed by increase of steady state DLco in two subjects. Alterations in rate and depth of breathing or changes in functional residual capacity do not explain the changes in steady state DL,, which are attributed to increase in uneven ventilation as predicted by the theory of CO absorption. Theory also predicts a lack of effect of uneven ventilation on the rebreathing DL co, but these results must be accepted wit...|$|R

40|$|Biophysical {{factors have}} been implicated in the {{development}} of pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury. In isolated rabbit lungs, the impact of vascular and alveolar distension, with and without alveolar oxygen supply, was investigated. With interruption of both perfusion (zero intravascular pressure) and ventilation, reperfusion after 120 min of warm ischemia resulted in transient pulmonary hypertension, with largely unchanged microvascular pressures, followed by a dramatic leakage response with � 10 -fold increased capillary filtration coefficients (Kfc) and severe edema. Maintenance of vascular distension during ischemia (intravascular pressure of � 2 to 3 mm Hg) reduced the hypertension and fully suppressed the leakage. Employing ischemic periods of 180 and 240 min, ventilation of the lungs with 21 or 100 % oxygen � <b>ventilation</b> with <b>nitrogen</b> during perfusion stop, but not static anoxic inflation, further enhanced the protective effect of vascular distension. At optimal biophysical support (vascular distension and ongoing normoxic ventilation), even 240 min of warm ischemia was tolerated with only moderate Kfc increase. We conclude that biophysical factors exert marked influence on pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury. Maintenance of vascular distension possesses strong protective potency, further enhanced by continued ventilation and alveolar oxygen supply during ischemia. These results may have important implications for organ preservation in lung transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether the levels of nitric oxide found in hospital compressed air have a clinically relevant effect on oxygenation in intubated patients with normal lungs. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Cardiothoracic and surgical intensive care unit in a university hospital. Patients: Twelve postoperative patients receiving mechanical <b>ventilation,</b> interventions: Pure <b>nitrogen</b> and oxygen were substituted for hospital compressed air {{as a source of}} blending for correct FIO 2. Measurements and Main Results: Hemodynamics and PaO 2 were measured in nitrogen and oxygen used for blending oxygen during stable FIO 2 levels. Inhaled nitric oxide was measured with a nitric oxide-chemiluminescence detector. There was no clinically relevant change in systemic hemodynamics. However, the Pao 2 decreased significantly when nitrogen was used for blending. Inhaled nitric oxide levels varied from 2 to 550 parts per billion during use of hospital compressed air; no nitric oxide was detectable during use of nitrogen. Conclusions: The low concentration of nitric oxide in hospital compressed air improves oxygenation in patients with normal lungs receiving mechanical ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Local {{emissions}} from poultry production appear to significantly {{contribute to the}} spatial distribution of N and pitch canker disease in managed slash pine ecosystems. Pitch canker disease (Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg & O’Donnell) causes serious shoot dieback, reduced growth and mortality in pines found in the southern and western USA, and {{has been linked to}} nutrient imbalances. Poultry houses with forced-air <b>ventilation</b> systems produce <b>nitrogen</b> (N) emissions. This study analyzed spatial correlations between pitch canker disease and foliar, forest floor, soil, and throughfall N in a slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii Engelm.) plantation adjacent to a poultry operation in north Florida, USA. Tissue and throughfall N concentrations were highest near the poultry houses and remained elevated for 400 m. Disease incidence ranged from 57 e 71 % near the poultry houses and was spatially correlated with N levels. Similarly, stem mortality ranged from 41 e 53 % in the most heavily impacted area, and declined to 0 e 9 % at distances greater than 400 m. These results suggest that nutritional processes exacerbate changes in disease susceptibility and expression in slash pine...|$|R

However, the standard curve tend to appear low line slope, leading to measurement errors. In the preparation of ZnS colloidal process, it is nitrogen as the carrier gas and protective gas. Its direct impact on the ventilation conditions colloidal particle size and uniformity of the precision for the calibration concentration have the significant impact, particles size appropriate uniform colloidal solution and the concentration can be more stable and accurate calibration by the standard curve.

The testing demonstrates that current facility configuration does not provide assured safety of operations relative to the hazards of benzene (in particular to maintain the tank headspace below 60 percent of the lower flammability limit (lfl) for benzene generation rates of greater than 7 mg/(L. h)) from possible accelerated reaction of excess NaTPB. Current maximal operating temperatures of 40 degrees C and the lack of protection against palladium entering Tank 48 H provide insufficient protection against the onset of the reaction. Similarly, control of the amount of excess NaTPB, purification of the organic, or limiting the benzene content of the slurry (via stirring) and ionic strength of the waste mixture prove inadequate to assure safe operation...|$|R
30|$|The {{detrimental}} effect of high PEEP levels on the bias may have multiple explanations. First, the WI-WO technique measures volume of lung regions {{that may be}} reached by nitrogen (and hence are ventilated), while CT measures aeration of both ventilated and non-ventilated regions. One could then hypothesize that regional <b>ventilation</b> (and hence <b>nitrogen</b> during EELV measurement) at high PEEP may be preferentially directed toward non-overinflated regions and that overinflated regions may not be detected in the EELV measurement. However, this explanation is not supported by our data, since the amount of overinflated area was very low even at the highest PEEP level in our study (1.1 [*]±[*] 0.89 mL). Nevertheless, the observed difference in EELV between methods at high PEEP {{may be related to}} the fact that the WI-WO method measures a functional EELV, while CT measures anatomical EELV. Occurrence of leaks at high PEEP is another hypothesis to explain the non-constant bias, but this explanation is unlikely since plateau pressure was maintained during the prolonged end-inspiratory pauses performed for CT acquisition. Finally, there may be insufficient nitrogen mixing within the aerated lung, during the time allocated for measurement by the ventilator, since animals were ventilated at high RR and low VT, which may have increased the time to reach equilibrium during the WI-WO measurement. An extended time between experimental stages and/or a lengthened WI-WO period may have narrowed the bias between methods.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: If lungs {{could be}} {{retrieved}} for transplantation from non-heart-beating cadavers, {{the shortage of}} donors might be significantly alleviated. METHODS: Peak airway pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and wet to dry weight ratio were measured during delayed hypothermic crystalloid flush in rabbit lungs (n = 6) at successive intervals after death comparing cadavers with lungs left deflated (group 1), inflated with room air (group 2) or 100 % oxygen (group 4), or ventilated with room air (group 3), or 100 % nitrogen (group 5), or 100 % oxygen (group 6). RESULTS: There was a gradual increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance with longer postmortem intervals in all study groups (p = not significant, group 1 versus group 2 versus group 3). There was also a gradual increase in peak airway pressure and wet-to-dry weight ratio over time in all groups, which reflected edema formation during flush (airway pressure, from 14. 5 +/- 1. 0 cm H 2 O to 53. 7 +/- 12. 2 cm H 2 O, and wet-to-dry weight ratio, from 3. 6 +/- 0. 1 to 11. 5 +/- 1. 2, in group 1 at 0 and 6 hours postmortem, respectively; p < 0. 05). Compared with group 1, however, the increase in groups 2 and 3 was much slower (airway pressure, 20. 9 +/- 0. 5 cm H 2 O and 18. 8 +/- 1. 2 cm H 2 O, and wet-to-dry weight ratio, 5. 2 +/- 0. 3 and 4. 6 +/- 0. 4 at 6 hours postmortem, respectively; p < 0. 05 versus group 1 and p = not significant, group 2 versus group 3). Airway pressure and wet-to-dry weight ratio did not differ between groups 2 and 4 or between groups 3, 5, and 6. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that (1) pulmonary edema will develop in atelectatic lungs if hypothermic flush is delayed for 2 hours after death, (2) postmortem inflation {{is as good as}} ventilation in prolonging warm ischemic tolerance, (3) inflation with oxygen or <b>ventilation</b> with <b>nitrogen</b> or oxygen is no different from that with room air, and (4) therefore, prevention of alveolar collapse appears to be the critical factor in protecting the lung from warm ischemic damage independent of continued oxygen delivery. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: If lungs {{could be}} {{retrieved}} for transplantation from non-heart-beating cadavers, {{the shortage of}} donors might be significantly alleviated. METHODS: We studied the effect of different postmortem lung conditions on pulmonary cell death. Lungs from 208 New Zealand white rabbits were flushed with trypan blue vital dye solution at intervals after circulatory arrest, fixed, and mounted for histologic examination. Pulmonary cells were judged to be viable {{on the basis of}} their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. In the control group, lungs were excised immediately after death and immersed in cold (4 degrees C) saline solution. In the other groups, cadavers were left at room temperature with lungs deflated, ventilated with room air or 100 % oxygen or 100 % nitrogen, or inflated with room air or 100 % oxygen. RESULTS: There was a gradual increase in percentage (mean +/- SEM) of nonviable cells in the control group from 2. 5 %+/- 0. 9 % (preischemic value) to 18. 1 %+/- 2. 8 % at 24 hours after death (p < 0. 001). In cadavers with lungs deflated, 79. 7 %+/- 2. 1 % of cells were nonviable at 24 hours after circulatory arrest (p < 0. 001 versus control group). In contrast, room air-ventilated cadavers showed only 21. 4 %+/- 2. 7 % nonviable cells at this interval (p < 0. 001 versus deflated group; not significant versus control group). Values in oxygen-ventilated animals were similar. Nitrogen-ventilated cadavers, however, had significantly more nonviable lung cells (73. 8 %+/- 3. 2 %; p < 0. 001 vs room air and oxygen-ventilated group, not significant vs deflated group). Oxygen-inflated lungs showed a parallel decrease in cell viability up to 4 hours after death when compared with room air-inflated cadaveric lungs, but thereafter more cells became nonviable in the latter group (11. 1 %+/- 0. 7 % vs 19. 6 %+/- 3. 2 % at 6 hours and 48. 7 %+/- 7. 2 % vs 75. 5 %+/- 4. 6 % at 24 hours, respectively; p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Postmortem room air ventilation is as good as oxygen ventilation in delaying pulmonary cell death, and its effect is comparable to cold storage; <b>nitrogen</b> <b>ventilation,</b> however, is ineffective and not different from deflation; oxygen inflation will preserve ischemic cells for longer intervals as opposed to room air inflation. Therefore the alveolar oxygen reserve seems to be the critical factor to protect-the lung parenchyma from warm ischemic damage. status: publishe...|$|R
