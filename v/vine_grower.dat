2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Champagne {{was making}} its mark and {{embedding}} itself into popular culture. The early 20th century brought its share of challenges. Some of the seeds of these challenges were planted during the century before when Champagne's growing popularity encouraged Champagne houses to look outside the Champagne region for a cheaper supply of grapes. The French railway system made it easy for truckloads of grapes from the Loire Valley or Languedoc to be transported to Champagne at prices nearly half of what the houses were paying Champenois vine growers for their grapes. Newspapers published rumors of some houses buying rhubarb from England to make wine from. With hardly any laws in place to protect the <b>vine</b> <b>grower</b> or the consumer, Champagne houses had most of the power in the region to profit off of these [...] Champagnes. To compound the misery for Champenois vine growers, the last few vintages of the 19th century were difficult with frost and rains severely reducing the crop yields. The phylloxera epidemic that ravaged vineyards across France was finally making its way to Champagne. The harvests between 1902 and 1909 were further troubled by mold and mildew. The 1910 vintages was particularly troublesome with hailstorms and flooding. Nearly 96% of the crop was lost.|$|E

50|$|Collusion was practised {{among various}} Champagne houses {{in order to}} drive down the prices of grapes to as a low as they would go, with the ever-present threat that if the houses could not get their grapes cheaply enough they will {{continue}} to source grapes from outside the region. With vineyard owners vastly outnumbering the producers, the Champagne houses used this dynamic of excess supply vs limited demand to their advantage. They hired operatives, known as commissionaires, to negotiate prices with <b>vine</b> <b>growers.</b> These commissionaires were paid according to how low of a price they could negotiate and many employed adverse tactics to achieve this; including using violence and intimidation. Some commissionaires openly sought bribes, often in the form of extra grapes, from <b>vine</b> <b>growers</b> to which they would sell themselves for profit. The prices they were able to negotiate rarely covered the cost of farming and harvesting which left many Champenois <b>vine</b> <b>growers</b> in poverty. Champenois vineyard owners were being paid less for fewer grapes. Poverty was widespread.|$|R

BN are widely used for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty in natural resource management. There is a rising interest in BN as tools for ecological and agronomic modelling. Data were collected from knowledge of vine-growing experts. We developed a C# computer program predicting the likely quality of a vineyard.

These sanctions were eventually eased during the 1970s with the de-stalinization efforts of Nikita Khrushchev's successor government. Ultimately, Champagne saw its mass introduction back into the Russian beverage scene with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{development}} of the Échelle des Crus systems, the Champagne industry functioned on a business dynamic that heavily favored the Champagne houses over the <b>vine</b> <b>growers.</b> Since making sparkling wine is a costly and time-consuming endeavor, most <b>vine</b> <b>growers</b> did not have the means or finances to produce Champagne themselves.

40|$|Grapevine is {{the most}} {{economically}} important and widely cultivated fruit crop in the world. Molecular markers have been used on Vitis vinifera to distinguish among both varieties and clones. Microsatellites are used to fingerprint varieties and several other techniques, reported in many papers, are {{used to analyze the}} differences among clones, but it is not available in the literature as a well defined strategy to screen a large number of Vitis cultivars. In fact, it is often necessary to use different techniques to investigate the genetic variability in different grapevine varieties and a proposed technique is used to study a cultivar, which is often not suitable for either the study of another cultivar or compare the genetic relationship among various cultivars. We describe here a strategy used for the analysis of several grapevine cultivars to describe a universal method to obtain DNA polymorphisms of Vitis vinifera genotypes from the same cultivar by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci (SAMPL), microsatellites AFLP (M-AFLP), and ISSR molecular markers. The strategy here adopted permitted both to identify different biotypes (i. e., Primitivo), accessions (i. e., Garnacha tinta), and clones (i. e., Callet, Manto Negro, Moll) among the variability of same variety and to correlate the genetic differences to their geographical origins (i. e., Garnacha tinta; Malvasia nera di Brindisi/Lecce) or morphological traits (i. e., Malvasia of Candia). Here is also described the application of the protocol that allows to highlight the genetic variability accumulated during centuries of cultivations and selections of the same variety in different environments by <b>vine</b> <b>grower...</b>|$|E

With the constant threat of Champagne houses ignoring the law and using more [...] "foreign" [...] grapes, tensions were already high between <b>vine</b> <b>growers</b> and Champagne houses when the late 19th century and early 20th century brought with it the devastation of the phylloxera epidemic and a string of poor weather and poor vintages. The tensions culminated in the Champagne riots of 1910 and 1911. To avoid the type of situation which led to the riots, producers and growers of the Champagne region formed an agreement that developed the Échelle des Crus system where prices would be set by a joint committee of producers and growers, fairly applied and based on the presumed quality of a village's vineyards. In recent times there has been discussion of modifying the classification and going to a [...] "Burgundy-like" [...] system whereby vineyards, rather than villages, would be the basis of ratings. Critics charge that a system based on rating an entire village ignores terroir differences within the large area of a village.|$|R

40|$|International audienceHigh {{resolution}} {{remote sensing}} imagery {{is becoming a}} reality {{in the context of}} Precision Agriculture. In future, it will be an essential tool for site specific crop management and will help in the global knowledge of land use and of "terroir" quality. In the Bordeaux wine producing area, France, all the parties involved in wine making (vine growers, cooperatives, <b>vine</b> <b>grower</b> unions, etc.) are interested in a better knowledge of vineyards. They are expecting precision viticulture technologies and more particularly remote sensing imagery to provide them with detailed maps (e. g. vegetative vigor maps) of vine fields. Such maps can be frequently updated and enable the determination of management zones inside the vine fields. Various processing steps are involved in the design of management maps, going from image acquisition to the integration into a GIS. In a previous paper, we addressed the accurate detection of vine rows inside the field using a network of deformable templates. In the present paper, we focus on a preliminary processing step, the automatic delineation of a specific field within an image. The objective of this step is the automatic extraction of the field of interest from its neighborhood (roads, buildings, trees and other fields). Automatic vine field delineation deals with segmentation algorithms. Indeed, segmentation algorithms have been widely used in the framework of remote sensing. Such algorithms can be classified into three groups: split and merge algorithms, statistical approaches and region growing methods. The split and merge algorithms are the most common segmentation methods. They proceed in two steps. Firstly, they split iteratively the image, until each region is homogeneous. The resulting set of region is often over-segmented. A quad tree algorithm usually fulfils such a task. A second step is then necessary to merge neighboring regions providing that they are similar. These methods are easy to implement, but they tend to favor rectangular regions. Moreover, they are very sensitive to the threshold values used to determine the homogeneity and the similarity of the regions. The statistical approaches are based on a joint statistical modelization of the region shape and of their content. Among these approaches, the markovian models are the most frequently used, thanks to their flexibility and their efficiency. The only drawback of such statistical approaches is the huge computation time needed to guaranty an optimal segmentation. Sub-optimal algorithms exist but their reliability depends on their initialization. In this paper we choose a segmentation approach derived from the region growing method. These methods appeared in the early 1970 's. They operate from seed pixels belonging to the region to be segmented. Then, pixels are added iteratively to this initial region provided that the candidate pixel shows similar features than those of the initial region. The algorithm stops when no pixel can be added to the region. This class of methods is specifically suitable {{in the case of the}} delineation of a unique region in a picture, but it requires some supervision from the operator in order to choose the initial germ inside the region. We consider here that this very simple task is acceptable. The paper present the acquisition method and images, the extraction of the textural features used in the segmentation algorithm, and the region growing algorithm...|$|E
