5|$|The Pact of Olivos {{diminished the}} electoral {{strength}} of the UCR, leading {{to the rise of}} the Frepaso. Both parties united in a political coalition, the Alliance, which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections. It was the PJ's first national defeat since 1985. The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections. De la Rúa stood for the UCR; the whole party, including Alfonsín, supported him. The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide, who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province. De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin. In the primaries, De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995. Despite his victory, Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR. They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa's ticket; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him. Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez, leader of the Frepaso, saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise. It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance: except for Meijide, the Frepaso did not have a political figure who may run with good chances for governor of the Buenos Aires province. Had she run for <b>vicepresident,</b> Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate.|$|E

Finally the government managed to control the situation and imprison colonel Campino, but president Eyzaguirre had had enough.

2500|$|Tismăneanu {{has been}} accused by {{multiple}} Romanian and foreign scholars and researchers of employing dubious methods to squelch criticism {{of him and his}} works. [...] In May 2012, the well-respected scholar Alina Mungiu-Pippidi wrote, [...] "I hope that Volodea will once again become the spiritual creature, subtle and {{with a sense of humor}} who he used to be, and that we can forget this sinister alter-ego that he has become, telephoning newspapers and television stations to orchestrate--without being asked by anybody--pro-Băsescu propaganda and putting pressure on independent journalists." [...] According to Michael Shafir, Tismăneanu responded to criticisms by the American researcher Richard Hall as follows: [...] "On the one hand, the <b>vicepresident</b> of the Civic Alliance, Sorin Ilieşiu, a person close to Tismăneanu, reacted by putting the word [...] "analyst" [...] in quotes, so that the journalist Andrei Bădin could then [...] "demonstrate" [...] that Hall wasn't a CIA analyst, but had only served an insignificant [...] "probationary" [...] period of six months. [...] The person who was the object of his criticism knew better: [...] Hall had published in the very journal that he had previously led ("East European Politics and Societies"). [...] So he picked up the telephone and yelled at Richard Hall's supervisor, in a scene that could have been included in [...] "Stalinism for All Seasons." [...] Michael Shafir detailed Tismăneanu's tactics more broadly in an article entitled suggestively, [...] "About Questionable Clarifications, Plagiarism, Being an Imposter, and Careerism." [...] In November 2013, Vasile Ernu told an interviewer how Editura Curtea Veche cancelled a book contract because among a handful of references to Tismăneanu one suggested that [...] "Tismăneanu employs two different discourses, one inside Romania and one outside." ...|$|E
