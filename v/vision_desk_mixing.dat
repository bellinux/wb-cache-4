40|$|While {{there are}} clear {{technical}} advantages to active microphone splitting, operational considerations dictate the use of passive splitting of microphones in most sound reinforcement applications. Modern microphones generally require a load impedance greater than 1, 000 ohms, and performance often degrades significantly with heavier loading. Since <b>mix</b> <b>desk</b> input impedances rarely exceed 1, 500 ohms, passive splitting utilizing 1 : 1 turns ratio transformers can seriously degrade microphone performance when driving two or more <b>mix</b> <b>desks.</b> Transformers designed to operate in stepdown mode solve this problem and offer other benefits. This paper reviews current practice, studies stepdown-mode splitting, and recommends that <b>mixing</b> <b>desks</b> be designed with higher input impedances and that microphones be designed to work with lower impedance loads...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} modern audio studios is complex. Audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desks</b> {{have grown to}} the point where they contain {{thousands}} of parameters. The control surfaces of these devices do not reflect the routing and signal processing capabilities that the devices are capable of. Software audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desk</b> editors have been developed that allow for the remote control of these devices, but their graphical user interfaces retain the complexities of the audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desk</b> that they represent. In this thesis, we propose a grid approach to audio mixing. The developed grid audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desk</b> editor represents an audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desk</b> as a series of graphical routing matrices. These routing matrices expose the various signal processing points and signal flows that exist within an audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desk.</b> The routing matrices allow for audio signals to be routed within the device, and allow for the device’s parameters to be adjusted by selecting the appropriate signal processing points. With the use of the programming interfaces that are defined as part of the Studio Connections – Total Recall SDK, the audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desk</b> editor was integrated with compatible DAW applications to provide persistence of audio <b>mixing</b> <b>desk</b> parameter states. Many audio studios currently use digital networks to connect audio devices together. Audio and control signals are patched between devices through the use of software patchbays that run on computers. We propose a double grid-based FireWire patchbay aimed to simplify the patching of signals between audio devices on a FireWire network. The FireWire patchbay was implemented in such a way such that it can host software device editors that are Studio Connections compatible. This has allowed software device editors to be associated with the devices that are represented on the FireWire patchbay, thus allowing for studio wide control from a single application. The double grid-based patchbay was implemented such that it can be hosted by compatible DAW applications. Through this, the double grid-based patchbay application is able to provide the DAW application with the state of the parameters of the devices in a studio, as well as the connections between them. The DAW application may save this state data to its native song files. This state data may be passed back to the double grid-based patchbay when the song file is reloaded at a later stage. This state data may then be used by the patchbay to restore the parameters of the patchbay and its device editors to a previous state. This restored state may then be transferred to the hardware devices being represented by the patchbay. ...|$|R
