HPVs represent the most common infectious agents that are transmitted sexually throughout the world; the major risk factors are behaviours associated with sexual activity.

40|$|The Milošević Trial - An Autopsy {{provides}} a cross-disciplinary examination {{of one of}} the most controversial war crimes trials of the modern era and its contested legacy for the growing fields of international criminal law and post-conflict justice. The international trial of Slobodan Milošević, who presided over the violent collapse of Yugoslavia - was already among the longest war crimes trials when Milošević died in 2006. Yet precisely because it ended without judgment, its significance and legacy are specially contested. The contributors to this volume, including trial participants, area specialists, and international law scholars bring a variety of perspectives as they examine the meaning of the trial 2 ̆ 7 s termination and its implications for post-conflict justice. The book 2 ̆ 7 s approach is intensively cross-disciplinary, weighing the implications for law, politics, and society that modern war crimes trials create. The time for such an examination is fitting, with the imminent closing of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal and rising debates over its legacy, as well as the 20 th anniversary of the outbreak of the Yugoslav conflict. The Milošević Trial - An Autopsy brings thought-provoking insights into the impact of war crimes trials on post-conflict justice. This is the first cross-disciplinary examination {{of one of the}} longest, most controversial war crimes trials of the modern era and its contested legacy for the growing fields of international criminal law and post-conflict justice.

40|$|The Language of Europe {{offers a}} clear and {{comprehensive}} introduction to the policy area of multilingualism and to translation practice within the EU institutions. This first edition in English builds on the success, among academics and practitioners alike, of its two preceding Italian editions (published respectively in 2003 and 2007 with the title Tradurre per l’Unione europea, Milan, Hoepli), which have closely followed the EU journey through its successive enlargements, {{and the impact of}} these multiple accessions on the politics and practice of institutional translation. It proposes an in-depth, up-to-the-minute analysis of the direct relationships between member-state languages and the problems of knowledge transfer between the diverse languages and cultures that make up the patchwork which is the EU. Enriched throughout with practical examples from many among the twenty-four official languages of the European Union, specially selected and adapted for an Anglophone readership, The Language of Europe features detailed studies on the following topics: the background to and arguments in favour of EU multilingualism; the language features of EU documents; variations in translation practice between the different EU institutions, agencies and consultative bodies; the day-to-day working practice of translators and lawyer-linguists; the impact of ICT on translation practice; distinctive genres of EU institutional translation; what the future holds for EU translation. The <b>volume</b> <b>incorporates</b> a range of sample texts from a variety of EU official languages, provided in the source-language original and English target-language translation, in order to give the student and specialist an insight into and overview of the rigour and procedural expertise which are demanded and can be seen at work from initial (co-) draft to final version in the rendering of a “multilingual” EU document. Geared towards students, peers and specialists in Translation and Interpretation Studies, Language Studies and Cultural Studies, The Language of Europe is likely to arouse an equal level of interest in those working in adjacent scholarly domains: Cultural Geography, European Studies and Law, Political Science, and Sociolinguistics, for a start, as well as those currently pursuing or prospecting a career in the European institutions.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{idea of the}} current publication emphasizes {{the characteristics of the}} processes related to administrative convergence and reform in the South-Eastern European states. Of course the area under review is quite wide and complex and therefore our approach aims to comprise only a few characteristics. Encompassing various geo-political aspects, political heritages enhancing that diversity as well as endemic socio-cultural traditions, the public administrations in the South-Eastern European states have faced a definite option for restoring democracy and accomplishing reforms according to the principles and values of the European Administrative Space, in the past two decades. For the time being other questions emerge and others remain still open. Which is the most adequate model for the administrative reform, which are the most efficient mechanisms and tools triggering its accomplishment and implementation? Lacking a formalized acquis communautaire on the processes related to administrative reform, their diversity has enhanced and the conditions for so called administrative convergence have multiplied. The research reports achieved and presented in the current publication emphasise the progress in implementing the democratic processes of central and local governance which do not lead however to convergence, being definitely relevant for the processes related to administrative dynamics. Various political experiences undergone by the states under review {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century have induced attitudes and behaviours mainly of subordination and loss of identity of the organizations in national public administrations. That situation persisting in the South-Eastern European space creates difficulties and unbalances in the dialogue and cooperation with the public administrations of Western European states. The state itself is weak, determining a lack of finality for the administrative reforms. The processes of administrative convergence have become more complex and complicate as the EU administration is searching a model and it is attempting to define an identity. The traditional models of administration, based on a hierarchic bureaucracy are overcome and the model of EU administration could not be found by a transfer or enlargement of an administrative model belonging to one or several states. Therefore, we should acknowledge that the processes related to administrative convergence and reform are profoundly integrated in a complex context, with globalizing valences, benefiting of profound mechanisms, enhancing the interdependence and systemic character of the developments of national public administrations. The current <b>volume</b> <b>incorporates</b> contributions of South-Eastern European universities (National School of Political Studies and Public Administration – Romania, New Bulgarian University – Bulgaria, University of the Aegean - Greece or University of Rijeka – Croatia, as well as of international organizations – European Public Law Organization – Greece. In the above briefly described context, the studies reveal both comparative aspects, strategies of administrative reform or significant developments of administrative convergence and conceptual models aimed to contribute to the debates on EU administrative and organizational future or contemporary developments of EU administrative law. The reports were achieved in the framework of Jean Monnet project â€œSouth-Eastern European developments on the administrative convergence and enlargement of the European Administrative Space in Balkan statesâ€œ and provide an overview close to the realities on specificity of administrative processes in South-Eastern European states. administrative convergence, balkans, public administration reforms, european administrative studies, South-Eastern European States...|$|E
