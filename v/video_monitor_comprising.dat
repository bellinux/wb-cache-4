It's used to establish, modify, and terminate muti-party multimedia sessions and has strong extensibility, flexibility, interoperability and reusability. It can get better compatibility and expansion capability that implement the call process with SIP in <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system. In this thesis, {{based on the}} demand for network <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system, we introduce the <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system's functional division and the SIP protocol, propose a scheme for call process in <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system based on SIP protocol, design and implement the call process subsystem supporting node register, call process, user authentication and status enquiry in <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system. In {{order to meet the}} requirements of the carrier-class <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system, we design and implement the high-performance SIP server on the distributed system, and test the SIP server on the cluster.

40|$|Abstract-In {{order to}} improve the effect of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> and {{decrease}} the rate of false alarm, an intelligent <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> system is designed based on 3 G telecommunication technology and face recognition teleology. Taking AMR 9 as its core, this system involves a 3 G telecommunication module centered on MUI 03 and a protocol of safe command transmission. Thus, this intelligent <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> system has multifold functions: long-distance <b>video</b> <b>monitoring,</b> automatic multistage alarming and long-distance backup. Many strict tests have proved this system has met the anticipated requirements, and can be applied into many fields such as long-distance monitoring and household security.

40|$|Dementia care is {{becoming}} increasingly important in Japan as the elderly population grows. Care homes are designed so that caregivers can easily observe and subsequently respond {{to the needs of}} people with dementia. However, the layout of care homes can become overly restrictive for residents, for example, by not providing intermediate spaces where people can spontaneously interact and initiate conversations. We present a case study that explores the implementation of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> in two purpose-built care homes in which we were asked to help overcome the blind spots presented by the layout. We collected data {{both before and after the}} implementation of the <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> in order to understand its effect. The balance between people’s sense of security and the concerns about loss of privacy through <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> is well established. However, we found that <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> had a beneficial effect on both the caregivers and the residents if implemented sensitively. Furthermore, the implementation of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> could support the design of more beneficial care home layouts. In conclusion, we propose that the sensitive implementation of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> be considered alongside design of the physical layout of care homes...|$|R

Unlike a television set, a <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> has no tuner (television) and, as such, is unable independently to tune into an over-the-air broadcast like a television receiver.

Therefore, faced with a complex operating environment, it is extremely important to protect transmission line <b>video</b> <b>monitoring.</b> At present, the technology widely used in the power distribution and network communication in domestic power industry is EPON technology. This technology has a broad application prospect on the transmission of electrical circuit <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> information.

The current study aims to prevent rare target-detection failures during visual search through the use of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Targets are sometimes missed when their prevalence during visual search is extremely low (e. g., in airport baggage screenings). Participants performed a visual search in which they were required to discern the presence of a tool in the midst of other objects. The participants were <b>monitored</b> via <b>video</b> cameras as they performed the task in one session (the videotaped condition), and they performed the same task in another session without being monitored (the non-videotaped condition). The results showed that fewer miss errors occurred in the videotaped condition, regardless of target prevalence. It appears that the decrease in misses in the <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> condition resulted from a shift in criterion location. <b>Video</b> <b>monitoring</b> is considered useful in inducing accurate scanning. It is possible that the potential for evaluation involved in being observed motivates the participants to perform well and is related to the shift in criterion...|$|R
