60|$|Immediately {{after leaving}} the Blackwater bridge we had a {{grateful}} touch of an Indian trail. The telegraph route kept to the <b>valley</b> <b>flat,</b> but an old trail turned {{to the right and}} climbed the north bank by an easy and graceful grade which it was a joy to follow. The top of the bench was wooded and grassy, and the smooth brown trail wound away sinuous as a serpent under the splendid pine trees. For more than three hours we strolled along this bank as distinguished as those who occupy boxes at the theatre. Below us the Blackwater looped away under a sunny sky, and far beyond, enormous and unnamed, deep blue mountains rose, notching the western sky. The scene was so exceedingly rich and amiable we could hardly believe it to be without farms and villages, yet only an Indian hut or two gave indication of human life.|$|E
60|$|There were no {{houses in}} the summit of Sonoma Mountain, and, all alone under the azure California sky, he reined in on the {{southern}} edge of the peak. He saw open pasture country, intersected with wooded canons, descending to the south and west from his feet, crease on crease and roll on roll, from lower level to lower level, to the floor of Petaluma <b>Valley,</b> <b>flat</b> as a billiard-table, a cardboard affair, all patches and squares of geometrical regularity where the fat freeholds were farmed. Beyond, to the west, rose range on range of mountains cuddling purple mists of atmosphere in their valleys; and still beyond, over the last range of all, he saw the silver sheen of the Pacific. Swinging his horse, he surveyed the west and north, from Santa Rosa to St. Helena, and on to the east, across Sonoma to the chaparral-covered range that shut off the view of Napa Valley. Here, part way up the eastern wall of Sonoma Valley, in range of a line intersecting the little village of Glen Ellen, he made out a scar upon a hillside. His first thought was that it was the dump of a mine tunnel, but remembering that he was not in gold-bearing country, he dismissed the scar from his mind and continued the circle of his survey to the southeast, where, across the waters of San Pablo Bay, he could see, sharp and distant, the twin peaks of Mount Diablo. To the south was Mount Tamalpais, and, yes, he was right, fifty miles away, where the draughty winds of the Pacific blew in the Golden Gate, the smoke of San Francisco made a low-lying haze against the sky.|$|E

Correct prediction of the depth of scour is required for the design of buried pipeline crossings.

30|$|Geomorphological {{features}} {{recognized in}} the area are hills, pediments, and valley flats. The topography of the study area is undulating. A hill is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain. In this study, hills are typically observed in areas underlain by gneissic rocks that are well exposed in the northwestern parts of the study area. Areas with hills usually have less groundwater potentials. Floodplain is an area of land adjacent to a stream or river that stretches from the banks of its channel {{to the base of the}} enclosing valley walls and experiences flooding during periods of high discharge (Goudie 2004). Rainwater travels deep into the ground of a floodplain to replenish groundwater supply (Maness 2015). Therefore, it is expected that areas covered with flood plains would hold more groundwater. In this study, floodplains are found around Ogbese and Isijogun. Valley flats are low linear areas occurring between hills. These units occupy the lowest reaches in topography with nearly level slope. The <b>valley</b> <b>flat</b> deposits are colluvium fluvial origin derived from weathering and deposited by the action of streams at the floor of valleys (Sedhuraman et al. 2014). In the study area, these features are identified between the hills in the northern part of the study area.|$|E

40|$|Several process-based {{models of}} river {{incision}} {{have been proposed}} {{in recent years that}} attempt to describe fluvial landform development. Although some field tests have been performed, more data are required to test the ability of these models to predict the observed evolution of fluvial landforms. We have investigated several tens of rivers located in the French western Alps that flow across folded sedimentary rocks with strongly contrasting rock strengths. These rivers record significant variations in some of the parameters controlling river incision, notably bedrock lithology, stream power, incision rate, and sediment flux, potentially allowing discrimination between existing models. Variations in incision rates are driven by variations in the amount of disequilibrium introduced in the river profiles during the last glaciation. We use diagnostic indices to investigate transport- and detachment-limited conditions, which include the channel morphology, the occurrence of lithogenic knickpoints, the continuity of alluvial and bedrock reaches, and the slope-area scaling of the river long profile. We observe transitions from detachment-limited to transport-limited conditions with increasing discharge/drainage area and decreasing incision rate. Bedrock strength influences the location of the transition predictably. The formation of transport-limited rivers coincides with the development of a <b>valley</b> <b>flat</b> wider than the active channel, which accommodates variations in bedrock strength, stream power, and incision rate along the transport-limited reaches. We propose and calibrate a model for the development of valley flats along transport-limited rivers and explore some properties of landscape development in mountain ranges controlled by transport-limited rivers...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide a {{detailed}} vertical velocity field in southernmost Longitudinal Valley where shows a complex three-fault system at the plate suture between Philippine Sea plate and Eurasia, we conducted leveling and GPS measurements, compiled data from previous surveys and combined them into a single data set. We compiled precise leveling results from 1984 to 2009, include 5 E-W trending and one N-S trending routes. We calculated the GPS vertical component from 10 continuous stations and from 89 campaign-mode stations from 1995 to 2010. The interseismic vertical rates are estimated by removing the co- and post-seismic effects of major large regional and nearby earthquakes. A stable continuous station S 104 {{in the study area}} was adopted as the common reference station. We finally establish a map of the interseismic vertical velocity field. The interseismic vertical deformation was mainly accommodated by creeping/thrusting along two east-dipping strands of the three-fault system: the Luyeh and Lichi faults. The most dominant uplift of 30 mm yr- 1 occurs at the hanging wall of the Lichi fault on the western Coastal Range. However the rate diminishes away from the fault in the hanging wall. The Quaternary tablelands inside of the Longitudinal Valley reveals uplift with a rate of 5 - 10 mm yr- 1. Outside of the tablelands, the rest of the Longitudinal <b>Valley</b> <b>flat</b> area indicates substantial subsidence of - 10 to - 20 mm yr- 1. Finally, it appears that the west-dipping blind fault under {{the eastern side of the}} Central Range does not play a significant role on interseismic deformation with subsidence rate of - 5 to - 10 mm yr- 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Long-term {{overgrazing}} has re-sulted in grassland deterioration {{and even}} deserti-fication {{on the eastern}} Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In this paper, we examined the characteristics of vegetation and soil properties in the livestock-ex-cluded pastures and the adjacent grazed pastures under two topographic habitats (the <b>flat</b> <b>valley</b> and the south-facing slope). Seven-year exclusion of livestock has enhanced aboveground live biomass, root biomass and litter accumulation. Livestock exclusion has also increased soil bulk density and soil water content, soil organic C concentration, total N concentration and its transformation rate, and soil microbial activity. The results showed that livestock exclusion has facilitated vegetation recovery and improved physical, chemical and bi-ological properties of soil. However, livestock ex-clusion has significantly decreased graminoid bio-mass accumulation, especially on the <b>flat</b> <b>valley,</b> the biodiversity also significantly decreased there. The results suggested that long-term livestock ex-clusion was disadvantageous for palatable forage production and biodiversity protection on the <b>flat</b> <b>valley.</b> Compared to the <b>flat</b> <b>valley,</b> the grassland on the south-facing slope was under more severe degradation, and the reversion was in a slower process. Thus, the optimal grassland management in the livestock-excluded pasture on the <b>flat</b> <b>valley</b> should include a low or moderate grazing inten-sity or adopt an alternate grazing system, but more effective and even longer livestock exclusion prac-tice should be taken on the south-facing slope...|$|R
