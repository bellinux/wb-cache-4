50|$|<b>Vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> {{of swine}} virus (VESV) is a virus {{different}} from those causing Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) and Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD) but it produces a disease in pigs that is clinically indistinguishable from FMD and SVD. Unlike FMD it only affects pigs.|$|E
50|$|Vesivirus is a genus of viruses, in {{the family}} Caliciviridae. Swine, sea mammals, and felines serve as natural hosts. There are {{currently}} only two species in this genus including the type species <b>Vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> of swine virus. Diseases associated with this genus include: respiratory disease, feline calicivirus (FCV); conjunctivitis, and respiratory disease.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{that used}} proteinase K to cleave VPg from the viral genome {{discovered}} that calicivirus <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> virus lacking VPg {{is no longer}} infectious whereas poliovirus retains infectivity even with the absence of VPg. Because VPg sits at the 5' end of the genome, similar to eukaryotic 5' mRNA caps, several experiments were performed to explore its function in translation. Poliovirus utilizes an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) instead of a cap for translation initiation, abrogating the requirement of VPg in initial infection whereas studies with feline calicivirus confirmed that the VPg protein interacts directly with the cap-binding protein of the ribosome, eIF4E, and that this interaction is essential for viral translation.|$|E

Three cases were reported on July 17, and 4 cases each were reported on July 18 and 19. The 11 cases, which included 5 girls and 6 boys, were from two classes that shared noontime rest in the same room. Nine (81.8  %) cases exhibited <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> on hands, feet and in the mouth, 9 cases (81.8  %) exhibited herpangina, and 10 (90.9  %) cases exhibited mild fever (< 38.5  °C).

40|$|RNA {{labeled with}} [3 H]uridine from Vero cells {{infected}} with San Miguel sea lion virus {{in the presence}} of actinomycin D was analyzed by glycerol density gradient sedimentation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The predominant single-stranded RNA (36 S, 2. 6 x 10 (6) molecular weight) was genome size. There was also a prominent 22 S, 1. 1 x 10 (6) -molecular weight, single-stranded component and one or more double-stranded or partially double-stranded classes. Replicative forms, sedimenting at 18 S, contained single-stranded RNA corresponding to the larger-molecular-weight class. All classes of intracellular RNA and virion RNA were polyadenylated. These findings and results with pig kidney cells infected with <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> of swine virus and feline cells infected with feline calicivirus indicate that caliciviruses exhibit a strategy of replication different from typical picornaviruses and supports removal of the caliciviruses from the family Picornaviridae...|$|E

40|$|The San Miguel {{sea lion}} viruses (SMSV) and <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> of swine viruses (VESV) are related morphologically and antigenically, but {{little has been}} done to {{determine}} their genotypic relationship {{to each other and to}} other caliciviruses. To examine this relationship, reverse transcriptase PCRs were performed by using oligonucleotide primer sets designed to amplify portions of the 2 C RNA helicase-like and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions with total cellular RNA purified from virus-infected cell cultures as a template. The 2 C RNA helicase primers directed the amplification of this region from eight SMSV serotypes, five VESV serotypes, and four related viruses. The RNA polymerase primer sets amplified products from all these viruses except one. Phylogenetic comparison of the caliciviruses demonstrated that SMSV, VESV, and four related viruses are closely related while being distinct from feline calicivirus, the human caliciviruses (small, round-structured viruses), and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and that they should be classified as a single genotype within the Caliciviridae...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> virus, the prototype {{member of the}} calicivirus group, has been studied in more detail.

40|$|We have {{prepared}} monoclonal antibodies to the capsid protein of feline calicivirus (FCV). These antibodies are directed against two close but distinct epitopes, {{only one of}} which is involved in virus neutralization, We have used these antibodies and immune cat serum in immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments and have identified novel proteins in FCV-infected cells which we term P 78, P 41, P 35 and P 29. The number and sizes of FCV proteins now known resemble those made by other caliciviruses. The caliciviruses are a group whose members show the same distinctive morphology (Schaffer et al., 1980). The non-enveloped virus particles are roughly spherical and have a characteristic surface pattern of 32 cup-shaped depressions from which the virus group derives its name. The capsid is constructed from one major polypeptide which varies in size between members but lies in the Mr range 60 K to 70 K (reviewed by Schaffer, 1979).

40|$|Abstract Background Prompt {{detection}} of PRRSV {{in the field}} samples is important for effective PRRS control, thereby reducing the potentially serious economic damage which can result from an outbreak. In this study, a rapid SYBR-based, one step real-time RT-PCR quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) has been developed for the {{detection of}} porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Primers were designed based on the sequence of highly conservative region of PRRSV N gene. Results The sensitivity of the real-time qRT-PCR assay was achieved through PRRSV ch- 1 a RNA for the generation of a standard curve. The detection limit of the assay was found to be 9. 6 RNA copies per reaction mixture. This assay had excellent intra- and inter-assay reproducibility as in total 65 field samples were screened for the presence of PRRSV by conventional RT-PCR in parallel with qRT-PCR, and the detection rate increased from 60. 0 % to 76. 9 %. Moreover, the specificity result indicated that this assay could reliably differentiate PRRSV from the other swine viral diseases, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) and <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> of swine virus (VESV). Conclusion The real-time qRT-PCR assay described in this report allows the rapid, specific and sensitive laboratory detection of PRRSV in field samples. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> {{of swine}} virus type A 48 or San Miguel sea lion virus type 2, when inoculated intradermally into swine, {{resulted}} in fluid-filled vesicles at {{the sites of}} inoculation in the snout, coronary band, and tongue. Pigs that developed vesicles also had fevers. Secondary vesicle formation varied, depending on virus serotype. Viremia was found in one pig infected with San Miguel sea lion virus five days after infection. Virus was recovered from nasal-oral passages {{for up to five}} days after infection in both groups of pigs and from the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts of pigs infected with San Miguel sea lion virus. Neutralizing antibodies began to increase three days after inoculation and reached peak titers in seven to ten days. In the absence of secondary bacterial infection, healing was well advanced by ten days after inoculation. Lesions usually were limited to nonhaired portions of the integument and tongue. Individual epithelial cells became infected when a break in the skin allowed virus access to susceptible epithelial cells from either exogenous or endogenous sources. Individual infected cells ruptured and adjacent cells were infected, resulting in the formation of multiple microvesicles. Centrif-ugal coalescence of microvesicles led to formation of grossly visible macrovesicles. Lesion...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide in a pass-through box for the decontamination {{of equipment and}} inanimate materials potentially contaminated with exotic animal viruses was evaluated. Tests were conducted {{with a variety of}} viral agents, which included representatives of several virus families (Orthomyxoviridae, Reoviridae, Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Rhabdoviridae) from both avian and mammalian species, with particular emphasis on animal viruses exotic to Canada. The effects of the gas on a variety of laboratory equipment were also studied. Virus suspensions in cell culture media, egg fluid, or blood were dried onto glass and stainless steel. Virus viability was assessed after exposure to vaporphase hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. For all viruses tested and under all conditions (except one), the decontamination process reduced the virus titer to 0 embryo-lethal doses for the avian viruses (avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses) or less than 10 tissue culture infective doses for the mammalian viruses (African swine fever, bluetongue, hog cholera, pseudorabies, swine vesicular disease, <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema,</b> and vesicular stomatitis viruses). The laboratory equipment exposed to the gas appeared to suffer no adverse effects. Vaporphase hydrogen peroxide decontamination can be recommended as a safe and efficacious way of removing potentially virus-contaminated objects from biocontainment level III laboratories in which exotic animal disease virus agents are handled...|$|E
30|$|Hand, foot, {{and mouth}} disease (HFMD) is {{characterized}} by mild febrile illness and <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> on hands, feet and mouth. HFMD is a virus-induced infectious disease affecting mainly infants and children, typically causing outbreaks in kindergartens and primary schools. Severe cases can also involve serious complications, such as encephalitis, meningitis, or death. HMFD is considered a substantial public health threat, and ranked first among category C infectious diseases by the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China in 2008. The predominant causative agents of HFMD are enterovirus 71 (EV-A 71) and coxsackievirus A 16 (CV-A 16); additionally, other CVA, CVB, and some echoviruses {{have been reported to}} cause HFMD (He et al. 2013). Since 2012, a newly emerged enterovirus (CV-A 6) has rapidly replaced the original circulating strains EV-A 71 and CV-A 16, becoming the predominant etiological agent of HFMD in some areas in China (Han et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2014). CV-A 6 is classified as human enterovirus A in the family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus, and is an etiological agent of mild herpangina or HFMD (Mirand et al. 2012; Osterback et al. 2009; Sinclair et al. 2014; Wei et al. 2011). CV-A 6 has also been reported to cause outbreaks worldwide (Feder et al. 2014; Puenpa et al. 2013; Fujimoto et al. 2012; He et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Virus {{particles}} morphologically {{similar to}} caliciviruses and rotaviruses were detected by electron microscopy (EM) in the intestinal {{contents of a}} 27 -day-old diarrheic nursing pig. A third small spherical 23 -nm virus-like particle was also observed. Calicivirus-like particles averaged 33 nm in diameter. Similar to rotaviruses, rotavirus-like particles were present as single-capsid 55 -nm forms or double-capsid 70 -nm particles. Most gnotobiotic pigs orally exposed to samples containing these three viruses developed diarrhea and villous atrophy of the small intestine, and all shed the three viruses in their intestinal contents. Attempts to propagate these viruses in cell culture were unsuccessful. The antigenic relationship of the rotavirus-like particles to known rotaviruses was explored by immune EM and immunofluorescent staining. By these techniques, the rotavirus-like particles did not cross-react with antisera to porcine, bovine, or human rotaviruses or to reovirus type 3. Antisera from gnotobiotic pigs exposed to all three viruses had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and virus neutralization titers of < 4 against porcine rotavirus. Previous infection of gnotobiotic pigs with the mixture containing rotavirus-like particles failed to protect them against a subsequent challenge with porcine rotavirus. The antigenic relationship of the calicivirus-like particles to known caliciviruses was investigated by immune EM and virus neutralization. By these tests, the calicivirus-like particles did not react with antisera against feline calicivirus strain 255 or M- 8. In a study conducted at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, antiserum against the three combined agents did not specifically neutralize any serotype of swine <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> virus...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-throughput}} multiplexed assay (Multiplex Version 1. 0) {{was developed}} for the differential laboratory diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) from viruses which cause clinically similar diseases of livestock. This assay simultaneously screens for five RNA and two DNA viruses using multiplexed reverse transcription PCR (mRT-PCR) amplification coupled with a microsphere hybridization array and flow-cytometric detection. Two of the seventeen primer-probe sets included in this multiplex assay were adopted from previously characterized real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for FMDV. The diagnostic accuracy of the mRT-PCR was evaluated using 287 field samples, including 248 (true positive n= 213, true negative n= 34) from suspect cases of foot-and-mouth disease collected from 65 countries between 1965 and 2006 and 39 true negative samples collected from healthy animals. The mRT-PCR assay results were compared with two singleplex rRT-PCR assays, using virus isolation with antigen-ELISA as the reference method. The diagnostic sensitivity of the mRT-PCR assay for FMDV was 93. 9 % [95 % C. I. 89. 8 - 96. 4 %], compared to 98. 1 % [95 % C. I. 95. 3 - 99. 3 %] for the two singleplex rRTPCR assays used in combination. In addition, the assay could reliably differentiate between FMDV and other vesicular viruses such as swine vesicular disease virus and <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> of swine virus. Interestingly, the mRT-PCR detected parapoxvirus (n= 2) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (n= 2) in clinical samples, demonstrating the screening potential of this mRT-PCR assay to identify viruses in FMDV-negative material not previously recognized using focused single-target rRT-PCR assays...|$|E
40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} is {{an important}} livestock disease endemic in the Americas. This zoonotic viral disease is characterized by vesicles, erosions and ulcers on the mouth, feet and udder. Pain, anorexia and secondary mastitis can cause decreased productivity in all species, and swine infected with some viruses may die. Although vesicular stomatitis is endemic in limited areas of the southeastern United States, these viruses have not caused outbreaks in livestock since the 1970 s. Epidemics in the Southwest are typically caused by newly introduced viruses, which usually disappear after 1 - 2 years. Affected herds are quarantined until the disease has run its course. Vesicular stomatitis closely resembles three vesicular diseases exotic to the U. S. : foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease, and <b>vesicular</b> <b>exanthema</b> of swine. Differentiation of these diseases is important, as a wrong diagnosis could mask the spread of an exotic disease. Prompt diagnosis is also important in containing outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis, which can restrict international trade. Etiology Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) {{is a member of}} the genus Vesiculovirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The two major serotypes are New Jersey and Indiana. Currently, four viruses are known to cause vesicular stomatitis: vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV-IN; formerly known as the Indiana 1 subtype of VSV), vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSV-NJ), vesicular stomatitis Alagoas virus (VSV-AV; formerly Indiana 3) and Cocal virus (formerly Indiana 2). The genus Vesiculovirus also contains related viruses (such as Piry virus) which have been isolated from animals, humans and/or arthropods and may cause vesicles after experimental inoculation. Species Affected Vesicular stomatitis mainly affects horses, donkeys, mules, cattle and swine. South American camelids, sheep and goats occasionally have clinical signs.

40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), in {{collaboration}} with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) has developed advanced rapid diagnostics that may be used within the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, Iowa) and the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). This effort has the potential to improve our nation's ability to discriminate between foreign animal diseases and those that are endemic using a single assay, thereby increasing our ability to protect animal populations of high economic importance in the United States. Under 2005 DHS funding we have developed multiplexed (MUX) nucleic-acid-based PCR assays that combine foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) detection with rule-out tests for two other foreign animal diseases <b>Vesicular</b> <b>Exanthema</b> of Swine (VESV) and Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD) and four other domestic viral diseases Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Bovine Herpes Virus 1 (BHV- 1 or Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitus IBR), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Parapox virus complex (which includes Bovine Papular Stomatitis Virus BPSV, Orf of sheep, and Pseudocowpox). Under 2006 funding we have developed a Multiplexed PCR [MUX] porcine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for VESV and SVD foreign animal diseases in addition to one other domestic vesicular animal disease vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and one domestic animal disease of swine porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). We have also developed a MUX bovine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for the two bovine foreign animal diseases malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), rinderpest virus (RPV) and the domestic diseases vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), infectious bovine rhinotracheitus virus (BHV- 1), bluetongue virus (BTV), and the Parapox viruses which are of two bovine types bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) and psuedocowpox (PCP). This document provides details of signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used. A condensed summary of the development, testing and performance of the multiplexed assay panel was presented in a 126 page separate document, entitled 'Development and Characterization of A Multiplexed RT-PCR Species Specific Assay for Bovine and one for Porcine Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Rule-Out'. This supplemental document provides additional details of large amount of data collected for signature generation, evaluation, and testing, as well as the specific methods and materials used for all steps in the assay development and utilization processes. In contrast to last years effort, the development of the bovine and porcine panels is pending additional work to complete analytical characterization of FMDV, VESV, VSV, SVD, RPV and MCF. The signature screening process and final panel composition impacts this effort. The unique challenge presented this year was having strict predecessor limitations in completing characterization, where efforts at LLNL must preceed efforts at PIADC, such challenges were alleviated in the 2006 reporting by having characterization data from the interlaboratory comparison and at Plum Island under AgDDAP project. We will present an addendum at a later date with additional data on the characterization of the porcine and bovine multiplex assays when that data is available...|$|E
40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{is a highly}} {{infectious}} and contagious viral disease affecting bovidae (cattle, zebus, domestic buffaloes, yaks), sheep, goats, swine, all wild ruminants and suidae. Camelidae (camels, dromedaries, llamas, vicunas) have low susceptibility. Foot and mouth disease {{is caused by a}} RNS virus of the family Picornaviridae, genus Aphthovirus. There are seven immunologically distinct serotypes: A, O, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, Asia 1. Foot and mouth disease causes significant economic loss both to countries who manage it as an endemic disease (with or without vaccination), as well as those FMD free countries which may become infected. The mortality rate is low in adult animals, but often higher in young due to myocarditis. Foot and mouth disease is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America (sporadic outbreaks in free areas). The Office of International Epizootics (OIE), also referred to the World Organization for Animal Health maintains an official list of free countries and zones. 1 The OIE Terrestrial Code (Chapter 2. 2. 10) provides detailed information on the categories of freedom that can be allocated to a country as well as guidelines for the surveillance for foot and mouth disease (Appendix 3. 8. 7). In short, countries may be completely free of FMD, free with vaccination or infected with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). Source of FMDV include incubating and clinically affected animals with virus present in breath, saliva, faeces, urine, milk and semen. In experimental settings virus has been detected in milk several days before the onset of clinical signs 2. Additional sources of virus are meat and by-products in which pH has remained above 6. 0 as well as persistently infected carrier animals. Carrier animals may include cattle and water buffalo; convalescent animals and exposed vaccinates (virus persists in the oropharynx for up to 30 months in cattle or longer in buffalo, 9 months in sheep). Pigs do not become carriers. It has been shown that the African Cape buffalo are the major maintenance host of SAT serotypes. FMDV transmission can occur by either direct or indirect contact. Indirect transmission can occur via contaminated animate vectors (humans, etc.), inanimate vectors (vehicles, implements) or airborne transmission. Indirect disease transmission via animate or inanimate vectors can {{play a major role in}} disease transmission. Good biosecurity can significantly reduce this type of transmission. Airborne transmission is often debated and is known to be serotype and species specific as well as require specific environmental conditions to occur. Airborne transmission is favored in temperate zones and has been postulated to occur over distances of up to 60 km overland and 300 km by sea. Foot and mouth disease virus is an unenveloped virus which is preserved by refrigeration and freezing and progressively inactivated by temperatures above 50 C. FMDV is highly sensitive to pH change and is inactivated by pH 9. 0. There are many disinfectants which are effective against FMDV including sodium hydroxide (2 %), sodium carbonate (4 %), and citric acid (0. 2 %). FMDV is resistant to iodophores, quaternary ammonium compounds, hypochlorite and phenol, especially in the presence of organic matter. The virus can survive in lymph nodes and bone marrow at neutral pH, but is destroyed in muscle when is pH < 6. 0 i. e. after rigor mortis. FMDV can persist in contaminated feed/commodities and the environment for over to 1 month, depending on the temperature and pH conditions. The incubation period for FMD is 2 - 14 days. Animals transition through latent (infected but not infectious), subclinically infected (infectious but lacking clinical signs) clinically infected and recovered disease states. In cattle clinical signs include pyrexia, reluctance to eat, bruxism, drooling, lameness, treading or stamping of the feet and decreased milk production. Most clinical signs are related to the development and subsequent rupturing of vesicles at the coronary band and in the oral cavity. Vesicles and ulcerations can also occur on the mammary gland.
