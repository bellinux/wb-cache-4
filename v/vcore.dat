40|$|A Non-Uniform Memory-Access (NUMA) {{machine is}} {{currently}} the most deployed type of a hardware architecture for high performance computing. System virtualization {{on the other hand}} is increasingly adopted for various reasons. In a virtualized NUMA system, the NUMA attributes are transparent to guest OS’s.

Tradeoffs between performance, power, and energy are observable as virtual cores (<b>vcores)</b> and/or virtual addresses are mapped in different ways.

40|$|Consider a multithreaded {{parallel}} application running {{inside a}} multicore VM context that is itself hosted on a multi-socket multicore physical machine. How should the VMM map virtual cores (vcores) to physical cores? We compare a local mapping, which compacts virtual cores to processor sockets, and an interleaved mapping, which spreads {{them over the}} sockets. Dynamic Adaptive <b>Vcore</b> Mapping for Various Objectives We have demonstrated the opportunity for optimizing for performance, power, and energy presented {{by being able to}} simply choose between local and interleaved mappings of virtual cores to physical cores. This opportunity is leveraged in an automatic adaptive system that chooses between these two mappings. We implemented and evaluated {{in the context of the}} Palacios VMM [1, 2, 3] to do this. We demonstrate that the performance of SPEC and PARSEC benchmarks can be increased by as much as 66 %, energy reduced by as much as 31 %, and power reduced by as much as 17 %, depending on the optimization objective. The overhead of system is concentrated in page table scanning and <b>vcore</b> remapping; the worst case we observed takes 4. 6 ms and 5. 3 ms for each. The overall overhead in one execution is clearly negligible even in the worst case that has less than 0. 05 % overhead.

The Aggregator and mapping components are controlled and called by the Mapper component. VMM-base Measurement We took several measures to arrive at our set of metrics.

Finally, we selected a minimally correlated set. <b>Vcore</b> Mapping Policy Our approach is based on modeling, in which we run diverse workloads on the machine. As the machine runs, we continue to collect the metrics, and use their values, plus the models, to make predictions of the relative utility of the two mappings, deciding between them in pursuit of the currently chosen goal...|$|E

40|$|When new {{transistor}} {{technology is}} used in a microcontroller design, the transistors become smaller. They cannot withstand the same voltages as older technology, because of their size. The automotive industry still uses 5 V as a standard voltage, and the automotive industry is a major costumer for microcontroller companies. The microcontroller must therefore {{be able to use}} 5 V. This must be done without the need of external voltage regulator. To still be a supplier to the automotive industry, the AVR {{needs to be able to}} withstand voltages up to 5. 5 V. The main problem with the new transistor technology is the leakage currents. Traditionally, the CMOS devices have used power only when during switching of logical levels. This is no longer true, since the leakage currents have become so large. When using new transistor technology, the dynamic power usage will be reduced, but the total power usage will be increased, if nothing is done to prevent it. One solution to this is to make a multiple power domain microcontroller. The idea is that one power domain can withstand voltages up to 5. 5 V. The microcontroller then uses an internal voltage regulator to scale down the voltage to a suitable level. The low voltage area will then have a suitable voltage level, which reduces both the dynamic- and leakage power usage. The different voltage domains uses different clock sources, so communicating between them requires both level shifters to deal with the different voltage levels, and synchronization logic to prevent metastability. This assignment uses two voltage domains, VIO and <b>VCORE.</b> Since voltage regulators are quite inefficient, it is most efficient to use only two domains. The <b>VCORE</b> domain contains most of the digital logic of the microcontroller, such as the CPU, SRAM and timers. This domain uses a high-speed clock source, and a <b>VCORE</b> data bus to communicate between each other. To communicate with the VIO domain, the data bus is connected to the VIO data bus through an asynchronous communication scheme block. This is because the VIO domain uses a low speed clock source. The usage of individual clock sources prevents clock skew problems that may occur when passing level shifters, and there is power saving by using only a low speed clock source on the VIO domain. The VIO domain contains the Power Management Unit (PMU). The PMU shall control the power usage of the microcontroller. During active mode, the PMU can set unused modules in sleep mode, or shut them completely off. Most of the power savings are during sleep mode though. This is because a microcontroller such as the AVR spends most of the time in sleep mode. To reduce the power usage in sleep mode, the leakage currents needs to be reduced. The best way of doing so is to disconnect the power from the circuits. If the voltage regulator is disconnected, and all the inputs are set to high impedance, the <b>VCORE</b> domain is completely disconnected from the power, and uses absolutely no power. An asynchronous wake up circuit is designed to make it possible to wake up the microcontroller from a sleep mode without the usage of synchronized digital logic. Then the low frequency oscillator can be turned off, and even more power is saved. The major disadvantage of the multiple power domain solution is the start up time from a sleep mode. If the power to the low voltage area is disconnected, the start up requires that all the capacitors become charged before the chip can start running again. The oscillator is shut off, and it takes time to stabilize the oscillator. Especially since the oscillator requires some stability in the voltage, and the voltage may not stable until the capacitors are charged. Simulations shows that the multiple power domain solution has great potential of power saving. The proposed asynchronous wake up circuit uses only 1. 2275 nA. This is significantly smaller than the AVR uses in the deepest sleep mode today. To get a secure microcontroller, a reset circuit has to be on to be able to reset the AVR if necessary. The power usage of the reset circuit used today is confidential Atmel information, and cannot be published in this assignment. By looking at the data sheet of a pico power circuit of the AVR, the ATmega 329 p, one can see that in the deepest sleep mode, the microcontroller uses 40 nA at 1. 8 V. By assuming that the reset circuit does not use more that half of this current, the total amount of power that saved during a sleep mode by using the multiple power domain solution is about 47 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aims. We present optical long-slit {{spectra of}} the Virgo dwarf {{elliptical}} galaxy VCC 510 at high spectral (σ∼ 30 km/s) and spatial resolution. The principal {{aim is to}} unravel its kinematical and stellar population properties. Methods. Heliocentric velocities and velocity dispersions as functions of galaxy radius are derived by deconvolving line-of-sight velocity distributions. The luminosity-weighted stellar population parameters age and element abundances are obtained by comparison of Lick absorption-line indices with stellar population models. Results. A maximum rotation vrot = 8 ± 2. 5 km/s inside half the effective radius (re ≈ 20 ′′) and a mean, radially flat velocity dispersion σ= 44 ± 5 km/s are measured. The core extending over the inner 2 ′ ′ (∼ 140 pc) is found to rotate in the opposite sense with <b>vcore</b> rot ≈− 1 / 2 vrot. VCC 510 (MB∼− 15. 7) is therefore by far the faintest and smallest galaxy with a counter-rotating core known. From the main body rotation and the velocity dispersion profile we deduce that VCC 510 is anisotropic and clearly not entirely supported by rotation. We derive an old luminosity-weighted age (10 ± 3 Gyr) and sub-solar metallicity ([Z/H]=− 0. 4 ± 0. 1) inside the effective radius. There is tentative evidence that the counter-rotating core might be younger and lessα/Fe enhanced. From the stellar population parameters we obtain a total stellar massto-light ratio of ∼ 3. 6 (M/LB) ⊙ which is significantly lower than a rough dynamical estimate obtained from the kinematics through the virial theorem (∼ 15). This discrepancy hints toward the possible presence of dark matter in the centre of VCC 510...|$|E
40|$|Context. Since 1973 it {{is known}} that some Hi high {{velocity}} clouds (HVCs) have a core-envelope structure. Recent observations of compact HVCs confirm this but more general investigations have been missing so far. Aims. We study the properties of all major HVC complexes from a sample compiled 1991 by Wakker & van Woerden (WvW). Methods. We use the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21 -cm line survey and decompose the profiles into Gaussian components. Results. We find the WvW line widths and column densities underestimated by ∼ 40 %. In 1991 these line widths could not be measured directly but had to be estimated with the help of higher-resolution data. We find a well defined multi-component structure for most of the HVC complexes. The cold HVC phase has lines with typical velocity dispersionsσ= 3 km s − 1 and exists only within more extended broad line regions, typically withσ = 12 km s − 1. The motions of the cores relative to the envelopes are characterized by Mach numbers M = (<b>vcore</b> − venvelope) /σenvelope ∼ 1. 5. The center velocities of the cores within a HVC complex have typical dispersions of 20 km s − 1. Remarkable is the well defined two-component structure for some prominent HVC complexes in the outskirts of the Milky Way: Complex H lies approximately in the galactic plane, and the most plausible distance estimate of R∼ 33 kpc places it {{at the edge of the}} disk.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{property and}} intraparticle {{structure of the}} γ phase of Fe 2 O 3 (maghemite) nanoparticles with a diameter (D) of 5. 1 ± 0. 5 nm were investigated through AC and DC magnetic measurements and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at pressures (P) up to 27. 7 kbar. Maghemite originally exhibits ferrimagnetic ordering below 918 K, and has an inverse-spinel structure with vacancies. Maghemitenanoparticles studied here consist of acore with structural periodicity and a disordered shell without the periodicity, and core shows superparamagnetism. The DC and AC susceptibilities reveal that the anisotropy energy barrier (ΔE/kB) and the effective value of the core moment decrease against the initial pressure (P≤ 3. 8 kbar), recovering at P≥ 3. 8 kbar. The change of ΔE/kB with P is qualitatively identical {{with that of the}} core moment, suggesting a down-and-up fluctuation of the number of Fe 3 + ions constituting the core at the pressure threshold of about 4 kbar. This phenomenon was confirmed by the analysis of the XRD measurement using Scherrer’s formula. The core volume decreased for P≤ 2. 5 kbar, whereas at higher pressure the core was restructured. For 2. 5 ≤P≤ 10. 7 kbar, the volume shrinkage of particle hardly occurs. There, ΔE/kB is approximately proportional to the volume associated to the ordered fraction of the nanoparticles as seen from XRD, <b>Vcore.</b> From this dependence it is possible to separate the core/shell contribution to ΔE/kB and estimate core and surface anisotropy constants. As for the structural experiments, similar experimental data have been obtained for D= 12. 8 ± 3. 2 nm as well.
