50|$|The American Terra Cotta Tile and Ceramic Company {{was founded}} in 1881; {{originally}} as Spring <b>Valley</b> <b>Tile</b> Works; in Terra Cotta, Illinois, between Crystal Lake, Illinois and McHenry, Illinois near Chicago by William Day Gates. It became the country's first manufactury of architectural terra cotta. The production consisted of drain tile, brick, chimney tops, finials, urns, and other economically fireproof building materials. Gates used the facilities to experiment with clays and glazes {{in an effort to}} design a line of art pottery which led to the introduction of Teco Pottery (TErra COtta) in 1899. American Terra Cotta's records are housed at the University of Minnesota and include original architectural drawings.|$|E
50|$|Roof tiles are 'hung' {{from the}} {{framework}} of a roof by fixing them with nails. The tiles are usually hung in parallel rows, with each row overlapping the row below it to exclude rainwater and to cover the nails that hold the row below. There are also roof tiles for special positions, particularly where the planes of the several pitches meet. They include ridge, hip and <b>valley</b> <b>tiles.</b> These can either be bedded and pointed in cement mortar or mechanically fixed.|$|R
25|$|The valley {{stage in}} MUSHA {{utilizes}} the Genesis' vertical parallax scrolling capabilities, which was later highlighted by critics {{as one of}} the game's most impressive technical features. The stage was programmed by Yuuichi Sotoyama, who also programmed the enemies that move {{in and out of the}} depths of the <b>valley,</b> and <b>tiles</b> that fall into the screen in other stages. Sotoyama worked with the sound effects programmer Masanobu Tsukamoto to modulate the frequency of the sound effects when objects moved in and out of the screen to simulate the Doppler effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of Elham was 1,192 in 1881. Elham Valley Railway opened in 1889 and closed in 1947. There are still traces {{of its existence}} throughout the parish such as {{the remains of the}} station platforms at the bottom of Duck Lane. Until the early 1900s a brickworks existed within the village (the Elham <b>Valley</b> Brick and <b>Tile</b> Company) with kilns situated {{on the east side of}} the valley.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{abundant}} well-drained clay {{all along}} the <b>valley</b> ridge, <b>tile</b> and brick making is documented here {{as far back as}} the late 1600s. Rhead's book Staffordshire Pots and Potters (1906) found only a one-man water-pipe business in Basford at 1818, but noted traces of a possible early pottery: [...] "... there were scattered foundations of what might have been a pottery in King's fields, with the remains of low arches as of oven or kiln 'mouths'." [...] During the 1830s, the area along the base of the escarpment featured the full range of brick and tile yards and small ceramics manufactories, increasingly working at an industrial scale. [...] Despite this, substantial pockets of fields and woods persisted, notably the Etruria Woods. As late as 1929 aerial photography reveals large fields of corn and wheat being harvested directly alongside large tile-works at Basford.|$|R
50|$|A {{side effect}} of {{irrigation}} in the San Joaquin Valley was that ground water levels began to rise over time. This led to a condition where excess water was accumulating and starting to harm crops. In 1968, the Bureau of Reclamation created the 134 km long San Luis Drain and the Kesterson Reservoir. Farmers in the San Joaquin <b>valley</b> installed drainage <b>tiles</b> {{in an effort to}} maintain water tables at 2 meters. The Kesterson reservoir was completed in 1971 by the Bureau of Reclamation and consisted of 12 evaporation ponds within the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge.|$|R
5000|$|Princes Road {{marks the}} {{boundary}} of Central Park through which the Darent Valley Way passes, exiting beside the museum & library. Turn right {{at the corner of}} Dartford Library along the front of the museum and stay on the footpath to a Pelican crossing, turning right towards The Wat Tyler Inn where the path follows Bullace Lane to the pedestrian underpass under the Hanau Bridge bus stops. Walk up the ramp and locate the signposted path to the rear of offices. Proceed to the wooden bridge close to Dartford train station and pass under it (and the railway) to enter Mill Pond Road. Turn left here and, when convenient and safe, cross Mill Pond Road. In view of the gasworks, at the roundabout, is an embedded Darent <b>Valley</b> Path <b>tile!</b> Turn right into Lower Hythe Street, passing The Hufflers Arms. After 100 metres, take [...] "Nelsons Row" [...] pathway to the right. Signposted and marked DB10, it is maintained in passable condition by local lengthsman volunteers of [...] "The Friends of Dartford and Crayford Creek". Nelsons Row pathway leads over the River Darent by [...] "Nelson's Row" [...] slipway which is used by kayakers as the only access facility on the [...] "Esat Bank". Turn immediately left on crossing the bridge and follow the path along the east bank of the river, behind industrial estates. A specially built walkway further along places you almost directly over the river and in sight of the ruckings of Dartford Lock, as The Darent Valley Path heads into marsh land. The Path drops under the A206, before following the flood defences out to Dartford Flood Barrier where it joins the river Thames.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 A lack of {{reliable}} criteria for designing tile drainage {{systems in the}} Willamette Valley has lead to tile drainage installations in a given soil series being based on general observations of previous drain performance in the series. Relatively few quantitative measurements, which would aid in designing economical installations, have been made on existing tile systems in the <b>Valley.</b> An experimental <b>tile</b> installation with tile spacings of 30, 60, and 90 feet was made in what {{was considered to be}} a modal soil of the Amity Soil Series. Records of rainfall, tile flow, water table position, and water table profiles were obtained during the winter and spring for three years. Mathematical models programmed for a digital computer were constructed from the field data to simulate water table movement for combinations of 90, 120, and 150 foot tile spacings; unrestricted, 1. 0, and 0. 5 inch per day main line capacities; surface storage; and a grassed or bare soil surface. Rainfall in the Willamette Valley is quite variable in amount and distribution from year to year, hence 16 years of hourly rainfall and monthly evaporation were used with the simulator programs to generate 16 years of monthly summaries of water table depths for March, April, and May. The data from the simulator programs were then analyzed to obtain estimates of probable water table depths for the several drainage installations simulated. Estimates were also obtained for the effects of surface cover, surface storage, restricting main line capacity, and changing tile spacing...|$|R
