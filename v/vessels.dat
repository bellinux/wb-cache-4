Detailed data of individual ferry <b>vessel</b> accidents for the 11 -year time period 1991 - 2001 that were investigated by the U. S. Coast Guard are used to estimate ferry-vessel accident property damage cost and injury severity equations. Tobit regression is used to estimate the former equation and the ordered probit model is used to estimate the latter. Property damage costs include damage costs to the <b>vessel</b> itself, its cargo and contents, and other-property damage (e. g., damage to pier structures and waterfront facilities). Injury severity for a ferry <b>vessel</b> accident is measured as an ordinal variable – no injuries, non-fatal injuries and fatal injuries. Damage cost and injury severity of individual ferry <b>vessel</b> accidents are expressed as functions {{of the type of}} <b>vessel</b> accident, <b>vessel</b> characteristics, <b>vessel</b> operation phase, weather/visibility conditions, type of waterway, type of <b>vessel</b> propulsion, type of <b>vessel</b> hull construction and cause of <b>vessel</b> accident. The property damage estimation results suggest that allision, collision and fire ferry <b>vessel</b> accidents incur more <b>vessel</b> property damage cost per <b>vessel</b> gross ton than other types of accidents. The injury severity estimation results suggest that injury severity is greater when the ferry <b>vessel</b> accident is caused by human error as opposed to <b>vessel</b> and environmental factors...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient <b>vessels</b> in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient <b>vessels</b> were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era <b>vessels</b> to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han <b>vessels</b> in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
