30|$|Unfortunately, {{there remains}} {{substantial}} {{doubt about the}} adequacy of most models, a concern that can be traced {{in large part to}} the complexity of brain multiscale interactions described in Introduction. Most <b>validation</b> to <b>date</b> is at the level of numerical validation of the accuracy of simulation rather than experimental validation of the overall model [80]. As models increase in sophistication, they will also begin to deviate further from the basis in animal experimentation on which most model parameters are based, in order to more closely match the human condition. Although desirable to obtain these parameters directly from people, or in some cases from the individual patient, clinical measurements are severely restricted compared to what can be done in animals. Clinical experimentation is typically limited to the testing of new medications or diagnostic tests on large populations. Direct experimentation on the individual patient is also possible in very limited circumstances. For example, an epileptic patient will often be empirically treated with one drug after another, with each being titrated up to a maximum dose or till not tolerated, to find a medication that will prevent seizures in that particular patient. Ideally, multiscale modeling using individualized testing of genomic and pathologic variants will be able to reduce this kind of patient experimentation.|$|R

The most comprehensive <b>validation</b> to <b>date</b> of cloud liquid water estimated from satellites is presented.

40|$|The Mascot score (M-score) {{is one of}} the {{conventional}} validity measures in data base identification of peptides and proteins by MS/MS data. Although tremendously useful, M-score has a number of limitations. For the same MS/MS data, M-score may change if the protein data base is ex-panded. A low M-value may not necessarily mean poor match but rather poor MS/MS quality. In addition M-score does not fully utilize the advantage of combined use of complementary fragmentation techniques collisionally ac-tivated dissociation (CAD) and electron capture dissocia-tion (ECD). To address these issues, a new data base-independent scoringmethod (S-score) was designed that is based on the maximum length of the peptide sequence tag provided by the combinedCAD and ECDdata. The quality of MS/MS spectra assessed by S-score allows poor data (39 % of all MS/MS spectra) to be filtered out before the data base search, speeding up the data analysis and eliminating a major source of false positive identifications. Spectra with below threshold M-scores (poor matches) but high S-scores are validated. Spectra with zero M-score (no data base match) but high S-score are classified as belonging to modified sequences. As an extension of S-score, an ex-tremely reliable sequence tag was developed based on complementary fragments simultaneously appearing in CAD and ECD spectra. Comparison of this tag with the data base-derived sequence gives the most reliable peptide identification <b>validation</b> to <b>date.</b> The combined use of M-and S-scoring provides positive sequence identification from> 25 % of all MS/MS data, a 40 % improvement over traditional M-scoring performed on the same Fourier trans-form MS instrumentation.

FPA detected the highest number of positive cases (79. 3 %) followed by CFT (71. 4 %), RBT (70. 7 %), SAT (70. 6 %) and cELISA (68. 8 %). A combination of real-time PCR with one of the used serological tests identified brucellosis in more than 99 % of the infected animals. 59. 7 % of the examined samples were positive in all serological tests and real-time PCR. A subpopulation of 6. 8 % of animals was positive in all serological tests but negative in real-time PCR assays. The high percentage of positive cases in this study does not necessarily reflect the seroprevalence of the disease in the country but might be caused {{by the fact that the}} camels were imported from brucellosis infected herds of Sudan, accidentally. Seroprevalence of brucellosis in camels should be examined in confirmatory studies to evaluate the importance of brucellosis in this animal species. Conclusion We suggest combining bcsp 31 real-time PCR with either FPA, CFT, RBT or SAT to screen camels for brucellosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Detection and {{quantification}} {{of hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) RNA {{is integral to}} diagnostic and therapeutic regimens. All molecular assays target the viral 5 '-noncoding region (5 '-NCR), and all show genotype-dependent variation of sensitivities and viral load results. Non-western HCV genotypes have been under-represented in evaluation studies. An alternative diagnostic target region within the HCV genome could facilitate {{a new generation of}} assays. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study we determined by de novo sequencing that the 3 '-X-tail element, characterized significantly later {{than the rest of the}} genome, is highly conserved across genotypes. To prove its clinical utility as a molecular diagnostic target, a prototype qualitative and quantitative test was developed and evaluated multicentrically on a large and complete panel of 725 clinical plasma samples, covering HCV genotypes 1 - 6, from four continents (Germany, UK, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore). To our knowledge, this is the most diversified and comprehensive panel of clinical and genotype specimens used in HCV nucleic acid testing (NAT) <b>validation</b> to <b>date.</b> The lower limit of detection (LOD) was 18. 4 IU/ml (95 % confidence interval, 15. 3 - 24. 1 IU/ml), suggesting applicability in donor blood screening. The upper LOD exceeded 10 (- 9) IU/ml, facilitating viral load monitoring within a wide dynamic range. In 598 genotyped samples, quantified by Bayer VERSANT 3. 0 branched DNA (bDNA), X-tail-based viral loads were highly concordant with bDNA for all genotypes. Correlation coefficients between bDNA and X-tail NAT, for genotypes 1 - 6, were: 0. 92, 0. 85, 0. 95, 0. 91, 0. 95, and 0. 96, respectively; X-tail-based viral loads deviated by more than 0. 5 log 10 from 5 '-NCR-based viral loads in only 12 % of samples (maximum deviation, 0. 85 log 10). The successful introduction of X-tail NAT in a Brazilian laboratory confirmed the practical stability and robustness of the X-tail-based protocol. The assay was implemented at low reaction costs (US$ 8. 70 per sample), short turnover times (2. 5 h for up to 96 samples), and without technical difficulties. CONCLUSION: This study indicates a way to fundamentally improve HCV viral load monitoring and infection screening. Our prototype assay can serve as a template for a new generation of viral load assays. Additionally, to our knowledge this study provides the first open protocol to permit industry-grade HCV detection and quantification in resource-limited settings...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Three {{previous}} studies have investigated the use of chronological split to compare cross- to single-company effort predictions, where all used the ISBSG dataset release 10. Therefore {{there is a need}} for these studies to be replicated using different datasets such that the patterns previously observed can be compared and contrasted, and a better understanding with regard to the use of chronological splitting can be reached. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to replicate [17] using the same chronological splitting; however a different database – the Finnish dataset. METHOD: Chronological splitting was compared with two forms of cross-validation. The chronological splitting used was the project-by-project chronological split, in which a validation set contains a single project, and a regression model is built from scratch using as training set the set of projects completed before the <b>validation</b> project’s start <b>date.</b> We used 201 single-company projects and 593 cross-company projects from the Finnish dataset. RESULTS: Single-company models presented significantly better prediction than cross-company models. Chronological splitting provided significantly worse accuracy than leave-one and leave-two out cross-validations when based on single-company data; and provided similar accuracy when based on cross-company data. CONCLUSIONS: Results did not seem promising when using project-by-project splitting; however in a real scenario companies that use their own data can only apply some sort of chronological splitting when obtaining effort estimates for their new projects. Therefore we urge the use of chronological splitting in effort estimation studies such that more realistic results can be provided to inform industry...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{forest tree}} species mapping has benefitted from {{advances}} in remote sensing techniques. In this study, we explored {{the potential of}} the newly developed high resolution satellite sensor, WorldView- 2 (WV 2) imagery for identifying and mapping urban tree species/groups in the City of Tampa, FL, USA by comparing capabilities between high resolution IKONOS (IKO, acquired on April 6, 2006) and WV 2 (acquired on May 1, 2011) imagery for identifying the urban tree species. Seven urban tree species/groups were mapped, including: sand live oak (Quercus geminata), laurel oak (Q. laurifolia), live oak (Q. virginiana), pine (species group), palm (species group), camphor (Cinnamomum camphora), and magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Image-objects (IOs) were used as the tree species mapping unit. A stepwise masking protocol was developed to separate sunlit and shadow/shaded tree canopy IOs from the study area prior to tree species mapping. Comparative analyses examined average accuracies of tree species mapping results between four-band IKO imagery and three different band combinations of WV 2 imagery: four “traditional” bands, four additional bands, and all eight bands. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Classification and Regression Trees were used to classify IOs using selected IO features derived from IKO and band combinations of WV 2 imagery. With the exception of sand live oak mapping result (due to phenological difference due to image collection <b>dates),</b> <b>validation</b> results indicate significantly improved mapping accuracies using all combinations of WV 2 imagery (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Results using independent validation samples demonstrated that average accuracy was increased by 16 – 18...|$|R
40|$|Exchange {{rate policy}} in many {{emerging}} markets shifts between a stronger and weaker commitment to peg. This observation raises the following questions, which we address in our paper: Does intervention policy exhibit switching? And if so, what causes policy to shift? The theoretical literature increasingly {{points to the}} critical importance of financial fundamentals (Chinn, M. D., Kletzer, K. M., 2001. Imperfect information, domestic regulation and financial crises. In: Glick, R., Moreno, R., Spiegel, M. (Eds.), Financial Crises in Emerging Markets. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 196 - 237; Dooley, 2000; Chang, R., Velasco, A., 2005. Monetary policy and the currency denomination of debt: {{a tale of two}} equilibria. Kennedy School of Government Working Paper Series, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; among others). Direct empirical <b>validation</b> to <b>date</b> is limited, however, although relevant intuitions come from duration and indicators literature (Kaminsky, G. L., Reinhart, C. M., Vegh, C. A., 2004. When it rains, it pours: procyclical capital flows and macroeconomic policies. NBER Macroeconomics Annual, National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.; Domac, I., Peria, M. S., 2003. Banking crises and exchange rate regimes: is there a link? Journal of International Economics 61, 41 - 72; Tudela, M., 2004. Explaining currency crises: a duration model approach. Journal of International Money and Finance 23, 799 - 816). We use a panel of quarterly data starting 1985 through 2004 for 14 countries, mainly from Latin America and East Asia, and adopt a novel two-step empirical strategy. First, we apply regime switching methods to two simple indices of central bank exchange rate policy. This generates likelihoods of high and low intervention. In the second step, we establish the variables that determine these probabilities. We find strong evidence that the economy's balance sheet and economic performance determine the likelihood of switching in the exchange rate regime. Specifically, an increase in reserve currency debt relative to assets raises potential capital losses from devaluation and reduces the probability of switching to a low intervention regime, as does a decline in growth. The purpose here is not to present an alternative regime classification (Levy-Yeyati, E., Sturzenegger, S., 2005. Classifying exchange rate regimes: deeds vs. words. European Economic Review 49, 1603 - 1635; Reinhart, C. M., Rogoff, K., 2004. The modern history of exchange rate arrangements: a reinterpretation. Quarterly Journal of Economics, Available at: [URL] but to establish the relative importance of different constraints on the central bank, which has policy implications. The empirical approach and specification is flexible to whether intervention is discrete or gradual and {{to whether or not the}} central bank sterilizes.
