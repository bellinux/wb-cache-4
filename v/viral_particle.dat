5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA genome and a protein capsid. The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat that encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> {{can be used}} as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. This region of the viral genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus infects {{human cells}} by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155, (also {{known as the}} {{poliovirus}} receptor (PVR)) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> necessary for viral entry. Attached to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via {{the formation of a}} pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then “injected” into the host cell cytoplasm, or that the virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{label-free}} imaging, detection, and mass/size measurement of single <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> in solution by high-resolution surface plasmon resonance microscopy. Diffraction of propagating plasmon waves along a metal surface by the <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> creates {{images of the}} individual particles, which allow us to detect the binding of the <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> to surfaces functionalized with and without antibodies. We show that {{the intensity of the}} particle image is related to the mass of the particle, from which we determine the mass and mass distribution of influenza <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> with a mass detection limit of approximately 1  ag (or 0. 2  fg/mm 2). This work demonstrates a multiplexed method to measure the masses of individual <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> and to study the binding activity of the <b>viral</b> <b>particles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Five {{cases of}} epidermodysplasia verruciformis were studied for <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> and antigens. In all benign lesions tested, <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> and antigens were {{observed}} by electron microscopy of ultrathin sections and/or tissue extracts and by fluorescent antibody staining with an antiserum against human wart virus. Both <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> and antigens {{were observed in}} {{the cells of the}} stratum corneum and not in those of deeper layers. <b>Viral</b> <b>particles</b> and antigens were observed in nuclei. <b>Viral</b> <b>particles</b> resembled morphologically the virus of common human warts. In two, one on the forehead and the other on the inner aspect of the upper thigh, of six lesions showing the histology of early malignancy, <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> were observed by electron microscopy of ultrathin sections and/or tissue extracts. Four advanced malignant lesions, two primary ulcerated squamous cell carcinomas and two recurrent carcinomas, were similarly studied. In none of them, were <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> or antigens detected. These results suggest that (1) the virus of epidermodysplasia verruciformis is related with that of common human warts both morphologically and antigenically, (2) {{at least some of the}} virus-induced lesions of epidermodysplasia verruciformis become malignant, and (3) when the lesions are completely replaced with malignant cells, neither <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> nor antigens are recognizable in them...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has emerged}} that RNA viruses utilize the host {{secretory}} pathway for processing and trafficking mature <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> and for exiting the infected cells. Upon completing the complex assembly process, the <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> {{take advantage of}} the cellular secretory trafficking machinery for their intracellular trafficking toward the Golgi organelle and budding or export of virions. In this study, we showed that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) -induced extracellular GRP 78 contains no KDEL motif using an anti-KDEL-specific antibody. Overexpression of the KDEL-truncated GRP 78 in the GPR 78 knocked down cells significantly reduced JEV infectivity, suggesting that the KDEL motif is required for GRP 78 function in the release of JE <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> In addition, we demonstrated the KDELR protein, an ER-Golgi retrieval system component, is associated with viral envelope proteins and is engaged in the subcellular localization of <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> in Golgi. More importantly, accumulation of intracellular virions was observed in the KDELR knocked down cells, indicating that the KDELR protein mediated the intracellular trafficking of JE <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> Altogether, we demonstrated that intracellular trafficking of JE assembled <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> was mediated by the host ER-Golgi retrieval system prior to exit by the secretory pathway...|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional <b>viral</b> <b>particle.</b> The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E
25|$|The {{glycoprotein}} {{shell of}} the mature DENV virion consists of 180 copies each of the E protein and M protein. The immature virion starts out with the E and prM proteins forming 90 heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the <b>viral</b> <b>particle.</b> This immature <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. As the virion passes through the trans-Golgi Network (TGN) it is exposed to low pH. This acidic environment causes a conformational change in the E protein which disassociates it from the prM protein and causes it to form E homodimers. These homodimers lie flat against the viral surface giving the maturing virion a smooth appearance. During this maturation pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease, furin. The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the E-protein {{shell of the}} mature virion. The pr peptide stays associated with the E protein until the <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> is released into the extracellular environment. This pr peptide acts like a cap, covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> has exited the cell.|$|E

40|$|African {{green monkey}} kidney cells {{infected}} by simian virus 40 were analyzed {{for the presence}} of the major capsid protein (capsid protein I) by immunological and radiolabeling techniques. Antisera with different specificities were prepared by immunization with intact or denatured <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> Antisera prepared against intact virus reacted by complement fixation with <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> and with an 8 S subunit containing the capsid protein I. Antisera prepared against denatured <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> reacted with unassembled capsid protein(s) as well as with <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> These antisera were used to detect 8 S viral subunits or unassembled viral capsid protein in soluble extracts of infected cells after centrifugation at 100, 000 × g to remove <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> The soluble antigen pool was found to be small during infection with wild-type virus or a temperature-sensitive mutant deficient in the synthesis of <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> Pulse-chase experiments, performed at a high multiplicity of infection, also indicated a small pool of nonparticle capsid protein I. Radioactive lysine was incorporated into capsid protein I of virus particles during a 2 -hr pulse. A subsequent chase with excess unlabeled lysine resulted in only a slight increase in the radio-activity found in capsid protein I of <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> Furthermore, in the same experiments, capsid protein I was incorporated preferentially into empty shells during the pulse with a shift in radioactivity to intact virions during the chase period, indicating a possible precursor relationship between the two types of virus particles...|$|R

40|$|Most {{antiviral}} vaccines {{are based}} on <b>viral</b> <b>particles,</b> which are efficient inducers of B cell responses. In addition {{to their ability to}} replicate, several features associated with the structure and content of the <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> are responsible for this high immunogenicity. First, <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> usually have dimensions between 20 and 200 nm, a size optimal for drainage to lymph nodes and direct interaction with B cells. Second, the surface of most <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> is highly repetitive, causing efficient cross-linking of B cell receptors, an early and key step of B cell activation. In addition, such repetitive structures bind natural antibodies and fix complement, further enhancing B cell activation as well as transport to and deposition on follicular dendritic cells. Third, <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> carry ligands for toll-like receptor 7 / 8 or 9 which activate B cells directly for isotype switching as well as dendritic cells for T cell priming. In this review, we will highlight recent insights in these mechanisms and discuss their impact on antiviral antibody responses. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the type}} and degree of {{dehydration}} the <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> is around 27–30nm in diameter. The viral genome is around 2500nm in length so we can therefore conclude {{that it must be}} tightly packaged within the capsid along with substances such as sodium ions in order to cancel out the negative charges on the RNA caused by the phosphate groups.|$|E
25|$|Alice Huang's {{research}} {{focused on}} defective interfering particles (DIPs) {{which can be}} utilized to combat viruses. DIPs are composed of viral structural proteins and sets of DNA or RNA which are incomplete. These DIPs will interfere in replication of the virus because they are reproduced {{at the expense of}} a standard <b>viral</b> <b>particle.</b> Alice Huang's work on DIPs has been utilized to combat cancer, HIV, and plant related diseases.|$|E
25|$|Further {{experimentation}} {{has demonstrated}} that sulfatide enriched cells, in which sulfatide binds to hemagglutinin, enhances IAV replication by increasing the progeny virus particle formation; this is done through the promotion of nuclear export of IAV formed viral ribonucleoproteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Experimentation has also demonstrated that if binding is inhibited between sulfatide and hemagglutinin that <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> formation and replication would be inhibited, again suggesting that the binding between sulfatide and hemagglutinin facilitates IAV replication.|$|E

25|$|The early {{proteins}} transcribed {{are used}} in the regulation of genetic replication of the virus. On entering the cell, an α-TIF protein joins the <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> and aids in immediate-early transcription. The virion host shutoff protein (VHS or UL41) is very important to viral replication. This enzyme shuts off protein synthesis in the host, degrades host mRNA, helps in viral replication, and regulates gene expression of viral proteins. The viral genome immediately travels to the nucleus but the VHS protein remains in the cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|Viruses {{lacking a}} viral {{envelope}} often have complex mechanisms {{for entry into}} the host cell. MPyV capsid protein VP1 binds to sialic acids of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b on the cell surface. The functions of VP2 and VP3 are less well understood, but at least VP2 {{has been reported to}} be exposed upon endocytosis of the <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> and may be involved in releasing the virus from the endoplasmic reticulum. MPyV has been reported to enter cells through both a caveolae-dependent endocytosis mechanism and by an independent mechanism through uncoated vesicles.|$|E
25|$|Picornaviruses are classed under Baltimore's viral {{classification}} system as group IV viruses as they contain a single stranded, positive sense RNA genome. Their genome ranges between 7.1 and 8.9 kb (kilobases) in length.

40|$|During {{the life}} cycle of the {{transmissible}} gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), two types of virus-related particles are detected in infected swine testis cells: large annular viruses and small dense viruses. We have studied the relationships between these two types of particles. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that they are closely related, since both large and small particles reacted equally with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for TGEV proteins. Monensin, a drug that selectively affects the Golgi complex, caused an accumulation of large annular <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> in perinuclear elements of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. A partial reversion of the monensin blockade was obtained in both the absence and presence of cycloheximide, a drug that prevented the formation of new <b>viral</b> <b>particles.</b> After removal of monensin, the Golgi complex recovered its perinuclear location, and a {{decrease in the number of}} perinuclear large <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> was observed. The release of small dense <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> into secretory vesicles and the extracellular medium was also observed, as was a partial recovery of infectivity in culture supernatants. Small <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> started to be seen between the third and the fourth Golgi cisternae of normally infected cells. All of these data strongly indicate that the large annular particles are the immature precursors of the small dense viruses, which are the infectious TGEV virions. The immature <b>viral</b> <b>particles</b> need to reach a particular location at the trans side of the Golgi stack to complete their morphological maturation...|$|R
25|$|Unlike many {{viruses that}} enter the cell through endocytosis, polyomaviruses {{penetrate}} the cell membrane {{and enter the}} cytosol from the late endoplasmic reticulum rather than from endosomes, although conformational changes in response to low pH in endolysosomes have been hypothesized as critical steps in the process. MPyV membrane exit is believed {{to depend on the}} presence of specific host proteins located in the late ER; for example, the host protein ERp29, a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, has been shown to disrupt the conformation of VP1. It is not known whether entry into the cytosol is obligatory for MPyV infection or whether the particle could enter the cell nucleus directly from the ER. Even a single <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> entering the nucleus can be sufficient for infection.|$|E
500|$|The word is {{from the}} Latin neuter vīrus {{referring}} to poison and other noxious liquids, from 'the same Indo-European base as Sanskrit viṣa poison, Avestan vīša poison, ancient Greek ἰός poison', first attested in English in 1398 in John Trevisa's translation of Bartholomeus Anglicus's De Proprietatibus Rerum.

A meaning of [...] "agent that causes infectious disease" [...] is first recorded in 1728, before the discovery of viruses by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. The English plural is viruses (sometimes also viri or vira), whereas the Latin word is a mass noun, which has no classically attested plural (however in Neo-Latin vīra is used). The adjective viral dates to 1948.

2500|$|The DENV E (envelope) protein, {{found as}} a dimer {{on the surface}} of the mature <b>viral</b> <b>particle,</b> is {{important}} in the initial attachment of this particle to the host cell. Each E protein monomer comprises three ectodomains, ED1 to ED3, and a trans-membrane segment. ED2 includes the dimerization interface, two glycosylation sites, and the peptide of fusion with the cellular membrane. ED3 is a continuous polypeptide segment; its fold is compact and immunoglobulin-like. Dengue virus is transmitted by a mosquito known as Aedes. Several molecules which interact with the viral E protein (ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin, CD209, Rab 5, GRP 78, and the mannose receptor [...] ) have been shown to be important factors mediating attachment and viral entry. The membrane form of Ribosomal protein SA may also be involved in the attachment. Recombinant domains of the E protein are used as well-defined antigens in the serological detection of antibodies directed against dengue virus and as immunogens in vaccine candidates.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>viral</b> <b>particle</b> binds to cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are {{characterized}} for each serotype of picornaviruses. For example, poliovirus receptor is glycoprotein CD155 which is special receptor for human {{and some other}} primate species. For this reason, poliovirus couldn’t be made in many laboratories until transgenic mice having a CD155 receptor on their cell surface were developed in the 1990s. These animals can be infected and used for studies of replication and pathogenesis. Binding causes a conformational change in the viral capsid proteins, and myristic acid are released. These acids form a pore in the cell membrane through which RNA is injected [...] Once inside the cell, the RNA un-coats and the (+) strand RNA genome is replicated through a double-stranded RNA intermediate that is formed using viral RDRP (RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase). Translation by host cell ribosomes is not initiated by a 5' G cap as usual, but rather is initiated by an IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site). The viral lifecycle is very rapid with {{the whole process of}} replication being completed on average within 8 hours. However, as little as 30 minutes after initial infection, cell protein synthesis declines to almost zero output – essentially the macromolecular synthesis of cell proteins is shut off. Over the next 1–2 hours there is a loss of margination of chromatin and [...] in the nucleus, before the viral proteins start to be synthesized and a vacuole appears in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus that gradually starts to spread as the time after infection reaches around 3 hours. After this time the cell plasma membrane becomes permeable, at 4–6 hours the virus particles assemble, and can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm.
