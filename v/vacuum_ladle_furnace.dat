However, due to energy costs rise, national steel industries are investing in electrical power generation in partnership with energy supply companies aiming at overall cost reduction. Therefore, actions that search for energy consumption reduction and productivity increase became priority for their research and development projects. The <b>ladle</b> <b>furnace</b> of V&M {{is one of the}} largest energy consuming units in the steel plant, consuming up to 2, 400 MWh on average a month.

40|$|A {{promising}} type {{of steel}} slag for applications is the <b>ladle</b> <b>furnace</b> (LF) slag, {{which is also}} known as the basic slag, the reducing slag, the white slag, and the secondary refining slag. The LF slag is a byproduct from further refining molten steel after coming out of a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) or an electric arc furnace (EAF). The use of the LF slag in further applications requires knowledge of its characteristics. The LF slag characterization in this paper has been performed using the following analytical methods: chemical analysis by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area properties by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, surface chemistry by infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy, and morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the main compounds are calcium, silicon, magnesium, and aluminium oxides, and calcium silicates under their various allotropic forms are the major compounds in the LF slag. Surface area properties have shown that the LF slag is a mesoporous material with relatively great BET surface area.

Refining processes that applied for low alloy and alloyed steel production include degassing via <b>vacuum</b> or <b>ladle</b> and <b>ladle</b> <b>furnace</b> units. This technique could help in producing homogeneous steel with low gas content and minimum internal defects. In certain grades of steel for tools and penetration and impact resistance uses, non-metallic inclusions (NMI) and sulphur content are the key factors for the steel performance and applications. ESR, Electro-salg refining (or remelting), is the technique that can efficiently produce clean steel with minimum content of NMI and sulphur due to the special nature and mechanism of this technique.
