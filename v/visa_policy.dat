25|$|Some {{countries}} {{apply the}} principle of reciprocity in their <b>visa</b> <b>policy.</b> A country's <b>visa</b> <b>policy</b> is called 'reciprocal' if it imposes visa requirement against citizens of all the countries which impose visa requirements against its own citizens. The opposite is rarely true: a country rarely lifts visa requirements against citizens of all the countries which also lift visa requirements against its own citizens, unless a prior bilateral agreement has been made.|$|E

40|$|<b>Visa</b> <b>policies</b> {{today are}} a central {{instrument}} for filtering wanted and unwanted types of travellers, {{leading to a}} hierarchy of mobility rights. While {{there is evidence of}} a “global mobility divide”, we still know little about the role of regional integration {{when it comes to the}} distribution of mobility rights and the (re) structuring of mobility spaces. Against this background, the paper examines the structure of visa relations in different bodies of regional integration (EU, MERCOSUR, ASEAN, ECOWAS, EAC, NAFTA, SADC and SICA). In this article, we compare <b>visa</b> <b>policies</b> in the member states of these institutions in 1969 and 2010 from a social network perspective. While one would generally expect each institution’s member states to become more similar with regard to both internal and external mobility regulations, we find that not all regional clusters align their <b>visa</b> <b>policies.</b> Potential explanations for this state of affairs are investigated...|$|R

40|$|While <b>visa</b> <b>policies</b> are {{the major}} {{instrument}} for regulating and controlling the global flow of people, {{little is known about}} how they have changed over time. Accordingly, scholars have expressed the need for large-N datasets which cover more than one point in time. This article takes up this challenge and presents a {{for the first time a}} global overview of the changes in <b>visa</b> waiver <b>policies</b> based on a newly created database containing the <b>visa</b> waiver <b>policies</b> of over 150 countries for 1969 and 2010. We find that, on average, visa-free mobility has in-creased over the past 40 years. However, not everybody has benefited from these develop-ments. In fact, visa waivers are increasingly unequally divided: While citizens of OECD countries and rich countries have gained mobility rights, mobility rights for other regions have stagnated or even diminished, in particular for citizens from African countries. Overall, we find a clear bifurcation in mobility rights, leading to a ‘global mobility divide’...|$|R
25|$|The Schengen Area {{consists}} of 22 European Union member states and four non-members {{who are members}} of EFTA: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are not yet part of the Schengen Area but, nonetheless, have a <b>visa</b> <b>policy</b> that is based on the Schengen acquis.|$|E
25|$|Even though Turkey is a {{candidate}} country for the membership in the European Union, it has a more complex <b>visa</b> <b>policy</b> than the <b>Visa</b> <b>policy</b> of the Schengen Area. Turkey requires visas from citizens of certain EU member states and Schengen Annex II countries and territories – Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Dominica, East Timor, Grenada, Ireland, Kiribati, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Norway, Netherlands, Palau, Poland, Portugal, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Spain, Taiwan, Tonga, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vanuatu. On the other hand, Turkey grants visa-free access to citizens of countries and territories – Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belize, Bolivia, Ecuador, Iran, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan, Lebanon, Mongolia, Morocco, Qatar, Russia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 the Agreement was {{supplemented}} by the Schengen Convention, which proposed {{the abolition of}} internal border controls and a common <b>visa</b> <b>policy.</b> The Agreements and the rules adopted under them were entirely separate from the EC structures, {{and led to the}} creation of the Schengen Area on 26 March 1995.|$|E

The two countries also established two Joint Task Forces— one to combat terrorists, another to combat terror financing.

5000|$|Globalization is {{associated}} with a dramatic rise in international education. More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many international students now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country. [...] The contributions that foreign students make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to immigration and <b>visa</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures.|$|R
25|$|In 1990, the Agreement was {{supplemented}} by the Schengen Convention which proposed {{the abolition of}} internal border controls and a common <b>visa</b> <b>policy.</b> It was this Convention that created the Schengen Area through the complete abolition of border controls between Schengen member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial cooperation.|$|E
25|$|Japan has {{a special}} <b>visa</b> <b>policy</b> for {{nationals}} of Azerbaijan (until 1 December 2017), Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.

5000|$|The People's Republic of China (PRC) authorizes its Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau {{to issue}} {{passports}} to their permanent residents with Chinese nationality under the [...] "one country, two systems" [...] arrangement. <b>Visa</b> <b>policies</b> imposed by foreign authorities on Hong Kong and Macau permanent residents holding such passports {{are different from}} those holding ordinary passports of the People's Republic of China. A Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport (HKSAR passport) permits visa-free access to many more countries than ordinary PRC passports.|$|R
25|$|Ecuador {{has one of}} {{the most}} lenient <b>visa</b> <b>policies</b> in the world as most {{visitors}} are not obliged to obtain a visa for stays up to 90 days, except citizens of Peru and Venezuela who are allowed a maximum stay of 180 days, and citizens of China who are allowed to stay for 90 days per calendar year. All visitors must hold a passport valid for 6 months, except for citizens of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay. Citizens of those countries can also enter Ecuador with ID card only.|$|R
40|$|International {{migration}} {{is an old}} phenomenon caused by many factors divided into push and pull factors. However, there is no enough coverage on {{the perceptions of the}} labour migrants. Although there is a vast body of writing on migration, this study delves into the experiential perceptions of academic labour migrants at Rhodes University. These academic labour migrants include professors, lecturers, researchers and postdoctoral research fellows. The study took a qualitative approach to document the experiential perceptions of academic labour migrants at Rhodes University. In-depth interviews were conducted with twelve respondents, to analyse how academic labour migrants perceive South Africa’s changing <b>visa</b> <b>policies</b> in the context of regional integration and development, migration networks and choice, host-migrant relations. The study is underpinned by Probsting’s (2015) concept of "spatial fix" in the context of capitalism and migration, to locate the positionality of academic labour migrants within a capitalist society. The study established that the increase in skilled labour {{migration is}} relatively linked to the expansion of capitalism. Based on the perceptions of the respondents, the study concluded that migration is inherently vital in providing cheap labour for capitalists. It established that changing <b>visa</b> <b>policies</b> is not without problems. Historical dispositions of the apartheid system, conflicting domestic versus international imperatives, neo-liberal policies and the widely condemned results of capitalism as an imperialist system and other factors influence migration management in South Africa...|$|R
