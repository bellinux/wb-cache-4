5|$|Basset {{probably}} died in 1127, and {{was certainly}} dead in 1130. He {{is said to}} have taken ill at Northampton, and to have been clothed in a monk's habit while on his deathbed. He was buried in the chapterhouse at Abingdon Abbey, which he left a bequest to. A copy of a charter from Archbishop Theobald of Bec, recorded in a cartulary, records most of Basset's manors. While most of the estates seem to have been held by Basset as a sub-tenant, four of the estates appear to have been held as a tenant-in-chief. These estates were not <b>very</b> <b>valuable,</b> and Basset can not be considered a baron, although his son Richard managed through marriage to {{become a member of the}} barons. He held lands in nine counties, perhaps centred in Berkshire.|$|E
5|$|Historical eclipses are a <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> {{resource}} for historians, {{in that they}} allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from which other dates and ancient calendars may be deduced. A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text {{is important for the}} chronology of the ancient Near East. There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses. The Book of Joshua 10:13 could refer to an annular eclipse on 30 October 1207 BC. The King Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago. Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807 BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins as}} an {{initiate}} {{of a powerful}} sect of magicians, the Shapers. Members of the sect create living beings from the magical essence within themselves. Apprentices are sent to academies to learn the art of shaping and the player's character has been accepted to do so. The player departs on a voyage to the academy aboard a specially modified Drayk, a dragon-like Shaper Creation. During the journey, the Shaper passes a group of islands, {{one of which is}} recognized as the Barred Sucia Island. Locations Barred by the Shapers are closed to both the sect and outsiders alike, meaning a catastrophe has occurred or something <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> is located there. As the Shaper examines Sucia, lost in thought, the craft is attacked and mortally wounded by an unidentified sailing ship. After igniting the vessel's sails with a fireball, the craft deposits the Shaper on an abandoned dockside before dying. The player is now stranded on Sucia Island and {{must find a way to}} leave.|$|E

50|$|In the sea many larger {{fish species}} prey on the Raitt’s sand eel {{including}} cod, haddock, whiting, saithe and mackerel. Many {{of these are}} <b>very</b> commercially <b>valuable</b> species and declines in sand eel have caused declines in their numbers {{due to lack of}} prey. Marine mammals also feed on Raitt’s sand eels but less regularly. Mostly species such as grey seals, harbour seals and harbour porpoise consume lots of sand eels in the Spring and early Summer.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that auxiliaries received the substantial cash bonuses (donativum) handed to legionaries on the accession of a new emperor and other occasions. Although irregular, these payments (each worth 75 denarii to a common legionary) averaged once every 7.5 years in the early 1st century and every three years later. Duncan-Jones has suggested that donativa may have been paid to auxiliaries also from the time of Hadrian onwards, {{on the grounds that the}} total amount of donative to the military increased sharply at that time. A <b>very</b> <b>valuable</b> benefit paid to legionaries was the discharge bonus (praemia) paid on completion of the full 25 years' service. At 3,000 denarii, this was equivalent to ten years' gross salary for a common legionary after the pay increase of 84AD. It would enable him to purchase a substantial plot of land. Again, there is no indication that auxiliaries were paid a discharge bonus. For auxiliaries, the discharge bonus was the grant of Roman citizenship, which carried important tax exemptions. However, Duncan-Jones argues that the fact that service in the auxilia was competitive with the legions (deduced from the many Roman citizens that joined the auxilia) that a discharge bonus may have been paid.|$|E

Joseph B. Dabney, owner of the Dabney Oil Syndicate, was a trustee of California Institute of Technology.
