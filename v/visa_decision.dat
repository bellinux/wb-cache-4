40|$|Before {{entering}} the United States for permanent or temporary residence, most noncitizens must complete {{a series of}} administrative procedures and background checks. The final {{step in the process}} is an interview with a consular officer in the noncitizen’s home country. That step, in most cases, determines whether a spouse can permanently rejoin her U. S. -citizen husband or wife in the United States or whether another immediate family member can permanently reside in the same home as her U. S. -citizen family member. After a consular officer decides to admit or deny entry to a noncitizen family member, there are limited opportunities for administrative or judicial review of the consular officer’s decision. For decades, federal courts have adhered to the doctrine of consular nonreviewability to limit judicial review of a consular officer’s <b>visa</b> <b>decision.</b> This doctrine, rooted in the legislative and the executive branches’ plenary power over immigration matters, first emerged in Kleindienst v. Mandel. Since then, federal courts have interpreted the doctrine—in some instances limiting the doctrine’s reach, and in others, allowing for more judicial review. In 2014, the U. S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in Din v. Kerry, a U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision, which held that a visa denial impinges on a U. S. citizen’s constitutionally protected interest in her marriage to a noncitizen spouse. Without the opportunity for either an administrative appeal or judicial review of a visa denial, a single consular officer can force a U. S. citizen, like Mrs. Din, to live apart from her closest family member or to relinquish a stable life and employment in the United States to move abroad with her noncitizen family member. This Comment argues that the visa denial of a U. S. citizen’s family member implicates that citizen’s fundamental Fifth Amendment due process rights—therefore allowing judicial review of the denial—because the Supreme Court has long recognized the liberty interests involved in marriage and in living with one’s immediate and extended family...|$|E

The combined nature of mental health and legal support are an increasing feature of a co-ordinated and much needed integrated response to assist vulnerable asylum seekers living in the community.

40|$|Thesis (MPA (School of Public Management and Planning)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is on the analysis of Namibian land reform policy. The primary objective is to identify the prevailing values behind the land reform, formulate precise objectives that reflect the inherent values, and analyse the existing options with a view to identifying the delivery mechanism(s) most appropriate to meeting the land reform objectives and to delivering the desired outcomes in a sustainable way. Namibia inherited skewed land ownership. The land reform debate focuses mainly on the redistribution of commercial farms, which are mostly owned by whites, and the tenure reform in the communal areas. The Namibian land reform rests on a tripartite scheme: Resettlement, Affirmative Action Loan Scheme (AALS) and the Development of Communal Areas (DCA). These approaches are governed by a number of policies and laws. Land reform is a very complex and emotion-laden phenomenon with multiple dimensions, which include moral, historical, social, economic, environmental and technical aspects. The land question in Namibia is a race question. While politicians argue publicly that land reform is important to boost the economy and reduce poverty, in reality the focus is on having more black Namibians own more of Namibia’s commercial farmland. This discrepancy between public pronouncements and actual motive may be responsible for the lack of clear objectives for the land reform policy. The analysis of Namibian land reform policy will require formulation of precise objectives. Because Namibia is the driest country south of the Sahara, sustainable management of land is imperative. Finding ways of achieving a politically acceptable racial balance of commercial land ownership and sustainable utilisation of redistributed land within an optimum time span is a challenge. The formulation of Namibian land reform policy was not preceded by any attempt at prior policy analysis. An ad hoc and crisis-management approach prevailed. A policy issue analysis approach has been used in this study. It is based primarily on a literature review augmented with questionnaires and interviews with selected key stakeholders. A stratified sampling technique was applied in the selection of the key stakeholders. The three groups identified were the policy-formulation and implementation group, the commercial farmers and the emerging farmers. <b>VISA,</b> a multi-criteria <b>decision</b> analysis package, was used to analyse and compare the three land reform approaches, while PolicyMaker software was used to analyse political actors and suggest strategies that can enhance the policy’s feasibility. The literature review and questionnaires revealed that the objectives of the land reform policy include correcting the skewed ownership of commercial farmland to reflect the demography of Namibia, alleviating poverty and achieving social and economic equity for all citizens. The programme should be sociologically, economically and environmentally sustainable. Combining all these objectives as criteria for evaluation, VISA demonstrates that the affirmative action loan scheme has the greatest potential for meeting the objectives followed by resettlement and development of communal areas respectively. Using the PolicyMaker software, stakeholders were categorised into supporters, opponents and non-mobilised; opportunities and obstacles were identified and strategies devised to harness opportunities and diffuse opposition. cmc 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{problem the}} research deals {{with is the}} unequal access to spaces, which I choose to explore through the visa device, the main instrument used by nation-states to control the access to their territories. The study of visas can give us interesting insights on borders, in a wider meaning than geographical national borders, which continue to represent a form of inequality imposed on people. Virtually nothing {{is known about the}} practices that migrants have to face to travel with proper documents toward the countries of Europe or United States, and all the consular bureaucracy which is deployed abroad passes largely unnoticed. The thesis is focused on the visa policy, exploring its implementation in Consulates. The locations appropriate for the operational case study are Schengen Consulates abroad, in countries subjected to the visa requirement, where these Consulates act as borders through the visa device, having the power to issue it or not, on the basis of an alleged “migratory risk” (the assessment of the intention of the person to leave the Schengen territory within the period of the <b>visa).</b> Here, <b>decisions</b> which lead to both mobility and immobility are made. Thanks to a fieldwork experience at the Italian Consulate in Senegal, I could investigate what goes on in Consulates, how law is implemented, practices developed by the administration, how recipients and officials behave at the counter, and similar activities. I will look at the implementation of visa policies at the micro level of Consulates in the attempt to unpack discourses and policies around migration, exploring selective filters and the construction of the category of (potential) “migrant” itself. In the First Chapter, I illustrate the concepts which frame my understanding, by reviewing the literature on the state control of movement through processes of categorisation and selection, the concept of border, the implementation process of public policies and the micro level of practices of discretion operated by Administrations. Subsequently, in Chapter Two, I will present the methodology of the work, describing methods I used to develop my research questions as well as difficulties faced in the fieldwork. The ethnographic approach I choose to study the Italian Embassy in Senegal includes the use of qualitative research techniques (direct observations, informal conversations, interviews), coupled with the collection and analysis of quantitative data. The rest of this dissertation is organised in two parts, where the first has a contextualisation function relating to the second. In the first I describe the institutional framework (both European and Italian) of migration administrations and policies, while in the second part I will dig into the detail of implementation of visa policies in Consulates, which I consider to be the actual “substance” of my present study. More specifically, in Chapter Three, I will trace the interrelated structure of Italian administrations in charge of migration management, in particular looking at the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, also including other (state or non-state) bureaucracies involved in the issue of migration (Municipalities, Post Office, Patronages). Chapter Four explores, on the one hand, the most recent regulations and tools of the Schengen visa policy, and on the other hand, Italian laws and the mechanisms for legal entry. In {{the second part of the}} thesis (Chapters Five to Seven) I will look at the micro level of policies, its implementation and the working practices developed at the Consular level in the country under consideration. It is that aspect of the institutions which is relevant to the people's experience, not the people themselves, that constitutes the object of inquiry. The aim of the study is not to account for the success or failures of the Schengen visa policy, but rather to achieve a better understanding of the institutional and routine bureaucratic mechanisms that lie behind it. I will show how the implementation of the visa device entails procedures which are both long and unclear, and are in operation both on the side of the Consulate and the applicant. This issue will be developed in three steps. First of all, I will outline the visa application process (Chapter Five), considering the access to information and the collection of required documents. Secondly, in Chapter Six, I will describe the visa examination phase, with particular attention to the very moment of the interview at the counter and the official's assessment, as well as the decision-making roles. Both these chapters based on fieldwork are focused on the direct experience of key actors interviewed (diplomats, officials, employees, démarcheurs, [...] ) and on my fieldwork's notes, in order to contribute to a concrete knowledge on Embassies and visas, making “visible” those practices usually hidden behind walls of bureaucracy. Then, in Chapter Seven, I will look at the family reunification procedure. I will investigate both phases, taking place in the country of origin (Senegal), and in the destination country (Italy – through the case study of the Prefecture of Pisa, Italy), in order to show the persistence of those practices of control on “the truthfulness of mobility” which may be present even in the case of a recognised right. To conclude, I will recapitulate my findings in the light of my initial research questions, connecting them back with some theoretical considerations, and I will draw some final conclusions...|$|R
40|$| removal in the {{foreseeable}} future. Accordingly, Mr Al Masri’s continued detention was held to be unlawful and Merkel J ordered his release from detention on 15 August. Two weeks later, the Minister secured permission for the entry of Mr Al Masri and other Palestinians to Gaza. Mr Al Masri was placed in detention pending his deportation {{and is no longer}} in the country. This case has the potential to affect the detention of all people waiting to be removed from Australia where there is no real likelihood of removal in {{the foreseeable}} future. Failed Iranian and Iraqi asylum seekers would fall into this category. In fact, just this week, Justice Mansfield ordered the release of a failed Iraqi asylum seeker - Mr Al Khafaji - on very similar grounds to Mr Al Masri. For this reason, the government has appealed the decision in Al Masri’s case - even though he is no longer in the country - and we are waiting for the decision of the Full Federal Court, which is expected to be handed down soon. (b) The Hazara Afghanis: The next series of unlawful detention cases that appeared in the Federal Court involved four Hazara Afghani asylum seekers whose applications were being processed around the time that the war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan started. Unfortunately, we do not know the names of any of these applicants, due to changes to the Migration Act in 2001 prohibiting the courts from disclosing the name of applicants for protection visas. 6 Codes are used instead - hence ‘VFAD’ v Minister. We will refer to these four applicants as the Hazara Afghanis for now. Each applicant was an Hazara Afghani male who had arrived in Australia in early 2001. Through documents obtained by the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre under the Freedom of Information Act, the applicants discovered what appeared to be decisions signed by Immigration Department officials dating back to August 2001. They were decisions that appeared to grant them protection <b>visas.</b> However, these <b>decisions</b> were never communicated to the applicants and the Minister said that they were draft decisions only. After these ‘decisions’ appeared to have been made, the Minister for Immigration announced that given the changing situation in Afghanistan, there would be a department wide ‘freeze’ on the processing of all Afghani asylum applications until the situation had stabilised. Afghani asylum seekers were notified of this policy decision in mid-January this year, leading to protests at Woomera. Once processing recommenced {{after the fall of the}} Taliban, each of the applicants was denied a protection visa based on the changed circumstances in Afghanistan. The ultimate question in these cases is whether the ‘decisions’ were final decisions to grant protection visas to the applicants. If so, the processing freeze would have had no legal effect on them and the applicants should have been released from detention when the decisions were made. In each case, it was found that the applicants had a strong case for saying that the decisions were final decisions, and that they had been granted protection visas. This question will not, however, be determined until a final hearing takes place. The issue in these cases, though, was whether the applicants should be kept in detention until the final hearing. If the applicants succeed in proving that the decision records did constitute the grant of a visa, they will have been unlawfully detained since the decision was made. In reaching its decision in each case, the Court had to balance the strict requirements of the Migration Act with the law’s presumption in favour of liberty. The judges in each of these cases came down on the side of liberty. As Justice Gray put it: The protection of individual liberty is of such fundamental importance to the Australian legal system that the mere fact that the applicant is in detention must be given considerable weight. All four men were released into the care of a local charity, and are required to report to the Department on a regular basis until their hearings, which are scheduled early next year. (c) The ‘NAMU’ family: In many of these cases, evidence is led by the applicants of the detrimental effects of prolonged detention. About one of the Hazara Afghani applicants, Gray J said: He said he has been in detention for so long that he is now exhausted and depressed He feels as if his soul is not healthy and he is no longer human [...] . He feels like a fish that has just been caught, in its last moment before death. In another recent Federal Court case, it was argued that the effect of detention on children justified their release from detention. Applicant NAMU’s case (another pseudonym) was brought by a husband and wife and their four children, three of whom were under 18 years old. They are Iraqi nationals who fled in 1995 and arrived in Australia in 1999. They have been in detention since that time - about three years. The family claimed that their detention, although originally lawful, had become unlawful due to the severe psychological disturbances suffered by their children as a result of their detention. It was claimed that by placing the children in a situation where they had become suicidal the detention had stopped being administrative in nature and had become punitive. According to the reasoning in Lim’s case, punitive detention is unlawful. Justice Hely disagreed with this view on the basis that it is the purpose of detention, not its impact on individuals, that is the relevant question. He said that the purpose of detention remained valid - as the family was still pursuing visa applications, they were being detained for the purpose of being granted a visa. They have appealed his decision and are waiting in detention for the outcome of the appeal. As mentioned earlier, there is no restriction on the amount of time a person may be detained while waiting for a visa. As the processing freeze in relation to the Hazara Afghanis shows, there seems to be no obligation on the Minister to process applications within a fixed time frame. This is further highlighted by the case of the East Timorese asylum seekers in Australia - who arrived here eight years ago (and are not detained) - and who are only now having their protection applications processed. While the Minister for Immigration recently suggested that the asylum seekers themselves are in some way to blame for the delay in processing, the delay was in fact due solely to the Department’s reluctance to process asylum applications alleging persecution on the part of Indonesia, with whom Australia had a delicate political and diplomatic relationship. Most of these 1600 people had strong refugee claims at the time they lodged their applications; most are now being refused protection due to the changed political landscape in East Timor. Despite the devastating impact that such treatment has had on these people, who have had to try to establish new lives in a state of limbo, they are the lucky ones compared to the Hazara Afghanis who have been detained in the middle of the desert for up to three years, while the government plays political games with their lives. This, more than anything, perhaps reveals the true purpose of detention - the punishment of people for coming here in an ‘unorderly fashion’. As one commentator has put it, it is not the asylum seekers but Australian government that is seeking to achieve a migration outcome. The UK approach to detention - Saadi’s case NAMU’s case forms a stark contrast to the UK approach, as highlighted in Saadi’s case, decided in 2001. Saadi’s case challenged the UK policy of mandatory detention of all asylum seekers whose claims were, amongst other things, likely to be straightforward - that is, unfounded. Under that policy, a ‘fast track’ procedure was instituted where people were detained for a maximum of ten days to speedily resolve their claims. Mr Saadi and three other Iraqi Kurds who were applying to the UK for asylum were detained in the Oakington centre for a period of ten days under the regime in 2000. They brought a challenge to their detention, claiming that they had been unlawfully detained. Collins J held that detention regime was lawful according to domestic law, because it was done in accordance with the requirements of the UK Immigration Act. But he held that their detention was in breach of Article 5 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which protects liberty and prohibits detention except in specified situations. The decision of Collins J was, however, overturned on appeal and the regime was held to be lawful. Importantly, though, the judges on appeal held that there was a requirement of proportionality between the detention and the purpose, which in this case was to process their applications speedily. In this case detaining someone for ten days was held to be proportionate. Whether the detention of people like the ‘NAMU’ family for a period of three years would be considered proportionate under the ECHR is another question! The differences in approach of the British courts in Saadi and the High Court of Australia in Lim can in large part be explained by the different status of the relevant international conventions in the UK and Australia. Like Australia, international law is not directly enforceable in the UK unless it has been incorporated into UK law. Importantly, the ECHR has been incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998, unlike the ICCPR which, as we have outlined, is not directly enforceable in Australia. For this reason Mr Saadi and the other Iraqis were able to rely on the provisions of the ECHR and were not confined to arguing about the legality of the regime under domestic law. Just this week, the UK parliament has been engaged in heated debate over amendments to its Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill (2002) which will extend the number of ‘accommodation’ - read, detention - centres used in the UK. It even proposed the use of remote facilities (perhaps the UK could rent a desert facility from Australia!) but this proposal seems to have been defeated. Under the new regime, asylum seekers in the UK will be allowed to leave accommodation centres after six months if their applications have not been processed. While this represents a significant hardening of the UK position on asylum seekers, it makes plain the glaring inadequacies in the Australian system, particularly the absence of safeguards against prolonged and indefinite detention. Conclusion The right not to be arbitrarily detained has its origins in the birth of liberalism. It is also a fundamental human right protected by international conventions. It is clear, however, that the Australian government remains blind to the demands of international human rights law, revealing the impotence of non-enforceable norms. What that means for human rights advocates in Australia - and for asylum seekers in detention - is that the battlefield is not the international arena, but the domestic legal system. Whilst Lim’s case upheld the power of the government to place unauthorised arrivals into administrative detention, it did set some limits on that power, and the recent Federal Court cases are examples of this. Despite significant legislative and policy changes, Lim’s case has not been seriously reconsidered by the High Court. The cases currently before the Federal...|$|R
