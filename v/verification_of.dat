5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer.

While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E
