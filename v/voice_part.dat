25|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, ecclesiastical music was {{dominated}} by monophonic plainchant. The separate development of British Christianity from the direct influence of Rome until the eighth century, with its flourishing monastic culture, {{led to the development}} of a distinct form of liturgical Celtic chant. Although no notations of this music survive, later sources suggest distinctive melodic patterns. This was superseded, as elsewhere in Europe, from the eleventh century by Gregorian chant. The version of this chant linked to the liturgy as used in the Diocese of Salisbury, the Sarum Use, first recorded from the thirteenth century, became dominant in England. This Sarum Chant became the model for English composers until it was supplanted at the Reformation in the mid-sixteenth century, influencing settings for masses, hymns and Magnificats. Singing techniques called gymel, a technique of temporarily dividing up one <b>voice</b> <b>part,</b> usually an upper one, into two parts of equal range, but singing different music, were introduced in England in the thirteenth century. Church music was often accompanied by instruments such as the guitar, harp, pipes and organ. The earliest evidence of two handed, polyphonic organ music is in the Robertsbridge Codex, from around 1325.|$|E

500|$|The text by Christoph Birkmann {{reflects}} {{life of the}} Christian as {{a voluntary}} journey [...] "carrying the cross" [...] as a follower of Jesus. The text refers indirectly to the prescribed gospel reading which tells that Jesus traveled by boat, which {{on the other hand}} refers to a navigational instrument called Kreuzstab, the Jacob's staff. The poet used the imagery to liken life to a sea voyage, finally reflecting a yearning for death to reach the ultimate destination. The yearning for death is re-enforced by the choice of a closing chorale, the stanza [...] "" [...] (Come, o death, you brother of sleep) from Johann Franck's 1653 hymn [...] "" [...] which also relates to the ship voyage imagery. Bach, who composed the cantata in his fourth year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, structured the cantata in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives for a bass soloist and closing with a four-part chorale, and chose a Baroque instrumental ensemble of three woodwind instruments (two oboes and taille) playing mostly with three string instruments (two violins and viola), and continuo, with an obbligato cello in the first recitative and an obbligato oboe in the second aria, resulting in different timbres for the four movements for the same <b>voice</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E

50|$|When {{signatures}} {{with multiple}} flats first came in, {{the order of}} the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right.
