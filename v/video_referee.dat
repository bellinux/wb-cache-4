5|$|Smith {{resigned}} as England coach following the Four Nations, with Steve McNamara announced as the team's new head coach. Tomkins kept {{his place in}} the England team when they played France in a mid-season friendly, and he responded by scoring four tries on England's way to a 60–6 win, a record-equalling tally for an England player in a single match. Tomkins appeared in all three of England's matches at the 2010 Four Nations, firstly in a defeat by New Zealand where a Kevin Brown try scored from a Tomkins kick was disallowed by the <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> due to Tomkins pushing Greg Eastwood in the process. Another comprehensive defeat by Australia ended England's hopes of reaching the final, in a match where Tomkins made his first international switch from the halves to fullback. He stayed in this position for England's final match against Papua New Guinea, a 36–10 victory in which Tony Clubb equalled Tomkins' four-try record.|$|E
25|$|The North Stars {{made the}} 1992 playoffs {{with their new}} look, and took a 3-2 series lead into Game 6 at the Met Center against the Norris Division {{champion}} Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings won, 1-0, in overtime after a <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> review confirmed that Sergei Fedorov had scored a goal. This was the first use of video replay in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Wings won the seventh game at home, 5-2.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Test, which we won 20-7, David Campese scored {{one of the}} dodgiest tries I've ever seen... they didn't have <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> that day - because Campo was at least three feet over the {{sideline}} when he plonked the ball down. He had gone hard for the corner but hadn't mustered enough pace to flank the fullback who cut him down with a low tackle. The referee was about 25 metres back up the paddock and the touch judge a good fifteen metres away. In the absence of certain knowledge they awarded the try. But it wasn't one.|$|E
50|$|Six referees {{from four}} {{countries}} controlled matches in the tournament. These four nations also provided touch judges while England and Australia provided the <b>video</b> <b>referees.</b>|$|R

25|$|After a sixth-minute penalty to the Dragons {{helped them}} up into good field position, Jamie Soward from the ten-metre line kicked {{the ball over}} into the Roosters' in-goal and Mark Gasnier, racing through from the right side, leapt to catch it on the full and put it down just inside the dead ball line. The <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> Bill Harrigan awarded the try and Soward's {{conversion}} was successful, so St. George Illawarra were leading 6-0 after eight minutes. However, video replays showed that in the lead up to the try, Dragons winger Brett Morris had passed the ball with a foot outside the touch-line so play {{should not have been}} allowed to continue. Later, in the sixteenth minute, the Roosters had made their way up into better field position when Todd Carney, twenty metres from the opposition try-line's right side, kicked high to the left corner. His winger Joseph Leilua caught the ball, crashed over the try-line, and while attempting to put it down had it knocked from his outstretched hand by Jamie Soward's knee, but Roosters captain Braith Anasta was there to ground it. The <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> was again called upon to award the try, and with Carney's kick going wide the score was 6-4 in favour of the Red & Whites. Less than two minutes after the restart of play St. George Illawarra knocked on in their own half and the Tricolours, after getting within fifteen metres of the try-line, moved the ball through the hands from {{the left side of the}} field to the right where Mitchell Aubusson crashed over near the corner. Carney again missed the conversion but his side was now in the lead 8-6 with a quarter of the match gone. In the twenty-sixth minute the Dragons were awarded a penalty in a goal-kicking position but Soward missed. At the thirty-minute mark St. George Illawarra prop Michael Weyman was helped off the field after getting a swinging arm to the head from Daniel Conn which was placed on report. The third quarter of the match was played in both ends of the ground with neither side able to turn their opportunities into points, so the teams left the field with the Sydney Roosters leading 6-8.|$|E
25|$|At 19:00 AEST, Tim Mander, officiating his 2nd grand final, blew time {{on and the}} Tigers kicked off. In {{the eighth}} minute the Cowboys had almost reached the Tigers' twenty-metre line on the third tackle of the set when Payne ran from dummy-half and passed inside for Rauhihi {{to hit the ball}} up and stand in the takle, {{offloading}} to Thurston who passed to Matt Bowen. Bowen then threw a deft pass back on the inside to Justin Smith who charged toward the line and threw the ball blindly back over his head before being tackled. The loose ball was picked up by Thurtson and handed to Bowen to dash the remaining few metres to the line and touch down behind the uprights. For the third week in a row, Bowen was the first try scorer of the game. Josh Hannay converted the try so the Cowboys were leading 0-6. Ten minutes later the Tigers were down at the opposition's end of the field where halfback Scott Prince on the last tackle put up a kick that came down over the try line and was taken by Paul Bowman who was about to be tackled in goal and threw a speculative pass which was not caught by his teammate and Tigers forward Bryce Gibbs was there to fall onto the loose ball near the goal posts. Brett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the scores were even at 6-6. Cowboys winger Ty Williams crossed the Tigers' try-line in the twenty-third minute but the <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> ruled no try due to an obstruction in back play. A few minutes later, Tigers' left winger Pat Richards (whose fractured ankle required six pain-killing injections for him to defy medical opinion and play in the match) crossed in the corner but the <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> disallowed the try as the ball was not properly grounded. In the thirty-fifth minute the Tigers received a Johnathan Thurston kick on their own try line, the ball going to Benji Marshall who ran with it, splitting the defence and charging down the left side and over the half-way line. Drawing a defender, Marshall then threw a flick pass behind his back to his winger Pat Richards coming through in support. Richards palmed off a Cowboys defender as he ran the remaining twenty metres to dive over and score, finishing {{one of the most famous}} grand final plays in history. Hodgson kicked the extra two points so now the Tigers were leading 12-6. Shortly before half time the Cowboys were penalised on their twenty-metre line and Hodgson took the kick at goal but missed.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{minutes into}} the second half, a high tackle by Justin Hodges on Cameron Smith close to the Broncos' line {{resulted}} in a minor scuffle and a penalty to the Storm. Melbourne captain Smith {{decided to take the}} tap and attack Brisbane's line and a close-range try to Matt King resulted. The scores were then level at 8-all, with the kick to come. Smith, also the Storm's first-choice goal-kicker, was having a problem with his kicking leg so the task fell onto Matt Geyer whose conversion attempt went wide. Ten minutes later a penalty was awarded to the Broncos after a high shot from Billy Slater on Shaun Berrigan and Corey Parker's kick was successful, giving his side a two-point lead at 10-8. Following the restart kick from Melbourne, Brisbane were working the ball out of their own half and on the fifth tackle scored a brilliant Grand Final try. From dummy-half Berrigan ran then passed back inside to Lockyer who gave a short ball on to Parker who did likewise for Casey McGuire. Before being tackled McGuire tossed the ball blindly back over his head and it was picked up by Lockyer who spun out of a tackle then passed it to Tonie Carroll. Without losing momentum, Carroll passed the ball on to a flying Brent Tate who raced to the corner for the try. The conversion attempt from near the sideline was missed by Parker so the Broncos led by six with seventeen minutes of play remaining. A couple of minutes later the Storm appeared to have scored their third try when a bomb by Cronk was leapt for but unsuccessfully taken by both a Brisbane and a Melbourne player. On its way down the ball was snatched from the air by King who looked to have put it down for his second try but the <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> ruled that the ball had gone forward off the Storm so it was disallowed. In the seventy-third minute, after a strong run by prop Shane Webcke (the oldest player on the field) put him in good field position, Lockyer snapped away a successful field goal. This gave the Broncos a 7-point buffer. A frustrated Melbourne side were unable to score in the remaining minutes as Brisbane ground their way towards full-time, the score 15-8 at the final siren.|$|E

2500|$|Barry O'Brien, the Tipperary County board chairman, {{said the}} county {{would raise the}} issue of {{introducing}} a <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> in future championships [...] "to make sure the decisions are not only the right decisions, but are seen to be the right decisions". Former Offaly hurler Joachim Kelly, in the Irish Examiner, later agreed that video technology would be a good idea. Tipperary goalkeeper Brendan Cummins spoke in the aftermath of how he had appealed to the referee to look at the giant screen in Croke Park before awarding the penalty.|$|E
2500|$|From this, Thurston {{was able}} to kick to Billy Slater, setting up the first four-pointer which Thurston also {{converted}} to make the score 8–2. A try attempt by Cooper Cronk was controversially [...] disallowed by the <b>video</b> <b>referee,</b> who ruled Isaac Luke {{had been able to}} stop the ball coming into contact with the in-goal grass while also giving New Zealand a penalty against Andrew Fifita for 'driving' Luke. Cronk didn't have to wait long to score though, as a few minutes later Darius Boyd got around Whare and raced down the wing before putting in a miss-kicked grubber which Cronk managed to find to go over and score despite a desperate Kevin Locke tackle. Thurston kicked his 3rd goal from 3 attempts to take the score out to 14–2. Thurston's conversion of Cronk's try saw him overtake Michael Cronin as Australia's highest point scorer in test match football. Manu Vatuvei's attacking run for New Zealand saw him pushed over the sideline 5 metres out by 5 desperate Australian defenders, and an offside penalty at the 35 minute mark gave Thurston another kick to bring the score out to 16–2 at halftime.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} minute the Tigers were {{mounting}} an attack ten metres from the Cowboys line when {{on the third}} tackle, hooker Robbie Farah put his prop forward Anthony Laffranchi through a gap to crash over the line and score near the uprights. Brett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the Tigers were leading 18-6 [...] Ten minutes later the Cowboys were attacking the Tigers' try line when Thurston, ten metres out flicked the ball back to Travis Norton who charged over to score. Josh Hannay converted the try so the Cowboys were behind 18-12. In the sixty-third minute the Tigers had the ball down near the Cowboys' try-line and moved it out to Daniel Fitzhenry on the right wing to dive over in the corner. Hodgson kicked the goal from near the sideline to convert the try, taking the Tigers' lead out to 24-12. With {{six and a half}} minutes remaining, Tigers half-back Scott Prince attempted a field goal but missed. Shortly after that Cowboys winger Matt Sing almost scored a try but the <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> found that he'd knocked on. A few minutes later though, the Cowboys were down close to the Tigers' try line where their half-back Johnathan Thurston threw a cut out pass to Matt Sing to score on the right wing. Josh Hannay missed the conversion so the score was 24-16 in favour of the Tigers with under two minutes left to play. Seconds before the final siren the Tigers got one more try when Hodgson, from ten metres out, put a grubber kick into the Cowboys' in-goal area for Todd Payten to dive onto. Hodgson then converted the try so the final score was 30-16, and the Wests Tigers had their first premiership as a merged team.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} Henry's {{possible}} punishment {{being discussed}} at the FIFA EGM, FFF technical director Gérard Houllier defended Henry, stating the handball was instinctive and that the blame lay with the referee, pointing out that had the goal not been scored, the match would still have gone to penalties. Houllier also called for the introduction of <b>video</b> <b>refereeing.</b>|$|R
30|$|An {{increasing}} number of competitive matches in professional sports are recorded on <b>video</b> and <b>referee</b> decisions are retrospectively analyzed by coaches, fans, players, and sport commentators using slow-motion replays. In March 2018, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the game’s law-making body, approved, with immediate effect, the use of <b>video</b> assistant <b>referees</b> in association football. A <b>video</b> assistant <b>referee</b> has to check every situation to examine whether a potential clear and obvious error {{has been made in}} a match-changing situation. The video assistant relies on video clips in slow motion and/or real time for that. The <b>video</b> assistant <b>referee</b> eventually informs the main referee who then has the opportunity to review footage on the field before making a final decision. It is often acknowledged that slow motion distorts reality and can change the way body movements and intentions are perceived (Caruso et al., 2016). In the current study, we examined the impact of slow-motion video clips on the assessment of foul-play situations.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{game was}} the most closely contested in the series, being tied at 1 - 1 in {{regulation}} and won by the Oilers in double overtime. Nearly halfway into the first period of overtime, a breakaway goal by Stavanger's Juha Kaunismäki was controversially disallowed because none of the officials, including the goal judge, saw the puck go in. Footage provided by the broadcaster TV 2 showed the puck deflecting off the right post, the net inside the goal and finally the left post before being blocked by the goaltender. Since <b>video</b> <b>refereeing</b> is not allowed in Norwegian ice hockey, the footage {{could not be used}} and the game continued until Snorre Hallem scored 4 minutes and 38 seconds into the second overtime period to tie the series at 2 - 2. Following this incident, the NIHF decided to allow limited use of video replays {{for the remainder of the}} series, and will also consider the possibility of implementing <b>video</b> <b>refereeing</b> on a broader scale in the next season.|$|R

50|$|The <b>video</b> <b>referee</b> may {{be called}} upon by the referee to examine the play in {{possible}} tries.
