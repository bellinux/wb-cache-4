50|$|The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are {{material}} conditioning, material presentation, detection, {{data processing}} and separation. Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by the sensor. All optical sensors need clean material {{to be able}} to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle. There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute type and the belt type. For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a <b>vibrating</b> <b>feeder</b> followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the belt type the sensor usually detects the particles horizontally while they pass it on the belt. For the chute type the material detection is usually done vertically while the material passes the sensor in a free fall. The data processing is done in real time by a computer. The computer transfers the result of the data processing to an ultra fast ejection unit which, depending on the sorting decision, ejects a particle or lets it pass.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{automation}} means {{serial production}} with large batch sizes and limited flexibility. Complete automation lines are usually built up around a single product or possibly a small family of similar products that can {{run in the}} same production line. If a component is changed or if a complete new product is introduced, this usually causes large changes in the automation process-in most cases new component fixtures are required with time consuming set up procedures. If components are delivered to the process by traditional hoppers and <b>vibrating</b> <b>feeders,</b> new bowl feeder tooling or additional bowl feeder tops are required. It may be that different product must be manufactured on the same process line, the cost for pallets, fixtures and bowl feeders can often be {{a large part of}} the investment. Other areas to be considered are space constraints, storage of change parts, spare components, and changeover time between products.|$|R

The working principle of the piezoelectric feeder was analyzed, the kinetic model was established, and the main factor which affects the delivery performance of the resonant feeder was obtained by calculation, and then designed the prototype. The resonant frequency of the system obtained by the impedance analyzer, and the displacement magnification of the piezoelectric vibrator were obtained by using the laser displacement meter. Design the speed experiment device of the resonant feeder, obtained the influence of the magnetic spring gap on output speed. The experimental show that when the input voltage is 150 v, the frequency is 140 Hz and the magnetic spring gap is 8 mm, the system achieved the desired working condition, the displacement magnification of the piezoelectric vibrator is about 2. 46 times, the optimum speed is 80 cm/min.

30|$|The {{feed bin}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>feeder</b> {{controls}} the feed rate to the separating table. As ROM coal is {{introduced to the}} separation zone, a thick bed of particles forms on the vibrating deck. The heavier or high-density particles transport through the bed, comes {{in contact with the}} deck, and move toward the back plate {{under the influence of the}} inertia force generated due to deck vibration. Particles when strike the back plate, they move inward and upward in the direction of the discharge side of the table. During operation, lighter or low-density particles float on the top of the bed as they are pushed up at the back plate, and flow to the discharge point. As such, the lighter particles create an upper layer that is collected alongside the deck length. Particles of sufficient high-density sinks through the autogenous medium formed due to the bed of particles fluidized due to constant air-flow, and report back to the deck surface. These high-density particles are then forced by both vibration and the continuous influx of new feed material to transport in a helical pattern at the narrow end of the deck where the final reject is collected. Two or three products are collected from the front side of the table. For pilot-scale evaluation, a 5 -tph air-table deshaling unit utilizing a 1  m 2 air table was tested at three different test sites in India. An immanent advantage of this technology is that it is a dry separator, which delivers a dry product without incurring any dewatering costs.|$|E

It worked well in practice for transporting construction machines, which are used during the vibration. The use of vibration machines requires optimization of their operation modes. In the form of elastic link in them are increasingly using rubber-metallic elements, which are characterized by nonlinear damping properties. So it is necessary to search for new, more modern, methods of calculation of dynamic characteristics of the vibration machines on the properties of rubber as a cushioning material. Methodology. The dynamics of vibration machine that is as elastic rubber block units and buffer shock absorbers limiting the amplitude of the vibrations of the working body. The method of determining amplitude-frequency characteristics of the <b>vibrating</b> <b>feeder</b> is based on the principle of Voltaire, who in the calculations of the damping properties of the dampers will allow for elastic-hereditary properties of rubber. When adjusting the basic dynamic stiffness of the elastic ties and vibratory buffers, using the principle of heredity rubber properties, determine the dependence of the amplitude of the working body of the machine vibrations. This method is called integro-operator using the fractional-exponential kernels of relaxation. Findings. Using the derived formula for determining the amplitude of the resonance curve is constructed one-mass nonlinear system. It is established that the use of the proposed method of calculation will provide a sufficiently complete description of the damping parameters of rubber-metallic elements {{and at the same time}} be an effective means of calculating the amplitude-frequency characteristics of nonlinear vibration systems.
