The painting was presented at a White House reception on February 4, 1966, that was hosted by Lady Bird Johnson and attended by more than 250 invited guests. The portrait hangs in the <b>Vermeil</b> Room.|$|E
5|$|The trophy is {{two feet}} tall and is made of 14.5pounds of {{sterling}} silver and <b>vermeil</b> with a 24karat gold overlay. The trophy is manufactured by the Tiffany & Co. The championship team maintains permanent possession of the trophy. The year and winning team names are engraved on the trophies, and are often prominently displayed in the winning team's arena.|$|E
5|$|His passing did not {{diminish}} his popularity in Philadelphia {{and in a}} 1999 Philadelphia Daily News poll, he {{was selected as the}} city's greatest professional coach/manager, beating out other notable coaches such as: Connie Mack of MLB Philadelphia Athletics, Dick <b>Vermeil,</b> and Greasy Neale of the NFL Philadelphia Eagles. In 2010 there was a push to get him elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame, which included an online petition at Flyershistory.net. Shero was eventually elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 2013. He remains the winningest coach in Flyers history with 308 wins, plus 48 more in playoff competition.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vermeil's</b> {{first two}} seasons as Rams coach were as {{unsuccessful}} {{as many of the}} preceding seasons. Phillips was cut from the team mid-season in 1997, cementing his status as a draft bust.|$|R
5|$|Hank Stram, the team's first head coach, led the Chiefs {{to three}} AFL {{championship}} victories and two {{appearances in the}} Super Bowl. Stram was the team's longest-tenured head coach, holding the position from 1960 to 1974. Marty Schottenheimer was hired in 1989 and led Kansas City to seven playoff appearances in his ten seasons as head coach. Gunther Cunningham served as the team's head coach in between stints as the team's defensive coordinator. Dick <b>Vermeil</b> coached the team to a franchise-best 9–0 start in the 2003 season. Of the thirteen Chiefs coaches, Hank Stram and Marv Levy have been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Herman Edwards served as the team's head coach from 2006 to 2008, compiling a 15–33 record.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{won their}} first playoff game in team history by holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back Ricky Bell {{recorded}} 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. Bell's 38 rushing attempts set a playoff record, tied later by John Riggins in Super Bowl XVII, while the Eagles' Wilbert Montgomery {{was held to}} 35 yards on 12 attempts. The Buccaneers' opening drive resulted in a Bell touchdown, and a Neil O'Donoghue field goal gave the Buccaneers an early 10–0 lead. Wally Chambers forced a Montgomery fumble that was recovered by Randy Crowder on the 4-yard line and led to Bell's second touchdown run, giving the Buccaneers a 17–0 second-quarter lead. Trying to extend that lead before halftime, Doug Williams hurried a pass that {{wound up in the}} hands of Eagles linebacker Jerry Robinson at the Tampa Bay 11-yard line. This set up Ron Jaworski's touchdown pass to Charles Smith. After the Eagles narrowed the gap to 17–10 on a Tony Franklin field goal, a series of Lee Roy Selmon sacks of Jaworski killed the Eagles' rally. A 9-yard touchdown pass to Jimmie Giles completed the Buccaneers' scoring. It was only in the final minutes of the game that the Eagles were able to put together a long drive, ending in a touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael. The Buccaneers held the ball for over 36 minutes of the game. The Buccaneers' defensive strategy revolved around stopping Carmichael and Montgomery. At one point, when Leroy Harris was gang-tackled following a short reception, the entire Buccaneer defense was penalized for unnecessary roughing. The Buccaneers' hard-hitting play intimidated the Eagles' receivers into dropping 10 passes. Going into the matchup, the Eagles were expected to have edges in playoff and quarterback experience. Jaworski was the third-rated quarterback in the NFC, while Williams had the lowest rating of all NFC starting quarterbacks. The game represented a rematch of old coaching rivals, McKay of USC and Dick <b>Vermeil</b> of UCLA. The game was the Buccaneers' first on national television. Word of the upset spread as far as Iran, where the hostages were surprised to learn of the Buccaneers' contention for the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In , Dick <b>Vermeil</b> {{was hired}} from UCLA {{to coach the}} Eagles, who had only one winning season from 1962–1975. Starting in 1978, head coach Dick <b>Vermeil</b> and quarterback Ron Jaworski led the team to four {{consecutive}} playoff appearances.|$|E
50|$|Following {{his tenure}} with San Diego, he coached the Houston Oilers {{for two years}} from 1973 to 1974, helping bring the club out of the funk {{it had been in}} for many seasons prior, and closer to playoff contention. He later served as the {{offensive}} coordinator for the Chicago Bears in 1977 and as a consultant for Dick <b>Vermeil's</b> Philadelphia Eagles in 1980.|$|R
50|$|Originally a seventh-round {{selection}} (191st overall) by <b>Vermeil's</b> Eagles in 1976, Hairston preceded Reggie White on the Eagles' line (1976-1983), {{then spent}} six years in Cleveland (1984-1989) and one final campaign with the Cardinals (1990). In 224 games (184 starts), he posted 94 sacks among 1,141 tackles. He started for the Eagles at defensive end in Super Bowl XV against the Oakland Raiders, one of his 15 postseason contests played.|$|R
50|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, Pitts was a scout for two seasons in Green Bay under Devine. He became an {{assistant}} coach for the Rams under head coach Chuck Knox in 1974, filling a running backs vacancy left by Dick <b>Vermeil's</b> departure to UCLA. Pitts went with Knox to the Buffalo Bills in 1978, then left for the Houston Oilers in 1981, on first-year head coach Ed Biles' staff, coaching hall of fame back Earl Campbell. After Biles was fired in 1983, Pitts spent a season in Canada with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1984 with head coach Al Bruno.|$|R

5000|$|After {{a pair of}} {{wins over}} the Oregon schools, the Bruins went into their season-ending game against rival USC needing a win {{to go to the}} Rose Bowl; a loss or tie would send California to Pasadena. Despite fumbling 11 times and losing 8, UCLA beat the Trojans 25-22. [...] UCLA ended up tied with California for the Pac-8 championship, but {{advanced}} to the Rose Bowl on the strength of their 28-14 win over the Golden Bears. The Bruins went into the Rose Bowl ranked #11. Ironically, the 1975 USC-UCLA game was legendary coach John McKay and <b>Vermeil's</b> final game at the Coliseum.|$|R
50|$|Within {{two weeks}} of <b>Vermeil's</b> resignation, the Chiefs {{returned}} to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach. The team introduced Herman Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and {{head coach of the}} New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round selection in the 2006 NFL Draft to the Jets. Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks. Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5-3 record.|$|R
5000|$|John [...] "Deac" [...] Sanders (born January 11, 1950 in Chicago, Illinois) is {{a former}} American {{football}} defensive back in the National Football League. Sanders played college football at South Dakota. He was signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 1974 and played with them for 3 years, first as a cornerback {{and then as a}} free safety. Sanders then replaced Bill Bradley (American football) as the starting free safety for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1977, Dick <b>Vermeil's</b> second year as the Eagle head coach, and also in 1978. But in 1979, his final year, he played only one game, replaced by Brenard Wilson.|$|R
25|$|The USC coaches {{during this}} time were John McKay and John Robinson, while UCLA was coached by Tommy Prothro, Pepper Rodgers, Dick <b>Vermeil,</b> and Terry Donahue.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his career}} he also {{expressed}} himself through long-form interviews, of which {{perhaps the most}} substantial are those with Antoine Goléa (1958), Célestin Deliège (1975) and Jean <b>Vermeil</b> (1989). In addition, two volumes of correspondence have been published: with the composer John Cage (from the period 1949–62); and with the anthropologist and ethnomusicologist André Schaeffner (from 1954–70).|$|E
25|$|The 1995 and 1996 seasons {{were under}} the {{direction}} of head coach Rich Brooks. Their most prolific player from their first two seasons was the fan-favorite Isaac Bruce. Then in 1997, Dick <b>Vermeil</b> was hired as the head coach. That same year, the Rams traded up in the 1997 NFL draft to select future All-Pro offensive tackle, Orlando Pace.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Rust {{left the}} Alouettes {{to become an}} {{assistant}} with <b>Vermeil's</b> Philadelphia Eagles. He served as linebackers coach for two seasons before leaving to take the defensive coordinator position with Levy and the Kansas City Chiefs. After Levy's firing in 1982, Rust became defensive coordinator of the New England Patriots. Head coach Ron Meyer fired Rust midway through the 1984 season, but he was later reinstated (with Meyer himself fired). Rust and the Patriots went to Super Bowl XX (under head coach Raymond Berry) in 1986, but he left the team after the 1987 season. He returned to the Chiefs for the 1988 season, and moved again to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1989.|$|R
50|$|Terry Donahue was {{promoted}} from assistant coach to {{head coach of}} the Bruins football team following <b>Vermeil's</b> departure. Donahue has the most conference wins of any head coach in Pacific-10 Conference history (98) and also the most wins in UCLA football history (151). His teams compiled a record of 8 - 4 - 1 in bowl games and were the first to win a bowl game in seven consecutive seasons. Donahue's UCLA teams won or shared five Pacific-10 Conference championships and won three Rose Bowls (1983, 1984, and 1986). Donahue's record was 10 - 9 - 1 against USC in the UCLA-USC rivalry. His teams won four New Year's Day bowl games in a row from 1983 to 1986.|$|R
50|$|On January 1, 1976, Dick <b>Vermeil's</b> UCLA Bruins (ranked No. 11 in the AP Poll) {{defeated}} Ohio State (ranked No. 1), 23-10, {{before a}} crowd of 105,464 in the 1976 Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Ohio State had defeated UCLA, 41-20, {{in the regular season}} and came into the game as a 14-point favorite. Ohio State led, 3-0, at halftime, but Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin fractured a bone in his left hand on the third play of the game. UCLA rallied with 23 points in the second half. UCLA quarterback John Sciarra threw two touchdown passes to Wally Henry covering 16 and 67 yards. Ohio State cut the lead to 16-10 early in the fourth quarter, but Ohio State quarterback then threw two costly interceptions. Late in the game, UCLA's Wendell Tyler ran 54 yards for a touchdown; Tyler finished the game with 155 rushing yards.|$|R
25|$|For Edwards, {{the play}} was a {{personal}} redemption, {{as he had been}} burned on one of Pisarcik's early touchdown passes and would have been partially to blame for the loss. It also was his first NFL touchdown. <b>Vermeil</b> refused to question McVay's judgment but allowed that he, too, disliked sitting on the ball to preserve a victory.|$|E
25|$|Across {{the line}} of scrimmage, the Eagles had not huddled, as {{defensive}} coordinator Marion Campbell called for an all-out 11-man blitz. Edwards, who as a defensive back normally would have been several yards deep, was instead close enough to Kotar {{to talk to him}} (the Giants player assured him that his team was just going to kneel again). <b>Vermeil</b> later said the blitz made the victory possible.|$|E
25|$|Marceau {{was made}} a {{commander}} of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an Officer of the Légion d'honneur, and in 1978 he received the Médaille <b>Vermeil</b> de la Ville de Paris. The City of Paris awarded him a grant which enabled him to reopen his International School which offered a three-year curriculum. In November 1998, President Jacques Chirac made Marceau a grand officer of the Ordre national du Mérite.|$|E
50|$|On {{the field}} as either a player or coach during all 240 games of Dick <b>Vermeil's</b> career, Hairston first joined the legendary coach for a memorable run with the Rams. In Hairston's first year with the Rams, 1997, he {{assisted}} Leslie O'Neal to a ten-sack performance. He also coached a pair of players, Kevin Carter and Grant Wistrom, reach double digits in sacks (2000). One year earlier, when the Rams won Super Bowl XXXIV, his unit provided most of St. Louis' 57 sacks, which tied for the league lead. Carter's NFL-leading 17 sacks that year powered him to the Pro Bowl, where he joined his neighbor on the Rams line, D'Marco Farr.Under Hairston, Chiefs defensive end Jared Allen accumulated 20 sacks from 2004-2005, tied for tenth in the NFL during that period but first among players drafted in 2004, including 23 defensive linemen taken before him. Led by Allen's nine sacks as a rookie, the Chiefs finished 2004 with 41 sacks, seventh in the league.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958 Shaw {{took over}} a last-place Philadelphia Eagles team and started rebuilding. He {{immediately}} dealt Buck Lansford, Jimmy Harris, and a first-round draft choice to the Los Angeles Rams for 32-year-old, nine-year veteran quarterback Norm Van Brocklin. Shaw and Van Brocklin led the Eagles to the National Football League Championship in 1960 with a 17-13 victory over Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers, {{the only time the}} Lombardi-era Packers lost a postseason game. The contest ended on a game-saving tackle of Green Bay's Jim Taylor made by Eagle's center/linebacker [...] "sixty-minute-man" [...] Chuck Bednarik who because of early season injuries at linebacker revived, at Shaw's request, the long-discarded concept of two-way football. After winning the 1960 championship, the 61-year-old Coach Shaw retired, saying [...] "I wanted to get out while I was ahead." [...] In the quiet Green Bay dressing room, Lombardi said he was [...] "happy for Buck". [...] "Seeing he's going to retire, that's a nice note for him to go out on." [...] Shaw was the oldest head coach to win an NFL championship until Dick <b>Vermeil's</b> victory with the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV.|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of the turmoil of Al Davis' {{attempts}} to move the team to Los Angeles in 1980, Flores looked to lead the Raiders to their third Super bowl by finishing the season 11-5 and earning a wild card berth. Quarterback Jim Plunkett revitalized his career, taking over in game five when starter Dan Pastorini was lost for the season to a broken leg after owner Al Davis had picked up Pastorini when he swapped quarterbacks with the Houston Oilers, sending the beloved Ken Stabler to the Oilers. The Raiders defeated Stabler and the Oilers in the Wild Card game and advanced to the AFC Championship by defeating the Cleveland Browns 14-12. The Raiders slipped by the AFC West champion San Diego Chargers to advance to their third Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XV, the Raiders faced head coach Dick <b>Vermeil's</b> Philadelphia Eagles. The Raiders dominated the Eagles, taking an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter behind two touchdown passes by Plunkett, including a then-Super Bowl record 80-yard pass and catch to running bank Kenny King. A Cliff Branch third quarter touchdown reception put the Raiders up 21-3 in the third quarter. They would go on to win 27-10, winning their second Super Bowl and becoming the first team to ever win the Super Bowl after getting into the playoffs as the wild card team.|$|R
25|$|George Allen led the Rams from 1966 to 1970 and {{introduced}} many innovations, including {{the hiring of}} a young Dick <b>Vermeil</b> {{as one of the}} first special teams coaches. Though Allen would enjoy five straight winning seasons and win two divisional titles in his time with the Rams he never won a playoff game with the team, losing in 1967 to Green Bay 28–7 and in 1969 23–20 to Minnesota. Allen would leave after the 1970 season to take the head coaching job for the Washington Redskins.|$|E
25|$|After their Super Bowl-winning 1999 season, the Rams offense again {{dominated}} {{the league in}} 2000, leading the NFL in passing, scoring, and total yards. However, the Rams {{had one of the}} worst defenses in the league, ranking last in points allowed (471). This, along with injury problems and a coaching change from Super Bowl winning coach Dick <b>Vermeil,</b> who left the team, to Mike Martz, caused the Rams to slip to a 10–6 record in 2000. The season ended with a loss to the New Orleans Saints in the wild card round of the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Fans in {{the stands}} began heading for the exits as the game seemed all but over, with no {{apparent}} remaining danger of an Eagles comeback. Nowadays, teams in this situation let the play clock run {{down to the last}} possible second and have the quarterback take a knee. On the sidelines, a disgusted Eagles coach Dick <b>Vermeil</b> was turning his attention away from the field and toward the postgame press conference, where he would have to explain to reporters why his team had fallen to an inferior opponent.|$|E
25|$|He was the {{recipient}} of many international honours, including Honorary Citizen of St Emilion, 1974; Freeman of the Seychelles, 1974; Order of Cisneros (Spain), 1964; Officer, L'Étoile Equatoriale (Gabon), 1970; Médaille de <b>Vermeil,</b> City of Paris, 1972; Ordre de l'Étoile Civique (France), 1972; Officier du Mérite Agricole (France), 1973; Commander, National Order of the Leopard (Zaire), 1974; Knight Commander, Order of the Dannebrog (Denmark), 1974; Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia, 1974; Knight Commander, Royal Swedish Order of the Polar Star, 1980; and a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John, 1973. His British honours were MVO 1950, CVO 1969, Knight bachelor 1972, and GBE 1974.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} residence {{is in the}} center. Two colonnades—one on {{the east}} {{and one on the}} west—designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings, added later. The Executive Residence houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase. The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, <b>Vermeil</b> Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices. The second floor family residence includes the Yellow Oval Room, East and West Sitting Halls, the White House Master Bedroom, President's Dining Room, the Treaty Room, Lincoln Bedroom and Queens' Bedroom, as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room. The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{broadcast}} in the United States by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentators Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf. Lynn Swann (Chargers sideline) and Lesley Visser (49ers sideline) served as sideline reporters. During that Super Bowl, Visser {{became the first}} woman assigned to a Super Bowl sideline. Visser had previously become the first woman sportscaster to cover the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony, when she covered Super Bowl XXVI for CBS. Brent Musburger hosted all the Super Bowl XXIX pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame events with the help of then-ABC Sports analyst Dick <b>Vermeil,</b> Musburger's regular color commentator on ABC's college football telecasts, and then-New York Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason. This would be the final Super Bowl hosted by Musburger, as all subsequent Super Bowls on ABC were hosted by ESPN's Chris Berman following the Disney purchase of ABC (which included ESPN), and the subsequent integration of ESPN and ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC). Also, the trophy presentation for this game was the last to be held in the winning team's locker room, as all subsequent Vince Lombardi Trophy presentations would be held on the field.|$|E
