40|$|Few studies {{analyze the}} effects of health {{insurance}} on inpatient care in low income countries. This paper provides an empirical assessment {{of the influence of}} Vietnam's health insurance schemes on both hospital admission and the length of stay (LOS) using the Vietnam National Health Survey 2001 - 2002 and an appropriate count data regression model. Our findings suggest that the influence of health insurance on hospital admission and the LOS varies across insurance schemes. The compulsory insurance scheme and the insurance scheme for the poor increase the expected LOS by factors of 1. 18 and 1. 39, respectively, while the <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> has minimal effect on the expected LOS. Insurance also increases the likelihood of hospital admission far more for compulsory members than for members of the other two insurance schemes. The positive influence of insurance on hospital admission and the LOS also varies across income quintiles, regions and types of health facilities. While the compulsory and voluntary schemes increase the likelihood of hospital admission more for lower and middle income individuals, the influence of the compulsory scheme on the expected LOS is more pronounced for patients in the middle income groups. The influence of insurance on the LOS is also found to be stronger in the North than in the South and stronger for patients admitted to provincial hospitals rather than district hospitals.

40|$|Using {{household}} panel data from Vietnam, this paper compares out-of-pocket health expenditures on outpatient care at a health facility between insured and uninsured patients {{as well as}} across various providers. In the random effects model, the estimated coefficient of the insurance status variable suggests that insurance reduces out-of-pocket spending by 24 % for those with the compulsory and voluntary coverage and by about 15 % for those with the health insurance for the poor coverage. However, the modest financial protection of the compulsory and voluntary schemes disappears once we control for time-invariant unobserved individual effects using the fixed effects model. Additional analysis of the interaction terms involving the type of insurance and health facility suggests that the overall insignificant reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures {{as a result of}} the <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> masks wide variations in the reduction in out-of-pocket sending across various providers. Insurance reduces out-of-pocket expenditures more for those enrollees using district and higher level public health facilities than those using commune health centers. Compared to the uninsured patients using district hospitals, compulsory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> reduce out-of-pocket expenditures by 40 and 32 %, respectively.

This dissertation considers a <b>voluntary</b> micro-health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> in Burkina Faso, which has applied community-based targeting to offer poor households a premium discount. It addresses two main reasons for low program coverage in low-income countries, inaccurate targeting of poverty programs and low take-up by the poor. The empirical analysis rests on the combination of four different micro-datasets and follows three different approaches to program evaluation. The main findings from this dissertation are as follows. First, community-based targeting targets consumption-poor households fairly accurately when compared to four statistical targeting methods. Furthermore, for common transfer amounts it {{is by far the}} most cost-effective method. Second, the community-based targeting decision exhibits a moderate but highly statistically significant allocations bias due to ethnic favoritism.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{performance}} of <b>voluntary,</b> non-profit health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> and their potential contribution to health in the two African countries of Ghana and Cameroon. Based on fieldwork conducted {{in the two countries}} during the main rainy season (June-July) of 1996, the paper examines whether and in which way {{the presence or absence of}} a social movement component might affect {{the performance of}} <b>voluntary,</b> non-profit <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in attaining some key objectives of improving access to health care among the target population, as well as achieving equity, efficiency and financial viability. The paper makes this assessment by examining the performances of each of two case studies according to the criteria of social movement, efficiency, equity, access and financial results. Based on case studies of a community financing <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> in Ghana and a mutual aid insurance association in Cameroon, the study concludes that the evidence is not sufficient to confirm that the presence or absence of such a social movement dynamic per se accounts for the perceived performance of either of the schemes. However, it is also argued that the dynamic of social movement could enhance the design and performance of a scheme, especially the efficiency and quality of health care. Such enhancement is possible provided that the scheme is set up in such a way as to benefit from the specific contribution of a movement component, in particular, if the scheme engages in direct negotiations with providers over the price and quality of care and makes direct payment contracts with such providers. A good scheme design is therefore one of the real keys to success. Moreover, it is arguable that a non-social movement based scheme can incorporate elements of a social movement (such as greater community participation, accountability and autonomy) in the course of time. It is argued that this process would enhance the success of a non-movement-based scheme. The study finally presents some lessons and suggestions from the examination of the schemes which could be of benefit in the design, implementation and evaluation of similar <b>schemes.</b> <b>Insurance</b> Coverage Equity Efficiency Solidarity...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Voluntary</b> Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (VHIS) {{is one of}} {{the major}} medical {{healthcare}} reforms proposed by the government. In Hong Kong, the public and private sectors complement each other under a well-established dual-track healthcare system. However, there is an increasing imbalance between the two sectors. Public hospitals take up more than 88% of in-patient services with heavy government subsidies. Due to aging population, the rising demand of citizens on good quality healthcare service provision and escalating medical costs, the recurrent expenditure of the government on medical and health care services increased continuously, from $32 billion in 2007 to $52 billion in 2014. With such huge demand on public medical services, the quality of healthcare provided would inevitably be affected by the heavy workload of the medical staff and proportionally less medical resources per person. Thus, the government proposed the VHIS to recalibrate the balance between public and private healthcare systems by encouraging more well-off citizens, especially the middle-class, to use the private healthcare services as an alternative. Thus, the public sector can focus on providing services in its target areas, thereby enhancing the long-term sustainability of the dual-track healthcare system.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} {{pensions}} in Italy {{dates back to}} the institution in 1898 of the Factory Workers National Insurance Fund for Invalidity and Ageing (CNAS), a <b>voluntary</b> <b>insurance</b> that received grants from the State as well as from employers. In 1919 it became compulsory and it affected 12 million workers; the Agency was renamed National Institute for Social Insurance (INPS) in 1933. In 1939 unemployment insurance, tuberculosis benefits, widow pensions and family grants were established, along with the first forms of redundancy funds; pension ages were lowered. In 1952 pensions were reformed, and minimum pensions were introduced. In 1968-69 the contribution-based system was changed with a retribution-based system, related to previous wages. New measures were introduced for workers and employers to face production crisis. In the 1980s INPS got linked to the new healthcare system, and in 1989 it went through an administrative reform. Since the following year the private workers got their pension related to the company's year-income. The financial disorders of the early 1990s brought to an increase of pension age in 1992 and the introduction of the <b>voluntary</b> private <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> the following year. The reform, in order to decrease both fragmentation and public spending, was completed by the Dini Act in 1995 that introduced a flexible pension age between 57 and 65 years, and swung back to the contribution system. Pension coverage for the new flexible workers was introduced in 1996. Finally, in 2004 the Maroni Act tried to reform restrictively the pension system starting from 2008, but its effects are supposed to get deeply smoothed by the new centre-left government in charge since 2006.|$|R
40|$|Background: Although most {{community-based}} health <b>insurance</b> (CBHI) <b>schemes</b> are <b>voluntary,</b> {{problem of}} adverse selection is hardly studied. Evidence {{on the impact}} of targeted subsidies on adverse selection is completely missing. This paper investigates adverse selection in a CBHI scheme in Burkina Faso. First, we studied the change in adverse selection over a period of 4 [*]years. Second, we studied the effect of targeted subsidies on adverse selection. Methods: The study area, covering 41 villages and 1 town, was divided into 33 clusters and CBHI was randomly offered to these clusters during 2004 – 06. In 2007, premium subsidies were offered to the poor households. The data was collected by a household panel survey 2004 – 2007 from randomly selected households in these 33 clusters (n[*]=[*] 6795). We applied fixed effect models. Results: We found weak evidence of adverse selection before the implementation of subsidies. Adverse selection significantly increased the next year and targeted subsidies largely explained this increase. Conclusions: Adverse selection is an important concern for any <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> Targeted subsidies are often used as a tool to pursue the vision of universal coverage. At the same time targeted subsidies are also associated with increased adverse selection as found in this study. Therefore, it’s essential that targeted subsidies for poor (or other high-risk groups) must be accompanied with a sound plan to bridge the financial gap due to adverse selection so that these schemes can continue to serve these populations...|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries are trying to expand health insurance to achieve universal coverage, yet enrolling informal sector workers and the rural population remains a challenge. A good knowledge of factors driving demand for health insurance among these groups is therefore important. The current study contributes to this body of knowledge by analyzing demand for school-age children and adolescent student (aged 6 - 20) health <b>insurance,</b> a major <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> in Vietnam. Data were drawn form the Vietnam National Health Survey (2001 - 2002). We found that demand increases significantly with the expected benefits of insurance as measured by proximity to and quality of a tertiary hospital. There is a strong socio-economic gradient both at the household and commune levels, with wealthier, more educated households in better-off communes {{significantly more likely to}} purchase insurance for their children. No clear evidence of adverse selection is observed whether health status is assessed objectively or subjectively. Finally, while female heads of household are generally more prone to purchase health insurance for their children, households prioritize young children, male children, and those children with more schooling in their purchase decision. Findings emphasize the need to understand the effects of both health system factors and intra-household dynamics in resource allocation to explain the demand for health insurance in {{developing countries}}.

40|$|Background: In 2005, the South African {{government}} {{introduced a}} <b>voluntary,</b> subsidised health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> for civil servants. In {{light of the}} global emphasis on universal coverage, empirical evidence is needed to {{understand the relationship between}} new health financing strategies and health care access thereby improving global understanding of these issues. Objectives: This study analysed coverage of the South African government health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> the population groups with low uptake, and the individual-level factors, as well as characteristics of the scheme, that influenced enrolment. Methods: Multi-stage random sampling was used to select 1, 329 civil servants from the health and education sectors in four of South Africa&#x 0027;s nine provinces. They were interviewed to determine factors associated with enrolment in the scheme. The analysis included both descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Notwithstanding the availability of a non-contributory option within the <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> and access to privately-provided primary care, a considerable portion of socio-economically vulnerable groups remained uninsured (57. 7 % of the lowest salary category). Non-insurance was highest among men, black African or coloured ethnic groups, less educated and lower-income employees, and those living in informal-housing. The relatively poor uptake of the contributory and non-contributory insurance options was mostly attributed to insufficient information, perceived administrative challenges of taking up membership, and payment costs. Conclusion: Barriers to enrolment include insufficient information, unaffordability of payments and perceived administrative complexity.

The study {{was made possible by}} a unique longitudinal data set: the total sample includes 3492 rural residents from 1020 households. Logistic regression was employed for the data analysis. The results show that although this subsidized scheme achieved a considerable high enrollment rate of 71 % of rural residents, adverse selection still exists. In general, individuals with worse health status are more likely to enroll in RMHC than individuals with better health status. Although the household is set as the enrollment unit for the RMHC for the purpose of reducing adverse selection, nearly 1 / 3 of enrolled households are actually only partially enrolled. Furthermore, we found that adverse selection mainly occurs in partially enrolled households. The non-enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households have the best health status, while the enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households have the worst health status. Pre-RMHC, medical expenditure for enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households was 206. 6 yuan per capita per year, which is 1. 7 times as much as the pre-RMHC medical expenditure for non-enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households. The study also reveals that the pre-enrolled medical expenditure per capita per year of enrolled individuals was 9. 6 % higher than the pre-enrolled medical expenditure of all residents, including both enrolled and non-enrolled individuals. In conclusion, although the subsidized RMHC scheme reached a very high enrollment rate and the household is set as the enrollment unit for the purpose of reducing adverse selection, adverse selection still exists, especially within partially enrolled households. Voluntary RMHC will not be financially sustainable if the adverse selection is not fully taken into account. <b>Voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> Community health insurance Adverse selection Rural China...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{proposed}} solutions to solving issues {{within the realm of}} maternal health care is the inclusion of membership in community-based health insurance plans (CBHI). CHBI schemes are <b>voluntary,</b> non-profit health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> organized and managed at the community level. In developing nations, CBHI plans are seen as a mechanism to meet health-financing needs of rural informal sector households. CHBI has been incorporated into the national health financing strategy in Senegal. CBHI increases facility-based maternal health services by reducing direct payments, thus facilitating timely use of healthcare. It is beneficial in guarding households against unpredictable and potentially catastrophic medical fees associated with pregnancy-related complications. It can also increase women’s interaction with the formal health care sector through its coverage of non-maternal health services. The most important element is the inclusion of maternal health care in any CBHI benefits package, which makes the most significant difference. CBHI plans can increase the demand for and quality of maternal care though requiring certain standards in contracts with health facilities. However, membership in a CBHI scheme is not always sufficient in influencing maternal health behaviors.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades the {{government}} in Thailand has adopted an incremental approach to extending health-care coverage to the population. It first offered coverage to government employees and their dependents, and then introduced a scheme under which low-income people were exempt from charges for health care. This scheme was later extended to include elderly people, children younger than 12 years of age and disabled people. A <b>voluntary</b> public <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> was implemented to cover those who could afford to pay for their own care. Private sector employees were covered by the Social Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> which was implemented in 1991. Despite these efforts, 30 % of the population remained uninsured in 2001. In October of that year, the new government decided to embark on a programme to provide universal health-care coverage. This paper describes how research into health systems and health policy contributed to the move towards universal coverage. Data on health systems financing and functioning had been gathered before and after the founding of the Health Systems Research Institute in early 1990. In 1991, a contract capitation model had been used to launch the Social Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> The advantages of using a capitation model are that it contains costs and provides an acceptable quality of service as opposed to the cost escalation and inefficiency that occur under fee-for-service reimbursement models, such as the one used to provide medical benefits to civil servants. An analysis of the implementation of universal coverage found that politics moved universal coverage onto the policy agenda during the general election campaign in January 2001. The capacity for research on health systems and policy to generate evidence guided the development of the policy and the design of the system at a later stage. Because the reformists who sought to bring about universal coverage (who were mostly civil servants in the Ministry of Public Health and members of nongovernmental organizations) were able {{to bridge the gap between}} researchers and politicians, an evidence-based political decision was made. Additionally, the media played a part in shaping the societal consensus on universal coverage...|$|R

Employees in Germany with gross earnings over 40, 500 a year can choose {{to opt out of}} the statutory health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung, GKV) andpurchase substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> instead. Only a quarter of these employees and their dependants actually choose to opt out; the majority remain in the GKV. Substitutive <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> does not generally afford greater benefits than the GKV in terms of services provided or choice of insurer and only affords marginal benefits in terms of choice of provider.

We investigated trends in administrative expenditure across OECD countries, cross-country spending differences, spending differences between health care system typologies, and differences in the scale and scope of administrative functions across typologies. We used OECD data, which include health system governance and financing-related administrative activities by regulators, governance bodies, and insurers (macrolevel), but exclude administrative expenditure by health care providers (mesolevel and microlevel). We find that governance and financing-related administrative spending at the macrolevel has remained stable {{over the last decade}} at slightly over 3 % of total health spending. Cross-country differences range from 1. 3 % of health spending in Iceland to 8. 3 % in the United States. <b>Voluntary</b> private health <b>insurance</b> bears much higher administrative costs than compulsory schemes in all countries. Among compulsory schemes, multiple payers exhibit significantly higher administrative spending than single payers. Among single-payer schemes, those where entitlements are based on residency have significantly lower administrative spending than those with single social health insurance, albeit with a small difference. These differences can partially be explained because multi-payer and <b>voluntary</b> private health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> require additional administrative functions and enjoy less economies of scale. Studies in hospitals and primary care indicate similar differences in administrative costs across health system typologies at the mesolevel and microlevel of health care delivery, which warrants more research on total administrative costs at all the levels of health system...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} low and middle income {{countries}} (LMICs) are considering social health insurance (SHI) for adoption into their social and economic environment or striving to sustain and improve already existing SHI schemes. SHI was first introduced in Germany in 1883. An analysis of the German system from its inception up to today may yield lessons relevant to other countries. Such an analysis, however, is largely lacking, {{especially with regard to}} LMICs. This paper attempts to fill this gap. For each of the following lessons, it considers if and under which conditions they may be of relevance to LMICs. First, small, informal, <b>voluntary</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> may serve as learning models for fund administration and solidarity, but in order to achieve universal coverage government action is needed to formalise these schemes and to introduce a principle of compulsion. Once compulsory health insurance exists for some people, incremental expansion of coverage to other regions and social groups may be feasible to achieve universality. Second, in order to ensure sustainability of SHI, the mandated benefit package should be adapted incrementally in accordance with changing needs, values and economic circumstances. Third, in a pluralistic SHI system equity, as well as risk pooling and spreading, can be enhanced if funds merge. The optimal number of funds, however, will depend on the stage of development of the SHI system as well as on other objectives of the system, including choice and competition. A risk equalisation scheme may prevent the adverse effects of risk selection, if competition between insurance funds is introduced into the system. Fourth, as an alternative to both state and market regulation, self-governance may serve as a source of stability and sustainability as well as a means of decentralising and democratising a health care system. Finally, costs can be successfully contained in a fee-for-service system, if cost-escalating provider behaviour is constrained by either political pressure or technical means.
