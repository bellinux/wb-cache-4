5|$|The second issue, ironically, {{came about}} due to {{concerns}} about a Soviet ABM system. The US's existing SM-65 Atlas and SM-68 Titan both used re-entry vehicles with blunt noses that greatly slowed the warheads {{as they entered}} the lower atmosphere and made them relatively easy to attack. The new LGM-30 Minuteman missile used sharp-nosed reentry shapes that traveled at much higher terminal speeds, and included a number of decoy systems that were expected to make interception <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Soviet ABMs. This would guarantee the US's deterrent. If there was a budget choice to be made, McNamara supported Minuteman, although he tried not to say this.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be {{as close to the}} fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{verbatim}} of {{the speeches}} {{at the conference}} were presented in full in Neues Deutschland, the central organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, whilst the more critical aspects were censored out in the reports in the Soviet newspaper Pravda. In particular the speech of Carrillo was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Soviets to digest. Pravda sought to portray the conference as a victory for proletarian internationalism and communist unity, downplaying the divisions that had appeared at the meeting. Other Socialist Bloc newspapers also censored the speeches from the conference.|$|E
25|$|This {{compendium}} of biblical and classical history (original title: De aetatibus mundi et hominis libri XXIII) is told in fourteen books, each lacking a particular {{letter of the}} alphabet ('A' in book i, 'B' in book ii., etc.). The deliberate omission of each letter means that Fulgentius cannot use any word containing that letter for the entirety of that section. However, he varies this avoidance of words with his second technique of swapping omitted letters for other arbitrarily selected letters. These techniques obscure his language, making it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> reader to understand his meaning. Just as in the Content of Virgil, Fulgentius claims the work was completed {{as a result of}} the request of his unnamed patron.|$|E

25|$|The Quaid Post {{was located}} at an {{altitude}} of 22,153 feet. It was extremely difficult to attack, as it was surrounded by 457 m high ice walls. It had an inclination of 80° to 85° on three sides, and a little less on the fourth side. It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attackers to climb up the peak without getting noticed by the Pakistani soldiers stationed at the top. The scarcity of oxygen made walking long distances difficult, as the troops had to halt every few meters to regain their breath. There were also frequent blizzards, and taking advantage of poor visibility at night was difficult due to the wind chill factor. The minimum temperatures in the area were as low as -50°C at that time.|$|E
25|$|Lee's army {{suffered}} 5,355 casualties (versus 3,214 Union) in this wasted effort, {{but continued}} to follow the Union army {{all the way to}} Harrison's Landing. On Evelington Heights, part of the property of Edmund Ruffin, the Confederates had an opportunity to dominate the Union camps, making their position {{on the bank of the}} James potentially untenable; although the Confederate position would be subjected to Union naval gunfire, the heights were an exceptionally strong defensive position that would have been <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Union to capture with infantry. Cavalry commander Jeb Stuart reached the heights and began bombardment with a single cannon. This alerted the Federals to the potential danger and they captured the heights before any Confederate infantry could reach the scene.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the same}} side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, it makes for a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E

25|$|The British {{had given}} a 15-day {{ultimatum}} to Nepal to ratify a treaty on 28 November. But the points of the treaty were <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Nepalese to ratify quickly. The delay provided the excuse for the British to commence the second military campaign against the kingdom. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa, another brother of Bhimsen Thapa, had been appointed as Sector Commander for defensive battles for the area from Bijayapur to Sindhuli Gadhi in the first campaign. In this second campaign, Bada Kaji Amarsingh Thapawas detailed as Sector Commander for Sindhuli Gadhi and the eastern front. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa was manning his headquarters at Makwanpur Gadhi. Major General David Ochterlony, was the overall commander against Nepal with a massive 17,000 British troops to assault the fronts including Upardang Gadhi, Sinchyang Gadhi, Kandrang Gadhi, Makawanpur Gadhi and Hariharpur Gadhi.|$|E
25|$|Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium locally {{known as}} Kaloor Stadium is a {{multi-purpose}} international stadium situated in Kochi, Kerala. The stadium is used mostly for association football and cricket matches. With a maximum capacity of 75,000, {{it is one}} of the largest stadiums in India and the third largest cricket stadium in the world. The stadium was built in 1996 by the Government of Kerala with Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA). The stadium is widely touted to be one of the noisiest football stadiums in the world due to its distinctive architecture. In fact, the Kochi crowd is so vociferous that during international cricket matches, it is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> umpires to hear minor edges off the bat by the ball for catches by the wicketkeeper. It is to be noted here that the stadium was originally built as a football stadium.|$|E
25|$|The Gettysburg Campaign {{represented}} the final major offensive by Robert E. Lee in the Civil War. Afterward, all combat {{operations of the}} Army of Northern Virginia were in reaction to Union initiatives. Lee suffered over 27,000 casualties during the campaign, a price <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy to pay. The campaign met only some of its major objectives: it had disrupted Union plans for a summer campaign in Virginia, temporarily protecting the citizens and economy of that state, and it had allowed Lee's men to live off the bountiful Maryland and Pennsylvania countryside and plunder vast amounts of food and supplies that they carried back with them and {{that would allow them}} to continue the war. However, the myth of Lee's invincibility had been shattered and not a single Union soldier was removed from the Vicksburg Campaign to react to Lee's invasion of the North. (Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, the day Lee ordered his retreat.) Union campaign casualties were approximately 30,100.|$|E

25|$|Many {{enterprises}} {{were taken}} over by the state or failed, small trade and production shops had to join cooperatives, but only a small proportion of peasant agriculture was made collective (over ten percent of the arable area) by {{the start of the war}} with Germany. Among the industrial installations dismantled and sent east were most of the Białystok textile industry factories. The results of the Soviet economic policies soon resulted in serious difficulties, as shops lacked goods, food was scarce and people were threatened by famine. Nevertheless, the conditions were better under the Soviets than in the German-run General Government. Industry was developed in Lviv and elsewhere and unemployment was officially eliminated by the spring of 1940. The living standards, following the initial collapse, kept gradually improving, many services were free or inexpensive and the poor and people with technical education fared better than under the Polish rule. The cities, of which Lviv and Białystok were particularly well-maintained by the Soviet authorities, were in much better shape than the countryside. The situation was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Polish retirees, deprived of their pensions, and for the tens of thousands of war refugees who fled German-occupied Poland and settled in the eastern cities.|$|E
500|$|Secord's {{criticism}} {{may have}} been a little extreme. The Department of Defense had created the 7th/13 Air Force at Udon in November 1965 {{for the express purpose of}} conducting the air war in Laos. According to historian Timothy Castle, Sullivan relegated the Air Force commander and his staff [...] "to the status of clerks hired to carry out his airpower decisions." [...] The unconventional arrangement bred frustration and the 7th/13th constantly harped about the use of its air assets in northern Laos. There was constant criticism over the use of air power [...] "serving targets" [...] or utilizing modern fighter-bombers as [...] "long-range artillery." [...] It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Air Force to grasp that a guerrilla force did not fight like a conventional army.|$|E
500|$|The RAAF {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} {{with the performance of}} the F-4Es, and they {{played an important role in}} preparing No.82 Wing to operate the F-111. Many personnel in the Air Force believed that it would have been <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wing to have transitioned directly from the Canberra to the much more complicated F-111. In particular, the Phantoms gave RAAF personnel experience operating aircraft fitted with sophisticated avionics and capable of using a wide range of weapons, and the intensive training program undertaken by No.82 Wing during this period significantly improved its professionalism. In his book Going Solo: The Royal Australian Air Force 1946–1971, Alan Stephens also argued that the speed with which the Air Force's aircrew and technical personnel adapted to operating Phantoms [...] "illustrated the RAAF's exceptional technical competence".|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{was one of}} {{the best}} spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He {{delivered}} the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and top spinners, with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188cm, 6ft 2in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant it was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, Wisden wrote of him: [...] "O'Reilly {{was one of the}} best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler."

500|$|During {{the first}} two months of 1986, Megadeth {{commenced}} a brief tour of the East Coast of the United States. At the shows, which were practically a continuation of the Killing for a Living tour, the band performed a number of songs from its upcoming album. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band intended to start making the record at the Music Grinder studio on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. Mustaine lifted the title from an article in Reader's Digest, which was titled [...] "Peace Would Sell But No One Would Buy It". Their label at the time, Combat Records, provided a recording budget of $25,000, which allowed the band to hire a freelance producer, Randy Burns. The recording of the album was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band, because Mustaine and Ellefson were homeless at the time. Furthermore, guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson would not show up for hours because of their heroin addiction. Shortly after the band finished the final recordings of the album for Combat, they were approached by Tim Carr, an A representative of Capitol Records. After securing a contract with the group, Capitol hired producer Paul Lani to remix the original mixes done by Randy Burns, the previous producer.|$|E
500|$|She {{differed}} from her sister ships mainly in her main armament. She had six [...] Model 1886 35-caliber guns mounted in twin barbette mounts, two forward, side by side, and one aft. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30° across {{the bow and}} 35° abaft the beam, or a total of 155°. The rear mount could traverse 202°. They had a range of elevation from −2° to +15°. Chesmas guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when the guns were trained to one side. Traversing all the guns {{as far as they}} could go to one side produced a list of 7.6° and made it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore-and-aft position. This problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract the list, but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill. The problem was partially cured in 1892 when the equipment was rearranged on the turntable to improve their balance, but more thorough solutions to the problem were either deemed too expensive or inadequate. Their rate of fire was reportedly one round every fifteen to seventeen minutes, including training time. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only [...] ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. They fired a 'light' shell that weighed [...] or a 'heavy' shell that weighed [...] The 'light' shell had a muzzle velocity of [...] while the 'heavy' shell could only be propelled at a velocity of [...] The 'light' shell had a maximum range of [...] when fired at an elevation of 15°.|$|E
