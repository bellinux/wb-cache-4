40|$|A Positive Crankcase Ventilation, or PCV, valve is {{required}} by internal combustion engines in order to regulate the flow of blow-by gases out of the crankcase and into the intake air stream. Fluctuations in the pressure and flow of these gases lead to poor performance and can be detrimental to engine durability. This thesis addresses a specific case of PCV valve component vibration, or flutter, which in certain conditions has been severe enough to be perceived by the customer. Tests monitoring pressure and flow were performed {{in a variety of}} test setups in order to simulate every real-world scenario possible at the bench level. Data attained was analyzed in order to identify and characterize any and all patterns in pressure and flow indicative of flutter conditions.

40|$|SUMMARY Differentiating {{discrete}} subaortic stenosis (DSAS) from {{aortic valve}} stenosis (AVS) may be difficult, even at cardiac catheterization. Twenty-two patients with DSAS were studied echocardiographically and compared with 41 patients with AVS and 234 normal subjects. A ratio of left ventricular outflow tract to aortic root (LVOT: AO) < 0. 80 determined LVOT narrowing in 19 of 22 DSAS patients. The aortic valve echogram was abnormal in 19 of 20 patients with DSAS and complete aortic valve echograms. Abnormalities included marked fluttering and early systolic partial closure ranging from 13 - 88 % of total aortic valve systolic excursion. AVS patients {{did not have}} comparable changes. Neither LVOT narrowing nor degree of aortic valve partial closure (AVPC) correlated with pressure gradients determined by catheterization. A subaortic membrane was visualized in three patients. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy was noted in five patients with DSAS. DSAS is characterized by LVOT narrowing, early systolic AVPC, marked aortic <b>valve</b> <b>flutter,</b> and, in some cases, by a subaortic membrane. Cardiac catheterization is necessary to quantitate the degree of LVOT obstruction. ALTHOUGH DISCRETE SUBAORTIC STENO-SIS (DSAS) is less common than aortic valve stenosi...|$|E
40|$|Pressure-actuated {{reed valves}} play an {{important}} role in the compression process of a refrigerator compressor. The material properties and geometrical parameters of the valve and geometrical properties of valve port determine the flow coefficient which in turn impacts the compressor efficiency. Also, the moving mass of the valve and its stiffness governs the transient response (<b>valve</b> <b>flutter)</b> which impacts life and reliability of the valve in operation. Therefore, it is imperative to carefully design the reed valves to maximize compressor performance while meeting the above requirements. The design of reed valves involves determining the geometrical parameters (length, width and thickness) and material properties (type of steel etc.). These properties are chosen such that they correspond to the desired mass and stiffness of the valve. This work mainly focuses on determining the basic valve topology (geometrical parameters) with the desired mass and stiffness of the reed valve as design constraints. In order to obtain the optimum reed valve mass and stiffness values, an in-house system level performance simulation model is used. An analytical finite element based model has been built that searches for geometrical parameters which meets both target valve parameters and material limitations for reliability and life. This provides multiple valve designs with different geometrical parameters and gives the designer the flexibility to choose the most suitable valve design for a targeted application. Additionally, the basic valve topology will facilitate a more detailed performance analyses, viz. flow-thermal simulations and flow-structure interaction...|$|E

Following withdrawal of four patients from the study, 55 patients were evalu-ated (31 patients in the underwater seal device group and 24 patients in the <b>flutter</b> <b>valve</b> drainage bag group). Results: In the conventional underwater seal device group the mean drainage time was 2. 6 (SD ± 2. 0) days and in the <b>flutter</b> <b>valve</b> drainage bag group the mean drainage time was 3. 3 days (SD ± 4. 0); difference – 0. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) – 2. 4 to 0. 9.

Echocardiography consistently demonstrated a high frequency, low amplitude flutter of the tricuspid valve in systole and none in diastole. Following surgical correction of the defect in one patient, there was complete disappearance of the systolic flutter. Systolic flutter has not been observed with tricuspid incompetence nor with other forms of ventricular septal defects.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Chest {{physical}} therapy techniques are essential {{in order to}} reduce the frequency of recur-rent pulmonary infections that progressively affect lung function in cystic fibrosis patients. Recently, ELTGOL (L’Expiration Lente Totale Glotte Ouverte en décubitus Latéral) emerged as an inexpensive and easy to perform therapeutic option. The aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of ELTGOL and the <b>Flutter</b> <b>valve</b> in stable adult patients with cystic fibrosis. [Subjects and Methods] This was a randomized, crossover study with a sample of cystic fibrosis outpatients. The subjects underwent two protocols (<b>Flutter</b> <b>Valve</b> and ELTGOL interventions, referred to as ELTGOL and FLUTTER) in a randomized order with a one-week washout interval between them. The main outcomes were pulmonary function variables and expectorated sputum dry weight. [Results] ELTGOL cleared 0. 34 g more of secretions than FLUTTER (95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 57). When comparing the physiological effects of ELTGOL and FLUTTER, the first was superior in improving airway resistance (− 0. 51 cmH 2 O/L/s; 95 % CI − 0. 88 to − 0. 14) and airway conductance (0. 016 L/s/cmH 2 O; 95 % CI 0. 008 to 0. 023).

40|$|Abstract Background Thoracic {{injuries}} play {{an important}} role in major trauma patients due to their high incidence and critical relevance. A serious consequence of thoracic trauma is pneumothorax, a condition that quickly can become life-threatening and requires immediate treatment. Decompression is the state of the art for treating tension pneumothorax. There are many different methods of decompression using different techniques, devices, valves and drainage systems. Referring to our case report we would like to discuss the utilization of these devices. Case presentation We report of a patient suffering from tension pneumothorax despite insertion of a chest drain at the accident scene. The decompression was by tube thoracostomy which was connected to a Heimlich <b>flutter</b> <b>valve.</b> During air transportation the patient suffered from cardiorespiratory arrest with asystole and was admitted to the trauma room undergoing manual chest compressions. The initial chest film showed a persisting tension pneumothorax, despite the chest tube that had been correctly placed and connected properly to the Heimlich valve. We assume that the Heimlich valve leaves did not open up and thus tension pneumothorax was not released. Conclusion We would like to raise awareness to the fact that if a Heimlich <b>flutter</b> <b>valve</b> is applied in the pre-hospital setting it should be used with caution. Failure in this type of valve may lead to recurrent tension pneumothorax. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} relative physiological effects of underwater seal (UWS) versus <b>flutter</b> <b>valve</b> (FV) pleural drainage systems {{in the treatment of}} postoperative air leaks.  METHOD—Fourteen patients with air leaks of 1 - 11 days duration, following lobectomy (n = 5), bullectomy (n = 4), decortication (n= 4), and pleural biopsy (n = 1) were analysed. Intrapleural pressure (IPP) measurements were made using an in-line external strain gauge connected directly to the intercostal tube. Patients were connected simultaneously to both UWS and FV drainage systems and pressures were measured sequentially, isolating each system in turn. Maximum (IPPmax) and minimum (IPPmin) intrapleural pressures were calculated from graphic traces. The degree of lung expansion was recorded by chest radiography.  RESULTS—At resting tidal volume IPPmax was significantly higher with the UWS system (mean difference 0. 8 mm Hg, 95 % CI 0 to 1. 6, p= 0. 046) and IPPmin was significantly lower with the FV system (1. 8 mm Hg, 95 % CI 0. 3 to 3. 3, p = 0. 023). The lung was fully expanded in 50 % of patients at the time of study. The mean difference in IPPmin between systems was significantly increased when the lung was fully expanded (mean 2. 8 mm Hg, 95 % CI 0. 1 to 5. 5, p= 0. 042).
