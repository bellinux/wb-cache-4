In the Roman Catholic Church, <b>Vocations</b> Sunday coincides with Good Shepherd Sunday, {{which is the}} fourth Sunday in the Easter Season. The first World Day of Prayer for <b>Vocations</b> was instituted by Pope Paul VI in 1963 during the Second Vatican Council.|$|R
50|$|In {{its initial}} stages, the monastery {{depended}} entirely on expatriate German <b>vocations.</b> This source {{was interrupted by}} World War II, during which the Congregation's German monasteries were forcibly shut down by the Nazi regime. Thus, the Venezuelan monastery needed to cultivate local <b>vocations</b> {{in order to stay}} alive. However, the culturally German character of the abbey made it difficult to entice Venezuelans to join. An effort to cater to local <b>vocations</b> led the community to gather several monks from monasteries in Spain. The drought of local <b>vocations</b> continued, until the monks opened a house in Bogotá, Colombia in 1961.|$|R
5|$|The diverse {{views on}} Spirit-baptism held among Christian traditions can be {{categorized}} into three main groups.

40|$|Researchers of the „religious life'' {{prove that}} <b>vocations</b> for the {{ministry}} and religiousness of groups and religious communities are closely interrelated. <b>Vocations</b> for the ministry — monastic and priesthood — are conditioned in their {{growth and development}} by the level of religiousness, spirituality and morality of a defined socio-religious community (e. g. family, parish). In turn, a proper number of evoked and realized (or systematically realized) <b>vocations</b> for the ministry {{is considered to be}} an "indicator" of the religious vitality of that community. The researchers are also in agreement that the said <b>vocations</b> are evoked only in communities of the faithful. There are only rare cases (0. 05 % in Poland) when the (monastic <b>vocations</b> appear and grow in the atheist) family or indifferent (group). The system of upbringing and a personal example in the scope of socializing and life in the religious spirit charakteristic for the family of believers is decisive in that aspect. In the light of the researchers opinion, monastic <b>vocations</b> are manifesting a level of religious vitality and piety of a given religious community to much higher degree than diocese priesthood <b>vocations.</b> The present work is devoted to the monastic <b>vocations</b> in Poland in the years 1936 - 1983, their numbers, formational differentiation, state specificity and determinants of growth and development. The sociological analysis is supplemented by the statistic data presenting aspects of monastic life. The quoted date can be summed up, that the monastic <b>vocations</b> increased in Poland over time by 30 % and the growth tendencies increased in the years 1978 - 83, years of the present John Paul II pontificate.

5|$|Cynics {{were often}} {{recognized}} {{in the ancient world}} by their apparel - an old cloak and a staff. The cloak came as an allusion to Socrates and his manner of dress, while the staff was to the club of Heracles.

5|$|Feeling a <b>vocation</b> to {{minister}} to the urban poor, Henson served in the East End of London and Barking before becoming chaplain of an ancient hospice in Ilford in 1895.

While there, and as Dean of Durham (1913–18), he wrote prolifically and sometimes controversially.

5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which {{he argued that the}} {{redefinition}} of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular <b>vocation</b> (secularisation of calling). The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5|$|De Barth {{was born}} November 1, 1764, {{in the town}} of Munster, in Alsace, France. He {{was the son of a}} French nobleman, Jean Joseph de Barth, and his wife, Marie Louisa de Rohme. He showed an {{inclination}} toward clerical life from an early age, and his parents encouraged him in that <b>vocation.</b> After attending a Premonstratensian college in Belgium, he enrolled in a seminary in Strasbourg and was ordained there in 1790. The French Revolution forced many noble families into exile, including de Barth's, and they moved to the United States in 1791. De Barth renounced his titles and presented himself to John Carroll, the bishop of Baltimore, for service as a secular priest. Initially, he worked at Bohemia Manor as an assistant priest; shortly thereafter, he was relocated to Port Tobacco, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of <b>vocation.</b>|$|E
