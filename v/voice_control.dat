5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users {{plenty of room}} to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the <b>Voice</b> <b>Control</b> feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly liveâ€”pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good <b>voice</b> <b>control.</b> Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E

25|$|The 1938 Democratic Senate primary {{featured}} {{an intense}} showdown between Barkley, liberal {{spokesman for the}} New Deal, and conservative governor Happy Chandler. The governor was a gifted public speaker, combining <b>voice</b> <b>control,</b> emotionalism, and singing with an unusual ability to personalize his speeches. He could remember everyone's name, and in turn they became emotionally involved in his campaign speeches. Barkley's methodical campaigning was bolstered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's strong endorsement. Barkley handily defeated Chandler, with 56% of the vote. Farmers, labor unions, and city machines gave Barkley his margin, a vote which reaffirmed {{the popularity of the}} New Deal in Kentucky. Only a few months later, Chandler was appointed to the state's other Senate seat upon the death of Senator Mills Logan.|$|E

Intel also learnt that <b>voice</b> <b>control</b> regulator is vital, and the interface between the humans and machine eases the discomfort condition, and brings some sense of control back. It is important to mention that Intel included only 10 people in this study, which makes the study less credible.

25|$|Reddy's early {{research}} was conducted at the AI labs at Stanford, first {{as a graduate student}} and later as an Assistant Professor, and at CMU since 1969. His AI research concentrated on perceptual and motor aspect of intelligence such as speech, language, vision and robotics. Over a span of five decades, Reddy and his colleagues created several historic demonstrations of spoken language systems, e.g., <b>voice</b> <b>control</b> of a robot, large vocabulary connected speech recognition, speaker independent speech recognition, and unrestricted vocabulary dictation. Reddy and his colleagues have made seminal contributions to Task Oriented Computer Architectures, Analysis of Natural Scenes, Universal Access to Information, and Autonomous Robotic Systems. Hearsay I {{was one of the first}} systems capable of continuous speech recognition. Subsequent systems like Hearsay II, Dragon, Harpy, and Sphinx I/II developed many of the ideas underlying modern commercial speech recognition technology as summarized in his recent historical review of speech recognition with Xuedong Huang and James K. Baker.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to provide a}} {{comprehensive}} introduction to digital sound processing and speech recognition. Selected speech recognition features as well as algorithms are introduced and utilized in a <b>voice</b> <b>controlled</b> text editor and a. NET class library. The performance of the features is evaluated in both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent recognition of commands related to text editing. The library provides a straightforward way of implementing a speaker-dependent, domain-constrained voice recognition in an arbitrary application. It is used in a simple <b>voice</b> <b>controlled</b> text editor. The editor allows the user to assign voice commands to built-in actions. In this way, it is possible for inexperienced users to access and use advanced features of the program without having to learn complex workflows. Moreover, this approach is language-agnostic and can even be used by people with speech impairments as opposed to majority of presently used voice recognition systems. The results of the experiments indicate that, given a recording of sufficient quality, the presented features and algorithms provide an effective means to implement a speaker-dependent speech recognition system, which {{can be used in a}} <b>voice</b> <b>controlled</b> text editor.
