25|$|Those {{allow the}} {{emulation}} of analogue teletext on digital TV platforms, {{directly on the}} TV or set-top box, or via analog output, reproducing the <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> data in which Teletext is carried.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, CAL {{engineer}} John Adams {{created a}} design and proposal for UK broadcasters. His configuration contained all the fundamental elements of classic Teletext including pages of 24 rows with 40 characters each, page selection, sub pages {{of information and}} <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> data transmission.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the Ceefax and ORACLE systems and their successors in the UK, the {{teletext}} signal is transmitted as part of the ordinary analogue TV signal but concealed from view in the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Blanking</b> <b>Interval</b> (VBI) television lines which do not carry picture information. The teletext signal is digitally coded as 45-byte packets, so the resulting rate is 7,175 bits per second per used lines (41 7-bit 'bytes' per line, on each of 25 frames per second).|$|E
50|$|The {{parameters}} {{defined by}} standard include horizontal <b>blanking</b> and <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals,</b> horizontal frequency and vertical frequency (collectively, pixel clock rate or video signal bandwidth), and horizontal/vertical sync polarity.|$|R
25|$|The {{technology}} {{works by}} adding additional {{lines to the}} video signal. In the NTSC video standard, <b>blank</b> lines (<b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals)</b> that the user cannot see are used for functions like closed captioning. Rovi Corporation uses these blank lines to implement its ACP technology.|$|R
5|$|Transition-minimized {{differential}} signaling (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, {{audio and}} auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the Control Period. During the Video Data Period, the pixels {{of an active}} video line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals),</b> audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The Control Period occurs between Video and Data Island periods.|$|R
25|$|A {{closely related}} service is the Video Program System (VPS), {{introduced}} in Germany in 1985. Like teletext, this signal is also broadcast in the <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>interval.</b> It consists only of 32 bits of data, primarily {{the date and}} time for which the broadcast of the currently running TV programme was originally scheduled. Video recorders can use this information (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes the VCR. VPS also provides a PAUSE code; broadcasters {{can use it to}} mark interruptions and pause the recorders, however advertisement-financed broadcasters tend not to use it during their ad breaks.|$|E

5000|$|The Nintendo Entertainment System's PPU {{graphics}} chip {{does not}} support true raster interrupts - an interrupt can be set to trigger during the <b>vertical</b> <b>blank</b> <b>interval,</b> but not at any arbitrary scan line - instead required polling of a [...] "hit flag" [...] that indicated when the first sprite was being drawn. Although early games like Super Mario Bros., Castlevania, and The Legend of Zelda managed to produce effective split-screen scrolling with this method, it is CPU-intensive. Some later cartridges incorporated MMC circuitry (most prominently Nintendo's MMC3 chip) that kept track of the PPU's address and data lines and generated raster interrupts.|$|R

5000|$|Normally, {{with any}} flying-spot scanned system, {{the area between}} the flying-spot CRT and {{photomultiplier}} tubes (the whole studio in Vitascan's case) {{would have to be}} completely darkened, in order to prevent any other light, besides the light for the flying spot from the CRT, from interfering with the photomultiplier tubes. Darkening the whole room would make things quite inconvenient for any talent present in a Vitascan studio, but to get around this, strobe lighting was used in the studio for the aid of the talent. The strobe light, referred to as a [...] "sync-lite" [...] by DuMont, would light up only when the photomultiplier scoops were in the <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals</b> of the video they would generate, to prevent any light interference to the photomultiplier tubes. Due to this, the system could not be used outdoors because sunlight would interfere during the scanning phase.|$|R
2500|$|Teletext (or {{broadcast}} teletext) is {{a television}} {{information retrieval service}} created in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by the Philips Lead Designer for VDUs, John Adams. Teletext {{is a means of}} sending pages of text and simple geometric shapes from mosaic blocks to a VBI decoder equipped television screen by use of a number of reserved <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> lines that together form the dark band dividing pictures horizontally on the television screen. [...] It offers a range of text-based information, typically including news, weather and TV schedules. Paged subtitle (or closed captioning) information is also transmitted within the television signal.|$|E

50|$|The Rec. 601 signal can be {{regarded}} as if it is a digitally encoded analog component video signal, and thus the sampling includes data for the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> sync and <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals.</b> Regardless of the frame rate, the luminance sampling frequency is 13.5 MHz.

25|$|The 68000 {{and video}} {{controller}} took turns accessing DRAM every four CPU cycles during {{display of the}} frame buffer, while the 68000 had unrestricted access to DRAM during <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals.</b> Such an arrangement reduced the overall performance of the CPU as much as 35% for most code as the display logic often blocked the CPU's access to RAM. This made the machine run more slowly than several of its competitors, despite the nominally high clock rate.|$|R
50|$|In {{video game}} systems the <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> pulses are {{extensively}} used {{to time the}} plotting of new graphics/removal of old ones {{in order to avoid}} screen tearing, as they occur at an accurately known frequency, and many systems up to the 16-bit era featured games and other graphical programs where drawing was conducted during the <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> for this reason. Cases where synchronising game code this way was more necessary than preferable made early video game systems such as the Atari 2600 difficult to program.|$|R

40|$|Images {{which do}} not have proper synchronization, such as decompressed raw video, must be {{synchronized}} before being displayed. This paper describes {{the design of a}} parameterizable custom integrated circuit that generates both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> synchronization and <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals</b> as defined by video standards (such as NTSC and PAL). An instance has been generated for use in a 640 x 480 video system and placed on a chip using Lager, a silicon compiler. Estimates indicate the 1. 5 volt module will consume 0. 2 mW, a factor of 10 reduction in power as compared to an equivalent solution operating at 5 V.

50|$|A <b>vertical</b> <b>blank</b> {{interrupt}} (or VBI) is {{a hardware}} feature {{found in some}} computer systems that generate a video display. Typical video display circuits generate <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> and <b>vertical</b> sync' pulses when the display picture has completed and the raster is being returned {{to the start of}} the display. With VBI, the <b>vertical</b> <b>blank</b> pulse is also used to generate an interrupt request for the computer's microprocessor.|$|R
50|$|When the OS <b>Vertical</b> <b>Blank</b> Interrupt is enabled, direct updates to the ANTIC DLIST {{registers}} by the CPU or the ANTIC Jump instructions will be overwritten by the OS {{during the}} next <b>Vertical</b> <b>Blank</b> by the values in the shadow registers.

50|$|Vertical {{synchronization}} eliminates this by timing {{frame buffer}} fills {{to coincide with}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>interval,</b> thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as video games and computer aided design (CAD) packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>interval.</b> This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. Triple buffering reduces this latency significantly.|$|E
50|$|Older {{technologies}} such as teletext (DVB-TXT) and <b>vertical</b> <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> data (DVB-VBI) are also supported by the standards to ease conversion. However, for many applications more advanced alternatives like DVB-SUB for subtitling are available.|$|E

50|$|Note {{that the}} DLIST {{registers}} are also updated by the Operating System's <b>Vertical</b> <b>Blank</b> Interrupt (VBI) routine using the values in shadow registers SDLSTL/SDLSTH ($0230-$0231hex/560-561dec). When the OS VBI routine is enabled direct updates to the ANTIC DLIST registers by the CPU or the ANTIC Jump instructions will be overwritten by the OS {{during the next}} <b>Vertical</b> <b>Blank.</b> This implies that an ANTIC JVB (Jump and wait for <b>Vertical</b> <b>Blank)</b> instruction that specifies an invalid address (or a valid address that differs from the shadow SDLST value) has no real affect on the display.|$|R
