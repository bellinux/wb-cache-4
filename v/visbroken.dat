5000|$|A {{marketable}} fuel oil, such as for fueling a power station, {{might be}} required to have a viscosity of 40 centistokes at 100 °C. It might be prepared using either the virgin or <b>visbroken</b> residue described above combined with a distillate diluent ("cutter stock"). Such a cutter stock could typically have a viscosity at 100 °C of 1.3 centistokes. Rearranging equation (2) above for a simple two component blend shows {{that the percentage of}} cutterstock required in the blend is found by: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{yields of}} the various {{hydrocarbon}} products {{will depend on the}} [...] "severity" [...] of the cracking operation as determined by the temperature the oil is heated to in the visbreaker furnace. At {{the low end of the}} scale, a furnace heating to 425 °C would crack only mildly, while operations at 500 °C would be considered as very severe. Arabian light crude residue when <b>visbroken</b> at 450 °C would yield around 76% (by weight) of tar, 15% middle distillates, 6% gasolines and 3% gas and LPG.|$|E
40|$|The {{reasons that}} lead to a {{decrease}} in the stability of colloidal particles dispersed phase <b>visbroken</b> tar are considered. It is established, that introduction the surface-active compounds on the rapeseed oil basis in the <b>visbroken</b> tar contributes to the sorption-solvate of sustainability in the system, to the colloidal stability of particles of the dispersed phase in the conditions of storage, in chemical and thermal aging...|$|E
