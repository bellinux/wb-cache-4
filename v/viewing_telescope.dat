40|$|The {{technique}} described {{is based}} on a refraction phenomenon. Objects observed through a rotating transparent parallel-faced prism have images which move relative to the object. When the objects are small tracer particles suspended in a moving fluid, the velocity of the fluid can be measured by varying the rotational speed of the prism until the component of the image velocity normal to the prism axis is cancelled. The point in space at which thc measurement is lnade is fixed by the interscction of the line of sight of the <b>viewing</b> <b>telescope</b> with a thin transverse beam of light used for illuminating the tracer particles. ...|$|E

The modified Chapman scheme of reactions (8 to 11) assumes that NaO is mostly {{produced in the}} excited state NaO*(A) rather than in ground-state NaO(X) following Shi et al. (1993) and Wright et al. (1993). In the modified scheme of reactions (8 to 11), the first possibility is that the excited NaO*(A) produced can be reduced by atomic oxygen to yield the excited Na atoms, which in turn, de-excites to give the airglow emissions. Secondly, NaO*(A) may be converted to NaO(X) through collisional quenching with M before being reacted with O. In a recent paper, Plane et al. (2012) have used a zenith-sky <b>viewing</b> <b>telescope</b> and a Czerny-Turner spectrograph {{for a series of}} ground-based long-term measurements of RD at several locations and found that RD varies between 1.5 and 2.0, with an average value of 1.67.

40|$|The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is a lunar orbiter {{launched}} in September 2012 that investigates {{the composition and}} temporal variation of the tenuous lunar exosphere and dust environment. The primary goals of the mission are to characterize the pristine gas and dust exosphere prior to future lunar exploration activities, which may alter the lunar environment. To address this goal, the LADEE instrument suite includes an Ultraviolet/ Visible Spectrometer (UVS), which searches for dust, Na, K, and trace gases such as OH, H 2 O, Si, Al, Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe, {{as well as other}} previously undetected species. UVS has two sets of optics: a limb-viewing telescope, and a solar <b>viewing</b> <b>telescope.</b> The solar viewer is equipped with a diffuser (see Figure 1 a) that allows UVS to stare directly at the solar disk as the Sun starts to set (or rise from) behind the lunar limb. Solar viewer measurements generally have very high signal to noise (SNR greater than 500) for 20 - 30 ms integration times.

40|$|The simple {{addition}} of a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera to a theodolite makes it safe to measure the pointing direction of a laser beam. The present {{state of the art}} requires this to be a custom addition because theodolites are manufactured without CCD cameras as standard or even optional equipment. A theodolite is an alignment telescope equipped with mechanisms to measure the azimuth and elevation angles to the sub-arcsecond level. When measuring the angular pointing direction of a Class ll laser with a theodolite, one could place a calculated amount of neutral density (ND) filters in front of the theodolite s telescope. One could then safely view and measure the laser s boresight looking through the theodolite s telescope without great risk to one s eyes. This method for a Class ll visible wavelength laser is not acceptable to even consider tempting for a Class IV laser and not applicable for an infrared (IR) laser. If one chooses insufficient attenuation or forgets to use the filters, then looking at the laser beam through the theodolite could cause instant blindness. The CCD camera is already commercially available. It is a small, inexpensive, blackand- white CCD circuit-board-level camera. An interface adaptor was designed and fabricated to mount the camera onto the eyepiece of the specific theodolite s <b>viewing</b> <b>telescope.</b> Other equipment needed for operation of the camera are power supplies, cables, and a black-and-white television monitor. The picture displayed on the monitor is equivalent to what one would see when looking directly through the theodolite. Again, the additional advantage afforded by a cheap black-and-white CCD camera is that it is sensitive to infrared as well as to visible light. Hence, one can use the camera coupled to a theodolite to measure the pointing of an infrared as well as a visible laser...|$|E
40|$|Part 1. An Absolute Method for the Measurement of Reflectivity. Because of the {{difficulty}} in establishing reflectivity standards {{for use in the}} measurement of reflectivity by comparison, the present method was developed to allow the measurement of absolute reflectivity at perfectly normal incidence. A glass cube with a semi-metallised surface was mounted in the centre of a horizontal circle goniometer, a photomultiplier clamped over the <b>viewing</b> <b>telescope</b> and the specimen supported in front of the glass cube. Monochromatic plane polarised light was passed through a system of lenses which cause the now parallel light beam, after passing through the cube, to fall on the specimen surface with perfectly normal incidence. Facility is provided for measurements in both air and oil. A mathematical treatment of the intensity relationships of the various direct and reflected light rays is given, from which the reflectivity of the specimen (and also the glass cube) can be calculated. The reflectivity of several standard samples in both air and oil is recorded. Part 2. The Distribution of Heavy Metals in Granites. The present survey was conducted in order to extend the possible application of primary cycle geechemical prospecting. Nine different areas of Hercynian and Caledonian granites in Great Britain were studied and both trace and major element analyses recorded. Care was taken to include only unweathered samples for analyses, and three mineral fractions, namely, biotite, raiuscovite and feldspar plus quartz were separated and analysed independently. A method for calculating the plagioclase, orthoclase and quartz percentages in the feldspar plus quartz fraction by the use of x-ray diffraction is given. Analyses are included to show the variation of trace elements away from a mineral vein, the variation of element concentration within a given granite, and the number of samples required to detect a significant difference between two trace element populations. As well as discussing geochemical prospecting, details of the degree of fractionation and order of intrusion of different phases of the same granite, and comparisons between different granites, are given...|$|E
