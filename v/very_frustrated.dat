I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal contested {{the final}} against Chelsea on 4 May 2002. Wenger {{recalled}} Seaman in goal {{from the previous}} fixture, in place of Wright while Campbell was paired up with Adams in central defence. For Chelsea, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Graeme Le Saux passed late fitness tests and were named in the first team; John Terry filled the substitutes bench, having woken up with a virus. Chelsea threatened early with goal efforts from Le Saux and midfielder Frank Lampard, before Bergkamp fashioned the first real chance of the match – he headed the ball over the top, which caught goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini off his line. In the 70th minute Arsenal took the lead: Adams found Wiltord in space, who in turn passed the ball towards Parlour – he kicked [...] "from just beyond the arc", which flew into the top right corner. Ten minutes after, Ljungberg increased the lead, running from the half-way line and shrung off a late challenge by Terry to curl the ball past Cudicini. The win meant Arsenal completed one half of an expected double; Wenger {{was pleased with the}} team's performance, adding: [...] "We were <b>very</b> <b>frustrated</b> last year.

[...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E

[...] She concluded by saying, [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>frustrated</b> that a former fan has tried to co-opt my work for financial gain.

2500|$|Phineas and Ferb is an American {{animated}} {{musical comedy}} television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas Flynn and his British stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries {{to reveal their}} shenanigans to her and Phineas' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy (named [...] "Agent P") for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother.

And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W.

While his parents were very happy when they found out their son, who had been forcibly taken from them two years earlier, was not only alive and aboard a ship in Ranofotsy bay, the Jesuits refused to let [...] "Dom Andre" [...] go to shore until his father provided two additional relatives as temporary hostages. While King Chambanga was enraged over this, he did eventually yield to this demand. These temporary hostages were chained up on the ship and then the Jesuits indicated they would take Drian-Ramaka back on board as well unless his father provided them with another son (preferably two), who would also be taken to Goa for studies. However, Chambanga refused to give up any of his sons to the Jesuits, including Drian-Ramaka. Furthermore, he told the Jesuit missionaries [...] "he felt the Portuguese had the custom of sending some missionaries first to lands they desired and following later to take possession" [...] of them (Larson, 2007). This in turn enraged the Jesuits and the ship's company, who plotted to mercilessly battle the king and his followers, only giving up on this plan when they realized in so doing they {{would not be able to}} do any missionary work in Anosy. Eventually the Jesuits worked out an agreement with Chambanga that in exchange for [...] "just" [...] taking one of what had been two temporary Antanosy hostages to Goa for education, they would be allowed to live and do their missionary work in Anosy. Two of the missionaries settled at Tranovato (for a 1656 map of this community drawn by Flacourt, see.). However, when members of this new, Portuguese community identified the ombiasa as God's enemies, in return the ombiasa threatened to poison them. When the Portuguese openly began searching for gold and silver in the Anosy area, this confirmed King Chambanga's fears that they were involved in much more than just sharing their religion with his people. Soon after this the Portuguese living at Tranovato became ill due to fevers and by the end of the year, <b>very</b> <b>frustrated</b> with how this vazaha endeavor was working out, Chambanga forbid his people to provide anything to the Portuguese in an attempt to starve them into leaving Anosy.|$|E
