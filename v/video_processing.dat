5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing <b>video</b> <b>processing</b> and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E

The technique enables in-situ row-access {{as well as}} column access to the register files. It can {{reduce the number of}} memory access significantly. The technique is especially useful for block-based <b>video</b> signal <b>processing</b> kernels such as FFT/IFFT, DCT/IDCT, and two-dimensional filtering. We have applied the new instruction set architecture to in-loop deblocking filter processing in H. 264 decoder.

2500|$|The Advanced SIMD {{extension}} (aka NEON or [...] "MPE" [...] Media Processing Engine) is {{a combined}} 64- and 128-bit SIMD instruction set that provides standardized acceleration for media and signal processing applications. NEON {{is included in}} all Cortex-A8 devices, but is optional in Cortex-A9 devices. NEON can execute MP3 audio decoding on CPUs running at 10MHz, and can run the GSM adaptive multi-rate (AMR) speech codec at no more than 13MHz. It features a comprehensive instruction set, separate register files, and independent execution hardware. NEON supports 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer and single-precision (32-bit) floating-point data and SIMD operations for handling audio and <b>video</b> <b>processing</b> as well as graphics and gaming processing. In NEON, the SIMD supports up to 16operations at the same time. The NEON hardware shares the same floating-point registers as used in VFP. Devices such as the ARM Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A9 support 128-bit vectors, but will execute with 64bits at a time, whereas newer Cortex-A15 devices can execute 128bits at a time.|$|E

Urban freeways are the backbone of the highway transportation system and the demand on this system is growing. The increase in demand creates an increase in traffic congestion. Past construction solutions to relieve congestion are less viable today due to rising costs and government regulations. Effectively managing the operations of the existing highway transportation network is an alternative for congestion mitigation. The research documented in this study analyzes a trip-wire <b>video</b> image <b>processing</b> system's ability and limitations in accurately detecting passenger cars with and without passenger cars traveling in the adjacent travel lane. This study also analvzes a <b>video</b> image <b>processing</b> system's ability to determine passenger car speeds. Testing was performed at Texas A&M University's Riverside Campus research facility. Testing analyzed three camera heights, 30 feet, 40 feet and 49 feet- 6 inches, in conjunction with three passenger car speeds, 20 mph, 45 mph and 55 mph. The <b>video</b> image <b>processing</b> system used in the study was the Autoscop 0 m 2004 by Image Sensing Systems, Inc. The camera imaging device was a one-half (1 / 2) inch interline transfer microlens charged coupled device (CCD). The camera lens was a six (6) mm, fl. 2 auto ifis lens. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test indicated both camera height and travel lane location affected the system's ability to accurately detect passenger cars. Generally, higher camera heights and travel lanes farther from the camera produced accurate passenger car detection farther upstream from the camera. Also, it was determined that passenger cars traveling in adjacent travel lanes did not significantly influence the <b>video</b> image <b>processing</b> system's ability to accurately detect passenger cars. The paired t-test indicated that passenger car speeds determined by the <b>video</b> image <b>processing</b> system were significantly different when compared to passenger car speeds obtained by a radar speed gun. The results of this thesis research study provide some guidance on the use and placement of a <b>video</b> image <b>processing</b> system in a freeway application. This study also provides some recommendations regarding future <b>video</b> image <b>processing</b> system research and development...|$|R

2500|$|The {{development}} {{team that}} worked on Mega Man 9 consisted of about 20 people total. Takeshita explained that although Inti Creates used their previous experience {{to create the}} gameplay, the technical aspects like the graphics and sound, were more difficult to finetune. As the team {{had a tendency to}} make these attributes complex, Inafune would often scold them to simplify their work and [...] "bring it back to the basics". Rather than use NES technology, Mega Man 9 runs on a new, proprietary engine that simulates the behavior of 8-bit video games. The game even includes [...] "Legacy Mode", which emulates the low <b>video</b> <b>processing</b> power of the NES by partially rendering sprites, thus causing them to flicker when too many are on screen simultaneously. The developers also considered distributing the game on NES cartridges, but without technology {{to bridge the gap between}} the cartridges and current gaming hardware, the idea was scrapped. Takeshita clarified that Mega Man 9 is much too large to actually fit on an NES cartridge. Inafune designed both Plug Man and Splash Woman, while the artists at Inti Creates created the remaining six Robot Masters. Plug Man was used as an example to guide the younger designers in making characters with simple yet unique features. The idea for Splash Woman, the first female Robot Master of the original series, was requested by the planning team. Hornet Man was originally conceived as another female Robot Master named [...] "Honey Woman" [...] before being changed to a male after Inafune presented his design of Splash Woman.|$|E
