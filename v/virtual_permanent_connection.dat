40|$|This paper {{considers}} a TMN-based management {{system for the}} management of public ATM switching networks using a four-level hierarchical structure consisting of one network management system, several element management systems, and several agent-ATM switch pairs. Using Jackson’s queuing model, we analyze the effects of one TMN command on the performance of the component ATM switch in processing local calls. The TMN command considered is the <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> call <b>connection.</b> We analyze four performance measures of ATM switches— utilization, mean queue length and mean waiting time for the processor directly interfacing with the subscriber lines and trunks, and the call setup delay of the ATM switch— and compare the results with those from Jackson’s queuing model.

40|$|At the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), {{there is}} an ongoing effort to gain {{experience}} on ATM and multi-media applications. ICSI is participating in two ATM pilots called Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) and Multimedia Applications on Intercontinental Highway (MAY). Beside these wide-area trial ICSI's ATM network is used for local multi-media experiments. The ATM environment at ICSI is heterogeneous. Both, local and long distance traffic is based on <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>connections.</b> The management of this environment has often been cumbersome and time-consuming {{for a number of}} reasons: The ATM devices have to be accessed separately in an unintegrated manner. Different vendor-specific tools with different user interfaces are used. Configuration data is stored unstructured, redundant and not centralized. Users cannot setup or verify a connection without knowing device-specific details. Hence, the need for a software tool arose that can minimize the administrative [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, the {{functionality}} {{enabling the}} configuration of <b>Permanent</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Connections</b> (PVCs) in heterogeneous Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) environments has been accomplished {{through the use of}} client/server technologies. However, this approach suffers from a number of problems in the areas of flexibility, extensibility and efficiency, and as networks become increasingly complex and dynamic, the need for a new paradigm has become apparent. This paper is concerned with the analysis of a proposed solution wherein intelligent mobile agents are utilized to provide autonomous network configuration management functionality. Configuration methodologies based on a single mobile agent acting serially and multiple mobile agents acting in parallel are compared in terms of time duration and network load. The use of a small expert system to provide the intelligence needed to handle error situations is investigated.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a fundamental problem in resource management for flow-based hybrid switching systems. Such systems aim at efficient transport of layer 3 connectionless IP traffic over layer 2 connection-oriented ATM switching fabrics. One idea behind flow-based hybrid switching is to decompose individual IP packet streams into flows {{and then to}} classify them into short-lived flows and long-lived flows. While the short-lived flows are good for forwarding by the embedded software through <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>connections</b> (PVC), the long-lived flows are more effectively transmitted by hardware through switched virtual connections (SVC). Clearly the flow identification /classification mechanism will have great impact on the utilization of the system's resources.

40|$|Early {{deployments}} of broadband ATM {{networks are}} likely to use overbooked <b>Permanent</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Connections</b> in which more connections are set up than Connection Admission Control (CAC) would ordinarily permit. Since, hopefully, not all users will simultaneously use their connections, the QoS levels required for each connection will be met. A critical problem concerns the behaviour when more than the expected maximum number of users are active- does the network gracefully degrade? Internet type applications {{under the control of}} TCP posses a degree of elasticity that enable them to adjust, whereas others (often real time applications) are more brittle. Under such circumstances appropriate ATM level controls are required that maintain the differing QoS requirements. The interaction of these controls with higher layer protocols, notably TCP, is crucial. Various control mechanisms are described and compared. It is concluded that TCP performs well in conjunction with the ATM Forum’s Guaranteed Frame Rate and VBR. 3 traffic classes. Both cases benefit from Partial Packet Discard and a mechanism that assures minimum bandwidth requirements. Network partitioning using PVCs gives additional control. When used together these controls can reduce undesirable interactions between elastic and brittle services thus enabling easier end-to-end service provision...|$|R

Our study indicates that the presently available static flow classification methods have a vital shortcoming in balancing the utilization of the system's resources. We propose a novel approach for adaptive flow classification based on the min [...] max objective for the system resource utilizations to match with the time-varying traffic/resource characteristics. Based on the monotone properties and sensitivity analysis of the resource utilizations as functions of the control parameters, we first prove that the optimal solution of the static min [...] max problem is achieved at a unique balance point for the resource utilizations. With the intuition gained from the static results, we then design an adaptive controller formulated as a hierarchical stochastic automata control system with local search. T [...] ...|$|R

The female drain connector also has a spring-loaded plastic cap to prevent casual contact with the electrical contact; however with sufficient pressure this can be displaced with a finger.|$|R

40|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1990 s brought new technologies in the telecommunication networks. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has been chosen as the transmission technology of broadband networks. The standardisation of ATM is practically finished today, the implementations are ready and the ATM equipment is largely introduced by users and service providers. At {{the end of the}} 1990 s the Internet Protocol (IP) became the fastest growing network layer protocol that is applicable over any data link layer. The convergence of these two technologies became reality at the {{beginning of}} the year 2000, but a couple of months later the telecommunication market entered the deepest recession ever seen. In the current marketplace the service providers must improve network management to reduce operation costs. ATM network service providers offered mainly <b>permanent</b> <b>virtual</b> circuit <b>connections</b> to customers in the last years, but recently there is an increasing interest to offer switched virtual circuit (SVC) connections to end users. The SVC is based on the use of signalling protocols. Our paper focuses on the performance of call processing in ATM networks. Based on a series of measurements on four types of ATM switches we have established some generalised conclusions, which are switch invariant features of the ATM signalling flows. These results have a wide generality among ATM switches and they can be used to model and design large ATM signalling networks. Our new model is validated against the measurement results on the 7 -node backbone of the TEN- 155 Pan-European ATM network. The second part of the paper shows that a cascaded network is a good estimator for the signalling performance of an arbitrary network. In addition, it is demonstrated that the call density of the network is an important [...] ...|$|R
