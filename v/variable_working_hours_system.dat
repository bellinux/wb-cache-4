40|$|AbstractAlong {{with the}} amount of time spent {{learning}} (or time-on-task), the quality of learning time has a real influence on learning performance. Quality of time in online learning depends on students’ time availability and their willingness to devote quality cognitive time to learning activities. However, the quantity and quality of the time spent by adult e-learners on learning activities can be reduced by professional, family, and social commitments. Considering that the main time pattern followed by most adult e-learners is a professional one, it may be beneficial for online education programs to offer a certain degree of flexibility in instructional time that might allow adult learners to adjust their learning times to their professional constraints. However, using the time left over once professional and family requirements have been fulfilled could lead to a reduction in quality time for learning. This paper starts by introducing the concept of quality of learning time from an online student-centred perspective. The impact of students’ time-related <b>variables</b> (<b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> time-on-task engagement, time flexibility, time of day, day of week) is then analyzed according to individual and collaborative grades achieved during an online master’s degree program.

40|$|L'auteur présente les horaires flexibles, leurs avantages pour l'employeur et pour l'employé, leurs modalités d'application et les réactions de différentes parties à cette forme d'aménagement du temps de travail. For {{the last}} five years rigid working {{schedules}} have increasingly been under attack and many new experiences have been tried in many European countries, particularly in Germany and Switzeriand. The essence of these experiences has been to adapt working schedules to each worker through a flexible <b>hour</b> <b>system.</b> The basic principle of such a system is the free and individual choice of entry and exit time within certain limits. The flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> <b>system</b> generally distinguishes three separate components to a working day : a core time when all employees must be at their job and two flexible time periods, at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the working day. Such a system has advantages for both the employer and the employee. As for the employer, such a system facilitates time Computing, encourages a decrease of short term absenteism and turnover, a reduction of internal traffic, a decrease of accidents on the way to work, a reduction of overtime, greater hiring advantages, and a longer service to the consumer. Moreover management workers may work in a more peaceful atmosphere, the social climate is ameliorated and internal conflicts are reduced. As for the employees, a reduction of transportation time has been noted, family and personal needs are given a better chance to be satisfied, and a change of attitude towards work was underlined. There is no best way to design and install such a system. There are many variations to it and adaptation is surely favorized under such a system. Experience, however, teaches some ground rules. First such a system much be progressively introduced. Experimentation is greatly encouraged. Second, it takes time for the system to give good results. Third, trial and error is often the best method. Fourth, rules must be established to avoid misunderstandings. Fifth, pragmatism is the golden rule. Sixth, a clear distinction must be made between exceeding hours and overtime. Seventh, a lot of information is necessary before and during the introduction of the <b>system.</b> Flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> practically require a form of control. This control, however, should itself be as flexible and as discreet as possible. Self control is to be aimed at. Such a control can be made by a time card, posted or not, by a punch clock, by special individual meter or by computer. To the same extent that flexible <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> <b>system</b> is well accepted by employees, to the same extent does it find obstruction at the middle management level. That the system is applied to middle management is perceived as a move to put them on the same level as blue collar workers. But the basic reluctance of white collars comes from the revised notion of authority required by a flexible <b>hour</b> <b>system.</b> If one group needs particular attention when flexible hours are introduced, it is middle management. Eventhough early reluctance of unions has been greatly dissipated, they still feel that such a system decreases the possibility of human contacts and that the greater responsibility left to the workers is subtle moral constraint. Up to now, flexible hours have been very successful. This is not to say that they are a panacea nor that they will settle all personnel problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the nature of Dutch approach to achieving Work Life Balance (WLB) and to draw policy implications for Japan. It is argued that flexibility of <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and flexibility offered at one's working place are essential elements of WLB. In this respect, the Netherlands has attained relatively advanced policies and practices. For instance, workers in the Netherlands enjoy a strong degree of flexibility in terms of <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> a <b>system</b> that strives to bring actual <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> close to desired <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Furthermore, the country is currently seeking to increase flexibility for workers in the choice of their place of work through the promotion of telework.

Second, the paper presents a theoretical discussion on the flexibility of <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Third, it focuses on three important aspects of WLB in the Netherlands, namely, part-time work, family-friendly policies, and telework. Finally, the paper considers WLB policies and work-style practices in the Netherlands based on a hearing survey of four major private-sector companies. ...|$|R

The aim of the programmes was to initiate and motivate a process of change within the driver, which {{in the long term}} should lead to permanent and sound health habits. One programme was based on health profile assessment and the other was a health examination. METHODS: Altogether, 102 subjects were investigated (51 allocated to an intervention group and 51 to a reference group). The programme in the intervention group (health profile assessment) was based on revelatory communication, adjusted to the driver and contained individual and group activities. The reference group went through a health examination. In both groups blood pressure, serum lipid concentrations, body mass index, and estimated maximal oxygen uptake were measured and the lifestyle habits were surveyed by questionnaires at the start and at follow ups of 6 and 18 months. RESULTS: The results showed that in the intervention group the maximal oxygen uptake increased, as did exercise habits and the intention to practice good dietary habits. <b>Variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> was the most common obstacle to change a health habit.

40|$|Modern {{societies}} are characterised by profound changes in both {{working conditions and}} family formation. Today s workplaces are marked by high flexibility, great job instability and <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> A dual-earner family has replaced the traditional male-breadwinner family and the norm is two working adults. However, the pattern of women s involvement in employment differs in all labour markets depending on the gendered division of paid work, unpaid work and care obligations. These differences {{can be seen as}} the combined effect of the individual household strategies and the shape of family and labour market policies in the European welfare regimes. The article analyses household strategies in combining paid work, unpaid work and care in four European countries Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The main conclusion is that the division of paid work, unpaid work as well as caring obligations is gendered in all four countries. Compared with women, men tend to be more flexible, have more secure positions in the labour market and seem to be more involved in unpaid voluntary activities and seem thus more integrated in the society and have a higher level of civic participation. On the other hand, today, an increasing number of women are fully active in the labour market and their level of participation in civic activities becomes more and more similar to men s. However, the burdens of caring for children and other members of the household are still very unevenly divided between men and women, which makes the conflicts between obligations at work and in the households significantly more troublesome for women than for men. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{in most of}} the OECD {{countries}} employment relations have been changing and atypical forms of employment have been spreading rapidly. The “standard contract”, permanent and full-time, has lost importance, replaced by “flexible jobs”, such as fixed-term contracts, temporary work agency employment, <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> jobs, on call employment. A debate has been rising on whether atypical jobs, especially short-term contracts, might spur the development of a secondary labour market, in which the unemployed might get trapped in a cycle between dead-end jobs and unemployment. On the other hand, disadvantaged groups excluded from employment by too strict regulations might benefit most from the enhanced flexibility. Chapter 1 introduces this debate, Chapters 2 and 3 shed light on it. I analyse the labour market performance of workers who left unemployment through short-term jobs. I infer what counterfactual labour market performance would have been undertaken if the unemployed had rejected these jobs. In this way, it can be established whether short-term jobs may increase or decrease the chances of having a more stable career later in life, i. e. whether they are “stepping stones” or “dead ends”. I find evidence supporting the stepping stone hypothesis both in Italy and in Belgium. In terms of future job stability, even precarious and unsuccessful jobs are to be preferred to longer searches for directly finding better jobs. Chapter 4 is an identification analysis of the econometric models for duration data that encompass competing risks of exits, consecutive spells, and lagged duration dependence. Finally, Chapter 5 provides a new estimation strategy to look at the effect of past labour market experiences on two aspects of the subsequent job quality: wage and tenure on the job. The methodological novelty consists in jointly modelling labour market durations, transitions, and wages by way of a hazard-function based approach. (ECON 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} find whether there is a trend in the occupational health and safety of veterinary practices over the years 2002 - 2012. In addition a trend in relation to the practice type and practice size has been analysed.

Reports of these risks assessments were available and coded for subsequent statistical analyses. The prevalence of requirements met stated in the risk assessment reports were analyzed by use of percentage calculations and use of a generalized linear model. Of the eleven variables stated in the risks assessment only one showed a significant (P< 0, 01) improvement over time: radiation. Many variables, biological agents and hygiene in particular, showed a trend towards improvement, but non-significant. The <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> showed a significant difference in practice type (P= 0, 02); mixed practices had the lowest odds (OR= 0, 13 and 95 % CI = 0, 02 - 1, 04) for not meeting requirements.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} developments {{over the}} past two decades in regard to working time and alternative forms of employment, placing the trends seen in Belgium in an international perspective. It also examines whether the Belgian regulations on this subject are stricter than those in the other EU- 15 countries. For the Belgian working population, the usual working time averaged 37 hours per week in 2004, whereas in 1983 it was a little over 40 hours. There are wide variations within the EU- 15. Belgian working time is somewhat shorter than the average for the EU- 15, and that also applies to employees. The average working time ascertained for the various countries is influenced by the employment structure. After adjustments for that factor, the differences are definitely smaller, and working time in Belgium is roughly the same as the EU- 15 average. The decline in average working time and the increased dispersion which have emerged over the years are inevitably connected with the growing use of part-time working and other alternative forms of employment such as temporary work, employment during non-standard <b>hours,</b> overtime <b>working,</b> <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and home <b>working.</b> In many cases this satisfies a genuine preference on the part of the persons concerned, e. g. those seeking a better balance between work and family life. However, since these forms of employment are more common among risk groups such as women, older workers, the young and the low-skilled, there is a danger of further segmentation of the labour market. On the demand side of the labour market, the alternative forms of employment give employers a range of instruments which are conducive to a flexible production process. working time, part-time employment, temporary work, overtime, flexibility...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{and trace}} gas fluxes were {{measured}} from anthropogenic and biogenic emission {{sources in the}} Houston urban surface layer. Air sampling from a tall tower platform began in 2008 and continued through April 2013. A relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system combined with a dual channel GC-FID {{was used to measure}} the flux of 19 different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from C 4 through C 8 species. We discuss a time series comparison of local concentrations and fluxes of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) from winter 2009 compared to spring 2013. Median concentrations over the four-year period fell between 20 to 34 percent, comparable to long-term VOC reduction trends observed in other major metropolitan areas. Emissions of these species fell accordingly with median flux reductions of 25 to 54 percent. For emissions inventory validation purposes, traffic counts were taken along major commuter roads surrounding the tower. We observed a strong correlation between selected vehicle exhaust VOC fluxes and traffic counts except during <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> To assign measured fluxes to local sources, we tested a bulk flux footprint model (Kormann and Meixner model) designed for uniform emission surface areas in this urban, heterogeneous landscape. Tracer releases of known amounts of acetone and methyl-ethyl-ketone (MEK) were performed within the footprint region to validate the model. Four out of six tracer releases matched the fluxes measured at the GC within the given levels of uncertainty for the footprint model and the REA GC-FID system. There were reasonable causes of error for the two releases that did not match. The footprint model was also tested using a known n-pentane emissions source approximately one mile SSE of the tower. Using modeled footprints under wind directions directly from this source, we calculated that the facility emitted an average of 6. 35 ? 3. 63 (1 sd) kg of n-pentane per hour. These rates fell within the facility?s TCEQ permitted hourly emissions allowing 10. 5 kg of VOC per hour. However, if occurring daily, the calculated emission would be above the permit?s yearly emission rate of 4. 67 kg of VOC per hour at a 68 % likelihood based on a normal distribution...|$|R
