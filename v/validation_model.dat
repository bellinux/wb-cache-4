The first version of Gladiator was developed by a team of Government Contract Companies located in the Huntsville, Alabama area but it was soon found that the requirement for two TUGVs to fit into a HMMWV made the original Gladiator CVM design top heavy and impractical.|$|E
30|$|The ANN {{model was}} {{constructed}} by applying a two-fold strategy namely model training and <b>model</b> <b>validation,</b> respectively. In <b>model</b> training, 90 spectra of each matrix-free and matrix-matched calibration curves were first trained using three hidden nodes.

The model that gave the best validation statistics was then chosen as the final model. The trained and cross validated models for (C) and (G) indicated that both matrix-free and matrix-matched calibration curves were linear over the relevant working range with the square of the correlation coefficients (r 2) values between 0.9990 to 1.0000, as assessed from the individual residual plot (both training and <b>validation</b> <b>models).</b> Root-mean-square-deviation (RMSE) obtained for both (C) and (G) were highly satisfactory at < 4 % for both training and <b>validation</b> <b>models.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Hyperspectral {{camera is}} useful for finding a {{wavelength}} range that can estimate growth by using wide spectrum (400 - 1000 nm) ranges. It is possible to apply precision agriculture through determination of accurate harvest season, amount of applied fertilizer and so on according to estimation of growth. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the growth for radish by using hyperspectral image depending on vegetation stages. Methods: Hyperspectral images of Radish and Chinese cabbage were acquired at intervals of 2 weeks in midday. It was divided into the crop and background area in image by using NDVI and the reflectance values of crop area were calibrated by the values of reference board in same image. PLSR analysis was employed to develop model for estimating growth of the crops with the all spectral band of all vegetation stages. The models for estimating the weight of the crops were evaluated through R 2 and root mean square error (RMSE), which were verified as <b>validation</b> <b>model</b> by full-cross validation. Results: The model for estimating the fresh weight for Radish exhibited high performance (R 2 = 0. 950, RMSE= 236. 3 g), but <b>validation</b> <b>model</b> exhibited high error value (R 2 = 0. 806, RMSE= 492. 3 g). Likewise, the model for estimating the dry weight exhibited high performance (R 2 = 0. 975, RMSE= 3. 413 g), but <b>validation</b> <b>model</b> exhibited high RMSE (R 2 = 0. 843, RMSE= 8. 993 g). The model for estimating the fresh weight for Chinese cabbage exhibited high R 2 (R 2 = 0. 897, RMSE= 571. 1 g), but estimation and <b>validation</b> <b>model</b> exhibited high error value (R 2 = 0. 859, RMSE= 685. 0 g). Discussions: The estimation and <b>validation</b> <b>model</b> of the fresh and dry weight for the crops are required to improve RMSE by using different statistics analysis and various vegetation indices. Also, comparative analysis between spectral attributes of this experiment and repeated experiment are required. Conclusion: It is possible to mostly estimate growth of the crops, but estimation and validation models of weight are needed to improve RMSE...|$|E
