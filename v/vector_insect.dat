El objetivo de este trabajo fue determinar el rol de la avena, cebada, centeno, {{triticale}} y trigo (pastoreados y no pastoreados) en la dinámica poblacional de D. kuscheli. El ensayo se realizó dentro del área endémica de la enfermedad, bajo un diseño en franjas en 1998, 1999 y 2000. Se estudió la variación del número de individuos en el tiempo, utilizando como unidad de muestreo los individuos colectados semanalmente en cien golpes de red. Éstos fueron clasificados en ninfas y adultos (macrópteros y braquípteros). Los resultados muestran la importancia del manejo sobre las poblaciones del vector, ya que éstas son mayores en los cultivos pastoreados. La avena registró el mayor número de individuos, seguida por trigo y cebada. El momento del pico poblacional de adultos macrópteros en avena es diferente a los otros cultivos evaluados.

A variety of methods have been employed to suppress vector populations, including the application of biological control agents and the elimination of breeding sites, with a continuing and heavy reliance on the use of chemical insecticides. However, the development of insecticide resistance by <b>vector</b> <b>insects,</b> the cost of developing and registering new insecticidal compounds, and the increase in legislation to combat the detrimental effects of insecticidal residues on the environment, have emphasised the need to assess a variety of alternatives to vector control.

When RDV was treated with CCl 4 for various times, the reduction in the amount of P 2 protein and the loss of viral infectivity to vector cell monolayers were proportional to treatment time. RDV purified using CCl 4 treatment, thus lacking P 2 protein, lost the ability to infect vector insects through feeding and consequently failed to be transmitted to plants.

The microtubule-depolymerizing drug NOC, which had a negligible effect on the formation and protrusion of such tubules from cells, did not inhibit the intercellular spread of RDV.

40|$|The {{epigenetic}} {{regulation of}} gene expression {{has been recognized}} {{as an alternative to}} genetic mutation for the conversion of environmental stressors, such as the presence of parasites, into heritable phenotypic changes. The activation of immune responses in insects involves the orchestrated expression of genes that mediate pathogen recognition and immunity-related signalling, which in turn induces the synthesis of effector molecules such as antimicrobial peptides. This transcriptional reprogramming is regulated by DNA methylation and the acetylation and deacetylation of histones, which operate before transcription begins, and by microRNAs, which control protein synthesis posttranscriptionally. Therefore, research on epigenetic regulation at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ and organism levels in insects represents an emerging field to understand the regulation of complex parameters such as longevity, fecundity and reproduction. Microbial parasites and parasitic wasps have evolved strategies to interfere with the epigenetic mechanisms of their host insects to favour their own development.
