40|$|Characterization of {{petroleum}} cuts constitutes a necessary stage to perfect {{understanding of the}} reaction mechanisms and to {{the description of the}} kinetics of certain refining processes such as hydrotreating or catalytic cracking. Mass spectrometry (MS), thanks to group-type quantitative analysis methods, enables to access detailed description of complex hydrocarbon mixtures such as middle distillates or heavy cuts such as <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillates.</b> But these methods are also subject to some drawbacks and we shall expose, thereunder, two examples of improvements. In a first part, the accuracy of MS quantification of thiophenic sulphured compounds in middle distillates is studied by intertechnique comparison with the results obtained by gas phase chromatography coupled to sulphur-specific detection by chemiluminescence (GC/SCD). Improving on the MS method is suggested. In the second part, a new system for introducing the sample in the spectrometer source, dedicated to group-type analysis of heavy cuts is described. Its validation, by comparison of the MS results to those of liquid chromatography (LC) as well as its performances, is exposed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{dewaxing}} of paraffinic lube stocks is {{an essential}} step {{in the production of}} lubricants to improve the operability of machines especially in winter. The present work deals with study of the urea dewaxing process of two types of Egyptian <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillates.</b> The effect of different compositions of methanol to water saturated with urea and yield of the oil, percent of wax, pour point, refractive index, viscosity, viscosity index and specific gravity of the oil produced from the two types of distillates (I and II) were evaluated. The operating conditions of the urea adduct formation with n-paraffins using methanol to water mixture achieved the best pour point at − 3. 88 °C from an initial temperature of 4. 4 °C for distillate I at (25 / 75) methanol to water. At the same ratio of methanol to water the best specific gravity of oil produced changed from 0. 865 to 0. 867, with viscosity index of 80. Percent yield of 50 % for oil and percent wax of 50 % were obtained. Results for distillate II, of higher specific gravity, are comparatively higher than those for distillate I. Experiments were carried out at room temperature...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, Basrah crude oil, {{atmospheric}} distillate of 305 - 623 K boiling range, <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillate</b> of 623 - 823 K boiling range, and wide petroleum distillate of boiling range 305 - 823 K are hydrotreated in trickle bed reactor using Cobalt-Molybdenum alumina as a catalyst. Hydrotreating temperatures are 598 - 648 K, 598 - 673 K, 648 - 673 K and 648 K respectively while LHSV are 0. 7 - 2 hr - 1, 1 hr - 1, 0. 7 - 2 hr - 1 respectively. The operating pressure  and H 2 /Oil ratio for all experiments are kept constant at 3 Mpa and 300 liter/liter.     The {{results show that}} Sulphur and metal content decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing LHSV.      Vacuum residue of boiling range above 823 K is mixed with hydrotreated atmospheric distillate, <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillate</b> and with the hydrotreated wide petroleum distillate. The temperature for hydrotreating the mixed sample is 648 K and LHSV is 1 hr - 1. It was found that hydrotreating crude oil is the best choice since it gives the highest removal of sulphur, vanadium and cobalt removal. </p...|$|E

Volatile components were collected by condensation of popper headspace gases and by vacuum steam distillation of a slurry of ground, popped corn in distilled water. The organic compounds were extracted from the aqueous condensate and <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillate</b> with diethyl ether. The concentrated ether extracts were analyzed by a coupled gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer utilizing three different procedures. These were: (1) a 300 foot by 0. 01 inch ID capillary column, into which samples were injected with a 50 : 1 inlet split, with the effluent end connected directly to the ion source of the mass spectrometer; (2) the same directly coupled capillary column but with samples previously trapped from a packed column introduced without splitting; (3) mass spectrometric analysis of a portion (5 to 10...|$|E
3000|$|Classical {{viscosity}} {{breaking of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillate</b> residue or bitumens requires temperatures well {{in excess of}} 400  °C and up to 500  °C. This involves direct heating with coils or in soak drums as the pressure has to stay low to encourage cracking. Another method used to heat heavy feeds is hot water. Low pressure steam aids thermal cracking to make the smallest chemical building blocks such as ethylene and propylene—although this requires even higher temperatures. By contrast, lower temperature steam mobilises heavy hydrocarbons in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) (in situ) as well as post-processing such as bituminous oil (“tar sands”). The viscosity is reduced as long as heat is applied enabling improved mobility. Simultaneously, the steam selectively removes (“strips”) lighter components from the crude, but no cracking takes place as the temperature is well below the 340  °C threshold. Once the heating conditions are removed (i.e. after the heating zone), cooling results in a viscosity increase again.|$|E
40|$|Four nickel-molybdenum {{catalysts}} were synthesized on gamma alumina {{with higher}} surface area and on NiMo catalyst was prepared using gamma alumina with lower surface area. Catalysts with higher-surface-area support were prepared by co-impregnation, sequential impregnation and adding phosphorous. Theses catalysts were calcined at 500   ͦC. Effect of higher calcination temperature was investigated by preparation of one catalyst calcined at 700 ͦC. Catalysts were thoroughly characterized via four characterization techniques. The hydrotreating activity of three catalysts {{was carried out}} in a micro reactor at high pressure and three different temperatures with Nynas <b>vacuum</b> middle <b>distillate.</b> Prior to the test, sulfiding was carried out to activate the catalysts. Hydrotreated-oil samples as products were analyzed to evaluate the activity and conversion of the catalyst. Also, the spent catalysts were characterized to evaluate the surface area characteristics and deactivation of catalysts. Addition of phosphorous to NiMo/gamma-Al 2 O 3 improved the interaction between the metals and the support as well as reduced the coke formation as observed in scanning electron microscopy micrographs...|$|R
40|$|The 17 -day bench run CMSL- 6 (227 - 83), on Black Thunder Mine subbituminous {{coal and}} with an {{approximate}} space velocity of 481 kg/hr/m{sup 3 } (30 lb/hr/ft{sup 3 }), tested {{the performance of a}} dispersed slurry catalyst in powdered form added to the first stage thermal reactor. This catalyst, based on molybdenum-containing sulfated iron oxide prepared at HTI, had about 15 % moisture, 43 % Fe and 7 % Mo with a BET surface area of about 40 m{sup 2 }/g. The second stage reactor had a partially deactivated Shell S- 317 catalyst (initial age= 520 kg-coal/kg-catalyst) to make the effects of the slurry catalyst more apparent and to attain a realistic equilibrium catalyst age sooner. An in-line hydrotreater was successfully employed during this run to treat atmospheric still overhead and separator overhead products. No interstage product separator was utilized in this run. For the first run condition, the catalyst additive rate was 1400 - 4300 ppm (of coal) Fe with 200 - 700 ppm Mo using a slurrying oil recycle consisting of 60 % of filtered product slurry and 40 % of ashy recycle (unfiltered product slurry) at a relatively low severity with first and second stage temperatures of 427 {degrees}C and 413 {degrees}C (800 {degrees}F and 775 {degrees}F), respectively. After that the additive rate was lowered to 700 ppm Fe with 100 ppm of Mo and the severity was increased with first and second stage temperatures of 441 {degrees}C and 427 {degrees}C (825 {degrees}F and 800 {degrees}F) respectively. The proportion of ashy recycle was maintained at 40 % in Condition 2, and it was lowered to 25 % in Condition 3. In Condition 4, the proportion of ashy recycle was set at 50 %, but, because of slowing of the product slurry filtration, <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillate</b> recycle (and makeup oil) was substituted for the filtered liquid constituent of the recycled oil. With the changes of the proportion of ashy recycle the total slurry catalyst in the system (added and recycled) ranged from 860 to 6345 ppm Fe with 140 to 1030 ppm Mo...|$|E
