40|$|<b>Values</b> {{have held}} a {{prominent}} place in business ethics and organizational theories in recent years. Some organizations now aim to integrate <b>values</b> into their business practices, which requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the organizational <b>values.</b> However, while many believe organizational <b>values</b> should reflect the collective <b>values</b> of the staff, the majority of <b>values</b> statements are generated by senior management with little examination of employees' personal <b>values.</b> The difficulties surrounding the development of an organization's <b>values</b> are exacerbated by the dearth of literature offering practical guidance. The case study presented has been conducted in a UK construction company using Schwartz's theoretical framework of human <b>values</b> as a starting point and framing device.

Follow-up workshops and post-workshop activities facilitated the sharing of common <b>values</b> and helped staff representatives develop their own organizational <b>values</b> statements, independent of the senior management, before a final stage of negotiation with them.
