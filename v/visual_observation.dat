5|$|Amalthea was {{discovered}} on 9 September 1892, by Edward Emerson Barnard using the 36 inch (91 cm) refractor telescope at Lick Observatory. It {{was the last}} planetary satellite to be discovered by direct <b>visual</b> <b>observation</b> (as opposed to photographically) {{and was the first}} new satellite of Jupiter since Galileo Galilei's discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610.|$|E
5|$|Automotive {{manufacturers}} {{often use}} patterns to disguise upcoming products. This camouflage {{is designed to}} obfuscate the vehicle's visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns' purpose is to prevent <b>visual</b> <b>observation</b> (and {{to a lesser degree}} photography), that would subsequently enable reproduction of the vehicle's form factors.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a ship is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's <b>visual</b> <b>observation.</b> Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located {{west of the}} Apollo 15 landing site, {{begins in}} an area of low domes at an {{elongated}} crater, Běla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some research has suggested that both the rille and Běla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally an underground lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are strewn about the feature's floor. The elongated crater Běla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed by the collapse of a shallow magma chamber. <b>Visual</b> <b>observation</b> suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings.|$|E
5|$|The area {{south of}} Lake Ladoga is a heavily forested area with many {{wetlands}} (especially peat deposits) {{closer to the}} lake. In addition the forest shielded both sides from <b>visual</b> <b>observation.</b> Both of these factors greatly hindered the mobility of artillery and vehicles in the area, providing a considerable advantage to the defending forces. One of the key locations were the Sinyavino heights which were some 150 metres higher than the surrounding flat terrain, which {{were some of the}} few dry and clear areas, and in addition provided good observation. Since the front line had changed very little since the blockade was established, the German forces had built a dense defensive network of strong points, interconnected by trenches and protected by extensive obstacles and interlocking artillery and mortar fire. The Neva River and marshes were partially frozen in winter which allowed infantry to cross it, but not heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s mission {{included}} a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which {{had long been}} known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by Pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight, and Earth-based measurement of {{its effect on the}} probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. Thick haze prevented any <b>visual</b> <b>observation</b> of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, BLM {{said it would}} reduce the herd from its {{existing}} 195 adults to 120. The stated goal was to temporarily remove horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by <b>visual</b> <b>observation</b> of the herd's conformity to type using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg, and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed.|$|E

25|$|Various {{phosphors}} {{are available}} {{depending upon the}} needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen. Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one microsecond to several seconds. For <b>visual</b> <b>observation</b> of brief transient events, a long persistence phosphor may be desirable. For events which are fast and repetitive, or high frequency, a short-persistence phosphor is generally preferable.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the extreme}} {{political}} sensitivity of the site, no real archaeological excavations have ever been conducted on the Temple Mount itself. Protests commonly occur whenever archaeologists conduct projects near the Mount.

25|$|On 19 March 2003 at 21:00, {{the first}} strike of the {{operation}} {{was carried out by}} members of the 160th SOAR: a flight of MH-60L DAPs (Direct Action Penetrators) and four 'Black Swarm' flights - each consisting of a pair of AH-6M Little Birds and a FLIR equipped MH-6M to identify targets for the AH-6s (each Black swarm flight was assigned a pair of A-10As) engaged Iraqi <b>visual</b> <b>observation</b> posts along the southern and western borders of Iraq. In the space of seven hours, more than 70 sites were destroyed, effectively depriving the Iraqi military of any early warning of the coming invasion. As the sites were eliminated the first heliborne SOF teams launched from H-5 airbase in Jordan, including vehicle-mounted patrols from the British and Australian components who were transported by the MH-47Es of the 160th SOAR. Ground elements of Task Force Dagger, Task Force 20, Task force 14 and Task Force 64 breached the sand berms along the Iraqi border with Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait {{in the early morning hours}} and drove into Iraq. Unofficially, the British, Australians and Task Force 20 had been in Iraq weeks prior.|$|E
25|$|Battalions {{stationed}} at the Rockpile also had the responsibility of maintaining an outpost {{on top of the}} peak as well. Generally a twenty man contingent, composed mostly of Army technicians, operated at the summit with sophisticated detection and communication equipment that was critical to the entire intelligence operation in South Vietnam. Aside from <b>visual</b> <b>observation,</b> their exact purpose was top secret, however it is believed that their objective involved intercepting NVA radio transmissions. The summit could easily be defended against attack and was well within the capability of such a small group to repel any attempt to overtake the mountain. Typically the provisional Marine team, including an officer, was rotated every thirty days and {{became one of the most}} sought after positions in the DMZ as it was considered the safest place in the area due to its fortress-like pinnacle. In fact, many Marines regarded the Rockpile and Elliot Combat Base as the ideal location to be stationed because there was a high likelihood a soldier would make it through his tour, which typically lasted from a week to two months at the base, unscathed. On top of the Rockpile was a large helicopter pad constructed from heavy timbers. Most of the base's supplies were delivered via helicopter due to its relatively inaccessible location, however pilots often had to abort landing because of heavy fog, intense rain, and winds exceeding fifty miles per hour.|$|E

The goal was to temporarily remove feral horses from the refuge to allow the range {{to recover from the}} historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. According to Jared Bybee, BLM wild horse and burro specialist, grass cover on the range was at just 18 percent of its historic average. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth.

40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>observations</b> and {{quantitative}} samples of forestomach contents {{were made of}} minke whales caught in the Norwegian Sea (15 <b>visual</b> <b>observations</b> in 1999, 8 in 2000 and 1 stomach sample) and North Sea (15 <b>visual</b> <b>observations</b> and 7 stomach samples, all from 1999). Prey species were identified, and from the forestomach samples, each prey’s relative contribution by weight to the diet was calculated. In the Norwegian Sea, the diet was dominated by Norwegian spring-spawning herring (100 %). This {{was consistent with the}} large and dominant abundance of herring in the area. Observations and forestomach samples from the North Sea indicated a more varied diet, with sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) contributing 86. 7 % to the diet by weight, followed by mackerel (9. 3 %), whiting (2. 4 %), herring (1. 1 %) and Norway pout (0. 5 %). Haddock was observed in one stomach, but was not found in any of the samples. Sandeel occurred in all observed and four of the sampled stomachs. The domination of pelagic species in the diet strongly indicates pelagic feeding behaviour in both areas...|$|R

500|$|Nets can be {{effective}} at defeating <b>visual</b> <b>observation.</b> Traditional camouflage nets use a textile 'garnish' to generate an apparent texture with a depth of shadow created beneath it, and the effect can be reinforced with pieces of vegetation. Modern nets tend {{to be made of}} a continuous woven material, which is easier to deploy over a vehicle and lack the [...] "windows" [...] between patches of garnish of traditional nets. Some nets can remain in place while vehicles move. Simple nets are less effective in defeating radar and thermal sensors. Heavier, more durable [...] "mobile camouflage systems", essentially conformal duvets with thermal and radar properties, provide a degree of concealment without the delay caused by having to spread nets around a vehicle.|$|E
500|$|Above {{the dense}} [...] layer are thick clouds {{consisting}} mainly of sulfuric acid droplets. The clouds also contain sulfur aerosol, about 1% ferric chloride and some water. Other possible constituents {{of the cloud}} particles are ferric sulfate, aluminium chloride and phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have different compositions and particle size distributions. These clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of the sunlight that falls on them back into space, and prevent <b>visual</b> <b>observation</b> of Venus's surface. The permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight on the ground. Strong [...] winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to five Earth days. Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest winds are only 10–20% rotation speed.|$|E

In this paper, we address such problems by introducing a statistical dynamic framework to model and recognise human activities based on learning prior and continuous propagation of density models of behaviour patterns.
