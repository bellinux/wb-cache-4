40|$|Current CGSB testing {{standards}} (CAN/CGSB: 65. 17 - 1999) require that participants {{be able to}} move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> in calm water tests only. The effect that two separate wave frequencies had on the ability of people to move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> was investigated. Twenty-three participants were instructed to move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> in the following conditions: calm water, a regular wave spectrum, and an irregular wave spectrum. There {{were no significant differences in}} the length of time it took to move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> across all three conditions. Visual observations of the participants in the water suggest that more physical effort was required on their part to stabilize themselves while in waves. Two participants were unable to move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> in calm water. In conclusion, the two wave spectrums tested increased the amount of physical effort required by the participants to remain in a <b>vertical</b> <b>position,</b> but did not significantly affect the time it took to do so.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{evaluate}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> adopted by nulliparous women during labor in terms of pain and satisfaction with the position. METHODS: the study {{was based on a}} secondary efficacy analysis of data from 107 nulliparous women enrolled in a randomized controlled trial in which the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> adopted during the dilation phase of labor was evaluated. The analysis involved comparing the median percentages of the duration for which women remained in the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> for each of the variables studied. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to determine the difference s betwee n th e groups. Statistical significance was set at p 7 (p= 0. 02). At 4 and 6 cm of dilation, the women who reported greater satisfaction remained more than 50 % of the time in the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> (p= 0. 0 2 an d p= 0. 03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> helped relieve labor pain and increased comfort and patient satisfaction...|$|R

2500|$|This {{equation}} {{does not}} have elementary closed-form solutions, but can be explored {{in a variety of}} ways. [...] It is closely approximated by the Mathieu equation, for instance, when the amplitude of oscillations are small. Analyses show that the pendulum stays upright for fast oscillations. The first plot shows that when [...] is a slow oscillation, the pendulum quickly falls over when disturbed from the upright position. The angle [...] exceeds 90Â° after a short time, which means the pendulum has fallen on the ground. If [...] is a fast oscillation the pendulum can be kept stable around the <b>vertical</b> <b>position.</b> [...] The second plot shows that when disturbed from the <b>vertical</b> <b>position,</b> the pendulum now starts an oscillation around the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> (...) [...] The deviation from the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> stays small, and the pendulum doesn't fall over.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: EAST Superconducting Tokamak is a non-circular {{advanced}} steady-state plasma experimental device, {{which will}} be build at ASIPP in next year. Tokamak plasmas with highly elongated cross sections are subject to a vertical displacement event (VDE). For long duration steady state operation of EAST, {{it would be very}} crucial to maintain the plasma radial and <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> accurately. For designing the position controller in EAST we have adopted 1. 5 D equilibrim evolve control model. While the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> instability is slowed down by a set of passive stabilizers placed closed to the plasma edge, a pair of in- vessel active feedback coils can adequately control <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> perturbations of up to 2 cm. The parameters of both <b>vertical</b> and radial <b>position</b> control coils and their power supplies are determined based on the simulations. 1...|$|R
