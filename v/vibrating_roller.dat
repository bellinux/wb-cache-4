Theoretically, we expect the resulting signal to be periodic with the same frequency f with which the <b>roller</b> <b>vibrates</b> [...] and thus, after a Fourier transform, we expect to observe only frequencies which are multiples of the vibration frequency f. Surprisingly, often, we also observe a peak at half-frequency f/ 2. In this paper, we explain this empirical phenomenon: we show that it is a particular case of a spontaneous symmetry violation, and that the general physical theory of such symmetry violations explains why namely half-frequency signals are often observed...|$|R

The roller type compactors are used for {{compacting}} crushed rock as the base layer underneath concrete or stone foundations or slabs. The plate compactor (vibratory rammer) has a large vibrating baseplate and is suited for creating a level grade, while the jumping jack compactor has a smaller foot. The jumping jack type is mainly used to compact the backfill in narrow trenches for water or gas supply pipes etc. Road rollers may also have <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Since the {{effectiveness}} of a roller depends to a large extent on its weight, self-powered vehicles replaced horse-drawn rollers from the mid-19th century. The first such vehicles were steam rollers. Single-cylinder steam rollers were generally used for base compaction and run with high engine revs in a low gear to promote bounce and vibration from the crankshaft through to the rolls {{in much the same way}} as a <b>vibrating</b> <b>roller.</b> The double cylinder or compound steam rollers became popular from around 1910 onwards and were used mainly for the rolling of hot-laid surfaces due to their smoother running engines, but both cylinder types are capable of rolling the finished surface. Steam rollers were often dedicated to a task by their gearing as the slower engines were for base compaction whereas the higher geared models were often referred to as 'chip chasers' which followed behind the hot tar and chipping laying machines. Some road companies in the United States used steamrollers through the 1950s, and in the UK, some remained in commercial service until the early 1970s.|$|E

50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution roller and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating <b>rollers</b> (or ink <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers),</b> which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink form rollers. A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink form rollers.|$|R

Vibration is typically produced by a free-spinning hydrostatic motor inside the drum to whose shaft an eccentric weight has been attached. Some rollers have a second weight that can be rotated relative to the main weight, to adjust the vibration amplitude and thus the compacting force.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of infrastructure facilities all over the country, many construction activities are carried out causing the construction traffic increased. As a result of movement of heavy vehicles, people feel annoyances so that many complaints against this construction traffic have been arisen. Objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the characteristics of the ground vibrations induced by construction traffic and normal traffic. A road construction site and a road near to stone crusher were selected. Ground vibrations induced by five dump trucks and one <b>vibrating</b> <b>roller</b> at 1 m away from the edge of the road were measured using the four channel seismograph. Ground vibration levels experienced during period of construction traffic were greater than that for normal traffic and dominant in vertical direction. When operating a dump truck, Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) of the ground vibration in the vertical direction was in the range of 0. 127 - 1. 400 mm/s while transverse and longitudinal directions ranges were 0. 079 - 0. 730 mm/s and 0. 127 - 0. 825 mm/s, respectively. Maximum vibration range experienced was 2. 70 - 4. 16 mm/s induced by <b>vibrating</b> <b>roller</b> in vertical direction. Their transverse direction and longitudinal directions vibrations levels ranged from 1. 41 mm/s to 2. 05 mm/s and from 1. 49 mm/s to 3. 35 mm/s, respectively. Vibrations induced by passenger vehicles ranged from 0. 079 mm/s to 0. 143 mm/s in all three directions.

50|$|The primary {{difference}} in placing SMA, compared to DGA is in compaction procedures. Multi-tyred rollers {{are not used}} due to the possible working of binder-rich material {{to the surface of}} the asphalt and consequent flushing and pick-up. Trafficking of the newly placed asphalt while still warm may have the same effect and it is generally preferable for surfaces to cool below about 40°C before opening to traffic. The preferred method of compaction is to use heavy, non-vibrating, steel-wheeled rollers. If these are not available, <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers</b> may be used but vibrationshould be kept to a minimum to avoid fracture of coarse aggregate particles, or drawing of binder {{to the surface of the}} mix. The use of polymer modified binder may decrease mix workability and necessitate increased compactive effort to achieve high standards of compacted density. Achieving high standards of compacted density and low field air voids has been identified as an important factor in the performance of all SMA work. SMA is normally placed with a minimum layer thickness of 2.5 to 3 times the nominal maximum aggregate particle size. Greater layer thicknesses assist in achieving appropriate standards of compacted density.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Liquefaction {{has always}} been {{intensely}} studied {{in parts of the}} world where earthquakes occur. However, the seismic ac-tivity is not the only possible cause of this phenomenon. It may in fact be triggered by some human activities, such as constructing and mining or by rail and road transport. In the paper a road embankment built across a shallow water reservoir is analyzed in terms of susceptibility to liquefaction. Two types of dynamic loadings are considered: first corresponding to an operation of a vibratory roller and second to an earthquake. In order to evaluate a susceptibility of soil to liquefaction, a factor of safety against triggering of liquefaction is used (FSTriggering). It is defined as a ratio of vertical effective stresses to the shear stresses both varying with time. For the structure considered both stresses are obtained using finite element method program, here Plaxis 2 D. The plastic behavior of the cohesionless soils is modeled by means of Hardening Soil (HS) constitutive relationship, implemented in Plaxis software. As the stress tensor varies with time during dynamic excitation, the FSTriggering has to be calculated for some particular moment of time when liquefaction is most likely to occur. For the purposes of this paper it is named a critical time and established for reference point at which the pore pressures were traced in time. As a result a factor of safety distribution throughout embankment is generated. For the modeled structure, cyclic point loads (i. e., <b>vibrating</b> <b>roller)</b> present higher risk than earthquake of magnitude 5. 4. Expla-nation why considered structure is less susceptible to earthquake than typical dam could lay in stabilizing and damping influence of water, acting here {{on both sides of the}} slope...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Civil Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2001 Of {{the most}} {{essential}} objectives of a good mix design procedure {{is to be able}} to assess the compactibility of a mix in the laboratory, i. e. to relate laboratory compaction to compaction on site and to give insight into the prediction of the expected performance of the mix. Foamed bitumen treated material has been used with success in many countries around the world. Regardless of the success story, it is also true that there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the understanding of the effect of the current used compaction methods on the mechanical and volumetric properties of foamed bitumen treated material. The use of a variety of mix design and evaluation procedures around the world has led to difficulties in correlating and assessing results obtained in different environments. Experience and research have also revealed the tendency of current mix design methods to underrate the engineering properties of foamed bitumen treated material. This project entails an investigation into the volumetric and mechanical properties of mixes with three types of granular materials. Test specimens were prepared using four of the most commonly used laboratory compaction methods and one field simulating compaction method. The main objectives of the project were to: • Determine and compare the influence of the different compaction methods on the volumetric and mechanical properties of foam bitumen mixes • To make recommendations regarding the suitability of the different compaction methods for use in the mix design of foamed bitumen mixes. Marshall, Hugo, Gyratory and Refusal Density with Kango Hammer compaction were employed as laboratory compaction methods. A Hydrostatic double-drum <b>vibrating</b> <b>roller</b> was used to simulate field compaction. Graded crushed stone and gravel material were used as the granular materials. Indirect tensile (strength and stiffness) and Semi-circular bending (strength) testing was used to assess the mechanical properties. Use was made of 80 / 100 and 150 / 200 penetration grade bitumen. The study revealed that binder type has no influence on the mechanical properties of foamed mixes, whilst compaction method influences mechanical properties significantly. The SCB test was found to be inappropriate for foam mixes with low binder contents. All the laboratory compaction methods were found to be suitable for the design of foam Mixes. The results reported in this thesis needs to be validated by more extensive as testing was limited to only two types of granular materials.

50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} dampening system used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. Waterless offset presses do not use dampening solution to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the dampening system might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless offset inks have a higher tack and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers</b> in the ink train on the printing press.|$|R

This paper describes ACM equipment to measure crack response to both long term weather phenomena and transient, construction vibrations with the same sensor. This new approach is useful for control and assessment of vibrations produced by soil interaction (pile driving and <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers)</b> or rock interaction (blasting). Its inherently digital nature also allows comparative responses to be communicated broadly to interested regulators and public through real-time polling and Internet display. In addition to describing ACM technology, a case history is presented of crack response to weather and construction vibration.

Direct measurement of that which concerns the public – cracks – provides a control mechanism that is based upon the phenomena of concern itself.

40|$|Prispevek najprej poroča o teoretični raziskavi dinamičnega modela valja in jermena pri mehanizmu tipa Rolamite (RTM). Dinamični model valja in jermena mehanizma RTM je opisan z diferencialnimi enačbami ter analiziran na dva načina, tj. v primeru, ko na sistem ne vpliva vibracijsko vzbujanje, in v primeru, ko le-to vpliva na sistem. Ugotovili smo, da je mogoče s parametri vibracijskega vzbujanja spreminjati parametre nezdrsnega območja. To nas je vodilo do predpostavke, da je v dejanskih mehanizmih tipa Rolamite mogoče vplivati na trenje med strukturnimi elementi mehanizma RTM. Eksperimentalni del raziskave dinamike mehanizma tipa Rolamite z vibrajočimi elementi je bil izveden v treh smereh: kot analiza dinamičnih pojavov v mehanizmu valja in jermena, kot analiza postopkov obvladovanja trenja med elementi mehanizma RTM in kot analiza dinamičnih pojavov v vibramotorjih Rolamite. Povečanje {{amplitude}} električne napetosti, zmanjšanje sile obremenitve gibkega jermena, in zmanjsanje kota, pod katerim gibki jermen ovija valj, povzročijo povečanje amplitude vibracij valjev. Mehanizem RTM z vrtečima se in vibrajočima valjema ima v primerjavi z vibrajočima valjema drugačnega tipa boljso ležajno zmogljivost in je precej bolj občutljiv. Največjo sinhronost vrtenja rotorjev zagotavlja vibramotor Rolamite, ki se sestoji iz dveh rotorjev in piezoelektričnega pretvornika vibracij, ki hkrati vrti oba rotorja. Ta vibramotor primerjamo z vibramotorjem Rolamite z dvema rotorjema in piezo električnim pretvornikom vibracij, ki vrti le enega od rotorjev. This paper {{looks at}} theoretical {{research of the}} dynamic model of the "roller-band" system of the Rolamite-type mechanism (RTM). The dynamic model of the "roller-band" system of the RTM is described by differential equations and is investigated in two ways, i. e., when {{the system is not}} influenced by the excitation of vibrations, and when it is influenced by them. We have established that with the parameters of excitation of vibration it is possibleto operate the parameters of a non-slipping zone. This allows us to assume that in a real Rolamite-type mechanism it is possible to operate on the friction between the structural elements of the RTM. Experimental research on the dynamics of the Rolamite-type mechanism with vibrating elements was done in three directions: research on the dynamic processes running in the RTM roller-band system: research on the processes of friction-control between the elements of the RTMč and research on the dynamic processes running in the Rolamite vibromotors. The increase of the supply-voltage amplitude, the decrease of the force-load magnitude of the flexible band, and the decrease ofthe angle of the wrapping of the roller by the flexible band cause an increase in the amplitude of the roller vibrations. An RTM with rotating <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers,</b> compared with the <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers</b> of the other type, has a better bearing capacity and is much more sensitive. The highest synchronicity of rotation of the rotors is provided by a Rolamite vibromotor with two rotors and a piezoelectric converter of vibrations that simultaneously rotates both rotors. This is compared with the Rolamite vibromotor with two rotors and a piezoelectric converter of vibrations, which rotates only one rotor...|$|R

Three bridges in the Florida Panhandle with approximately 40 years of service in aggressive marine service were examined. A newly constructed marine bridge utilizing concrete cylinder piles was also examined to verify corrosion performance of piles manufactured with modern building materials and construction compared to piles built several decades ago. Survey of the marine bridges showed minimal corrosion distress despite low design concrete cover to steel hoop reinforcements (20 - 40 mm). Typical concrete distress included minor rust staining but not necessarily indicating corrosion of reinforcement steel. Thin longitudinal cracks were frequently observed but were likely caused by mechanical damage from pile driving rather than stemming from corrosion distress. Chloride ion diffusivity was low, {{in the order of}} 1 x 10 - 13 m 2 /s. Other measured parameters such as concrete resistivity, porosity, and water absorption indicate low permeability. Chloride analysis of cracked and uncracked concrete cores from the older bridges in this study did not show pronounced preferential chloride penetration. Chloride analysis from the contemporary marine bridge did show some preferential transport of chloride ions at shallow depths through cracks with further evidence of lower electrical resistivity indicating enhanced electrolyte transport.

In addition, the runway contained concrete Jersey barriers and pits. About 41 seconds later, the aircraft collided with the machinery and broke into 3 major pieces. The fuselage was torn in two, and the engines and landing gear separated. A crane tore the left wing from the aircraft, forcing the jet back onto the ground. The nose struck a scoop loader. A large fire followed, destroying the forward section of the fuselage and the wings. 79 of 159 passengers and 4 of 20 crew members died in the accident. Many of the dead were seated in the middle section of the aircraft; the fuel stored in the wings exploded and sent balls of flame through that section. At 23:17:36, the emergency bell sounded and 41 fire fighting vehicles, 58 ambulances, 9 lighting units, and 436 personnel were dispatched to assist survivors and extinguish the fire.

5000|$|Prior to relocation, {{the inside}} of the {{lighthouse}} was reinforced with a combination of cement block; steel beams, and block and tackle equipment. Besides stabilizing the interior of the light - the outside brick wall of the level beneath the lighting room was reinforced with plywood held in place with tightened steel cables. A similar steel cable reinforcement scheme was also used to stabilize the light's granite foundation. A roadway was excavated from the light's existing location to its new location onto a 3-foot thick reinforced footing. A series of heavy steel I-beams established a support base and track on which the lighthouse was pushed and moved with pneumatic power. [...] Due to the aide-to-navigation requirement that the elevation of the light's signal remain constant - the lower elevation of the new lighthouse location required the light be raised on a cement block foundation. The new cement block foundation along with the light's original granite stone foundation maintain the light's signal at its previous elevation. The new cement block foundation and old granite stone foundation are now buried beneath fill and topsoil. To minimize erosion of the cliffs due to potential drainage through disturbed soils of the excavated area - semi-impervious hardener was compacted (see photo foreground) with heavy <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers.</b> Top soil and vegetation removed and saved from the original site were then installed to reestablish the vegetated landscape. In preparation of the relocation, the light's flashing red-and-white signal was extinguished by Principal Keeper Richard Skidmore on April 16, 2015. The light was returned to its functional brilliance at 6:08 PM on the stormy evening of August 11, 2015. The Gay Head Lighthouse is once again open for public visitation through the Martha's Vineyard Museum. The new location of the Gay Head Light is approximately 180 feet back from the eroding cliff's face.

50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers</b> are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{great need}} to {{construct}} more durable roads such as concrete roads in Sri Lanka since the government is spending {{a considerable amount of}} money every year to maintain the national road network which has been constructed using with either conventional asphalt concrete or bituminous paving materials. This research was carried out mainly to explore the possibility of introducing more durable and cost effective Roller Compacted Concrete for road pavements in Sri Lanka. The structural behavior of Roller Compacted Concrete pavement (RCCP), which is a rigid pavement, is completely different from conventional asphalt pavements which are designed as flexible pavements. Since RCCP is not currently used in Sri Lanka there is no local standards available for design and construction of RCCP. An extensive literature review was carried out regarding the design of rigid pavements practiced in other countries. The rigid pavements can be designed using different types of design methods for given conditions. However, out of those methods, American Association of State Highway Traffic Organization method (AASHTO) and Portland Cement Association (PCA) method are popular in the countries where rigid pavements are used. Out of these two methods AASHTO method uses more parameters in designing the pavement thickness. Therefore, parametric study was carried out to investigate the effect of each parameter used in AASHTO method. And also a computer program was developed based on PCA method to carry out the thickness design procedure effectively, as it is more suitable for low volume traffic conditions. An experimental investigation was carried out to formulate a mix design procedure for RCC using local materials. Since the thickness of RCCP depends on the flexural strength of RCC, tests were carried out to investigate the factors affecting the flexural strength of RCC and also other properties such as wet density, compressive strength and drying shrinkage. New test methods were developed to measure these properties specially the flexural strength and wet density incorporating actual conditions of RCC such as actions of static and <b>vibrating</b> <b>rollers.</b> A new apparatus was developed to measure the wet density by modifying the conventional V-B apparatus where vibration as well as known static pressure can be applied to compact concrete. Furthermore, use of chemical and mineral admixtures to improve the properties of RCC was also investigated.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} study the {{evolution}} of a lime-treated silty soil under in-situ conditions of mixing, laying out, compaction and environment, an experimental dike was built near Rouen, in northwest France; this dike is 25 m long, 4 m wide at the crest and 1. 8 m high. While special care was taken to mix the soil and lime very thoroughly, to precisely measure the quantity of water, to compact the soil using a <b>vibrating</b> sheepsfoot <b>roller,</b> the building conditions were those usually used to construct embankments in all other respects. Samples were taken from the dike approximately 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after the completion of the work and underwent triaxial and oedometric testing. To compare the properties of treated soil with those of untreated soil, another smaller "reference" embankment was built nearby under similar conditions with silty soil. Small-strain triaxial tests were performed on unsaturated specimens of treated and untreated soil using an original strain measurement device. The change in axial secant moduli can be described by a power law E = beta sigma(m) (1), where beta is a parameter that depends on curing time and m is nearly constant (m approximate to 0. 45). CU and CD large-strain triaxial tests carried out on saturated treated and untreated specimens, consolidated under confining stresses ranging from 10 to 300 kPa, showed a definite increase in cohesion as a function of Curing time, with nearly unchanged friction angles. The possibility to use a non-linear failure criterion was examined. The compressibility coefficient C-iso,C- slope of the critical state line (CSL) in the [log(p'), e] coordinate system, is significantly lower in treated than untreated specimens, but its value remains constant whatever the curing time. At the same time, the CSL of the treated specimens is above that of the untreated silt. The brittleness of the material, derived from the peak to residual deviator stress ratio q(peak) /q(res) is the same for treated and untreated specimens and is independent of curing time and confining stress. However, the axial strain corresponding to the peak of CD curves is much higher in untreated than in treated specimens. The permeability of the saturated lime-treated soil (10 (- 9) m/s) is {{the same as that of}} the untreated soil. The value measured one month after the embankment was constructed, does not change with time or with the confining stress. The results of the present study confirm those of previous studies on laboratory-prepared unsaturated specimens: they have demonstrated the effectiveness of lime-treatment in the much more difficult environment of a real working site and shown that lime-treated samples present a significant gain in their engineering properties, even when saturated, provided that the dosage of lime and water, mixing and compaction conditions are carefully controlled. The new material thus obtained presents lower plasticity, improved workability, increased stiffness and cohesion without any loss of performance in terms of brittleness or permeability.
