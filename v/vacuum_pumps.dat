5|$|A {{large number}} of {{technological}} changes {{took place during the}} 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since {{the early part of the}} century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{betatron}} would influence {{all subsequent}} accelerators. Its success {{was due to}} {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics involved, and painstaking design of the magnets, <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> and power supply. In 1941, he teamed up with Robert Serber to provide the first theoretical analysis of the oscillations that occur in a betatron. The original 1940 machine was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1960.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, {{mathematical}} modelling of different chamber {{profile of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> to evaluate the evacuation time is developed. The validity of the developed mathematical modelling is demonstrated by performing an experiment on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> with elliptical profile. The performance of the elliptical profile is also {{compared with that of}} the circular profile chamber of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> It is shown that the evacuation time of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> with an elliptical chamber is lower than with a circular profile. Various parametric studies are also performed to investigate the effect of rotor eccentricity, ratio of minor and major axes of the elliptical profiles, air tank capacity on evacuation time of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{diagnosis}} of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> system for the semiconductor manufacturing {{is directly related to}} the failure rate of wafer. Pumping speed is the volume flow rate per unit time by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> and represents the performance of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> directly. Unfortunately, it is impossible to measure the pumping speed in situation. We proposed an alternative method to infer pumping speed indirectly in situ. The Pumping speed indicator (PSI) is based on similarity of the pump-down method and the semiconductor manufacturing processes, estimates the exhaust capacity of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> Keywords-vacuum pump system; system diagnosis; pumping speed indicator I...|$|R

25|$|Zeolites {{can be used}} as {{solar thermal}} {{collectors}} and for adsorption refrigeration. In these applications, their high heat of adsorption and ability to hydrate and dehydrate while maintaining structural stability is exploited. This hygroscopic property coupled with an inherent exothermic (energy releasing) reaction when transitioning from a dehydrated to a hydrated form make natural zeolites useful in harvesting waste heat and solar heat energy. Zeolites are also used as a molecular sieve in cryosorption style <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E
25|$|The W.2B/23C engines {{upon which}} the Welland was based {{produced}} 1,700lbf (7.58kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417mph (670km/h) at 3,000m {{and a range of}} 1,006miles (1,610km). It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit. The engines also drove hydraulic and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce compressor stalls early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds, the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat (around 700°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.|$|E

50|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> is {{a device}} that removes gas {{molecules}} from a sealed volume in order to leave behind a partial vacuum. The first <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> was invented in 1650 by Otto von Guericke, and was preceded by the suction pump, which dates to antiquity.|$|R
50|$|A vacuum is {{initially}} created by connecting a closed container to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b> After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump</b> {{can be left}} running. Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode ray tubes (CRTs), and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain a vacuum {{for a long time}}. This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases {{for a long time after}} the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced. Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump,</b> getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher <b>vacuum</b> than the <b>pump</b> could achieve alone. Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{overall goals}} of PIP are to {{increase}} the repetition rate of the Booster beam from 7Hz to 15Hz and replace old hardware to increase reliability of the operation. Before {{the start of the}} PIP project, a replacement of the pre-accelerator injector was underway. The replacement of almost 40-year-old Cockcroft–Walton generators to RFQ started in 2009 and completed in 2012. At the linac stage, the analog beam position monitor (BPM) modules were replaced with digital boards in 2013. A replacement of Linac <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> and related hardware is expected to be completed in 2015. A study on the replacement of 201-MHz drift tubes is still ongoing. At the boosting stage, a major component of the PIP is to upgrade the Booster ring to 15-Hz operation. The Booster has 19 radio frequency stations. Originally, the Booster stations were operating without solid-state drive system which was acceptable for 7-Hz, but not for 15-Hz operation. A demonstration project in 2004 converted one of the stations to solid state drive prior to the PIP project. As part of the project, the remaining stations were successfully converted to solid state in 2013. Another major part of the PIP project is to refurbish and replace 40-year-old Booster cavities. Many cavities have been refurbished and tested to operate at 15Hz repetition rate. The completion of cavity refurbishment is expected to be completed in 2015 and the repetition rate can be gradually increased to 15-Hz operation from that point. A longer term upgrade task is to replace the Booster cavities with a new design. The research and development of the new cavities is underway. The completion of the Booster cavity replacement is expected to be in 2018.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps,</b> in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|E

2500|$|Hooke {{studied at}} Wadham College, Oxford during the Protectorate {{where he became}} one of a tightly knit group of ardent Royalists led by John Wilkins. [...] Here he was {{employed}} as an assistant to Thomas Willis and to Robert Boyle, for whom he built the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> used in Boyle's gas law experiments. [...] He built some of the earliest Gregorian telescopes and observed the rotations of Mars and Jupiter. In 1665 he inspired the use of microscopes for scientific exploration with his book, Micrographia. Based on his microscopic observations of fossils, Hooke was an early proponent of biological evolution. He investigated the phenomenon of refraction, deducing the wave theory of light, and was the first to suggest that matter expands when heated and that air is made of small particles separated by relatively large distances. [...] He performed pioneering work in the field of surveying and map-making and was involved in the work that led to the first modern plan-form map, though his plan for London on a grid system was rejected in favour of rebuilding along the existing routes. [...] He also came near to an experimental proof that gravity follows an inverse square law, and hypothesised that such a relation governs the motions of the planets, an idea which was independently developed by Isaac Newton. Much of Hooke's scientific work was conducted in his capacity as curator of experiments of the Royal Society, a post he held from 1662, or as part of the household of Robert Boyle.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{related to}} making open-cycle OTEC a reality began earnestly in 1979 at the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) {{with funding from}} the US Department of Energy. Evaporators and {{suitably}} configured direct-contact condensers were developed and patented by SERI (see [...] ). An original design for a power-producing experiment, then called the 165-kW experiment was described by Kreith and Bharathan ( [...] , and [...] ) as the Max Jacob Memorial Award Lecture. The initial design used two parallel axial turbines, using last stage rotors taken from large steam turbines. Later, {{a team led by}} Dr. Bharathan at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed the initial conceptual design for up-dated 210kW open-cycle OTEC experiment (...) [...] This design integrated all components of the cycle, namely, the evaporator, condenser and the turbine into one single vacuum vessel, with the turbine mounted on top to prevent any potential for water to reach it. The vessel was made of concrete as the first process vacuum vessel of its kind. Attempts to make all components using low-cost plastic material could not be fully achieved, as some conservatism was required for the turbine and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pumps</b> developed as the first of their kind. Later Dr. Bharathan worked with a team of engineers at the Pacific Institute for High Technology Research (PICHTR) to further pursue this design through preliminary and final stages. It was renamed the Net Power Producing Experiment (NPPE) and was constructed at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii (NELH) by PICHTR by a team led by Chief Engineer Don Evans and the project was managed by Dr. Luis Vega.|$|E
