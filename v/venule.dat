25|$|Guided by the palps, the chelicerae {{cut into}} the skin with their {{horizontal}} cutting action. These rip and tear at the epidermal layers and a small pool of blood is formed. The hypostome is inserted and this provides the initial attachment strength. In the case of Ixodes holocyclus the hypostome is inserted very deep into the dermis. The palps remain spread apart on the surface. The process by which Ixodid and Argasid ticks feed is termed telmophagy (= pool feeding). (This contrasts {{with the process of}} solenophagy, used by mosquitos, in which feeding is direct from a small <b>venule.)</b> The resultant pool expands {{as a result of the}} anticoagulants released from the salivary glands. In some Ixodid ticks a cementum is secreted into the wound within 5–30 minutes of cutting into the skin. This material hardens quickly into a latex-like covering around the mouthparts but excluding the palps that remain flattened out on the skin surface. Ixodes holocyclus, however, is one of the Ixodid ticks which does not produce cementum.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} that, since the {{arteriole}} and <b>venule</b> {{share a common}} sheath, the arteriole's thicker walls push against those of the <b>venule</b> forcing the <b>venule</b> to collapse. This makes the <b>venule</b> form an hourglass shape around the arteriole. Other theories suggest that this results not from compression from the arteriole but from sclerotic thickening or glial cell proliferation at {{the site where the}} two vessels cross.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} deduced from {{indirect}} evidence that significant adjustments of vascular resistance {{take place in}} the venous network when blood flow changes in a organ. In the following experiments, we attempted to test the hypotheses that changes in postcapillary resistance in skeletal muscle may be due to changes in venous diameter, changes in the number of <b>venules</b> with blood flow, and/or changes in the apparent viscosity of blood in <b>venules.</b> The hypotheses were tested by observing the response of cat sartorius muscle <b>venules</b> (7 - 200 μm diameter) during arterial pressure reduction and muscle contraction. There was no observable change in venular diameter during any of the above perturbations. There was a significant decrease in the already low normalized velocity of blood in <b>venules</b> from a mean of 13 sec⁻¹ under control conditions to 5 sec⁻¹ during arterial pressure reduction to 20 mm Hg. At very low pressures, the number of <b>venules</b> with blood flow decreased. Combining our findings with Lipowsky's (1975) in vivo viscometry data, it was predicted that resistance in <b>venules</b> would increase 100 % as a result of increases in blood viscosity when blood flow was reduced 60 %. During post-contraction hyperemia the normalized velocity of blood in <b>venules</b> increased from 16 sec⁻¹ to 38 sec⁻¹ and the number of <b>venules</b> with blood flow increased a modest amount. Combining our observations with Lipowsky's data, we predict that venular resistance would fall 54 % when blood flow increased 250 % If shear rate changes cause substantial changes in blood viscosity in <b>venules</b> as suggested by the findings cited above, hydrostatic pressure in the small <b>venules</b> should tend to remain relatively constant as flow is altered. To determine whether this is the case, pressures of <b>venules</b> were measured using the servo-null technique during arterial pressure reduction. Pressures in the larger <b>venules</b> were a linear function of blood pressure and blood flow with an intercept not significantly different from the systemic venous pressure. Pressures in the smallest <b>venules</b> studied (24 μm), however, were somewhat insensitive to alterations in blood pressure (intercept of 10. 4 mm Hg) and blood flow (intercept of 13. 2 mm Hg). The stability of pressure in 40 <b>venules</b> supports the hypothesis that variable blood viscosity maintains the pressure drop in the venous network and the capillary hydrostatic pressure somewhat constant during changes in blood flow...|$|R

In 9 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, we observed small veins (n＝ 12) and <b>venules</b> (n＝ 9). We carefully obtained access of the needle lens probe into the subepicardial small veins and <b>venules.</b> The microvascular diameter responses after superfusion of NTG were monitored for 5 min. The diameter changes of the microvessels were analyzed at end diastole. In the control condition, the phasic diameter changes of both small veins and <b>venules</b> increased from end-diastole to end-systole and the diameter changes of the vessels during cardiac cycle reached almost 10 %. Both small veins and <b>venules</b> started to dilate just after NTG. The dilation of small veins at 1 min after NTG increased to 147 ± 10 μm from control values of 131 ± 9 μm (13. 7 ± 4. 2 %, p< 0. 01), whereas the diameters of <b>venules</b> increased to 65 ± 9 μm from 60 ± 8 μm (6. 0 ± 5. 0 ％, p< 0. 05) at 1 min. However, <b>venules</b> continued to dilate, reaching their maximum dilation at 2 ～ 3 min. In conclusion, the human subepicardial microvessels were clearly visualized by the needle-probe videomicroscope.

40|$|The {{anatomic}} site of pulmonary fluid leakage in endotoxemia in rats {{was investigated}} using the {{red blood cell}} packing method and low-dose horseradish peroxidase as a tracer. To differentiate between arterioles and <b>venules</b> in a given section by light and electron microscopy, human red blood cells fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde were administered to the rat pulmonary arterial trunk at a pressure of 40 cm water. Fixed red blood cells were packed in the lumina of arteries, arterioles, and a few capillaries surrounding arterioles, while veins, <b>venules,</b> and almost all capillaries were void of red blood cells in the lumina. Fifteen minutes after the intravenous administration of 3 and 30 mg/kg of Escherichia coli endotoxin, extravascular leakage of horseradish peroxidase from <b>venules</b> (nonmuscular veins) was evident. Two hours after the intravenous injection of the same doses of endotoxin, some arterioles (nonmuscular arteries) and <b>venules</b> (non-muscular veins) showed extravascular leakage of horseradish peroxidase, while few capillaries showed this leakage.

50|$|Immediately before {{reaching}} the liver, the portal vein divides into right and left. It ramifies further, forming smaller venous branches and ultimately portal venules.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{relationships}} of retinal vascular caliber with optic disc, macular, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) characteristics as measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Design: Observational cross-sectional study. Methods: This study included a subset of healthy children enrolled in the Singapore Cohort Study of the Risk Factors of Myopia (SCORM). Optic disc, macular, and RNFL morphology were measured with Stratus OCT 3. Digital retinal photography was performed and retinal arteriolar and venular caliber measured using validated imaging software. Results: One hundred and four children (mean age 11. 51 ± 0. 52 years; 50 % male) were included. In multivariate analyses, smaller horizontal integrated rim width and rim area were associated with narrower retinal arterioles and <b>venules</b> (all P <. 05), and shorter horizontal rim length was associated with narrower <b>venules</b> (P =. 04). Optic disc diameter {{was not associated with}} arteriolar or venular caliber. Larger vertical cup-to-disc ratios and cup-to-disc-area ratios were associated with narrower <b>venules</b> but not arterioles (P =. 01 and P =. 003, respectively). A thinner average RNFL measurement was associated with narrower arterioles and <b>venules,</b> and smaller total macular volume was associated with narrower <b>venules.</b> Conclusions: Thinner optic disc rims and RNFL measurements were associated with narrower retinal arterioles and <b>venules,</b> and larger cup-to-disc ratios with narrower <b>venules.</b> These findings suggest that retinal vessel caliber varies systematically with morphologic differences in the optic nerve head, retina, and macula. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} shown that {{increases}} in intraluminal flow elicit dilation in <b>venules,</b> but the mediation of response is not yet clarified. We hypothesized that - in addition to nitric oxide (NO) and dilator prostaglandins (PGI(2) / PGE(2)) - thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) contributes to the mediation of flow-induced responses of <b>venules.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated rat gracilis muscle <b>venules</b> (259 +/- 11 microm at 10 mm Hg) dilated as a function of intraluminal flow, which was augmented {{in the presence of the}} TxA(2) receptor antagonist SQ 29, 548 or the TxA(2) synthase inhibitor ozagrel. In the presence of SQ 29, 548, indomethacin or Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl-ester decreased flow-induced dilations, whereas in their simultaneous presence dilations were abolished. The selective cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 inhibitor SC 560 reduced, whereas the selective COX- 2 inhibitor NS 398 enhanced flow-induced dilations. Immunohistochemistry showed that both COX- 1 and COX- 2 are present in the wall of <b>venules.</b> CONCLUSION: In skeletal muscle <b>venules,</b> increases in intraluminal flow elicit production of constrictor TxA(2), in addition to the dilator NO and PGI(2) /PGE(2), with an overall effect of limited dilation. These mediators are likely to have important roles in the multiple feedback regulation of wall shear stress in <b>venules</b> during changes in blood flow velocity and/or viscosity...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{microscopy}} {{was used}} to assess the relationships among shear rate (and shear stress), leukocyte rolling velocity, and leukocyte adherence in a cat mesentery preparation. Shear rate in individual <b>venules</b> and arterioles of 25 - 35 microns diameter were varied over a wide range by graded occlusion of an arterial loop. There was a linear decline in leukocyte rolling velocity (Vwbc) as red cell velocity (Vrbc) was reduced. The ratio Vwbc/Vrbc remained constant despite variations in shear stress from 5 - 25 dyn/cm 2. A reduction in shear stress was associated with an increased leukocyte adherence, particularly when Vwbc was reduced below 50 microns/s. Reduction in wall shear rate below 500 s- 1 in arterioles allowed 1 - 3 leukocytes to adhere per 100 microns length of vessel, while <b>venules</b> exposed to the same shear rates had 5 - 16 adherent leukocytes. In arterioles, leukocyte rolling was only observed at low shear rates. At shear rates less than 250 s- 1 leukocyte rolling velocity was faster in arterioles than <b>venules,</b> and the ratio Vwbc/Vrbc for arterioles was 0. 08 +/- 0. 02, which was fourfold higher than the ratio obtained in <b>venules</b> at similar shear rates. Pretreatment with the CD 18 -specific antibody (mAb) IB 4 increased leukocyte rolling velocity in <b>venules</b> by approximately 20 microns/s at red cell velocities below 2, 000 microns/s. mAb IB 4 largely prevented the leukocyte adherence to arterioles and <b>venules,</b> and increased the ratio Vwbc/Vrbc observed in <b>venules</b> at low shear elicit a CD 18 -dependent adhesive interaction between leukocytes and microvascular endothelium, and that differences in shear rates cannot explain the greater propensity for leukocyte rolling and adhesion in <b>venules</b> than arterioles...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytes home to {{peripheral}} {{lymph nodes}} (PLNs) via high endothelial <b>venules</b> (HEVs) in the subcortex and incrementally larger collecting <b>venules</b> in the medulla. HEVs express ligands for L-selectin, which mediates lymphocyte rolling. L-selectin counterreceptors in HEVs are recognized by mAb MECA- 79, {{a surrogate marker}} for molecularly heterogeneous glycans termed peripheral node addressin. By contrast, we find that medullary <b>venules</b> express L-selectin ligands not recognized by MECA- 79. Both L-selectin ligands must be fucosylated by �(1, 3) fucosyltransferase (FucT) -IV or FucT-VII as rolling is absent in FucT-IV�VII�� � mice. Intravital microscopy experiments revealed that MECA- 79 –reactive ligands depend primarily on FucT-VII, whereas MECA- 79 –independent medullary L-selectin ligands are regulated by FucT-IV. Expression levels of both enzymes paralleled these anatomical distinctions. The relative mRNA level of FucT-IV was higher in medullary <b>venules</b> than in HEVs, whereas FucT-VII was most prominent in HEVs and weak in medullary <b>venules.</b> Thus, two distinct L-selectin ligands are segmentally confined to contiguous microvascular domains in PLNs. Although MECA- 79 – reactive species predominate in HEVs, medullary <b>venules</b> express another ligand that is spatially, antigenically, and biosynthetically unique. Physiologic relevance for this novel activity in medullary microvessels {{is suggested by the}} finding that L-selectin–dependent T cell homing to PLNs was partly insensitive to MECA- 79 inhibition.
