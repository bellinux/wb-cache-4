40|$|The {{discharge}} measurement in {{river is}} the basis for using of water, planning, designing and operating water management and development projects. The traditional method of measuring the discharge is based on measurement of the water velocity and cross section area. Current meters are commonly used to determine of water velocity but they require calibration at frequent intervals in laboratory flumes to get accurate results. Because cup and propeller equipments of current meters may be physically damaged, especially river conditions. Recently, acoustics <b>velocimeters</b> are increasingly used with the advances in remote sensing and data processing techniques. There are currently several manufacturers of commercial acoustic devices but the general principles of operation are based on the Doppler shift effect which is the difference in frequency (shift) between transmitted pulses and received echoes in water.

These <b>velocimeters</b> measure fluid velocity by observing the light scattered by particles in the fluid stream. Moving fluid particulates are simulated by fine taut wires that are radially mounted on a disk that is rotated at a known velocity. The laser beam intersection locus is first aimed {{at the very center}} of the disk and then the disk is translated so that the locus is swept by the rotating wires. The radial distance traversed is precisely measured so that the velocity of the wires (pseudo particles) may be calculated...|$|R

In this case the characteristic length of the magnetic field is of the same order of magnitude as {{the dimensions of the}} channel. It must be addressed that in the case where localized magnetic fields are used, it is possible to perform local velocity measurements and thus the term Lorentz force <b>velocimeter</b> is used.|$|E
50|$|A beam {{of laser}} light {{impinging}} on a moving particle will be partially scattered {{with a change}} in wavelength proportional to the particle's speed (the Doppler effect).
