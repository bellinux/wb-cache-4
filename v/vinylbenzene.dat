50|$|Finally, the {{formation}} of cross-linked polymers involves tetrafunctional structural units. For example, in the synthesis of cross-linked polystyrene, {{a small fraction of}} monomeric styrene (or <b>vinylbenzene)</b> is remplaced by 1,4-divinylbenzene (or para-divinylbenzene). Each of the two vinyl groups is inserted into a polymeric chain, so that the tetravalent unit is inserted into both chains, linking them together.|$|E
5000|$|Divinylbenzene (DVB) {{consists}} of a benzene ring bonded to two vinyl groups. It is related to styrene (<b>vinylbenzene)</b> {{by the addition of}} a second vinyl group. [...] It is a colorless liquid is manufactured by the thermal dehydrogenation of isomeric diethylbenzenes. Under synthesis conditions, o-divinylbenzene converts to naphthalene and thus is not a component of the usual mixtures of DVB.|$|E
50|$|Styrene, {{also known}} as ethenylbenzene, <b>vinylbenzene,</b> and phenylethene, is an organic {{compound}} with the chemical formula C6H5CH=CH2. This derivative of benzene is a colorless oily liquid that evaporates easily and has a sweet smell, although high concentrations have a less pleasant odor. Styrene is the precursor to polystyrene and several copolymers. Approximately 25 million tonnes (55 billion pounds) of styrene were produced in 2010.|$|E
40|$|Cross-linked resins of poly(divinylbenzene-co-ethylvinylbenzene) were {{characterized}} and modified {{by a variety}} of reactions with the pendant <b>vinylbenzene</b> groups. Laboratory-prepared resins of a known composition were compared and contrasted to a commercial version with regard to surface area, porosity, and <b>vinylbenzene</b> content. The commercial resin, Amberlite XAD- 4 (Rohm and Haas Company), had a higher surface area (831 m 2 /g), porosity (1. 18 mL/g), and accessible <b>vinylbenzene</b> groups (2. 5 mmol/g, degree of functionalization 33 %). Modifications of both resins by radical addition of a variety of thiols led to higher conversions (of <b>vinylbenzene</b> groups to modified groups) with use of the commercial resin (as high as 76 %). Further modifications were done strictly with XAD- 4. Some thiol additions to XAD- 4 were done with water as the solvent, with conversions as high as 43 %. Disulfides were added across the <b>vinylbenzene</b> groups of XAD- 4 with iodine catalysis, with conversions as high as 55 %. This simple one-step reaction has never been done with a polymer system before. XAD- 4 was completely epoxidized using a solution of dimethyldioxirane in acetone, and completely brominated to form a resin with (1, 2 -dibromoethyl) benzene groups (3. 76 mmol Br/g). Resins with (1 -hydroxy- 2 -bromoethyl) benzene groups (1. 5 mmol/g) were prepared by reaction of XAD- 4 with N-bromosuccinimide and water, with 73 % conversion. Resins with thiol groups (2. 5 mmol S/g) were prepared by a one-pot reaction of brominated XAD- 4 with N,N-dimethylthioformamide followed by methanolysis. From one commercially-available resin, several polymers with a variety of functional groups have thus been prepared by simple one- to three-step modifications...|$|E

40|$|This work {{shows that}} the {{synthesis}} of protein plastic antibodies tailored with selected charged monomersaround the binding site enhances protein binding. These charged receptor sites are placed over a neutralpolymeric matrix, thus inducing a suitable orientation the protein reception to its site. This is confirmed bypreparing control materials with neutral monomers and also with non-imprinted template. This concepthas been applied here to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), the protein of choice for screening prostate can-cer throughout the population, with serum levels > 10 ng/mL pointing out a high probability of associatedcancer. Protein Imprinted Materials with charged binding sites (C/PIM) have been produced by surfaceimprinting over graphene layers to which the protein was first covalently attached. Vinylben-zyl(trimethylammonium chloride) and vinyl benzoate were introduced as charged monomers labellingthe binding site and were allowed to self-organize around the protein. The subsequent polymerizationwas made by radical polymerization of <b>vinylbenzene.</b> Neutral PIM (N/PIM) prepared without orientedcharges and non imprinted materials (NIM) obtained without template were used as controls. These materials were used to develop simple and inexpensive potentiometric sensor for PSA. Theywere included as ionophores in plasticized PVC membranes, and tested over electrodes of solid or liq-uid conductive contacts, made of conductive carbon over a syringe or of inner reference solution overmicropipette tips. The electrodes with charged monomers showed a more stable and sensitive response,with an average slope of - 44. 2 mV/decade and a detection limit of 5. 8 × 10 − 11 mol/L (2 ng/mL). The cor-responding non-imprinted sensors showed lower sensitivity, with average slopes of - 24. 8 mV/decade.

40|$|The absorption, blood levels, distribution, excretion, and {{biotransformation}} of styrene in man {{and experimental}} animals are briefly reviewed. The acute toxicity of styrene {{appears to be}} unrelated to its biotransformation. Reports of organ toxicity upon chronic exposure to styrene are rare; however, since the chief intermediate in styrene metabolism is an epoxide, hepatotoxicity due to covalent binding {{at the site of}} formation appears to be a possibility. Styrene (phenylethylene, <b>vinylbenzene)</b> is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis and monomer for plastics manufacture. It is a colorless, refractive, oily liquid of density d 20 = 4 0. 909. Its melting and boiling points are- 33 and 146 °C, respectively. It is sparingly soluble in water, but soluble in most organic solvents. Its vapor has a characteristic, penetrating odor, the perception of which diminishes as exposure is continued (1). Styrene may be absorbed into the bloodstream by all routes: on peroral administration or inhalation, by percutaneous absorption, or after subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration. The most common routes of absorption in industrial exposure are pulmonary and percutaneous. The ACGIH recommended threshold limit value (TLV) is 100 ppm (420 mg/m 3 of air). Blood levels of styrene that have been reported (1) in man after exposure for varying periods to air containing different concentrations of styrene are shown in Table 1. Exposures were continuous for the indicated times, except for that of 410 -min duration, which was scheduled to simulate exposure for a full working day to the TLV concentration; subjects were exposed for 3. 5 hr, given a 30 -min lunch period, and again exposed for 3. 5 hr, and blood samples were drawn 10 min {{before the end of the}} second period...|$|E
