25|$|Renin-angiotensin system (RAS): This {{system is}} {{generally}} {{known for its}} long-term adjustment of arterial pressure. This system allows the kidney to compensate for loss in blood volume or drops in arterial pressure by activating an endogenous <b>vasoconstrictor</b> known as angiotensin II.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} {{safe to use}} lidocaine with <b>vasoconstrictor</b> such as epinephrine including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers and toes. While concerns of tissue death if used in these areas have been raised evidence does not support these concerns.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasoconstrictors</b> {{are present}} in most local anesthetics, and are {{intended}} to increase the length of analgesia by reducing blood supply to the region which reduces the amount of local anesthetic solution that is absorbed into the circulation and carried from the local tissues. Hence, use of local anesthetics with <b>vasoconstrictors</b> is {{associated with an increased}} risk of dry socket occurring. However, frequently use of local anesthetic without <b>vasoconstrictors</b> would not provide sufficient analgesia, especially in the presence of acute pain and infection, meaning that the total dose of local anesthetic may need to be increased. Adequate pain control during the extraction is balanced against an increased risk of dry socket.|$|R

25|$|The {{commonly}} held belief that LA with <b>vasoconstrictor</b> can cause necrosis in extremities {{such as the}} nose, ears, fingers, and toes due to constriction of end arteries], is invalidated, since no case of necrosis has been reported since the introduction of commercial lidocaine with epinephrine in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Adrenaline {{is added}} to {{injectable}} forms {{of a number of}} local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine and lidocaine, as a <b>vasoconstrictor</b> to slow the absorption and, therefore, prolong the action of the anesthetic agent. Due to epinephrine's vasoconstricting abilities, the use of epinephrine in localized anesthetics also helps to diminish the total blood loss the patient sustains during minor surgical procedures. Some of the adverse effects of local anesthetic use, such as apprehension, tachycardia, and tremor, may be caused by adrenaline. Epinephrine/adrenaline is frequently combined with dental and spinal anesthetics and can cause panic attacks in susceptible patients {{at a time when they}} may be unable to move or speak due to twilight anesthesia. Currently the maximum recommended daily dosage for people in a dental setting requiring local anesthesia with a peripheral <b>vasoconstrictor</b> is 10µg/lb of total body weight.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{secreted}} {{from the}} enterochromaffin cells eventually {{finds its way}} out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it can serve as a <b>vasoconstrictor</b> and/or a vasodilator while regulating hemostasis and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a <b>vasoconstrictor</b> by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Additionally, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.|$|E
30|$|There is wide {{variation}} {{in the use of}} local anaesthetic and <b>vasoconstrictors</b> in pelvic floor surgery. There is a need for a robustly designed randomized controlled trial for use of local anaesthetic with and without <b>vasoconstrictors</b> in pelvic floor surgery to study outcomes like reduction in visceral injuries, reduction in operation time and postoperative analgesia requirements, as well as adverse events like tachyarrhytmias and infections.|$|R
30|$|Future {{investigations}} {{should allow}} us {{to better understand the}} mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction, such as oxidative stress, inhibition of vasodilation, and the secretion of <b>vasoconstrictors.</b> The physiopathology of microcirculation dysfunction is all the more complex as unspecific phenomena, such as inflammation, platelet activation, and microthrombi formation. In addition, <b>vasoconstrictors,</b> such as norepinephrine, may have paradoxical effects, and their impact on cerebral microcirculation has not been determined yet.|$|R
50|$|Examples include amphetamines, antihistamines and cocaine. Many {{are used}} in {{medicine}} to treat hypotension and as topical decongestants. <b>Vasoconstrictors</b> are also used clinically to increase blood pressure or to reduce local blood flow. <b>Vasoconstrictors</b> mixed with local anesthetics are used to increase the duration of local anesthesia by constricting the blood vessels, thereby safely concentrating the anesthetic agent for an extended duration, as well as reducing hemorrhage.|$|R
25|$|Serotonin, in addition, evokes endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase {{activation}} and stimulates, through a 5-HT1B receptor-mediated mechanism, the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures. In blood, serotonin is collected from plasma by platelets, which store it. It is thus active wherever platelets bind in damaged tissue, as a <b>vasoconstrictor</b> to stop bleeding, and also as a fibrocyte mitotic (growth factor), to aid healing.|$|E
25|$|In {{experiments}} with isolated sheep carotid artery, d-, l- and d,l-synephrine all showed some <b>vasoconstrictor</b> activity: l-synephrine {{was the most}} potent, producing strong contractions at a concentration of 1:10000. d-Synephrine was about 1/2 as potent as the l-isomer, but d,l-synephrine (which would {{have been expected to}} have a potency of 1/2 that of l-synephrine even if the d-isomer were completely inactive) did not produce significant and irregular contractions until a concentration of 1:2500had been reached, implying an inhibitory interaction between the two enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the confounding influence of external factors, patients undergoing infrared thermographic testing must conform to special restrictions {{regarding the use}} of certain vasoconstrictors (namely, nicotine and caffeine), skin lotions, physical therapy, and other diagnostic procedures in the days prior to testing. Patients may also be required to discontinue certain pain medications and sympathetic blockers. After a patient arrives at a thermographic laboratory, he or she is allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in a 16–20°C, draft-free, steady-state room wearing a loose fitting cotton hospital gown for approximately twenty minutes. A technician then takes infrared images of both the patient's affected and unaffected limbs, as well as reference images of other parts of the patient's body, including his or her face, upper back, and lower back. After capturing a set of baseline images, some labs further require the patient to undergo cold-water autonomic-functional-stress-testing to evaluate the function of his or her autonomic nervous system's peripheral <b>vasoconstrictor</b> reflex. This is performed by placing a patient's unaffected limb in a cold water bath (approximately 20°C) for five minutes while collecting images. In a normal, intact, functioning autonomic nervous system, a patient's affected extremity will become colder. Conversely, warming of an affected extremity may indicate a disruption of the body's normal thermoregulatory <b>vasoconstrictor</b> function, which may sometimes indicate underlying CRPS.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{inhibition}} of <b>vasoconstrictors</b> normalizes GFR in postobstructed kidneys. The present studies {{were designed to}} analyze the potential contribution of angiotensin II and thromboxane A 2 to the remarkable decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow observed after unilateral release of 24 -hour bilateral ureteral obstruction. Pretreatment of the animals with inhibitors of either thromboxane or angiotensin synthesis for 48 hours prior to and during obstruction eliminated the contribution of these <b>vasoconstrictors.</b> Inhibition of these <b>vasoconstrictors</b> {{during the period of}} obstruction results in a greater increase in renal plasma flow and GFR than when inhibition was accomplished after release of the obstruction. These data suggest a greater role for these <b>vasoconstrictors</b> in the decrease in GFR that occurs with obstruction. Simultaneous {{inhibition of}} thromboxane and angiotensin production normalized GFR of the postobstructed kidney. Administration of atrial peptide after release of obstruction in the different groups of rats resulted in further increases in GFR, urine flow and absolute sodium excretion. It is suggested that atrial peptide participates in the renal hemodynamic changes that occur in the postobstructed kidney...|$|R
25|$|Exposure {{to stress}} {{increases}} sympathetic outflow, and repeated stress-induced vasoconstriction {{may result in}} vascular hypertrophy, leading to progressive increases in peripheral resistance and blood pressure. This could partly explain the greater incidence of hypertension in lower socioeconomic groups, since they must endure greater levels of stress associated with daily living. Persons with {{a family history of}} hypertension manifest augmented <b>vasoconstrictor</b> and sympathetic responses to laboratory stressors, such as cold pressor testing and mental stress, that may predispose them to hypertension. This is particularly true of young African Americans. Exaggerated stress responses may contribute to the increased incidence of hypertension in this group.|$|E
25|$|Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone {{system is}} a major blood {{pressure}} regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as hypotension, low distal tubule sodium concentration, decreased blood volume and high sympathetic tone trigger {{the release of the}} enzyme renin from the cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone angiotensinogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten amino acid residues known as angiotensin I. ACE (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE is found in the pulmonary circulation and in the endothelium of many blood vessels. The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent <b>vasoconstrictor).</b>|$|E
25|$|The reports {{created a}} sensation. Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). It seems he adhered to contemporary ideas of organotherapy, believing that powerful substances existed in tissues {{and ought to}} be discovered for medicinal use. In fact he immediately went on to extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the bronchodilator effect, which was discovered later, but on the <b>vasoconstrictor</b> effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn cultured rat aortic {{smooth muscle}} cells, {{angiotensin}} II induced tyrosine phosphorylation {{of at least}} 9 proteins with molecular masses of 190, 117, 105, 82, 79, 77, 73, 45 and 40 kDa in time- and dose-dependent manners. Other <b>vasoconstrictors</b> such as [Arg]vasopressin, 5 -hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of {{the same set of}} proteins as angiotensin II. The tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was mimicked by the protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, phorbol 12 myristate, 13 -acetate, and the Ca 2 + ionophore, ionomycin. These results demonstrate that the <b>vasoconstrictors</b> stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells and suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation reactions are the events distal to the activation of protein kinase C and Ca 2 + mobilization in the intracellular signalling pathways of the <b>vasoconstrictors...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{duration}} of the nerve block depends {{on the type of}} local anesthetics used and the amount injected around the target nerve. There are short acting (45–90 minutes), intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and long acting anesthetics (4–18 hours). [...] Block duration can be prolonged with use of a <b>vasoconstrictor</b> such as epinephrine, which decreases the diffusion of the anesthetic away from the nerve.|$|E
50|$|Medications causing vasoconstriction, {{also known}} as <b>vasoconstrictors,</b> are one type of {{medicine}} used to raise blood pressure. Generalized vasoconstriction usually results {{in an increase in}} systemic blood pressure, but it may also occur in specific tissues, causing a localized reduction in blood flow. The extent of vasoconstriction may be slight or severe depending on the substance or circumstance. Many <b>vasoconstrictors</b> also cause pupil dilation. Medications that cause vasoconstriction include: antihistamines, decongestants, and stimulants. Severe vasoconstriction may result in symptoms of intermittent claudication.|$|R
