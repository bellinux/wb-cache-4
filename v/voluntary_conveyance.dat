5000|$|The main {{categories}} of fact situations {{giving rise to}} a presumption of a resulting trust are:- Where A makes a <b>voluntary</b> <b>conveyance</b> of property to B - Where A has made a monetary contribution to the purchase of property for B ( [...] The Venture, 1908 P 218,(1907) 77 L.J.P. 105.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Where a {{fraudulent}} conveyance is alleged, the judgment creditor {{must make a}} [...] "motion in equity" [...] to attack that conveyance. A general creditor, who has not reduced the debt owed to a judgment, must file a [...] "bill in equity" [...] with the court and must file a notice of lis pendens on the property alleged {{to have been the}} subject of a fraudulent or <b>voluntary</b> <b>conveyance.</b> The issue of whether the conveyance is one that can be upset will then be tried in court.|$|E
50|$|The {{creditor}} {{has certain}} rights {{to set aside}} fraudulent conveyances and voluntary conveyances by the debtor. A fraudulent conveyance occurs where the debtor transfers property that could otherwise be reached by the creditor {{in order to avoid}} the creditor's levy. The debtor voluntarily conveys property where he sells it for less than fair market value after becoming insolvent, or where the sale of that property itself causes the debtor to become insolvent. A creditor who is able to prove that a fraudulent or <b>voluntary</b> <b>conveyance</b> has occurred may be able to avoid or upset the conveyance, which will restore the property to the debtor's possession, from which the creditor may levy on it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Voluntary</b> <b>conveyances</b> whereby a debtor {{chooses to}} pay one {{creditor}} instead of another {{can not be}} undone, except where self dealing is involved. For example, where a corporation is insolvent, {{and one of its}} creditor's is also a controlling shareholder, that creditor can not compel the corporation to give the debts owed to him any preferential treatment.|$|R
50|$|In {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 and 1584 avoided {{fraudulent}} conveyances as against all parties and <b>voluntary</b> <b>conveyances</b> as against subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most feudal tenures into tenure by {{free and common socage}} and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (gifts by will) of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, and the laws of inheritance and dower were amended.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} a {{creditor}} to undo a fraudulent or <b>voluntary</b> <b>conveyance</b> depends on the specific type of creditor and transfer at issue. If the creditor had obtained a judgment {{at the time of}} the conveyance, then the creditor will be able to avoid it. However, a creditor that reduces the debt owed to it to a judgment only after the conveyance has occurred must prove that the conveyance was indeed fraudulent, for the purpose of defrauding creditors. This is a very difficult standard to prove, but the state does provide some statutory presumptions of fraudulent intent. In particular, a transfer between spouses or close family members is presumed to be fraudulent unless proved otherwise, as is renunciation of a gift received by a beneficiary under a will. However, a conveyance to a bona fide purchaser for fair value can not be upset where the purchaser is unaware of the fraudulent intent of the conveyor.|$|E
40|$|Following the Fourth Circuit’s panel {{decision}} in United States v. Graham, a crisp, Fourth-Amendment-breeze {{emanated from the}} Constitution as the third-party doctrine was found inapplicable to cell site location information (CSLI). The low bar of “reasonable suspicion” needed for law enforcement to obtain the cell phone data constantly stored by the nation’s cell service providers was finally challenged. That is, until Graham was reheard en banc. Constrained by precedent, the en banc rehearing reversed course and maintained the argument that CSLI is “voluntarily conveyed,” excepting it from the Fourth Amendment protections of probable cause. In light of the latest Graham decision, this Comment argues the outdated definitions for <b>voluntary</b> <b>conveyance</b> and, thus, the third-party doctrine are inapplicable to modern technology like CSLI, and urges the legislature to require a probable cause warrant before the government can obtain the peoples’ cell phone location information...|$|E
