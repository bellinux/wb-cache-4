40|$|Wave {{drag and}} shock induced {{boundary}} layer separation are important issues of flows around transonic wings. At transonic speeds the supersonic flow regime that is formed locally above wings, is terminated by a shock wave. This happens especially under offdesign flight conditions {{and results in}} a wave drag. In addition, the shock-boundary layer interaction can cause a separation of the boundary layer and can thus lead to further losses and, eventually, to buffeting. These phenomena limit the maximum economic cruise speed of airplanes. The negative effect of the transonic flow regime can be mitigated by controlling the shock terminating the supersonic region above the wing. In the past many different concepts based, for example, on passive <b>ventilation</b> (perforated plates, <b>slots,</b> grooves), active suction, contour bumps or adaptive walls have been persued [1 - 3]. Mostly, these control methods {{are based on a}} two-dimensional approach, i. e., control devices are applied unifomly along the whole span. More recently, also three-dimensional control devices have been shown to positively affect lift and drag [4 - 7]. All these approaches have in common that measures for controlling the shock are applied directly at the surface of the wing. However, a control of the shock wave is also possible by placing external devices above the surface of the wing into the supersonic flow regime. The latter concept that is related to the one of aerospikes on blunt bodies, is studied in the present paper. As in the case of flow control measures that are applied directly at the surface of a wing the basic idea of aerospikes is achieving the pressure rise across a system of oblique and normal shocks instead of across a single normal shock thus reducing wave losses. In the present investigation oblique shocks were produced by disturbing the supersonic flow above the wing. In a test series the effectiveness of a variety of different spikeshaped bodies placed above a transonic wing was tested in the DNW-TWG, G¨ottingen. In addition to pressure measurements a colour schlieren system was set up for providing information about the influence of spikes on the flow field.

However, during the design of helmets, a compromise must be made between user safety and user comfort. Accordingly, the present study proposes a novel open-face helmet design, in which the helmet features three <b>ventilation</b> <b>slots</b> in the upper-head region. Finite element analysis (FEA) models were constructed for both a prototype helmet design, and three traditional helmet designs (full-face, open-face, and half-face helmets). In simulating the proposed open-face helmet, this study considered three different ventilation slot widths, namely 8, 14, and 18 mm. The simulation results showed that of all the helmet designs, the half-face helmet resulted in the greatest headform acceleration (303 G). The internal ventilation helmet achieved a lower peak acceleration than that of the full-face helmet. By contrast, the proposed open-face helmet with <b>ventilation</b> <b>slots</b> resulted in the lowest acceleration, irrespective of the ventilation slot width. The 8 -mm ventilation slot width resulted in the optimal impact performance level (i. e., a peak headform acceleration of 160 G).

40|$|Though heating, insulation, wall {{claddings}} and cavity-wall construction {{are considered}} as measures for remediating moisture and condensation in buildings, ventilation of wall cavities has however become a mantra among architects and other building professionals. Holes {{of any size}} and shape are made and located on building facades based on the accepted wisdom that a little air movement will keep the wall cavities dry. Whilst ventilation {{has been found to}} be successful in the control of moisture and condensation in rooms and larger enclosures, there is however insufficient understanding of how it works in thin spaces with high aspect ratios, such as the wall cavities studied in this thesis. In order to put in place good control and management practices in the remediation of moisture and condensation in vertical wall cavities by natural ventilation, it is vital to understand the dynamics of airflow in these cavities. In this thesis therefore, different size and shape of slots were employed to numerically investigate the effects of size, spacing and number of the slots on the characteristics of the velocity fields (patterns of airflow and distributions of velocity) in different cavity models. The Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) methodology was employed to simulate the cavity flows under different modelling conditions using FLUENT. The BS 5925 model, an empirical relation for predicting ventilation rates in rooms and other larger enclosures, was employed and modified to predict ventilation rates in these cavities. Experimentally, the mapping of the airstreams in these cavities was obtained under similar reference (inlet) wind speeds employed for the numerical investigations. The results of this study show that there exists a potential at higher wind speeds for natural ventilation in the remediation of moisture and condensation in the cavities of vertical walls. The steady state approach employed in the RANS-based computation of cavity flows in this thesis averages out the peak values of air velocities and therefore gives no information about regions of maxima or minima velocity values even at higher wind speeds. This makes the predicted air change rates insensitive to the inlet air velocities from the <b>ventilation</b> <b>slots</b> and therefore makes the results more applicable for long term control and management of moisture in these cavities. In order to therefore put in place short, medium and long term plans for remediation of moisture in these wall cavities, a time-dependent computation is required. This will also allow the efficiency of the cavity ventilation to be properly assessed. Using the modified BS 5925 model, reasonable predictions were obtained for the air change rates of the wall cavities with the different size of <b>ventilation</b> <b>slots</b> employed. Close agreements are also obtained at lower and higher wind speeds between the predicted ventilation rates from the modified BS 5925 model and the experimental results employed as benchmark for validating the results.

40|$|To {{meet the}} {{electromagnetic}} interference regulation, the radiated emission from {{device under test}} such as electronic devices must be carefully manipulated and accurately characterized. Instead of resorting to the direct far-field measurement, in this paper, a novel approach is proposed to model the radiated emission from electronic devices placed in shielding enclosures by using the near electric field only. Based on the Schelkkunoff’s equivalence principle and Raleigh–Carson reciprocity theorem, only the tangential components of the electric field over the <b>ventilation</b> <b>slots</b> and apertures of the shielding enclosure are sufficient to obtain the radiated emissions outside the shielding box if {{the inside of the}} shielding enclosure was filled with perfectly electric conductor (PEC). In order to efficiently model wideband emission, the time-domain sampling scheme is employed. Due to the lack of analytical Green’s function for arbitrary PEC boxes, the radiated emission must be obtained via the full-wave numerical methods by considering the total radiated emission as the superposition between the direct radiation from the equivalent magnetic currents in free space and the scattered field generated by the PEC shielding box. In this study, the state-of-the-art discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method is utilized, which has the flexibility to model irregular geometries, keep high-order accuracy, and more importantly involves only local operations. For open-region problems, a hybridized DGTD and time-domain boundary integration method applied to rigorously truncate the computational domain.

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study {{is combined with}} numerical modelling to investigate new ways to reduce cross-flow vibrations of hydraulic gates with underflow. A rectangular gate section placed in a flume was given freedom to vibrate in the vertical direction. Horizontal slots in the gate bottom enabled leakage flow through the gate to enter the area directly under the gate which is known to {{play a key role}} in most excitation mechanisms. For submerged discharge conditions with small gate openings the vertical dynamic support force was measured in the reduced velocity range 1. 5 <Vr< 10. 5 for a gate with and without <b>ventilation</b> <b>slots.</b> The leakage flow significantly reduced vibrations. This attenuation was most profound in the high stiffness region at 2 <Vr< 3. 5. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed with the Finite Element Method to assess local velocities and pressures for both gate types. A moving mesh covering both solid and fluid domain allowed free gate movement and two-way fluid–structure interactions. Modelling assumptions and observed numerical effects are discussed and quantified. The simulated added mass in still water is shown to be close to experimental values. The spring stiffness and mass factor were varied to achieve similar response frequencies at the same dry natural frequencies as in the experiment. Although it was not possible to reproduce the vibrations dominated by impinging leading edge vortices (ILEV) at relatively low Vr, the simulations at high Vr showed strong vibrations with movement-induced excitation (MIE). For the latter case, the simulated response reduction of the ventilated gate agrees with the experimental results. The numerical modelling results suggest that the leakage flow diminishes pressure fluctuations close to the trailing edge associated with entrainment from the wake into the recirculation zone directly under the gate that most likely cause the growing oscillations of the ordinary rectangular gate...|$|E
