2500|$|Most railway {{carriages}} {{were constructed}} by fitting together component parts {{which had been}} roughly machined to larger dimensions than required, which were then cut to the required size and joined together by skilled coachbuilders. Reid's new method involved the use of templates or [...] "jigs" [...] to mass-produce components to a set pattern and size. Once these had been checked any example of a specific part could be used interchangeably with any other of the same type. [...] The technique was applied to any item which could be manufactured in large numbers (as there were significant costs in producing the initial jigs) such as doors, <b>ventilators,</b> <b>windows</b> and seats.|$|R

Although Harry Marks was responsible for designing a number of buildings on both the Darling Downs and in Brisbane, much of his work was in Toowoomba where he designed a variety of buildings including Rodway, St James Parish Hall, St Luke's Church Hall, additions to the Toowoomba Maltings, and the Darling Downs Co-operative Bacon Factory. Marks was also described as being gifted with inventive genius, and he devised and patented a number of architectural elements, including roof <b>ventilators,</b> <b>windows</b> and a method of stucco wall construction.|$|R

Mahoney, supt. of the street car company, informing him that street cars must be properly ventilated, and that: “It is a crime against sanitation to keep the <b>ventilators,</b> <b>windows</b> and doors closed in a street car during the entire day’s run and to compel patrons to ride in a disease incubator which is full of dust, carrying every kind of bacteria;” he stated elsewhere that police will enforce the ventilation of the street cars if the company does notNewspaper article...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The need {{to reduce}} carbon {{emissions}} and fuel poverty has led to increased building envelope air tightness, intended to reduce uncontrolled ventilation heat losses. Ventilation strategies in dwellings still allow the use of trickle <b>ventilators</b> in <b>window</b> frames for background ventilation. The extent to which this results in “healthy ” Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in recently constructed dwellings was a concern of regulators in Scotland. This paper describes research to explore this. First a review of literature was conducted, then data on occupant interactions with ventilation provisions (windows, doors, trickle vents) gathered through an interview-based survey of 200 recently constructed dwellings, and measurements made on a sample of 40 of these. The main measured parameter discussed here is CO 2 concentration. It was concluded after the literature review that 1000 ppm absolute was a reasonable threshold to use for “adequate ” ventilation.

50|$|St Peter's Church {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as an important}} 20th century building. The church's design was influenced by European and Scandinavian styles with high walls and a low-pitched tile roof and wide moulded eaves. Of particular note is the ventilation system which uses exceptionally high walls to give a large air space {{in proportion to the}} seating capacity of 100. There are both <b>windows</b> and <b>ventilators</b> but the <b>windows</b> do not open. The ventilators are designed to be opened at night to store cool night air in the roof space. The air heated by the congregation rises through grilles into the roof space and out through the gable ends allowing the cooler air to flow downwards.|$|R
50|$|The first {{indication}} of changing ideas were some very handsome corridor vehicles in 1927. For the first time, the LMS abandoned outside compartment doors in corridor coaches and introduced larger windows in their stead. At first {{there were two}} such windows in each compartment (one fixed and one frameless droplight) {{in the manner of}} the characteristic Midland pattern vestibule coaches already considered. They differed from the normal twin-window style in having frameless droplights and Stones <b>ventilators</b> over both <b>windows</b> and the style soon became adopted for other vehicles. By 1930 it had made its appearance in some composites, this time with but one Stones ventilator centrally over the window pair and with large 4 ft 6 in wide corridor side windows.|$|R

A broad gravel-walk ran from end to end of the facade, terminating in a large conservatory. In the walk were three people pacing up and down. Lady Constantine's was the central figure, her brother being on one side of her, and on the other a stately form in a corded shovel-hat of glossy beaver and black breeches. This was the Bishop. Viviette carried over her shoulder a sunshade lined with red, which she twirled idly. They were laughing and chatting gaily, and when the group approached the churchyard many of their remarks entered the silence of the church tower through the <b>ventilator</b> of the <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Revival Gothic {{church is}} of Latin cross plan form, with the {{sanctuary}} {{placed at the}} western end. External walls are of face brickwork and contain five arched windows of stained glass with small pivoting vents. The steeply-pitched gable roof is sheeted with flat pan-and-roll galvanised iron and is penetrated by dormer <b>window</b> <b>ventilators.</b> The roof structure consists of finely-proportioned hammer beam trusses which intersect above the crossing, supporting a raised lantern roof ventilator. The entrance porch is at the eastern end and leads to a foyer beneath the upper choir loft with timber screen, cast iron lace balustrading and cast iron spiral stair access. The new floor {{of the church is}} of traditional clear-finished hoop pine and walls are painted plaster. The church pews are of traditional design and appear to be original.|$|R

40|$|Among {{several factors}} that {{influence}} silk yield, insect and non-insect pests form an important component. Of the insects that attack silkworm, the most important are the tachinid parasites which {{are commonly known as}} ujiflies. There are at least four species of ujifly that attack silkworms viz., Japanese ujifly, Crossocosmia sericariae (Rondani); Hime ujifly, Ctenophorocera pavida (Meigen); Tasar ujifly, Blepharipa zebina (Walker) and the Indian ujifly, Exorista bombycis (Louis). This review discusses distribution and history, taxonomy and bio-ecology of the ujifly. Among the different management practices used, cultural methods such as exclusion, i. e. fitting fly-proof wire mesh screens to the <b>windows,</b> <b>ventilators</b> and doors of rearing rooms and securing fly proof nylon net to individual trays, are found to be the most eco-friendly and economical. Other practices {{such as the use of}} hyper parasitoids, chemicals, chemosterilants, quarantine measures and lastly the integrated management practices have also been presented...|$|R

5000|$|LMS design coaches {{continued}} to be built for several years after 1947 until {{the introduction of the}} BR standard designs. This short-lived period was, in fact, little more than a continuation of the Stanier era and was not really a new phase in the same sense that the flush sided stock itself was. Later corridor coaches have, however, been distinguished by the name [...] "Porthole" [...] stock by virtue of the circular toilet window feature which they introduced. This stock actually commenced building a year or two after 1947 and was, therefore, not strictly LMS stock as such but it was in the direct tradition of LMS coach building practice and has, therefore, been included here. It differed from the last versions of the Stanier stock proper (which themselves were built well into BR days) principally in the circular toilet windows which replaced the earlier rectangular ones, but also in having post-war torpedo ventilators and the final style of sliding <b>window</b> <b>ventilators.</b>|$|R

In the measured dwellings average bedroom CO 2 levels of 1520 ppm during occupied (night time) hours were observed. Where windows were open the average bedroom CO 2 levels were 972 ppm. With windows closed, the combination of “trickle ventilators open plus doors open” gave an average of 1021 ppm. “Trickle ventilators open” gave an average of 1571 ppm. All other combinations gave averages of 1550 to 2000 ppm. Ventilation rates and air change rates were estimated from measured CO 2 levels, for all dwellings calculated ventilation rate was less than 8 L/s/p, in 42 % of cases calculated air change rate was less than 0. 5 ach. It was concluded that trickle ventilation as installed and used is ineffective in meeting desired ventilation rates, evidenced by high CO 2 levels reported across the sampled dwellings.
