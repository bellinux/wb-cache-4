5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being a <b>valuable</b> <b>commodity,</b> Archer is {{startled by}} the lack of basic medical supplies and the run-down nature of the colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), the leader of the Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium because two pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic tell them to take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does not sit well with Archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century salt was an {{essential}} and <b>valuable</b> <b>commodity.</b> The unpopular salt tax, {{known as the}} gabelle, was collected by the Ferme Générale.

25|$|When the Portuguese began {{trading on}} the west coast of Africa, in the 15th century, they {{concentrated}} their energies on Guinea and Angola. Hoping at first for gold, they soon found that slaves were the most <b>valuable</b> <b>commodity</b> available in the region for export. The Islamic Empire was already well-established in the African slave trade, for centuries linking it to the Arab slave trade. However, the Portuguese who had conquered the Islamic port of Ceuta in 1415 and several other towns in current day Morocco in a Crusade against Islamic neighbors, managed to successfully establish themselves in the area. But the Portuguese never established much more than a foothold in either place.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} certain rare mineral {{resources}} that, because of limitations due to distance and prevalence, were also moved along these rudimentary trade networks that {{towards the end}} of the culture would begin to become more and more important to the survival of the members of this society. The most important of these minerals was salt, which is critical for human existence. Indeed, the Cucuteni-Trypillia saltworks located at the brackish spring at Lunca, Neamţ County, Romania, may very well be the oldest in the world. There is evidence to indicate that the production of this <b>valuable</b> <b>commodity</b> directly contributed to the rapid growth of the society. This saltworks was so productive that it supplied the needs of the entire region. For this to happen, the salt had to be transported, which may have marked the beginning of a trade network that developed into a more complex system over time.|$|E

25|$|Jamaica was {{the most}} {{profitable}} British possession in the New World. Its most <b>valuable</b> <b>commodity</b> was sugar; it was more valuable to the British economy than the thirteen American colonies combined. In a letter from King George III to Lord Sandwich he declared that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands {{at the risk of}} Britain herself, and this was strategy implemented in 1779. Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as tobacco. As well as the gradual expulsion of the British from the West Indies by the French and Spanish, the conquest was to force a massive blow on the British economy. The invasion itself though was perceived in the courts at Paris and Madrid {{as an alternative to the}} Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar which for two years had been a costly disaster.|$|E
25|$|The first coal to {{be shipped}} on the R went to the Rochester coal merchant, Arthur G Yates. Such was the demand for coal that the coal {{shipments}} began well before track construction had been completed, leading to constant conflict in scheduling. By 1886, the railroad had some 4,182 freight cars, and 3,028 of them were coal cars. Of those, perhaps 500 belonged to the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company. By the mid-1880s, the railroad was running forty or more coal trains a day. Since coke was a <b>valuable</b> <b>commodity,</b> the coal company built {{a mile and a}} quarter long string of 475 coke furnaces, the largest in the world at the time, producing 22,000 tons a month, some of which was shipped out by train. Much of the coke, however, was consumed on-site in refining the iron ore brought in by lakes freighter and trans-shipped to the iron mills by the coal trains on their way back south.|$|E
25|$|The {{visions of}} {{chapters}} 7–12 reflect the crisis {{which took place}} in Judea in 167–164 BC when Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Greek king of the Seleucid Empire, threatened to destroy traditional Jewish worship in Jerusalem. When Antiochus came to the throne the Jews were largely pro-Seleucid. The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked – or more accurately, paid – to be allowed to make Jerusalem a polis, or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would {{be in the hands of}} the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a <b>valuable</b> <b>commodity,</b> to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.|$|E
