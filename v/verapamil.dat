25|$|Class IV agents include <b>verapamil</b> and diltiazem.|$|E
25|$|Several medications, {{including}} <b>verapamil</b> and nifedipine, {{as well as}} ergot derivatives such as bromocriptine and pergolide, {{have been}} associated with medication-induced erythromelalgia.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} prolong the QT {{interval}} such as quinidine, <b>verapamil,</b> amiodarone, sotalol and methadone may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive QT interval prolongation.|$|E
25|$|Escitalopram is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein {{and hence}} P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as <b>verapamil</b> and quinidine may improve its blood-brain penetrability. In a preclinical study in rats combining escitalopram with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor enhanced its antidepressant-like effects.|$|E
25|$|Phenylalkylamine calcium antagonists. The {{addition}} of a calcium channel blocker of the <b>verapamil</b> type, such as gallopamil 75nbsp&mg, {{has been shown to}} further improve left ventricular functional parameters when given in combination with isosorbide mononitrate in a sustained-release formulation.|$|E
25|$|AV node {{blockers}} {{should be}} avoided in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with WPW or history of it; this includes adenosine, diltiazem, <b>verapamil,</b> other calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. They can exacerbate the syndrome by blocking the heart's normal electrical pathway (therefore favoring 1:1 atrial to ventricle conduction through the pre-excitation pathway, potentially leading to unstable ventricular arrhythmias).|$|E
25|$|For {{people with}} {{extended}} periods of cluster headaches, preventive therapy can be necessary. <b>Verapamil</b> is recommended as first line treatment. Lithium can also be useful. For people with shorter bouts, a short course of prednisone (10 days) can be helpful. Ergotamine is useful if given 1–2 hours before an attack. See cluster headaches for more detailed information.|$|E
25|$|Simvastatin is {{contraindicated}} with pregnancy, breastfeeding, {{and liver}} disease. Pregnancy must be avoided while on simvastatin due to potentially severe birth defects. Patients cannot breastfeed while on simvastatin due to potentially disrupting the infant's lipid metabolism. High doses of simvastatin are also contraindicated with the widely used antihypertensive amlodipine. A lower dose is also recommended in people taking the calcium channel blockers, <b>verapamil</b> and diltiazem, {{as well as}} those taking amiodarone.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people who}} have taken {{too much of a}} calcium channel blocker, {{especially}} diltiazem, get slow heart rate and low blood pressure. This can progress to the heart stopping altogether. CCBs of the dihydropyridine group, as well as flunarizine, predominantly cause reflex tachycardia as a reaction to the low blood pressure. For <b>verapamil,</b> despite it having a similar mechanism of action as diltiazem, both fast and slow heart rhythm are described.|$|E
25|$|Calcium channel blockers, {{also known}} as calcium channel antagonists, are widely used {{for a number of}} health conditions. Thus they are {{commonly}} present in many people's homes. In young children one pill may cause serious health problems and potentially death. The calcium channel blocker that caused the greatest number of deaths in 2010 in the United States was <b>verapamil.</b> This agent is believed to cause more heart problems than many of the others.|$|E
25|$|Digoxin {{elimination}} {{is mainly}} by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein, {{which leads to}} significant clinical interactions with P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs. Examples commonly used in patients with heart problems include spironolactone, <b>verapamil</b> and amiodarone. In patients with decreased kidney function the half-life is considerably longer, along with decrease in Vd, calling for a reduction in dose or a switch to a different glycoside, such as digitoxin (not available in the United States), which has a much longer elimination half-life of around seven days and is eliminated by the liver.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{case reports}} on sudden death {{prompted}} {{a study on}} a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like <b>verapamil</b> or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or <b>verapamil,</b> and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E

2500|$|Caution {{should be}} taken when using <b>verapamil</b> with a beta blocker due {{to the risk of}} severe bradycardia. [...] If unsuccessful, {{ventricular}} pacing should be used.|$|E
2500|$|Quinidine, <b>verapamil,</b> and {{amiodarone}} increase plasma {{levels of}} digoxin (by displacing tissue binding sites and depressing renal digoxin clearance), so plasma digoxin must be monitored carefully when coadministered.|$|E
2500|$|Calcium channel {{blockers}} {{can be used}} in {{the treatment}} of aortic dissection, particularly if a contraindication to the use of beta blockers exists. [...] The calcium channel blockers typically used are <b>verapamil</b> and diltiazem, because of their combined vasodilator and negative inotropic effects.|$|E
2500|$|The cardiac action {{potential}} {{plays an important}} role in coordinating the contraction of the heart. The cardiac cells of the sinoatrial node provide the pacemaker potential that synchronizes the heart. The {{action potential}}s of those cells propagate to and through the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles. Action potentials from the AV node travel through the bundle of His and thence to the Purkinje fibers. [...] Conversely, anomalies in the cardiac action potential—whether due to a congenital mutation or injury—can lead to human pathologies, especially arrhythmias. Several anti-arrhythmia drugs act on the cardiac action potential, such as quinidine, lidocaine, beta blockers, and <b>verapamil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Verapamil</b> is {{also used}} intra-arterially to treat {{cerebral}} vasospasm. <b>Verapamil</b> is used to treat the condition cluster headache.|$|E
50|$|The {{recommended}} first-line preventative {{therapy is}} <b>verapamil,</b> a calcium channel blocker. <b>Verapamil</b> was previously underused {{in people with}} cluster headache.|$|E
50|$|Anipamil is a {{calcium channel}} blocker, {{specifically}} of the phenylalkylamine type. This type is separate from its more common cousin Dihydropyridine. Anipamil is an analog {{of the more}} common drug <b>verapamil,</b> {{which is the most}} common type of phenylalkylamine style calcium channel blocker. Anipamil has been shown to be a more effective antiarrhythmic medication than <b>verapamil</b> because it does not cause hypertension as seen in <b>verapamil.</b> It is able to do this by bonding to the myocardium tighter then <b>verapamil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>verapamil</b> is {{generally}} avoided {{in people with}} severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), cardiogenic shock, and hypersensitivity to <b>verapamil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Verapamil,</b> a calcium-channel blocker, {{is useful}} in the {{treatment}} of hypomania and in those cases where lithium and mood stabilizers are contraindicated or ineffective. <b>Verapamil</b> is effective for both short-term and long-term treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Studies have {{compared}} AH-1058 to widely used and clinically available {{drugs such as}} <b>verapamil</b> (a Class IV antiarrhythmic drug) and atenolol (a Beta Blocker) to assess the efficacy of AH-1058. The effects of AH-1058 are slower to onset but longer-lasting than those of <b>verapamil</b> and atenolol. In addition, the minimal effects AH-1058 has on total peripheral vascular resistance is an important advantage over atenolol and <b>verapamil,</b> as these drugs an be taken long term for disease management. [...] Lastly AH-1058 displays a greater selectivity for cardiac tissue over <b>verapamil</b> and atenolol with {{the same level of}} potency as <b>verapamil</b> in vitro. AH-1058 studies have been limited to in vitro and in vivo canine and guinea-pig models, with a greater potency displayed in vitro than in vivo. Along with decreased potency in vivo, blood levels do not correlate with AH-1058 activity.|$|E
