One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint, suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated.

5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given {{that it has no}} inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E

[...] Marshall's approach is heavily influenced by the science of ecology but has been criticized as privileging one school of ecology, i.e., 'community ecology', over others such as ecosystems science, systems ecology, and the ecology of Gaia.|$|R

In that system, this experience occurs when there is complete cessation of all thought-constructs.|$|R

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{elementary}} work by Cardano, {{the doctrine of}} probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654). Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject. Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre's Doctrine of Chances (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics. See Ian Hacking's The Emergence of Probability and James Franklin's The Science of Conjecture for histories of the early development of the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> mathematical probability.|$|E

25|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Cvetkovich's book is “organized as ‘an archive of feelings,'” and is “an {{exploration}} of cultural texts as repositories of feelings and emotions, which are encoded {{not only in}} the content of the texts themselves but in the practices that surround their production and reception.” According to Cvetkovich, archives of trauma resemble the archives of gay and lesbian cultures. Not only are ephemera, ephemerality, and memory fundamental to both of these archives, but both also challenge the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the archive. Cvetkovich's sources – her archive – include oral interviews, performances, fiction, poetry, memoirs, photographs, and films. Theoretically, she engages with feminist, critical race, Marxist, and queer theory.|$|E
25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It {{has been argued}} that while {{human trafficking}} is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E

There is more to the diversity of these images, however, than simply the tactics <b>of</b> the industry—the <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> Islam’s monotheism and iconoclasm are often redefined here. Ironically, some of these images are commonly venerated in south Asia’s Muslim society and reveal a liberalism that would mock the current cartoon crisis around the Muslim world...|$|R

25|$|Ford {{created a}} massive {{publicity}} machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and advertisements {{about the new}} product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in virtually every city in North America. A {{large part of the}} success of Ford's Model T stems from the innovative strategy which introduced a large network of sales hubs making it easy to purchase the car. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to explore the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed– several years posted around 100 percent gains on the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Garofalo, pg. 94 Suffice it to say, lest we {{get lost}} in history, that the music {{that came to be}} called rock 'n' roll began in the 1950s as diverse and seldom heard {{segments}} of the population achieved a dominant voice in mainstream culture and transformed the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> what popular music was.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "The Precession of the Simulacra," [...] Baudrillard recalls a tale from {{a short story}} by Borges in which a king {{requests}} a map (i.e. a symbol) to be produced so detailed that it ends up coming into one-to-one correspondence with the territory (i.e. the real area the map is to represent); this references the philosophical <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> map-territory relation. Baudrillard argues that in the postmodern epoch, the territory ceases to exist, {{and there is nothing}} left but the map; or indeed, the <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> the map and the territory have become indistinguishable, the distinction which once existed between them having been erased.|$|R
500|$|The 20th-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger {{criticized the}} ontological {{assumptions}} underpinning such a reductive model, {{and claimed that}} it was impossible to make sense of experience in these terms. This is because, according to Heidegger, the nature of our subjective experience and its qualities is impossible to understand in terms of Cartesian [...] "substances" [...] that bear [...] "properties". Another way to put this is that the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> qualitative experience is incoherent in terms of—or is semantically incommensurable with the concept of—substances that bear properties.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the story Tomiko describes Osden's relationship with the planet, saying [...] "He had taken the fear into himself, and, accepting, had transcended it. He had given up his self to the alien, and unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil. He had learned the love of the Other and thereby had been given his whole self." [...] Osden achieves a completely empathetic relationship with the planet, [...] "both literally and figuratively in touch with the forest;" [...] which also grants him temporary goodwill towards humans, as he says [...] "Listen, I will you well" [...] before leaving his colleagues. Le Guin makes another reference to Marvell's poetry at {{the conclusion}} of the story, which refers to the notion of a planetary consciousness. Marvell's poem [...] "The Garden" [...] speaks of [...] "a green thought in a green shade"; Le Guin describes World 4470 as [...] "one big green thought." [...] Le Guin's depiction of the planetary vegetative intelligence is of something that is [...] "whole, undifferentiated and unconscious." [...] Thus, it finds the <b>very</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> other beings terrifying, and it is qualitatively different from animal intelligences.|$|E

50|$|Van Herk has {{published}} numerous works blending fiction and criticism, which {{also offer a}} complementary exploration of her relationship with place. In particular, van Herk has rooted and uprooted conceptions of the Canadian west and the far north. In 1990, she initiated a new genre she called geografictione, with Places Far From Ellesmere. As a travel narrative that analyzes the <b>very</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> both travel and narrative, Places Far From Ellesmere questions the mapping of works of fiction, {{as well as the}} journeys that take place within fiction itself, most notably Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. Van Herk wrote the afterword for the 1990 New Canadian Library edition of Marian Engel's novel Bear.|$|R
