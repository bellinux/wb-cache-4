500|$|Investigators {{discovered}} an impurity and fatigue {{crack in the}} disk. Titanium reacts with air when melted, which creates impurities which can initiate fatigue cracks like that found in the crash disk. To prevent this, the ingot that would become the fan disk was formed using a [...] "double vacuum" [...] process: the raw materials were melted together in a vacuum, allowed to cool and solidify, then melted in a vacuum once more. After the double <b>vacuum</b> <b>process,</b> the ingot was shaped into a billet, a sausage-like form about 16 inches in diameter, and tested using ultrasound to look for defects. Defects were located and the ingot was further processed to remove them, but some contamination remained.

Surveys in 1996 – 98 produced 64 data points. These were taken from 54 sites, and involved 57 timber pre-treatment process operators. Of the data, 38 related to copper chromium arsenic preservative used in vacuum-pressure processes, 19 to solvent-based preservative in double <b>vacuum</b> <b>processes</b> and 7 to water-based preservative in double <b>vacuum</b> <b>processes.</b> Treatment cycle times, preservative concentrations, treatment load sizes and quantities of preservative used per cubic metre of timber are reported. Preservative deposition patterns were similar for all treatments, with about 90 % on the legs, {{and most of the}} remainder on the arms and chest.

50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>process</b> used at New Cheshire {{was more}} {{expensive}} than that used by other British manufacturers, as well as European manufacturers exporting to the UK.

40|$|Voids in {{solder joints}} are {{representing}} {{one of the}} main problems especially for power electronics. A low and homogeneous thermal resistance of solder joints is demanded for a quick and uniform conduction of the heat loss from the power chip. The same applies for the electrical conductivity of solder joints. Enclosed voids can cause a displacement of electrical and thermal paths and a local concentration of power and heat. In addition, gas voids are anxious to form spheres in the solder gap, which could be a cause for tilting of chip components and a wedge-shaped solder gap. This is tightening the problem of patchy distribution of current or heat and is causing stress and cracks. The amount of voids can be influenced by different measures, e. g. a good wettability of metallization, solder pastes with special adopted solvents and an adequate preheating profile. However, a special <b>vacuum</b> <b>process</b> step during soldering is demanded for absolutely void free solder joints. But this <b>vacuum</b> <b>process</b> is associated with some essential disadvantages. Besides of the technical expenses for vacuum pumps and additional locks, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>process</b> excludes the use of gas convection for heating and cooling. Apart from a special vapour phase-vacuum technology, most machines are using infrared radiation or heat conduction for soldering. The same principles as used in vacuum soldering technology are applicable also for a higher pressure level. If the void in the solder joint is arising for an excess pressure, the normal atmosphere pressure could be sufficient for escaping of enclosed gas. Essential for this effect is the pressure difference between inside and outside of solder joint. A benefit of soldering with excess pressure is the possibility of gas convection for heat transfer. This allows the application of conventional components and the realization of the usual temperature distribution and profiles...|$|E
