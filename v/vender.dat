500|$|BUF Compagnie {{served as}} the lead visual effects <b>vender</b> working on the film, with Digital Domain also {{providing}} work on the film. Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by Hubble photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by J. M. W. Turner to Digital Domain when creating Jotunheim. Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of Fuel VFX, said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifröst would look like, [...] "You can't Google what these things look like—they are totally imagined and within {{the heads of the}} stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifröst and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo. In the film, Odin enters {{what is known as the}} [...] "Odinsleep" [...] in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, [...] "For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space".|$|E
40|$|This paper's aim is {{to clarify}} the {{subsistence}} structure of processed and frozen food <b>venders</b> for school meals. The conclusions are as follows: 1) Processed and frozen foods are used for school meals all year round including the period when local products are in season. 2) The <b>venders</b> sell processed and frozen foods not only to school but also to restaurants and retailers. The prices at which <b>venders</b> sell school meals is decided by tender, and the terms of validity vary from one month to one year. The procurement price from factories fluctuates in line with raw product yields and the exchange rate, and <b>venders</b> take on the risks of such price fluctuation. The approximate volume of orders from schools is decided {{at the time of}} tender and the volume is fixed one week before delivery. The factories, however, need to put raw materials into production before they can receive a definite order, so the <b>venders</b> must order an estimated volume from factories. Thus the processed and frozen food <b>venders</b> subsist by taking on the risks of price and volume fluctuations between the school meals and factories...|$|R

6000|$|Then my cab-driver {{showed me}} {{business}} blocks gay with signs and studded with fantastic and absurd advertisements of goods, and {{looking down the}} long street so adorned, {{it was as though}} each <b>vender</b> stood at his door howling:--"For the sake of my money, employ or buy of me, and me only!" ...|$|E

60|$|Thither {{one morning}} the <b>venders</b> leisurely convened, {{bringing}} their wares with them. A porch or platform six feet wide encircled the building, shaded from the mid-morning sun by the projecting, grass-thatched roof.

6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of being a <b>vender</b> of broken diamonds, {{and there is nothing}} {{suspicious}} about honest labor. The object of my present endeavors was to reach England, and I journeyed northward. It was nearly a month after I had entered France that I was at a little village on the Garonne, repairing a stone wall which divided a field from the road, and I assure you I was very glad to get this job.|$|E
60|$|The {{imaginary}} pedlar entered, {{and placed}} his box on a table near which I was standing, the whole party immediately gathering around it. My presence had attracted no particular attention from either Seneca or his sister, the room being public, and my connexion with the <b>vender</b> of trinkets known. In the mean time, Seneca was too full of his good news to let the subject drop; while the watches, rings, chains, brooches, bracelets, &c. &c., were passed under examination.|$|E

Heedless of wet or dry as it lay in his path, with arms swinging to and fro, and with his head bent forward of his body several inches, Harvey Birch approached the piazza, with a gait peculiarly his own. It was the quick, lengthened pace of an itinerant <b>vender</b> of goods.|$|E

60|$|Clement, the Hungarian forger, <b>vender</b> {{of false}} state-secrets, is well hanged; {{went to the}} gallows (18th April, 1720) with much circumstance, just two days before that Heidelberg Church was got reopened. But the suspicions sown by Clement cannot quite be {{abolished}} by the hanging of him: Forger indisputably; but who knows whether he had not something of fact for his? What with Clement, what with this Heidelberg business, the Court of Berlin has fallen wrong with Dresden, with Vienna itself, and important clouds have risen.|$|E

6000|$|However, it {{was with}} a {{depressed}} spirit that Whistling Dick passed the old French market on his chosen route down the river. For safety's sake he still presented to the world his portrayal of the part of the worthy artisan on his way to labour. A stall-keeper in the market, undeceived, hailed him by the generic name of his ilk, and [...] "Jack" [...] halted, taken by surprise. The <b>vender,</b> melted by this proof of his own acuteness, bestowed a foot of Frankfurter and half a loaf, and thus the problem of breakfast was solved.|$|E
60|$|And then a stall-fed cop shoved {{himself through}} the {{congregation}} of customers. The <b>vender,</b> plainly used to having his seasons of trade thus abruptly curtailed, closed his satchel and slipped like a weasel through the opposite segment of the circle. The crowd scurried aimlessly away like ants from a disturbed crumb. The cop, suddenly becoming oblivious {{of the earth and}} its inhabitants, stood still, swelling his bulk and putting his club through an intricate drill of twirls. I hurried after Kansas Bill Bowers, and caught him by an arm.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a greater}} {{disaster}} {{to be recorded}} next day. A workingman in the square, looking about him for a pipe-light, espied the paper frisking near the curb-stone. He picked {{it up with the}} obvious intention of lighting it at the stove of a wandering <b>vender</b> of hot chestnuts who had just crossed the square. The workingman followed, twisting the paper as he went, when--good luck again--a young butcher almost ran into him, and the loafer, with true presence of mind, at once asked him for a match. At any rate a match passed between them; and, to my infinite relief, the paper was flung away.|$|E
