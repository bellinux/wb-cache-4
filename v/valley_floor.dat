5|$|The {{earliest}} tombs {{were located}} in cliffs {{at the top of}} scree slopes, under storm-fed waterfalls (KV34 and KV43). As these locations were filled, burials descended to the <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> gradually moving back up the slopes as the valley bottom filled with debris. This explains the location of the tombs KV62 and KV63 buried in the <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E

5|$|The {{geography}} in {{the area}} affects the local climate of the city with the Aarhus Bay imposing a temperate effect on the low-lying <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> where central Aarhus is located. Brabrand Lake to the west further contributes to this effect {{and as a result}} the valley has a very mild, temperate climate. The sandy ground on the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> dries up quickly after winter and warms faster in the summer than the surrounding hills of moist-retaining boulder clay. These conditions affect crops and plants that often bloom 1–2 weeks earlier in the valley than on the northern and southern hillsides.|$|E
5|$|Igneous {{activity}} {{associated with}} this stretching occurred from 12million to 4million years ago. Sedimentation is concentrated in valleys (basins) from material eroded from adjacent ranges. The amount of sediment deposited has roughly kept up with this subsidence, resulting in retention of {{more or less the}} same <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> elevation over time.|$|E
5|$|In the Preclassic {{period the}} floor of the Copán Valley was undulating, swampy and prone to {{seasonal}} flooding. In the Early Classic, the inhabitants flattened the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> and undertook construction projects to protect the architecture of the city from the effects of flooding.|$|E

5|$|Based on Apollo 17 observations, the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> is {{generally}} a gently rolling plane. Boulders {{of various sizes}} and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley. At the ALSEP lunar experiment deployment area, located west of the immediate landing site, the boulders average about four meters in size and are higher in concentration than {{in other areas of}} the valley.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|Rocks sampled in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Lunar Module are mostly vesicular coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of the <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> as displayed in observations of {{the immediate}} landing area, is predominately regolith and fragments varying in sizes excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
50|$|Braided meltwater streams heavily {{loaded with}} rock debris {{continually}} shift and intertwine their channels over <b>valley</b> <b>floors.</b> <b>Valley</b> trains are built up as streams drop quantities of poorly sorted sediment. Valley trains are long, narrow accumulation of glacial outwash, confined by valley walls.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that swamps such as these formed around 15,000 years ago. The Blue Mountain swamps exist within low‐lying sites on <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> (<b>valley</b> swamps) and also as hanging swamps which occur on steep hillsides and around the headwaters of creeks.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that Tragöß was already {{inhabited}} by the ancient Celts. The centuries that followed the collapse, in western Europe, of the Roman empire was marked by a period of large scale migrations, and by the sixth century the Tragöß area was inhabited by Slavs, who made their homes not on the <b>valley</b> <b>floors,</b> but on the slopes that overlooked them. Bavarii and Franks followed in the ninth century, settling {{for the most part}} the fertile ground of the <b>valley</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|The area is not {{prominent}} on Brighton's skyline, {{but good}} views are possible from its streets, especially westwards and southwestwards towards {{the sea and}} across the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> in which Old Steine and the old town are situated.

5|$|A mile east of Highway 133, the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> widens, {{filled with}} farms and subdivisions {{as the road}} gently trends to the south. Five miles (8km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County. Subdivisions begin to {{increase}} in the surrounding valley and the road soon turns to the south again as it passes a built-up area and then crosses the Roaring Fork. A {{mile and a half}} after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large massifs surrounding the valley and basalt underlying the <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E
50|$|The park {{consists}} {{of the two major}} valley systems of the Kidepo and Narus Rivers. The <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> lie between 3000 ft and 4000 ft AMSL.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to rock covered glaciers around mesas, {{the region has}} many steep-walled valleys with lineations—ridges and grooves—on their floors. The material comprising these <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> is called lineated valley fill. In {{some of the best}} images taken by the Viking Orbiters, some of the valley fill appeared to resemble alpine glaciers on Earth. Given this similarity, some scientists assumed that the lineations on these <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> might have formed by flow of ice in (and perhaps through) these canyons and valleys. Today, it is generally agreed that glacial flow caused the lineations.|$|R

5|$|From Pendre, {{the railway}} passes over a gated level {{crossing}} and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge {{and on to}} Hendy, the first of five minor halts, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the <b>valley</b> <b>floor,</b> although this is {{where some of the}} steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The ruling gradient of the line is 1 in 60.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th {{or early}} 7th century a natural {{disaster}} caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried {{the surface of the}} site under a deep layer of silt, completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, {{and it was one of}} the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.|$|E
5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} <b>valley</b> <b>floor</b> became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton {{spent much of his}} youth in the 1870s studying animal life.|$|E

50|$|The {{topography}} {{of the division}} is characterized by flat-topped hills of uniform height divided by shallow valleys forming papyrus swamps. Most of the streams flow into Lake Victoria. The streams are characterized by low gradient and comparatively broad <b>valley</b> <b>floors.</b> Owing to alluvial aggregation, low gradient, and frequent local silting, many <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> have become seasonal or permanent swamps. The soil geology from which the soils of the corridor formed belongs to the Basement Complex. It consists {{of a variety of}} metamorphic largely granitoid rocks, acid gneisses, schists and sand stones. Most of these rocks are highly weathered.|$|R
50|$|This species {{grows on}} <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> in heavy clay soils. The habitat is prairie, pasture, and {{the edges of}} woodlands. Other plants in the habitat may include tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and California oatgrass (Danthonia californica).|$|R
5|$|Yosemite Valley {{represents}} only {{one percent of}} the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, {{is one of the most}} popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise , respectively, above the <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zaculeu {{is located}} {{in an area of}} fertile soils close to the Selegua and Viña rivers. The site is {{situated}} on a plateau overlooking the Selegua River, which flows {{to the west of the}} city. Deep ravines bordering the site to the south and east protected its access. The only access to the site is via a narrow land bridge to the north which unites the plateau to the general level of the <b>valley</b> <b>floor.</b> The Zaculeu plateau measures 11,178 square varas (4191 square metres).|$|E
5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin <b>Valley</b> <b>floor</b> is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{landscape}} of the Aller valley between Celle and Verden is mainly utilised as grassland. The Aller depression there comprises <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> lying close to the watertable, so that fertile wet areas may be found here with rich habitats for flora and fauna. The landscape is characterised by oxbows, potholes, copses and rows of bushes. The <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> are widened by the depressions of the tributaries flowing into to the Aller, so that fens and bogs can form. Around the lower reaches crops are cultivated on the clay soils. Around the upper course of the river, many pine forests are managed on the sandy soils.|$|R
50|$|The {{area has}} Mojave Desert {{plants such as}} Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) and {{creosote}} bush (Larrea tridentata) on the <b>valley</b> <b>floors</b> and alluvial fans and in the Sierra foothills. Higher Sierra elevations have single-leaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla).|$|R
