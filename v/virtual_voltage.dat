40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved direct torque control (DTC) method for an asymmetrical six-phase induction motor using a two-level six-phase inverter. As is well-known, a simple extension of three-phase direct torque control technique to an asymmetrical six-phase motor, using large vectors only, introduces significant current harmonics {{of the order}} 6 n± 1 (n = 1, 3, 5,…), which are mapped into the non-flux/torque producing (xy) plane. These harmonics cause only losses in the motor winding as they do not take part in torque production. Hence {{a number of different}} improved DTC techniques have been developed in the past for multiphase motor drives. The paper takes one such DTC method as the starting point and improves it further by using the concept of <b>virtual</b> <b>voltage</b> vectors. Developed vector selection algorithm, based on two <b>virtual</b> <b>voltage</b> vectors, requires the information on position of the flux in the auxiliary (xy) subspace and provides stator current quality commensurate with the currently available best DTC algorithm for six-phase drives. However, use of two <b>virtual</b> <b>voltage</b> vectors enables a substantial reduction of the torque ripple, which is achieved by means of a five-level torque comparator. Extensive experimentation is performed and it is shown that the reduction of the current harmonics is in essence almost the same as in another recently developed DTC scheme, based on the use of a single <b>virtual</b> <b>voltage</b> vector. However, the achieved torque ripple reduction, which is verified experimentally, makes the scheme superior when compared to the existing approaches. At the same time, developed scheme retains qualities of conventional DTC schemes, such as simple structure and fast response. Its additional beneficial feature is the easiness of implementation...|$|E

30|$|The {{magnitude}} of the required <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> is controlled {{on the basis of}} wind profile and DFIG operation, i.e., slip value. Figure  11 gives the simulation results representing the corresponding value of <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> with respect to time. <b>Virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> of the proposed modified matrix converter topology is controlled referring the wind profile. When DFIG is operating near to the synchronous speed, the required value of the <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> is null or the least minimum.

40|$|Two {{difficulties}} {{have long}} troubled the field theory of dielectric solids. First, when two electric charges are placed inside a dielectric solid, the force {{between them is}} not a measurable quantity. Second, when a dielectric solid deforms, the true electric field and true electric displacement are not work conjugates. These difficulties are circumvented in a new formulation of the theory in this paper. Imagine that each material particle in a dielectric is attached with a weight and a battery, and prescribe a field of virtual displacement and a field of <b>virtual</b> <b>voltage.</b> Associated with the virtual work done by the weights and inertia, define the nominal stress as the conjugate to the gradient of the virtual displacement. Associated with the virtual work done by the batteries, define the nominal electric displacement as the conjugate to the gradient of <b>virtual</b> <b>voltage.</b> The approach does not start with Newton’s laws of mechanics and Maxwell–Faraday theory of electrostatics, but produces them as consequences. The definitions lead to familiar and decoupled field equations. Electromechanical coupling enters the theory through material laws. In the limiting case of a fluid dielectric, the theory recovers the Maxwell stress. The approach is developed for finite deformation, and is applicable to both elastic and inelastic dielectrics. As applications of the theory, we discuss material laws for elastic dielectrics, and study infinitesimal fields superimposed upon a given field, including phenomena such as vibration, wave propagation, and bifurcation...|$|E

40|$|Row-based power-gating has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} meet-in-the-middle sleep transistor insertion paradigm between cell-level and block-level granularity, in which each layout row defines the unit of gating, and different rows can be clustered and share the same sleep transistor. Previous works, however, assume {{the availability of a}} single <b>virtual</b> ground <b>voltage,</b> thus making the decision of whether to gate or not a given cluster a binary choice: a cluster is either gated or not. In this work, we consider a limited set of <b>virtual</b> ground <b>voltages,</b> which allows us to assign to a cluster the <b>virtual</b> ground <b>voltage</b> that offers the best leakage-performance tradeoff for that cluster. We propose two algorithms for solving two power-gating variants: one in which the entire design is gated (given an allowable delay degradation), and another one in which only a subset of the rows is gated (given an allowable delay degradation and sleep transistor area). Our algorithm automatically finds the set of clusters with optimal <b>virtual</b> ground <b>voltages</b> so as to minimize leakage while respecting timing and area constraints. The number of power-gating domains can be user-bounded, in accordance with power grid or library characterization limitations.

This reduces the voltage stress across the power electronic switches; as a result, the operational losses are reduced.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{technology}} {{moving into the}} deep sub- 100 -nm region, the increase of leakage power consumption necessitates more aggressive power reduction techniques. Power gating is a promising technique. Our research emphasizes that with the latest and future technologies, power gating operates frequently in its transition mode, especially for aggressive leakage reduction. The dynamic characteristics of power gating during its mode transition is critical for making design decision. Hence we derive a fast, accurate, and temperature-aware model to characterize the dynamic behavior of power gating during mode transition. The applications of this model include the estimation of several key design parameters for power gating, such as dynamic <b>virtual</b> ground <b>voltage,</b> dynamic leakage variation and energy break-even time. It provides an efficient estimation engine for power gating design optimization. The accuracy of the model has been verified by extensive HSPICE experiments.

40|$|The {{three-phase}} two-level {{voltage source}} converter (VSC) is widely employed in power conversions between AC and DC for its four-quadrant operation and control flexibility. However, it {{suffers from the}} low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side voltage-doubling VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, {{only half of the}} DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a <b>virtual</b> <b>voltage</b> source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the negative bus (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement). Modeling and control design for both rectifier and inverter modes of this converter in synchronous reference frame have been investigated to ensure a four-quadrant three-phase back-to-back system.

30|$|In this paper, {{due to the}} {{abovementioned}} factors, {{the space}} vector modulation technique is adopted with matrix converter for wind energy conversion system. Higher switching loss is the major drawback of the matrix converter application. Also, the wind profile changes, and the switching and conduction of engaged PEC is also affected. In this paper, a modified matrix converter topology using space vector modulation is proposed which have low conduction losses and switching losses. In addition, the voltage stress across the semiconductor devices of power converter is also reduced even though the wind profile is fluctuating. The proposed topology also reduces common mode voltage (CMV) hence low thermal stress on the winding of DFIG. This approach has the advantages like low switching and conduction losses, mitigation of common mode voltage, and overall improvement in the efficiency {{and the performance of}} the wind energy conversion system. For this purpose, the <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> of the modified converter topology is controlled according to the speed of DFIG and is kept at value of required rotor voltage.

30|$|The {{input and}} output current {{waveforms}} of proposed modified matrix converter topology show no significant deterioration. Although minor deterioration in both {{input and output}} current waveforms is observed at initial instant, but it {{is found to be}} improving very fast as shown in the result. Comparing Figures  14 and 15 for input current, it is found that the performance is improved. Similarly for output current, the improvement can be recognized by comparing Figures  16 and 17. This is achieved using proposed technique; hence, improved power quality is achieved. It is observed that for reduced <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> operation, the input current ripple is slightly higher than the current ripple when maximum <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> is generated. This has been taken in account while designing of the input filter. Designed filters connected with matrix converter ensure that no sub-harmonics are introduced to the system and provide unity power factor at line side with no harmonic current injection. This ensures the variable wind speed operation of DFIG with more reliable and economical performance. It is also observed that input and output current of the matrix converter are at unity power factor. Harmonic content is largely minimized and the power quality is improved. Thus, there is a significant improvement in the performance of matrix converter, DFIG and overall wind energy conversion system.|$|R

Continuous observation of DFIG speed is performed and close loop feedback is to be obtained. Matrix converter connected between the rotor of DFIG and grid fed power to the rotor of DFIG during sub synchronous operation. During super synchronous operation condition, the power is fed to the grid from rotor of DFIG is known as slip power recovery. During the operation when power is fed from grid to rotor of DFIG, a high-voltage stress continues across the switches of PEC (Ugalde-Loo et al. 2013; Blaabjerg et al. 2012; Garcés and Molinas 2012; Ashfaq and Tripathi 2012; Soufi et al. 2013). Hence high dc voltage exists; this is also a factor responsible for the CMV. The CMV causes the over voltage stress to the winding insulation of DFIG and increased thermal losses. CMV is dependent on the <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> of the proposed power electronic converter. If the <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> of the proposed converter is changed, the CMV will also change (Lee and Sul 2001; Swamy et al. 2001; Wei et al. 2004; Holmes 1996; Lee et al. 2010; Yue et al. 2006; Arifujjaman 2013; Ponmani and Rajaram 2013).

Due to this increase in on loss, off loss and conduction loss in power electronic switch and CMV effect in DFIG are observed with fluctuations in wind profile. CMV may cause machine winding insulation failure and bearing deterioration. To reduce the CMV, small and medium positive line to line voltage is employed to generate dc link voltage in rectifier stage, and suitable zero vector is chosen during inverter stage. Hence, the <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> of the converter is controlled to neutralize the impact of variation in wind velocity.|$|R

Switching losses are required to be reduced for performance enhancement. In case of the forced commutation, the losses are high. In this paper for the reduction of the losses and increase of switching frequency, a combination of the continuous and discontinuous modulation and distribution of the clamping segment in accordance to the load phase angle is proposed.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} work in {{this paper}} is replacing the power electronic converter with modified matrix converter with control of <b>virtual</b> dc link <b>voltage</b> as per the DFIG operation which is wind profile dependent. The net power converter losses have been reduced even with higher switching frequency. Reduced converter losses lower the thermal stresses across the switches. The common mode voltage peak value also decreases regardless of the output frequency. The inverter mode switching sequence affects the CMV, but the effect is not significant. Due to reduced CMV peak value, the leakage current through parasitic capacitor between stator core and stator winding reduces resulting in low thermal stress in DFIG windings.
