5000|$|The 431-cubic-inch {{displacement}} 1938-40 Cadillac V16 {{was one of}} {{the last}} new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead valves. Luxury car drivers presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional <b>V</b> <b>belt</b> drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds.

30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} discuss the {{development}} of the field of tribology, and highlight some of the main problems encountered in this area, such as lack of systematicness, loose correlation, and inadequate focus on the microscopic perspective. Then, we provide basic formulas of frictional mechanics while considering the friction effect on classical mechanics formulae. In order to carry out the frictional mechanics analysis, we first classify the interface. According to the size analysis of surface films, the manufacturing roughness of the surface, the contact width, and the roller radius of the rolling contact bearing, frictional mechanics has the features of interface mechanics, while interfaces are classified based on {{the presence or absence of}} a medium. Based on the classification, we further analyze the pressure and frictional stress of sliding and rolling friction problems without a medium, such as a slider, wedge key, and <b>V</b> <b>belt.</b> We also analyze problems with a medium, such as journal and rolling contact bearings. By comparing these results with those of classical mechanics without considering friction, we see that (1) friction causes deviations in the result for classical mechanics which does not consider friction, and (2) if the frictional stress and normal pressure affect each other, their interaction should be considered simultaneously. Finally, we summarize the friction problems, namely, sliding and rolling, with and without a medium, and deformed and non-deformed. From our analysis, we propose two conclusions. First, the frictional mechanics problem is a deviation of the classical mechanics problem, and secondly, frictional stress and normal pressure influence each other.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Iran {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{producers}} of almonds. According to the statistics released by FAO (2011), Iran with more than 110000 tons of almonds is the third in rank throughout the world. However, most Iranian almonds are presented as an unsorted and unpackaged product. Some producers sort their products by hand which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. So, there is an essential need for suitable grading and packaging machines especially for the export of almond kernels. Grading, which is sometimes called sorting, is basically separating the material in different homogenous groups according to its specific characteristics like size, shape, color and on the basis of quality. Weighing {{is one of the}} best methods for grading agricultural products based on size, but due to its high cost and complexity of operations, usage of weigh size sorting machines is practically limited. So, sizing of most agricultural products is accomplished based on their dimensional attributes such as diameter, length, thickness or a combination of them. Field study shows that recently vibrating sizing machines are used for grading almond kernels. This type of sizing machine is huge, expensive, noisy and it consumes a lot of energy. Thus, the main objective of the present study was the design, development and evaluation of a new prototype of an almond kernel sizing machine. Materials and methods: It is important that the machine could resolve defects of existing vibrating machines. It should provide efficient and cost effective sizing for a wide range of kernel sizes and shapes. Furthermore, it should be of simple construction and be able to accept manual feeding. Previously conducted experiments showed that the thickness of the kernel is the most appropriate dimension for its sizing. Among the different types of dimensional sizing machines, the divergent roller grader which grades the products based on their thickness is considered to be one of the simplest options. So, a divergent roller grader was developed and built in this research. The prototype consisted of two diverging rotating rollers which were made of mild steel with an outside diameter of 95 mm and a length of 700 mm. They were mounted to provide an adjustable slope towards the wide opening end. These roller beds were fixed on a box shaped frame of size 500 × 1000 × 1200 mm. The slope and counter-rotating action of the rollers encouraged the kernels to continue moving toward the end where the gap between the rollers was the widest. A tray was fixed at the feeding end of the machine for feeding the kernels. A provision was given to adjust the gap from a minimum to a maximum level. Based on the required activate torques of the rollers, an electric 74 W motor was selected to drive the machine. The power transmission mechanism consists of two pulleys 150 and 250 mm diameters and a <b>V</b> <b>belt</b> type A with a length of 1448 mm. The center distance of the pulleys is calculated to be 410 mm. Standard criterions of weighted sorting error index (C ̅_R), weighted sorting efficiencies index (EW) and operation capacity (Q) were used to evaluate the machine. Practical analysis showed that the machine’s performance is influenced mainly by the slope of the rollers, the rotation speed of the rollers, and the feeding rate of the product. In order to evaluate the performance of the prototype, a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications for each test was done. The performance evaluation was carried out for three levels of feeding rates (600, 1000, and 1400 kg 8 h- 1, three levels of slopes (2, 7, and 12 degree), and three rotation speeds of rollers (50, 80, and 110 rpm). Spreadsheet software MSTATC and SPSS were used to analyze the data and the Duncan's multiple range tests were used to compare the means. Results and discussion: Analysis of variance showed that all three studied factors have significant effects on evaluating standard criterions of C ̅_R, EW, and Q at the 1...|$|E
