5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. <b>Vertical</b> <b>speed</b> changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} an {{investigation}} are presented that are concerned with the feasibility of employing a weather radar to make precise measurements of the properties of a precipitating cloud. A schematic cloud is proposed as a model for interpreting the interaction of the radar energy with the cloud. Point values of the liquid-water concentration are estimated from measurements of the received power. The measurements were made under conditions which minimized errors arising from attenuation of the radar signal and a radar beam which is not completely filled with raindrops. A continuity equation for liquid-water concentration is developed. The <b>vertical</b> <b>speeds</b> at the core of convective clouds are related to the spatial and temporal variations of the liquid-water content by means of this equation. The version of the continuity equation developed in this study represents an improvement over forms used previously. The new version accounts for the downward development of a radar echo at speeds faster than the fall speed of raindrops. This echo development is caused by the coalescence mechanism. An error analysis is performed and it indicates that the percentage error of the measurements of the liquid-water concentration may be as much as 102. 4 %. The fractional error of the <b>vertical</b> <b>speeds</b> is + 1391. 4 % which results from the compounding of the experimental errors of the terms in the continuity equations. To check the estimated magnitudes of the experimental errors a case study was performed. The echoes of 23 convective clouds were studied and 695 observations of liquid-water concentration were obtained. The observed magnitudes indicate that these estimates are of the correct order. The values of <b>vertical</b> <b>speeds</b> also indicate that the estimated error of this quantityis indeed large. Possible methods for reducing the experimental errors are considered. This examination indicates that reasonably accurate measurements of liquid-water concentration can be made if high experimental standards are maintained. The use of calibrating instruments which are very accurate together with good experimental control may permit a reduction of the percentage error to less than 2 O%. However, this study indicates that attempts to measure <b>vertical</b> <b>speeds</b> accurately by use of the continuity equation may not be too successful...|$|R

25|$|The static ports {{are vital}} to the {{operation}} of virtually all of those flight instruments that provide basic aerodynamic data such as airspeed, altitude and <b>vertical</b> <b>speed,</b> {{not only to the}} pilots but also to the aircraft's computers, which provide additional functions such as warnings when flight characteristics approach dangerous levels.

25|$|Faced {{with the}} lack of {{reliable}} basic flight instrument readings, constant contradictory warnings from the aircraft's flight computer (some of which were valid and some of which were not) and believing that they were at a safe altitude, 58-year-old Captain Eric Schreiber Ladrón de Guevara, a veteran pilot who had logged almost 22,000 flight hours, and 42-year-old First Officer David Fernández Revoredo, who had logged almost 8,000 flight hours, decided to begin descent for the approach to the airport. Since the flight was at night over water, no visual references could be made to convey to the pilots their true altitude or aid their descent. As a consequence of the pilots' inability to precisely monitor the aircraft's airspeed or <b>vertical</b> <b>speed,</b> they experienced multiple stalls, resulting in rapid loss of altitude with no corresponding change on the altimeter. While the altimeter indicated an altitude of approximately 9,700 feet, the aircraft's true altitude was in fact much lower.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that the aircraft {{was the subject of}} a large number of complaints by pilots, called write-ups in the aviation industry. The highest number of complaints concerned the captain's side <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicator, which informs the air crew of the rate (in ft/min: Feet Per Minute) at which the aircraft is ascending or descending. In all, 48 complaints were made regarding the instrument in the three months before the crash. The aircraft's left right inertial reference system, which informs pilots what direction the aircraft is turning in, was complained about a total of thirty times. The International Herald Tribune reported that this may be of particular significance. The third most-complained about instrument was a fuel differential light, which received fifteen write-ups. Numerous complaints were also received about inoperative cockpit instrument lights, as well as multiple other malfunctions. Several complaints were made that the flaps, which modify drag and lift during take-off and landing, were jamming at twenty-five degrees upon landing, and there were two complaints that the weather radar was faulty.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the blocked static ports, the basic flight {{instruments}} relayed false airspeed, altitude and <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> data. Because the failure was not in any of the instruments, but rather in a common supporting system, thereby defeating redundancy, the erroneous altimeter data was also broadcast to Air Traffic Control, who was attempting to provide the pilots with basic flight data. This led to extreme confusion in the cockpit as the pilots were provided with some data (altitude) which seemed to correlate correctly with instrument data (altimeter) while the other data provided by ATC (approximate airspeed) did not agree. Although the pilots were quite cognizant of the possibility that all of the flight instruments were providing inaccurate data, the correlation between the altitude data given by ATC and that on the altimeter likely further compounded the confusion. Also contributing to their difficulty were the numerous cockpit alarms that the computer system generated, which conflicted both {{with each other and with}} the instruments. This lack of situational awareness was revealed by the cockpit voice recorder transcript. The fact that the flight took place at night and over water, thus not giving the pilots any visual references, was also identified as a major factor.|$|E
500|$|The variometer, {{also known}} as the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> {{indicator}} (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used {{to determine whether or not}} an aircraft is flying in level flight. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive <b>vertical</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|E

500|$|A blocked {{static port}} {{is a more}} serious {{situation}} because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One {{of the most common}} causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing. [...] A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicator will become frozen at zero and will not change at all, even if <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> increases or decreases. [...] The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. [...] When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. [...] In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|The {{final report}} from the NTSC stated that the {{probable}} cause of the accident was an excessive sink rate upon touchdown, following an unstabilised approach.

500|$|Inherent errors {{may fall}} into several categories, each {{affecting}} different instruments. [...] Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. [...] This type of error {{is caused by}} variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. [...] A compressibility error can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) correctly accounts for the compression {{so there is no}} compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above [...] and at airspeeds greater than [...] Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments. [...] These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading. [...] This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. [...] A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. [...] Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> indicators.|$|E
