5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> Earth.|$|E

5|$|The nearby 19th century house, Stonelands also formed {{part of the}} estate, so Repton {{ensured that}} it would be <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> the parkland. Stonelands no longer forms part of the estate, but is still <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> the park and wood. Towards the end of the 19th century, the house's park land was open to the public on certain days of the week by Peter Arthur Marsham Hoare, however this {{practice}} had ended by 1902. The grounds were still regularly opened for events such as fetes, the Dawlish flower show, as well as opening the gardens to the public.|$|E

5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic activity is distinct enough to be <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> ASTER satellite image but barely <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial activity, is controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{rendering}} cost, it is an efficient stategy that only <b>visible</b> data <b>from</b> a user's viewpoint are loaded and rendered. To implement this, we introduce a representative viewpoint (RV), which is a discrete point in the 3 D map used for a reference point of rendering. In our rendering system, we spread RVs {{all over the map}} in advance. Using the Z-buffer algorithm, <b>visible</b> objects <b>from</b> each RV are determined. When rendering, we first find the RV closest to a current viewpoint of a user. The objects seen from the RV on the map are found, and then only the <b>visible</b> objects <b>from</b> it are rendered.|$|R

5|$|Although not {{typically}} seen by viewers, the set {{also includes a}} used letter board that shows contestants which letters are remaining in play, a scoreboard that is <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> the contestants' perspective, and a countdown clock.
