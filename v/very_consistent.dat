5|$|In the Test series, Hirst scored 217 runs at {{an average}} of 24.11 and took 15 wickets {{at an average}} of 30.06. He scored 569 runs at 33.47 and took 36 wickets at 24.50 over all {{first-class}} games on the tour. His best bowling performance was five for 37 against Tasmania. Warner described Hirst as a <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> batsman throughout the tour, and noted that while he was a less effective bowler in Australian conditions than at home, he was often unlucky.|$|E
25|$|Since then, Mattner {{has played}} some <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> {{football}} in defence and has {{established himself as}} a clear best 22 player in Sydney. 2009 and 2010 saw solid form from Mattner while he has started the 2011 season in as strong form as has been seen from him at the club.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{tolerances}} are 0.005mm/mm or in/in {{because the}} sand compound {{is designed to}} barely shrink and a metal pattern is used. The cast surface finish is 0.3–4.0micrometers (50–150μin) because a finer sand is used. The resin also assists in forming a very smooth surface. The process, in general, produces <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> castings from one casting to the next.|$|E
25|$|Davie Grant, Sr. (16 July 1860 – 24 June 1903) was a Scottish {{professional}} golfer {{who played}} in the late 19th century. Grant was a frequent competitor in the Open Championship in the 1880s and 1890s and was <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> with his results. His best effort came in the 1888 Open Championship where he finished tied for sixth place. In total, he had six top-10 performances.|$|E
25|$|Dillon {{opened up}} 2014 with a bang, winning the pole at the season opening Daytona 500, then {{finishing}} ninth {{in the race}} after avoiding serious damage in a lap 145 wreck involving 13 cars. Though his results were not been spectacular (one Top 5 and four Top 10's), Dillon's results were <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> (0 DNF's), remaining {{in the hunt for}} a low-end chase berth, and finishing 20th in points, losing Rookie of the Year to Kyle Larson.|$|E

25|$|On the two last records Stubø was on {{the label}} Cadence Jazz Records. First came the LP Rhythm'a'ning (Cadence Jazz Records, 1986), live in Tromsø, with Krister Andersson, Lars Sjösten, Terje Venaas and Egil Johansen, (Cadence Jazz Records, 1986). This is a stylish and <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> release, with many tunes by John Coltrane. The end of a tune (Cadence Jazz Records, 1988), with Art Farmer, Doug Raney, Ivar Antonsen, Jesper Lundgaard and Ole Jacob Hansen, {{marked the end of}} an {{extraordinary}} career.|$|E
25|$|Some thyratrons {{can carry}} large {{currents}} for their physical size. One {{example is the}} miniature type 2D21, often seen in 1950s jukeboxes as control switches for relays. A cold-cathode version of the thyratron, which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode, is called an ignitron; some can switch thousands of amperes. Thyratrons containing hydrogen have a <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> time delay between their turn-on pulse and full conduction; they behave much like modern silicon-controlled rectifiers, also called thyristors due to their functional similarity to thyratrons. Hydrogen thyratrons have long been used in radar transmitters.|$|E
25|$|Their bowling {{was seen}} as their weakness, and indeed {{a lot of changes}} were made to the bowling attack {{throughout}} the series. It worked for the last match of the series, when Australia were kept to under 250 runs in both of their innings, but none of the bowlers - bar seam bowler Dick Pollard, who took 25 wickets in his four matches - were <b>very</b> <b>consistent,</b> or indeed selected with any regularity. George Pope took eight wickets in the second match, only to miss the third, and then came back to take six in the fourth match.|$|E

The team lost to the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 27–17 at Arrowhead Stadium on August 16. The Chiefs were shut out by the Miami Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium by a score of 24–0 on August 23. Kansas City played its final pre-season game against the St. Louis Rams on August 28 at Arrowhead Stadium for the Missouri Governor's Cup. The Chiefs won the game 21–17.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Earnhardt {{achieved}} a feat {{that he himself}} had believed to be impossible—he scored his seventh Winston Cup championship, tying Richard Petty. He was <b>very</b> <b>consistent,</b> scoring four wins, and after Ernie Irvan was sidelined due to a near-deadly crash at Michigan (the two were neck-and-neck {{at the top of}} the points up until the crash), won the title by over 400 points over Mark Martin. Earnhardt sealed the deal at Rockingham by winning the race over Rick Mast. It was his final NASCAR championship and his final season for the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet Lumina.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{a lack of}} a {{coherent}} definition for South Asia resulted in not only a lack of academic studies, but also in a lack interest for such studies. The confusion existed {{also because of the}} lack of a clear boundary – geographically, geopolitical, socio-culturally, economically or historically – between South Asia and other parts of Asia, especially the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Identification with a South Asian identity was also found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. However, modern definitions of South Asia are <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> in including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries.|$|E

25|$|Early in Korean myth, often {{men were}} equated to birds {{and women were}} often equated to fish or land animals. This often held true for later myths not based in Muism. Examples can be seen through the Samgungnyusa, where men often {{transformed}} into birds and tales of women include water or fish. For example, the early goddess, Lady Yuhwa, {{the daughter of the}} Chinese deity of the Yellow River Habaek, but Hae Mosu was said to be a sky god. In the tale about Suro, Suro was said to transform into a bird—as did his opponent, but his wife, Heo Hwang-ok was said to have come by boat from the sea. This is <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> throughout the Three Kingdoms period as seen in the Samgungnyusa.|$|E
25|$|Busch {{started off}} the 2016 season {{bringing}} home a 10th-place {{finish in the}} Daytona 500 and winning two consecutive poles for the Atlanta and Las Vegas. However, {{he was given the}} pole position for the former at Atlanta because his brother, Kyle Busch, earned that spot in qualifying but started dead-last after his time was disallowed due to failing post-qualifying inspection. He got his first and only victory of the season at Pocono, ironically the only race of the season when his crew chief Tony Gibson was suspended. Busch had a <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> season, breaking a record for most consecutive lead-lap finishes to start the year. His streak ended, however, when he got his first DNF of the season during the 23rd race at Bristol after suffering contact from Joey Logano. He remained in top ten in points throughout the year and finished 7th in the championship standings.|$|E
25|$|Borg {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{distinctive}} playing styles in the Open Era. He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander. He hit the ball hard and high {{from the back of the}} court and brought it down with considerable topspin, which made his ground strokes <b>very</b> <b>consistent.</b> There had been other players, particularly Rod Laver and Arthur Ashe, who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.|$|E

25|$|These 29 goals {{all came}} in the {{domestic}} league and Lambert shared this tally with Swindon Town's Simon Cox, who just like Lambert was playing in his last season for his club, moving to West Bromwich Albion of the Coca-Cola Championship. Despite the loss of striker Lambert, a fine start to the 2009–10 season pushed Rovers into 3rd place in {{the table at the}} start of October, which included a thrilling 3–2 victory away to Southampton on 29 September in which a last minute (96th to be precise) goal by Andy Williams saw Rovers clinch victory and go four points clear of 4th placed Colchester United. A run of five successive defeats, however, including 5–1 and 4–0 defeats to Norwich City and Leeds United respectively, saw Rovers drop out of the play-off places. Rovers maintained a <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> level of performance throughout the remainder of the season, never falling out of the top 10 positions in the league table. Eventually, on 10 April 2010, Rovers' play-off hopes were put to an end for another season after losing 2–1 away to Oldham Athletic. The side finished the season in 10th place after gaining only one point from their last six games.|$|E
25|$|Liang lost in {{qualifying}} {{for both the}} Wuxi Classic and the Shanghai Masters to Rod Lawler. He reached the venue stage of the Australian Goldfields Open by beating Thanawat Thirapongpaiboon, but lost 3–5 {{in the first round}} against Matthew Stevens. Liang beat Anthony McGill and Andrew Higginson to qualify for the UK Championship, where he saw a 4–3 lead in the first round against Barry Hawkins turn into a 4–6 defeat. Liang failed to qualify for the next two events, but won two matches to enter the main draw of both the Welsh Open and the China Open. In Wales he lost 2–4 to local favourite Stevens in the first round, and in his homeland of China he beat Lu Ning 5–1 in the wildcard round, before losing 3–5 to Stuart Bingham in the first round. Liang had a <b>very</b> <b>consistent</b> season in the Players Tour Championship series as he advanced to, but not past, the last 16 in five of the ten events. This saw him placed 27th on the PTC Order of Merit, one spot short of making the Finals. Liang's season ended when he was beaten 6–10 by Mark Davis in the final round of World Championship Qualifying. His end of year ranking was world number 32.|$|E
