40|$|The {{challenging}} {{issue of}} <b>value</b> (co) <b>creation</b> {{has attracted a}} great number of researchers and decision makers to debates on ways to improve the capacity and will of actors to collaborate to produce better solutions and results. Some researchers have analysed <b>value</b> (co) <b>creation</b> {{as the result of the}} individual and collective will to collaborate. Referring to these reflections, this paper proposes to investigate the topic of <b>value</b> (co) <b>creation</b> from a different point of view. It highlights not only how the opportunities for <b>value</b> (co) <b>creation</b> are related to the individual and collective will, but that they are influenced by deep individual and collective psychological and sociological status. Hence, <b>value</b> (co) <b>creation</b> is proposed as the peak of the social pyramid, the last step of a staircase, each level of which represents a specific actor’s need. Therefore, the principal goal is to demonstrate that a win-win logic in the <b>value</b> (co) <b>creation</b> perspective is possible only if all the involved actors are in a condition of well-being...|$|R

A firm’s experience of prior alliances can be characterized by the depth in a specific governance form and the breadth of diverse governance forms. In-depth experience creates governing capabilities that are specific to a focal structure and result in exploitation of the same structure. Diverse governance experience broadens the range of alliance-related knowledge, and lead to better informed governance decisions by the creation of selection capabilities. In the first empirical essay, I examine a model that integrates both contractual hazards and experience-based capabilities to predict governance decisions. The second essay takes a further step by examining how the stock market responds to experience factors when evaluating events of new alliance formation. In a sample of alliances formed by US software companies, I find strong empirical evidence for the argument of multi-dimensional experience in affecting strategic decisions and <b>value</b> <b>creations...</b>|$|R

In particular. this study examined the effects the utilization of consensus and values clarification had on the level of member-group value congruency and the affective variables (general job satisfaction, group cohesion, and organizational commitment), which have been positively associated with person-organization fit. Using an organizational subculture composed of 125 individuals. this study treated person-group fit. job satisfaction. commitment, and group cohesion as dependent variables with respect to the independent variables: interventions A and B. Intervention A consisted of a group shared <b>values</b> <b>creation</b> exercise utilizing only a group consensus process. Intervention B was a group shared <b>values</b> <b>creation</b> exercise utilizing both a process of personal values clarification and group consensus. Increased levels of value congruence, satisfaction, commitment or cohesion with either method used to create shared values would suggest a positive outcome {{as a result of the}} intervention. Results for both interventions indicated little impact on groups with strong cultures and high pre-existing levels for the affective variables under consideration. Findings also indicated this research should be pursued further using larger samples and more heterogeneous populations, and that additional variables should be examined...|$|R

[...] According to Wirtz, [...] "a business model is a simplified and aggregated representation of the relevant activities of a company.

In his speech to the Storting following his appointment, Jagland described the Norwegian House as a foundation with four pillars. The metaphor represented, [...] "the collective <b>value</b> <b>creation</b> within the ecologically sustainable society". The four pillars that hold up the house were business and labour policy; welfare policy; research and educational policy; and foreign and security policy. Jagland stated that everyone had something to contribute regarding the creation of the house; in particular he stated that the cabinet would cooperate with the opposition to reach these goals. In his speech, Jagland said that he would not deviate much from Harlem Brundtland's policies, but that he would increase the focus on violence, abuse of alcohol and drugs, and crime, including improvement of preventative measures and the courts. He also stated {{that it was important to}} introduce information technology in all parts of the education system. As part of the construction of the Norwegian House, the cabinet also started to appoint lay councils, with expertise within their fields, that would provide them with feedback and inputs on important areas in society. Jagland stated that the purpose was to allow critical voices close access to the political decisions, and increase the number of ideas generated at a political level. Jagland stated in August 2008 that, [...] "the Norwegian House could have been better planned and prepared, but I did not have the time. I took a chance. The Labour Party was down for the count. My goal was to make a good election; and we did. We have not done so well since". Jagland said in an interview, [...] "I still get letters from people who miss the Norwegian House. It was an attempt at something new, a building project that would also inspire the activity on the side of the parties".|$|E
