30|$|The {{content of}} {{volatiles}} in magma controls {{the degree of}} vesicle development in volcanic rocks, and greatly affects the type of <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> (explosion or effusion). However, numerous studies on phreatic eruption and phreatomagmatic eruption have demonstrated that the vaporization of hot magma interacted with the surface water or ground water can also provide energy for the <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> and change the style of <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption.</b>|$|R
50|$|Martin {{discovered}} the Messum crater in 1939, the Namibian remainder of a gigantic <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> that happened before Africa and South America broke apart. This eruption {{is thought to}} have been the single largest explosive <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> {{in the history of the}} Earth.|$|R
50|$|A <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> of Mount Ontake (Ontake-san) {{took place}} on September 27, 2014, killing 63 people. Mount Ontake is a volcano located on the Japanese island of Honshu around 100 {{kilometres}} (62 mi) northeast of Nagoya and around 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Tokyo. It was the first fatal <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> in Japan since the 1991 collapse of a lava dome at Mount Unzen, and the deadliest <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> in Japan since Torishima killed an estimated 150 people in 1902.|$|R

5|$|Kwee's {{work is the}} {{earliest}} of three Chinese Malay novels which were inspired by <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> The second, Liem Khing Hoo's Meledaknja Goenoeng Keloet (The Eruption of Mount Kelud), was inspired by Kelud in East Java and {{was published in the}} monthly magazine Tjerita Roman in 1929. The third, Kwee's Drama dari Merapie (Drama of Merapi), was inspired by Central Java's Mount Merapi and was published as a serial in Moestika Romans from March to September 1931. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> also featured in contemporary Chinese Malay poetry. Claudine Salmon records one syair, Ong Tjong Sian's Sair Petjanja Goenoeng Krakatau (Syair on the Eruption of Mount Krakatoa; 1929), as dealing with the community's fears after Krakatoa resumed activity.|$|E
25|$|Prediction of <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> (also: <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> forecasting) is an {{interdisciplinary}} monitoring and research effort {{to predict the}} time and severity of a volcano's eruption. Of particular importance is the prediction of hazardous eruptions {{that could lead to}} catastrophic loss of life, property, and disruption of human activities.|$|R
50|$|Dense-rock {{equivalent}} is a volcanologic calculation used {{to estimate}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> volume. One of the widely accepted measures {{of the size of}} a historic or prehistoric eruption is the volume of magma ejected as pumice and volcanic ash, known as tephra during an explosive phase of the eruption, or the volume of lava extruded during an effusive phase of a <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption.</b> Eruption volumes are commonly expressed in cubic kilometers (km3).|$|R

5|$|Preindustrial {{deposition}} {{rates of}} mercury {{from the atmosphere}} may be about 4ng /(1 L of ice deposit). Although that {{can be considered a}} natural level of exposure, regional or global sources have significant effects. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> can increase the atmospheric source by 4–6 times.|$|E
5|$|Large {{areas of}} Earth's surface {{are subject to}} extreme weather such as {{tropical}} cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year. Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> tornadoes, sinkholes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.|$|E
5|$|The state {{accounts}} for ~80% of the United States' volcanoes, excluding the seamounts in the area, ~8% of world volcanoes, {{and most of}} these are located among the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Islands arc serves as the northern boundary of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic activity generates earthquakes and <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> in masses.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is the 22nd most {{abundant}} element in Earth's crust {{with an average}} concentration of 100 ppm. Chromium compounds {{are found in the}} environment from the erosion of chromium-containing rocks, and can be redistributed by <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> Typical background concentrations of chromium in environmental media are: atmosphere <10 ng m−3; soil <500 mg kg−1; vegetation <0.5 mg kg−1; freshwater <10 ug L−1; seawater <1 ug L−1; sediment <80 mg kg−1.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 to 1972, NASA {{visited the}} real Moon through the Apollo program {{and found that}} its surface does not closely {{resemble}} this part of Idaho. NASA astronauts discovered that real Moon craters were almost all created by meteorites while their namesakes on Earth were created by <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> Apollo astronauts performed part of their training at Craters of the Moon Lava Field by learning to look for and collect good rock specimens in an unfamiliar and harsh environment.|$|E

5|$|The bedrock {{under the}} {{watershed}} includes {{part of the}} last exotic terrane, a chain of seamounts, acquired by the North American Plate as it moved west during the Eocene. Known as the Waverly Hills Formation, it lies buried under ash and lava from later <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> sediments from flooding and erosion, and layers of wind-blown silt. Two dormant volcanoes from the Boring Lava Field are in the Tryon Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the extinction, and suggest that other events may have contributed to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In particular, <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg extinction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are {{not known}} to have {{occurred}} from the Anahim hotspot in historical times. However, since 2007 there have been recorded volcano tectonic earthquakes and carbon dioxide emissions {{in the vicinity of}} Nazko Cone. The lack of evidence for historic seismicity prior to 2007 suggests that the area is tectonically stable, making the Nechako Basin one of the most seismically inactive areas of British Columbia.|$|E

There has been no confirmation yet of a direct link between the <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption</b> and earthquake, but Ken Hudnut, a geophysicist for the United States Geological Survey, stated that [...] "it seems suggestive at this point". Keleti Mafi, the Tongan government's chief seismologist, has suggested that the earthquake is likely to have a direct impact on the <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruption,</b> stating that the [...] "strength of the earthquake could crack the volcano's (undersea) vent and allow more magma to be ejected".|$|R

5|$|Campaigns in From Dust are {{structured}} as {{a sequence of}} missions, whereby completing certain objectives expedites the tribe's progress and bestows additional powers, such as the capacity to jellify water. Tribal shamans alert the player to natural disasters, notably tsunamis and <b>volcanic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> shortly before they occur. These disasters can be inhibited through creative, physical manipulation of the environment: a tsunami can be jellified, wildfires extinguished, and lava flows diverted. Although there is no 'explicit sandbox' mode, Chahi stated that each mission features a distinct map, which the player can return to and manipulate further.|$|E
5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>eruptions</b> can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E
