40|$|AbstractAims: we {{suspected}} incompetent perforating {{veins of}} having {{a role in the}} development of recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> in some patients. The aim was to look for an association between perforators and recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Methods: a consecutive group of patients presenting with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were examined using colour duplex ultrasonography by an experienced vascular technologist. Pathological perforating veins were defined as those exhibiting bi-directional flow and a diameter of 4 mm or greater at the fascia. Results: between September 1998 and July 1999, 204 patients were examined. Primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were found in 198 legs (135 patients) and recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> in 91 legs (69 patients). In patients with primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> 88 (44 %) had incompetent perforators compared to 57 (63 %) of those with recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> (Chi-squared, p < 0. 005). Also, for recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> the percentage of patients with any given number of incompetent perforators was higher than for primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Overall, there was a higher number of incompetent perforators in those with recurrent veins compared to primary veins and this difference was significant at 95 % confidence interval. Conclusion: patients with recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> have both a higher prevalence and a greater number of incompetent perforating veins than patients with primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> have a {{thickening}} wall. Their {{smooth muscle}} cells are disorganized as regards proliferation {{and production of}} extracellular matrix protein. An imbalance between the synthesis of collagen type I protein (collagen I) and collagen type III protein (collagen III) could explain the lack of elasticity of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Therefore, collagen synthesis was compared {{in the media and}} in cultured smooth muscle cells derived from human control and <b>varicose</b> saphenous <b>veins.</b> An increase in total collagen synthesis was observed in the media and in smooth muscle cells derived from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> This augmentation was due to an overproduction of collagen I in cultured cells from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> consistent with an increase in the release of collagen I metabolites in the media. A concomitant decrease in collagen III was observed in cultures of smooth muscle cells from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> The increase in the synthesis of collagen I in cells from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> was correlated with an over-expression of the gene since mRNAs for collagen I were augmented without change in mRNA-half-life. This augmentation in the synthesis of collagen I was reduced by the addition of exogenous collagen III in cultures from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> These findings suggest a dysregulation of the synthesis of collagen I and III in smooth muscle cells derived from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Copyright © 2001 S.

50|$|In 2013, Professor Mark Whiteley and {{his team}} {{described}} a new sort of vein associated with varicose veins. Primary Avalvular Varicose Anomalies (PAVA) are fine, refluxing, veins that run around other veins in the leg and are often associated with Pelvic Vein Reflux. They can cause recurrent varicose veins if not recognised and treated {{at the time of}} the <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery and can be incorrectly diagnosed as neo-vascular tissue.|$|E

50|$|<b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> are veins {{that have}} become {{enlarged}} and twisted. The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg, although <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> can occur elsewhere. Veins have pairs of leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde flow or venous reflux). Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart (the skeletal-muscle pump), against the effects of gravity. When <b>veins</b> become <b>varicose,</b> the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more. <b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> are most common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem, <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> can be painful, especially when standing. Severe long-standing <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> can lead to leg swelling, venous eczema, skin thickening (lipodermatosclerosis) and ulceration. Although life-threatening complications are uncommon, <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> may be confused with deep vein thrombosis, which may be life-threatening.|$|R
50|$|Other {{associated}} conditions include <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> or venous reflux, folate deficiency, magnesium deficiency, fibromyalgia, sleep apnea, uremia, diabetes, thyroid disease, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, POTS, and certain autoimmune {{diseases such as}} Sjögren's syndrome, celiac disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. RLS can also worsen in pregnancy. In a 2007 study, RLS was detected in 36% of people attending a phlebology (vein disease) clinic, compared to 18% in a control group.|$|E

40|$|Background - The {{dilatation}} and tortuosity {{observed in}} <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> {{provide evidence for}} progressive venous wall remodeling associated with abnormalities of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix. The present {{study was designed to}} examine if the phenotypic modulations observed in the venous smooth muscle cells of patients with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were also present in their dermal fibroblasts. Methods and Results - Collagen type I (collagen I), type III (collagen III), and type V (collagen V) were compared in dermal fibroblasts derived from the skin of control subjects and patients with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> The synthesis of collagen I, the release of its metabolites, and the expression of its mRNA were increased in fibroblasts from patients with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> whereas the synthesis of collagen III was decreased but not correlated with a decrease in mRNA expression and in metabolite release. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, and 13) and their inhibitors (TIMP 1 and 2) were quantified in both cell types; only the production of proMMP 2 was increased in cells derived from patients with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Conclusions - These findings suggest that the synthesis of collagen I and III is dysregulated in dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> These results are comparable with those observed in smooth muscle cells derived from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> thus suggesting a systemic alteration of tissue remodeling in subjects with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> and {{haemorrhoids}} both {{involve the}} venous circulatory system, {{but it is}} unclear whether they are predictors of elevated rates of other circulatory diseases.

We analysed an epidemiological database of hospital admission and day-case statistics, constructing cohorts of people admitted for care for <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> or haemorrhoids, and comparing their experience of subsequent circulatory diseases with a control cohort. Compared with the control cohort, there was an elevated risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> cohort (rate ratio 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval 1. 08 - 1. 33) but not in the haemorrhoids cohort (0. 90; 0. 78 - 1. 03). No other circulatory diseases showed significantly elevated risks associated with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> or haemorrhoids. The rate ratio for coronary heart disease in the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> cohort was 0. 91 (95 % confidence interval 0. 88 - 0. 95) and that in the haemorrhoids cohort was 0. 98 (0. 94 - 1. 03).
