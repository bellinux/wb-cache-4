5|$|Internal {{cleaning}} of diving cylinders {{may be required}} to remove contaminants or to allow effective <b>visual</b> <b>inspection.</b> Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal.

5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> with acetic acid (VIA).

5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} new policy {{directive}} regarding the handling {{of nuclear weapons and}} delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating that they are not armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of nuclear weapons from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle nuclear weapons must develop a coordinated <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear weapons cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E

40|$|Many steel {{structures}} contain multiple fatigue sensitive details that have similar geometries and {{are subjected to}} similar load fluctuations. Examples are orthotropic (bridge) decks and stiffened (ship) hulls where tens to thousands of similar details are present in one structure. Generally only <b>visual</b> <b>inspections</b> on fatigue cracks are considered for these structures because more accurate techniques {{are considered to be}} too expensive and time consuming when so many details need to be inspected. <b>Visual</b> <b>inspections</b> are known to have a low probability of detection. Consequently Bayesian update techniques usually show a marginal effect of the result of <b>visual</b> <b>inspections</b> on the reliability of structures with respect to fatigue failure. On the other hand the inspection result of one location also provides information on similar details at other locations and thus the significance of the inspection result may be larger if multiple potential crack locations occur and cracks are not detected at any of these locations. This paper provides a probabilistic fatigue crack growth (fracture mechanics) model of a system containing a fatigue sensitive detail at multiple locations that accounts for the results of inspections. Spatial correlations of loading, resistance, and uncertainty variables between the different locations are evaluated and estimated through a literature review and are accounted for in the model. The model is demonstrated on a practical example of an orthotropic bridge deck containing a detail at 100 locations. The paper shows that <b>visual</b> <b>inspections</b> may be effective provided that a certain minimum inspection reliability can be guaranteed, that the structure is relatively tolerant to large cracks, and that the geometry and loading conditions are similar for a large number of location...|$|R
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during <b>visual</b> <b>inspection</b> meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by <b>visual</b> <b>inspection,</b> but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an integrated procedure {{for evaluation of}} the service-life curve of existing bridges, calibrated with data derived from <b>visual</b> <b>inspections</b> and aimed at assessing the degree of deterioration of their structural/non-structural elements. <b>Visual</b> <b>inspections</b> allowed a total sufficiency rating for the bridges to be calculated, together with data collection, {{to be used in}} Bayesian updating of element deterioration curves. The results were combined with information from simulations of potential bridge deterioration scenarios to quantify mean trends and related uncertainties of the remaining service-life curves of existing bridges. The proposed procedure was applied to two bridge stocks and results are critically discussed. The method used may allow public authorities/private managing companies to optimise economic resources allocated to long/medium-term maintenance plans for the most critical structures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{wide range}} of {{materials}} used {{in the construction of}} embankments leads to highly differentiated structural behaviours and sometimes to accidents. Therefore, namely in higher hazard works, such as dams, it is necessary to periodically assess their safety. That assessment is done by site visits, to perform <b>visual</b> <b>inspections,</b> and the reading of certain quantities. Those variables are not to exceed certain values, which are related with the behaviour models predicted in the design. Applied Geodesy plays a significant part in the measurement of surface displacements. The <b>visual</b> <b>inspections</b> are a complement to the data obtained in those measurements, as zones of differential settlements, deviation, fissures, cracks, etc. This paper presents the contribution of the Applied Geodesy to detect the causes of accident in two embankment structures, {{as well as to the}} decisions adopted for their rehabilitation. 1...|$|R
