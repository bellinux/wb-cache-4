40|$|As this is {{the first}} {{newsletter}} in my tenure as chair of the Site Remediation Committee, let me take this opportunity to greet all committee members, and to proudly offer to you our issue on the theme of contaminated sediments. Our committee strives to bring together legal and technical expertise and points of view on specific issues in site remediation, and this issue shows how well the concept can work. We are pleased to present (in no particular order), an analysis of natural resource damages claims in sediment sites; a proposal for streamlining the remedial investigation and feasibility study process at sediment sites; a discussion of assigning costs for restoring urban rivers, co-authored by a former Section chair; an analysis of the use of Superfund to deal with contaminated sediments in urban waterways and embayments; and a study of special considerations for conducting remedial investigations at sediment sites. In the coming year we will be looking into new themes for newsletters. If there is a particular theme of interest to you, please contact me or one of our Newsletter vice chairs, Peter Hapke or Karen Mignone.
