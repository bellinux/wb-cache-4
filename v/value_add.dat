40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} structural changes {{on the distribution of}} net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and the difference between net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and agricultural income over time. We present and discuss the changes in the distribution of net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> (land, labor, capital, and farm income) over time. Net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> by U. S. agriculture grew significantly from $ 18 billion in 1960 to $ 95 billion in 1996. We examine regional differences in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> using the Theil entropy measure. The inequality (dispersion) of net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> increased over time. The increased inequality in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> represented both increases in regional dispersion in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and increases in the average inequality in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in each region. Thus, the net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is becoming less alike across the United States. We also examine the inequality in the components of net <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> The greatest dispersion occurred in returns to land followed by returns to capital.

This article examines current literature on <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statements in two areas: {{the usefulness of the}} <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement in South Africa and the relevance of social accounting theories in explaining its continued disclosure in South African listed companies’ annual reports. It also reports the results of a questionnaire survey addressed to preparers of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statements. The research studies examined in the literature review indicate that legitimacy theory is more likely to provide an explanation for the disclosure of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statements in annual reports in South Africa. The results of the empirical survey indicate {{that the majority of the}} respondents are of the opinion that it is desirable to prepare a <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement, but that it is not used in the majority of companies. Furthermore, the reasons advanced by the preparers for the desirability of the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement provide some evidence that legitimacy theory may be behind the propensity of companies to publish a <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement. The article recommends that the preparation of the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement should be standardised.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{issues involved}} in calculating a <b>value</b> <b>added</b> index {{in order to measure}} real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> at the industry level. Three methods of calculating real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> are considered; the Laspeyres double-deflation method recommended by the Utzired Nations System of Nation Accounts, the commonly used single-deflation method, and the double-deflation Divisia method. Actual data are employed to clarify and illustrate the issues involved, and the paper concludes with a recommenda-tion for an appropriate index to use when calculating industry real <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is the key to understanding the contribution of the primary inputs, the economies of scale, and technical change in the production process. Historical and contemporary changes in "pure " productivity of an industry can be analyzed by observing real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> data. Industry nominal <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is easy enough to calculate, it is simply the difference between the value of the industry's output and the industry's cost of materials or intermediate inputs. Adjusting nominal <b>value</b> <b>added</b> for price changes in order to calculate real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is much less straightforward. In defining real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> one encounters index number problems as well as some problems unique to <b>value</b> <b>added</b> itself...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of financial bootstrap strategies in new ventures, scholars have presented conflicting views on the relationship between these strategies and venture development. This paper studies the impact of financial bootstrapping on the level of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> at particular points in time and growth in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> across time. We use a longitudinal database comprising data from both questionnaires and financial accounts of 214 new ventures. Findings provide mixed evidence on the impact of financial bootstrapping on the level of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in new ventures. For instance, ventures that use more finance from family and friends demonstrate lower levels of <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> while ventures that do not invest in their own buildings exhibit higher levels of <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> More significantly, financial bootstrapping has a consistently positive impact on the growth in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> across time. Although new ventures that use more owner funds, employ more interim personnel, incite customers to pay more quickly and apply for more subsidy programs start with lower or similar levels of <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> these ventures exhibit higher growth in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> across time (180 words). ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Value</b> <b>added</b> is {{a common}} tool in {{educational}} research on effectiveness. It is often modeled as a (prediction of a) random effect in a specific hierarchical linear model. This paper shows that this modeling strategy is not valid when endogeneity is present.

This paper shows that this phenomenon is far from exceptional and can even be a generic problem when the covariates contain the prior score attainments, a typical situation in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> modeling.

We {{consider how the}} structural changes in Canadian and U.

We use the Theil Measure of Inequality (TMI) to compare and explain changes in 1) the between and within-region distribution of net <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> and 2) changes {{in the distribution of}} factor shares of net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in Canada and in the U.

Results show that in Canada (1960 - 2000), net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> has become somewhat more equally distributed relative to the number of farms per province, but has varied widely from 1972 - 1988. Between-region inequality in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> accounted for from 0. 5 to 85. 5 percent of this inequality from 1960 - 2000. In the U. S. (1949 - 2000), net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> has become more unequally distributed. About half of the variation in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in the U.
