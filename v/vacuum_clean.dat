50|$|A {{section of}} the glass is heated until it is malleable; then it is bent into shape and aligned to a neon sign pattern paper {{containing}} the graphics or lettering that the final product will ultimately conform to. This is where the real art of neon comes in, that takes some artisans from a year up to several years of practice to master. A tube bender corks off the hollow tube before heating and holds a latex rubber blow hose at the other end, through which he gently presses {{a small amount of}} air to keep the tube diameter constant as it is bending. The trick of bending is to bend one small section or bend at a time, heating one part of the tubing so that it is soft, without heating some other part of the tube as well, which would make the bend uncontrollable. A bend, once the glass is heated, must be brought to the pattern and fitted rapidly before the glass hardens again because it is difficult to reheat once completely cooled without risking breakage. It is frequently necessary to skip one or more bends and come back to it later, by measuring carefully {{along the length of the}} tube. One tube letter may contain 7-10 small bends, and mistakes are not easily corrected without going back and starting all over again. If more tubing is required, another piece is welded onto it, or the parts can be all welded onto each other at the final step. The finished tube must be absolutely vacuum tight to operate, and it must be <b>vacuum</b> <b>clean</b> inside. Once the tube is filled with mercury, if any mistake is made after that, the entire tube has to, or should be, started over anew, because breathing heated mercury impregnated glass and phosphor causes long term heavy metal poisoning in neon workers. Sticks of tubing are joined until the tube reaches an impractical size, and several tubes are joined in series with the high voltage neon transformer. Extreme ends of the electrical circuit must be isolated from each other to prevent tube puncture and buzzing from corona effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of cobalt thin films on ultra–high <b>vacuum</b> <b>clean</b> Si(100) surfaces below the threshold temperature for silicide formation (at 375 °C) is studied. We find Co grain formation and Co grain size evolution at all temperatures at and above room temperature. The clustering process is quantified with films post-deposition annealed for 15 minutes at temperatures between 250 °C and 350 °C. The activation energy for clustering {{is found to}} be 0. 3 ± 0. 2 eV, indicating that a Co surface diffusion process dominates the kinetics.

40|$|We study {{an example}} due to Wooldridge {{of a small}} robotic agent that will <b>vacuum</b> <b>clean</b> a room. The room is an n × n grid and at any point the robot can move forward one step or turn right 90 degrees. The problem {{is to find a}} {{deterministic}} strategy for the robot in which (1) its next action only depends on its current square and orientation (one of north, west, south, east), and (2) all squares are visited infinitely often. We use a model checker and a SAT solver to find such strategies, and a proof assistant to exhibit certain symmetries in the problem. ...|$|E

40|$|Accumulation of dust on {{the surface}} of solar panels reduces the amount of {{radiation}} reaching it. This leads to loss in generated electric power and formation of hotspots which would permanently damage the solar panel. This project aims at developing an autonomous vacuum cleaning method which can be used on a regular basis to maximize the lifetime and efficiency of a solar panel. This system is implemented using two subsystems namely a Robotic <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Cleaner</b> and a Docking Station. The Robotic <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Cleaner</b> uses a two stage cleaning process to remove the dust from the solar panel. It is designed to work on inclined and slippery surfaces. A control strategy is formulated to navigate the robot in the required path using an appropriate feedback mechanism. The battery voltage of the robot is determined periodically and if it goes below a threshold, it returns to the docking station and charges itself automatically using power drawn from the solar panels. The operation of the robotic vacuum cleaner has been verified and relevant results are presented. The DC Charging circuit in the docking station is simulated in Proteus environment and is implemented in hardware. An economical, robust Robotic <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Cleaner</b> which can clean arrays of Solar panels (with or without inclination) interlinked by rails and recharge itself automatically at a docking station is designed and implemented...|$|R
