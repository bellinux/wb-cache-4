25|$|For {{portions}} of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, {{it is recommended that}} the luma samples be assigned the code word 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0mV. It is permissible to encode analog <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> information (such as <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> timecode or <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> test signals) without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended—and neither is necessary in the digital interface.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the V bit {{is used to}} {{indicate}} {{the start of the}} vertical blanking region; an EAV packet with V=1 indicates the following line (lines are deemed to start at EAV) is part of the <b>vertical</b> <b>interval,</b> an EAV packet with V=0 indicates the following line is part of the active picture.|$|E
25|$|Thermoclines, or sudden {{changes in}} {{temperature}}. Where the air temperature {{is higher than}} the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends.

25|$|As the {{standard}} definition interface carries no checksum, CRC, or other data integrity check, an EDH (Error Detection and Handling) packet may be optionally {{placed in the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> of the video signal. This packet includes CRC values for both the active picture, and the entire field (excluding those lines at which switching may occur, and which should contain no useful data); equipment can compute their own CRC and compare it with the received CRC in order to detect errors.|$|E
25|$|A {{calibration}} header is sent {{before the}} image. It {{consists of a}} 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, a 10ms break at 1200Hz, another 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, followed by a digital VIS (<b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> signaling) code, identifying the transmission mode used. The VIS consists of bits of 30 milliseconds in length. The code starts with a start bit at 1200Hz, followed by 7 data bits (LSB first; 1100Hz for 1, 1300Hz for 0). An even parity bit follows, then a stop bit at 1200Hz. For example, the bits corresponding the decimal numbers 44 or 32 imply that the mode is Martin M1, whereas the number 60 represents Scottie S1.|$|E

2500|$|Returning to 1786, the proprietors of {{the canal}} {{realised}} that the Blackhill discontinuity had now to be overcome; moreover the best coalfields lay {{a couple of miles}} east of Sheepford. An extension east involved locks there with a <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> of [...] The two groups of locks would vastly increase the requirement for water; this was readily available in the River Calder, but the Monkland Canal Act had forbidden the abstraction of any water that might later be claimed by the Forth and Clyde Canal, and that canal was itself considering an extension which would require the water.|$|E
2500|$|The Monkland Canal was a [...] canal {{designed}} to bring coal from the mining areas of Monklands to Glasgow in Scotland. In {{the course of a}} long and difficult construction process, it was opened progressively as short sections were completed, from 1771. It reached Gartcraig in 1782, and in 1794 it reached its full originally planned extent, from pits at Calderbank to a basin at Townhead in Glasgow; at first this was in two sections with a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> between them at Blackhill; coal was unloaded and carted to the lower section and loaded onto a fresh barge. Locks were later constructed linking the two sections, and the canal was also connected to the Forth and Clyde Canal, giving additional business potential.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{limitations}} of well clusters and nested wells and a desire for monitoring more <b>vertical</b> <b>intervals,</b> researchers at the University of Waterloo (Canada) developed a MLS to collect depth-discrete groundwater samples at a landfill site in Ontario, Canada (Pickens et al. 1978). That system, which contained multiple tubes within an outer PVC pipe, was subsequently commercialized as the Solinst Waterloo system. Further improvements to that system included the addition of packers to hydraulically isolate the monitoring intervals.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "other means" [...] {{was some}} kind of {{inclined}} plane in which canal boats could be lowered and raised to accommodate the <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> between the two sections of the canal. At that time, systems of this kind had already been installed in the Shropshire Canal in 1788 and 1790, where 5 tonne boats were hauled up inclines dry, on cradles. In 1798 there had been an attempt on the Somerset Coal Canal to use a system in which 20 tonne boats could rise and descend vertically in a float chamber, the boat contained within a timber caisson; this had been unsuccessful. In 1809 a vertical lift had been installed at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, where boats in a wooden caisson were winched up by manpower; it was not successful and was replaced in 1815.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Townhead basin served much heavy {{industry}} in that quarter of Glasgow, progressive {{improvements to the}} navigability of the River Clyde meant that 100-tonne (110-short-ton) ships, and by {{the early years of}} the nineteenth century 400-tonne (440-short-ton) ships, could reach the Broomielaw quays from the sea. The conveyance of coal, iron ore and machinery from the canal down to the quays resulted in a huge and inconvenient cartage traffic through the city streets; this [...] "added a cost equivalent to [...] carriage on a railway", and of course involved a trans-shipment. The engineer Rennie designed a canal link from the Monkland Canal to the Clyde in 1797, but it involved [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> of lockage and was impossibly expensive; Stevenson prepared a similar scheme later but it too foundered. The Canal Company bought land for a connecting railway for the purpose in 1824, but that scheme also came to nothing.|$|E

The ‘Rg’ is a parameter of channel slope, which facilitates calculation of the runoff volume (Sreedevi et al. 2005). The ‘Rg’ value {{of the study area}} is 0.52 (Table  1), which reveals the mountainous nature of the terrain, where the Kosi river originates.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} defining {{property of}} the semicubical parabola {{is that it is}} an isochrone curve, meaning that a particle following its path while being pulled down by gravity travels equal <b>vertical</b> <b>intervals</b> in equal time periods. In this way it is related to the tautochrone curve, for which particles at different starting points always take equal time to reach the bottom, and the brachistochrone curve, the curve that minimizes the time it takes for a falling particle to travel from its start to its end.|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{synchronization}} eliminates this by timing {{frame buffer}} fills {{to coincide with}} the <b>vertical</b> blanking <b>interval,</b> thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as video games and computer aided design (CAD) packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the <b>vertical</b> blanking <b>interval.</b> This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. Triple buffering reduces this latency significantly.|$|R

50|$|A <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> {{test signal}} {{inserter}}, or VITS inserter inserts test patterns into the <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> {{of a television}} signal. Unlike test signal generators; a VITS inserter is used to insert the test signal into live programming, so that inline measurements of a transmission chain can be made while the chain is operational. (As the <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> is typically not visible on end-user televisions, {{this can be done}} without producing any artifacts noticeable to viewers). Since VITS signals can often be transmitted, it is also possible for a television station to receive its own on-air feed, and use the VITS to detect and troubleshoot problems in on-air transmission.|$|E
