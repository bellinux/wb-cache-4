40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{show the}} {{seismicity}} {{of the past}} 20 years that occurred in Italy and surrounding regions. Hypocentral locations have been obtained by using P- and S-wave arrival times from the INGV national and several regional permanent seismic networks. More than 48, 000 events, selected from an original data set of about 99, 780, are used to reconstruct the most complete seismic picture of the Italian region so far. The seismicity distribution allows inference on seismotectonics of this complex region of subduction versus continental collision. Our results clearly reveal the geometry of the Adria and the Ionian subduction and a continuous normal fault belt in the upper crust, following the Apennines mountain range. The depth of the seismogenic layer is computed from the cut-off of seismicity at depth and shows large variations along and across the seismic active regions. Earthquakes are generated by the different <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> slab <b>retreat</b> and the subsequent asthenospheric upwelling. D 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A strong climatic {{warming is}} {{currently}} {{observed in the}} Caucasus mountains, which has profound impact on runoff generation in the glaciated Glavny (Main) Range and on water availability in the whole region. To assess future changes in the hydrological cycle, the output of a general circulation model was downscaled statistically. For the 21 st century, a further warming by 4 – 7 °C and a slight precipitation increase is predicted. Measured and simulated meteorological variables were used as input into a runoff model to transfer climate signals into a hydrological response under both present and future climate forcings. Runoff scenarios for the mid {{and the end of}} the 21 st century were generated for different steps of deglaciation. The results show a satisfactory model performance for periods with observed runoff. Future water availability strongly depends on the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> glacier <b>retreat.</b> In a first phase, a surplus of water will increase flood risk in hot years and after continuing glacier reduction, annual runoff will again approximate current values. However, the seasonal distribution of streamflow will change towards runoff increase in spring and lower flows in summer...|$|R
40|$|Rocks metamorphosed under {{high-pressure}} (HP) and ultra high-pressure (UHP) {{conditions in}} subduction zones {{come back to}} the surface relatively soon after their burial and at rates comparable to plate boundary velocities. In the Mediterranean realm, their occurrence in several belts related to a single subduction event shows that the burial–exhumation cycle is a recurrent transient process. Using the Calabria–Apennine and Aegean belts as examples, we show that the exhumation of HP rocks is associated in time and space with the subduction of small continental lithosphere blocks that triggers slab rollback, creating the necessary space for the exhumation of the buoyant continental crust thatwas deeply buried just before. The buoyancy force of the subducted crust increases until this crust detaches from the downgoing slab. It then exhumes at a rate that depends directly on the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> trench <b>retreat</b> {{to become part of the}} overriding plate. Heated from below by the asthenosphere that flows into the opening mantle wedge, the exhumed crust weakens and undergoes core-complex-type extension, responsible for a second stage of exhumation at a lower rate. The full sequence of events that characterizes this model (crust–mantle delamination, slab rollback and trench retreat, HP rock exhumation, asthenosphere heating and core-complex formation) arises entirely from the initial condition imposed by the subduction of a small continental block. No specific condition is required regarding the rheology and erosion rate of HP rocks. The burial–exhumation cycle is transient and can recur every time a small continental block is subducted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{our use of}} {{scanning}} force microscopy (SFM) to study calcite dissolution rates. Until now, calculation of rates has been limited to surfaces on which steps retreat at an isotropic velocity. More commonly, on surfaces where steps in different directions retreat at different velocities, the rate depends on the velocities and the densities of the differently oriented steps. Here, we show that calculating rates from SFM image sequences is possible for anisotropic surfaces if the ration of step lengths in different directions is constant in the analyzed images (eg, by considering steps at nonintersecting pits exclusively). In contrast to nonintersecting pits, high velocity steps are formed at intersecting pits on the calcite (1014) surface. At these steps, material can be removed without the slow nucleation of kink sites. The morphology of these steps is not straight and they become easily pinned by particles or impurites. Therefore, measuring the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> step <b>retreat</b> directly in the images fails, but calculating the dissolution rate of surface regions with high velocity steps is still possible. Dissolution rate is roughly similar in both the deep etch pits and the areas with high volocity steps at intersecting pits. Consequently, we suggest that the formation <b>of</b> high <b>velocity</b> steps contributes considerably to the weak enhancement of the rate with increasing dislocation density because additional etch pits within the intersectional regions do not significantly increase the rate. The calculated dissolution rate of 1. 5 × 10 - 6 mol m- 2 s- 1 on the calcite (1014) surface in water at 24 -°C and pCO 2 = 10 - 3. 5 atm corresponds well to the rates obtained from batch experiments. Thus, SFM {{can be regarded as}} an instrument capable of acquiring rates even on surfaces with anisotropic step volocities. ...|$|R

The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> exhumation within the subduction channel or the accretionary complex, {{and thus the}} shape of P-T paths, depend upon the kinematic boundary conditions.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the origins, development and contemporary manifestations <b>of</b> Christian <b>retreats.</b> It traces origins from the Biblical record until current retreats. Christian retreat is a period of withdrawal from usual activities to experience encounter with God through Christian prayer. Jesus' pattern of engagement in ministry and withdrawal is a vital basis for retreat. Other Biblical descriptions <b>of</b> <b>retreat</b> are studied. There is an examination <b>of</b> <b>retreat</b> experiences in Church history with a particular focus on monasticism, as a major expression <b>of</b> <b>retreat</b> life, and Ignatius of Loyola, the founder <b>of</b> the modern <b>retreat</b> movement. Varieties <b>of</b> subsequent <b>retreat</b> types in the spiritualities of different traditions from the Protestant Reformation onwards are considered. The spectrum of study includes Protestant, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Pentecostal spiritualities. The study culminates in focusing on current Ignatian and other retreats in their many forms.

40|$|Previous work {{proposes that}} many {{trenches}} advance, but inferred motions vary considerably between different estimates of plate motion relative to hotspots. We remedy this by using recent estimates of absolute plate motions inferred from seismic anisotropy, incorporating the MORVEL relative plate angular velocities, and fully propagating the uncertainties.
