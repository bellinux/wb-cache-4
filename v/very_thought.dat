It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is the <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of this film —is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images become this thought, so that they become the evidence of this thought—and not in order to [...] "represent" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|The band were {{adamant about}} not {{replacing}} Duane's {{position in the}} band. Les Dudek, the guitarist who would eventually record [...] "Jessica" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] had entered the sessions {{when he was asked}} to jam with Betts through mutual friends. The band enjoyed how Dudek played and Phil Walden, the band's manager, seemed set on Dudek being in the band. Word of mouth, propagated by Dudek himself, was that he [...] "got the gig" [...] and had become the Allman Brothers' new co-lead guitarist. [...] "We went looking for this dude to kick his ass. Nobody was going to replace Duane and the <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of it was infuriating to us," [...] said Trucks. After recording completed, Dudek went on the road with Boz Scaggs and the Steve Miller Band. He wanted to end his contract with Phil Walden at Capricorn, and part of his release granted him no part of the publishing deal for Brothers and Sisters, including a songwriting credit for [...] "Jessica", as he had no written contract.|$|E

However, he continued to send her an allowance until her death. In 1870, she suggested visiting Fisher in England, but he dissuaded her as strongly as he could. Fisher wrote to his wife: [...] "I hate the <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of it and really, I don't want to see her. I don't see why I should as I haven't the slightest recollection of her." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{respect to}} the Orthodox Ukrainian {{population}} in eastern Poland, the Polish government initially issued a decree defending {{the rights of the}} Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the Catholics, also eager to strengthen their position, had stronger representation in the Sejm and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Catholic Church. During the Polish rule, 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed (although some of them have already been abandoned) and 150 were forcibly transformed into Catholic (not Ukrainian Catholic) churches. Such actions were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who claimed that these acts would [...] "destroy in the souls of our non-united Orthodox brothers the <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of any possibility of reunion." ...|$|E

He also reports two romantic Haryanvi folk tracks, apart from a hard rock song, world music, an Awadhi number and a song with 1970s-80s pop touch to it. The soundtrack received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critic Joginder Tuteja said, [...] "Chuck the <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> around whether this album will do well commercially or not; it is an exemplary piece of work and that's what that matters most."

2500|$|In May 2012, Paul {{was one of}} {{only seven}} Republicans to vote against a bill which, if passed, would have made {{performing}} or pressuring a woman into having a sex-selective abortion, or transporting a woman into the country or across state lines for the purpose of undergoing such an abortion, a federal crime, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. The bill would also have subjected nurses and other healthcare workers to fines and possible imprisonment for failing to report suspected violations of the law. Paul explained that although he found the <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> of sex-selective abortions revolting, he could not support the measure because it would be unconstitutional and would create [...] "yet another set of federal criminal laws, even though the Constitution lists only three federal crimes: piracy, treason, and counterfeiting."

2500|$|In 1896 the {{association}} appointed a [...] "Committee of Seven" [...] {{to develop a}} national standard for college admission requirements {{in the field of}} history. Before this time, individual colleges defined their own entrance requirements. After substantial surveys of prevailing teaching methods, emphases and curricula in secondary schools, the Committee published [...] "The Study of History in Schools" [...] in 1898. Their report largely defined the way history would be taught {{at the high school level}} as a preparation for college, and wrestled with issues about how the field should relate to the other social studies. The Committee recommended four blocks of Western history, to be taught in chronological order—ancient, medieval and modern European, English, and American history and civil government—and advised that teachers [...] "tell a story" [...] and [...] "bring out dramatic aspects" [...] to make history come alive.he student who is taught to consider political subjects in school, who is led to look at matters historically, has some mental equipment for a comprehension of the political and social problems that will confront him in everyday life, and has received practical preparation for social adaptation and for forceful participation in civic activities.... The pupil should see the growth of the institutions which surround him; he should see the work of men; he should study the living concrete facts of the past; he should know of nations that have risen and fallen; he should see tyranny, vulgarity, greed, benevolence, patriotism, self-sacrifice, brought out in the lives and works of men. So strongly has this <b>very</b> <b>thought</b> taken hold of writers of civil government, that they no longer content themselves with a description of the government as it is, but describe at considerable length the origin and development of the institutions of which they speak.|$|E
