This has been largely ignored in subsequent user interface developments. A single-word verb however is sometimes unclear, and so as to allow for multiple word menu names, {{the idea of a}} <b>vertical</b> <b>menu</b> was invented, as seen in NeXTSTEP.|$|E

It primarily used a <b>vertical</b> <b>menu</b> {{bar on the}} left-hand side of the screen, {{as well as the}} traditional horizontal menu bars across {{the top and bottom of}} the screen. As well as the new menu system, many more high-resolution background images were added - these were mostly relevant to whatever screen the player was viewing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe study {{reported}} in this paper investigates the effect of navigational mechanisms on students in a computer based assessment environment at a cross-cultural setting. Literatures in computer based assessment studies highlight the phenomenon of “test mode effect” that can explain the differences in test scores across two different formats of testing. In this study the authors posit that even different formats of presentation through the same media might affect students’ performance in a computer based assessment environment. The {{study reported}} here investigates the effect of two different navigational mechanisms namely, <b>vertical</b> <b>menu</b> and step based navigations on students’ performance. Students from Indian universities and American universities participated in the study. The results highlight that navigational mechanisms affect students’ performance and their subjective evaluation of the Computer based Assessment system. The {{results of the study}} would provide navigational heuristics for the Graphical User Interface designers to design a learner centered Computer based Assessment system...|$|E
40|$|Web sites need {{fast and}} {{effective}} navigation systems. An eye tracking laboratory study with n= 120 participants {{was conducted to}} compare the influence of different navigation designs (<b>vertical</b> versus dynamic <b>menus)</b> and task complexity (simple versus complex navigation tasks) on user performance, navigation strategy, and subjective preference. With <b>vertical</b> <b>menus,</b> users needed less eye fixations, were faster and more successful. We conclude that, firstly, <b>vertical</b> <b>menus</b> fit better to perception and cognition than dynamic menus, where the navigation items are hidden and must be accessed by an additional mouse click. Secondly, navigation systems should be extended with different kinds of navigation items adapted {{to the complexity of}} the users' navigation tasks, because users tend to switch their navigation strategy when confronted with complex tasks.

40|$|We {{present a}} set of {{graphical}} user interface elements, called widgets, for 2 -dimensional visual codes. The proposed widgets are suitable for printing on paper as well as showing on electronic displays. Visual code markers and their orientation parameters are recognizable by cameraequipped mobile devices in real time in the live camera image. The associated widgets are specifically designed for marker-based interaction. They define basic building blocks for creating applications that incorporate mobile devices as well as resources in the user’s environment, such as paper documents, posters, and public electronic displays. In particular, we present visual code <b>menus</b> (<b>vertical</b> <b>menus</b> and pie menus), check boxes, radio buttons, sliders, dials, and free-form input widgets. We describe the associated interaction idioms and outline potential application areas. 1...|$|R

Also, the OLED screen is no longer blue but displays 16-grey levels. The UI was also reworked compared to the U3: the <b>vertical</b> main <b>menu</b> changed to a horizontal menu, with some redesigned icons. And the [...] "Now playing" [...] screen now displays the album art if one {{is embedded in the}} tags. The U4 has three LEDs which can blink randomly or when pressing a button. It also has the standard DNSe 2.0 engine, including street mode, clarity, 3D and Bass effects as well as 10 EQ presets and a 7-band user EQ.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{an investigation}} by the authors into the efficiency and user opinions of menu positioning in web pages. While the idea and use of menus on web pages are not new, the authors feel there is not enough empirical evidence to help designers choo se an appropriate menu position. We therefore present the design and results of an empirical experiment, investigating the usability of menu positioning on web pages. A four condition experiment was conducted by the authors. Each condition tested a differe nt menu position. The menu positions tested were left vertical, right vertical, top horizontal and bottom horizontal. The context wa s a fictitious online store. The results, based on statistical analysis and statistically significant findings, suggest that the top horizontal and left <b>vertical</b> positioned <b>menus</b> incurred fewer errors and fewer mouse clicks. Furthermore, the user satisfaction ratings were in line with the effici ency aspects observed...|$|R
