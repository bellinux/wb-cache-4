40|$|The current paper {{discusses}} the Thermal Gauging Method (TGM) developed and employed for the propellant estimation of ARABSAT 2 B satellite. ARABSAT 2 B is a commercial geostationary telecommunications satellite {{owned and operated}} by the ARABSAT organization based in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. The satellite was built by Thales Alenia Space (Cannes, France) and launched in November 1996. It employs a standard bi-propellant chemical propulsion system. ARABSAT 2 B completed its design life of 12 years in 2008 with full functionality and is currently still in operation. The life limiting factor for this satellite is available propellant, hence the importance of a gauging method that determines propellant. It is shown that the TGM provides more accurate estimation of propellant remaining now than methods such as bookkeeping and PVT (Pressure-Volume-Temperature). The TGM (as other thermal methods) is based on a concept of measuring the thermal capacitance of a tank containing liquid fuel and pressurant gas by measuring the thermal response of the propellant tank to heating and comparing the observed temperature rise to simulation results. The current paper {{discusses the}} difference between different thermal methods, namely, TPGS, PGS and TGM. The TGM employs a <b>very</b> <b>sophisticate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Relativism and realism {{are often}} {{held to be}} in {{conflict}}. It is not obvious what {{the exact nature of}} the conflict is supposed to be, because it is not obvious what the two doctrines amount to. But that there is some kind of conflict between moral realism and moral relativism is evidenced by the fact that some take moral relativism to be the straightforward denial of moral realism. David Brink, for example, baldly states that ‘Moral relativism is usually understood as a denial of realism or objectivity about ethics’ (Brink 1989, 43). This definitional thesis is wrong. Even so, in the case of morality at least the tension between the two seems clear enough. Why? The moral realist holds inter alia that there are objective truths in the moral domain, and further that these objective truths are not mere human artefacts, but are backed up by special kinds of facts. The moral relativist, on the other hand, claims that judgements of right and wrong, permissibility and obligation, and so on, are in an important sense socially constructed; that they are human artefacts, perhaps of a <b>very</b> <b>sophisticate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{review the}} major {{achievements}} of the dynamical reduction program, showing why and how it provides a unified, consistent description of physical phenomena, from the microscopic quantum domain to the macroscopic classical one. We discuss the difficulties in generalizing the existing models in order to comprise also relativistic quantum field theories. We point out possible future lines of research, ranging from mathematical physics to phenomenology. 1. Quantum Mechanics, measurements and environment Standard Quantum Mechanics is known to talk only about the outcomes of measurements, but {{it has nothing to}} say about the world as it is, independently of any measurement or act of observation. This is a source of serious difficulties, which have been clearly elucidated e. g. by J. Bell [1]: It would seem that the theory is exclusively concerned about ‘results of measurements’, and has nothing to say about anything else. What exactly qualifies some physical systems {{to play the role of}} ‘measurer’? Was the wavefunction of the world waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared?

40|$|Electric {{power systems}} are {{nonlinear}} and complicate in nature. Along with increasing size of power systems, their complexity becomes more. Besides, by using additional and auxiliary components such as Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devises, Power System Stabilizers (PSSs), excitation systems, turbine-governor systems and etc, the dynamic model of network is increased and power system becomes more complicate. The nonlinear dynamic model of these large power systems is easily obtained. But, the complexity {{makes it difficult}} to obtain a linear dynamic model of power system. Obtaining an appropriate linear model is necessary in order to analysis and study of power system. In tradition method, a linear dynamic model of power system is obtained by linearization of nonlinear dynamic model around an operating condition. But in large electric power systems, the linearization technique is <b>very</b> <b>sophisticate</b> and maybe impossible. Concerning this matter, in this paper a Recursive Least Square (RLS) technique is used to parameter identification in a multi machine electric power system.

25|$|There is a {{positive}} relationship between national wealth and good health. The rich and industrialized countries of the world, prominently Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, spend a large proportion of their wealthy budget on the health care system. As, a result, their health care systems are <b>very</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> with many physicians, nurses, and other health care experts servicing the population. Thus, infant mortality is low. On the other hand, a country such as Mexico, which spends disproportionately less of its budget on healthcare, suffers from high mortality rates. This is because the general population is likely to be less healthy. In the U.S., infant mortality rates are especially high in minority groups. For instance, non-Hispanic black women have an infant mortality rate of 13.63 per 1000 live births whereas in non-Hispanic white women it was much lower at a rate of 5.76 per 1000 live births. The average infant mortality rate in the U.S. is 6.8 per 1000 live births.|$|E

Metalwork, including decoration in enamel, became <b>very</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral by Nicholas of Verdun. The bronze Gloucester candlestick and the brass font of 1108–17 now in Liège are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting, the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at Hildesheim Cathedral, the Gniezno Doors, and the doors of the Basilica di San Zeno in Verona are other substantial survivals. The aquamanile, a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic zoomorphic forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass.
