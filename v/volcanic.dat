5|$|La Reforma {{is one of}} 11 <b>volcanic</b> centres in Baja California. In {{addition}} to La Reforma-Tres Virgenes, the other centres are Cerro Prieto, El Pinacate, the San Quintin <b>volcanic</b> field, the Puertecitos <b>volcanic</b> province, San Luis Island, the Jaraguay <b>volcanic</b> field, the San Borja <b>volcanic</b> field, Punta Púlpito, the Mencenares <b>volcanic</b> complex and La Purísima.|$|E
5|$|The Andes are {{a site of}} <b>volcanic</b> activity, {{which is}} usually {{subdivided}} into four separate <b>volcanic</b> zones: the Northern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, the Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, the Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone and the Austral <b>Volcanic</b> Zone. These <b>volcanic</b> zones are separated by gaps where no recent <b>volcanic</b> activity has occurred. These gaps are not static; the gap separating the Austral and the Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zones has been moving northward for the past 15-20 million years.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos is a Holocene caldera {{in central}} Chile's Maule Region (7th Region). Part of the Chilean Andes' <b>volcanic</b> segment, it is {{considered}} {{a member of the}} Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone (SVZ), one of the three distinct <b>volcanic</b> belts of South America. This most active section of the Andes runs along central Chile's western edge, and includes more than 70 of Chile's stratovolcanoes and <b>volcanic</b> fields. Calabozos lies in an extremely remote area of poorly glaciated mountains.|$|E

50|$|The Macusani <b>volcanics</b> are the {{youngest}} <b>volcanics</b> of the Cordillera de Carabaya. By {{the time they}} were erupted the mountain range already existed. The Macusani <b>volcanics</b> are included into the Quenamari formation.|$|R
5|$|Currently the Wells Gray-Clearwater <b>volcanic</b> {{field is}} not {{monitored}} closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the <b>volcanic</b> field's magma system is. The existing network of seismographs {{has been established}} to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is {{too far away to}} provide a good indication of what is happening beneath the <b>volcanic</b> field. It may sense an increase in activity if the <b>volcanic</b> field becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only after the <b>volcanic</b> field has started erupting.|$|E
5|$|Diamond-bearing rock {{is carried}} from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin <b>volcanic</b> eruptions. The magma {{for such a}} volcano must {{originate}} at a depth where diamonds can be formed— or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface <b>volcanic</b> craters extend downward in formations known as <b>volcanic</b> pipes. The pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface by <b>volcanic</b> action, but was not ejected before the <b>volcanic</b> activity ceased. During eruption these pipes {{are open to the}} surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in <b>volcanic</b> pipes. Diamond-bearing <b>volcanic</b> pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Canadian {{volcanologist}} Catherine Hickson {{revealed that}} the Wells Gray-Clearwater <b>volcanic</b> field {{is not part of}} the Anahim <b>Volcanic</b> Belt, but rather a separate centre that most likely represents an area of lithospheric decompression melting caused by rifting along pre-existing crustal fractures. The Wells Gray-Clearwater <b>volcanic</b> field has since not been considered part of the Anahim <b>Volcanic</b> Belt and the Anahim hotspot is now believed to be in the area of Nazko Cone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Major, {{trace element}} and K-Ar age {{determinations}} are reported for a suite from the Yamadağı <b>volcanics</b> in the Eastern Anatolia. The exposed rocks mainly consist of medium-potassium calc-alkaline basaltic andesites, andesites and dacites. Petrographical data exhibit disequilibrium mineral textures, such as resorption of the ferromagnesian phases, clinopyroxene-mantled orthopyroxene, and sieve-textured plagioclases. The Yamadağı <b>volcanics</b> have a calk-alkaline character, and trace element characteristics exhibit that the <b>volcanics</b> resemble subduction zone <b>volcanics</b> and/or <b>volcanics</b> assimilated by continental crust. K/Ar age determinations {{show that the}} Yamadağı <b>volcanics</b> were formed during the 12 ± 0. 5 − 15 ± 0. 5 Ma time interval. Geochemical characteristics of these <b>volcanics</b> {{can be attributed to}} complex petrogenetic processes, including magma mixing and crustal assimilation along with fractional crystallization...|$|R

5|$|Laguna del Maule is a <b>volcanic</b> {{field in}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of Chile, close to, and partly overlapping, the Chile-Argentina frontier. The bulk of the <b>volcanic</b> field is in the Talca province of Chile's Maule Region. It is {{a segment of the}} Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, part of the Andean <b>Volcanic</b> Belt. Many of the <b>volcanic</b> centres in the Laguna del Maule <b>volcanic</b> field formed during postglacial times, after glaciers had retreated from the area. This activity has generated cones, lava domes, lava coulees and lava flows which surround Laguna del Maule lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the Maule river. Some of the <b>volcanic</b> centres were active during and before the last glaciation; at least three caldera formation events are associated with the system.|$|E
5|$|Proximal <b>volcanic</b> hazards pose a {{significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling <b>volcanic</b> ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As <b>volcanic</b> ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of <b>volcanic</b> ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} <b>volcanic</b> eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, <b>volcanic</b> bombs and <b>volcanic</b> blocks), and {{assorted}} gases are expelled from a <b>volcanic</b> vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes where {{that type of}} behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption {{during a period of}} activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.|$|E

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. In 1980, von der Borch {{suggested that the}} Adelaide Geosyncline formed {{as a result of}} a rift initiated in the Late Proterozoic. In 1984, Gunn added further to the idea, and proposed that the Roopena <b>Volcanics</b> represented alkaline igneous activity associated with the initial doming phase. The basaltic lavas of Depot Creek, Port Pirie, Wooltana, the Adelaide Geosyncline, and the Beda <b>Volcanics</b> represent tholeiitic flood basalts from a later rifting stage, with the Gairdner Dyke Swarm acting as feeder dykes to the basalts. In hand specimen the <b>volcanics</b> look very similar, i. e. red-brown to green-grey fine vesicular basalts, but in thin section they are quite different. The Beda <b>Volcanics</b> are merocrystalline with an intersertal texture, the main mineral being plagioclase with small patches of subophitic augite (maximum 10 %). The Gairdner Dyke Swarm rocks consist of either fine grained, curved branching augite with coarse laths of plagioclase and pehnocrysts of olivine set in an iron rich glass, or coarser grained holocrystalline ophitic rocks. The Depot Creek volvanics have a fine grained intersertal texture, consisting of potassium feldspar and recrystallised glass. The Port Pirie <b>Volcanics</b> are interbedded with both Calanna Group and Emeroo Subgroup sediments. The Emeroo <b>Volcanics</b> are intersertal fine grained rocks containing potassium feldspar and minor pyroxene set in an iron rich glassy ground mass. The Calanna <b>Volcanics</b> are subophitic in texture. Geochemically all the <b>volcanics</b> except the Port Pirie <b>Volcanics</b> are very similar, with the Beda <b>Volcanics</b> and Gairdner Dyke Swarm being the most fractionated. Magma chamber fractionation simulation studies suggest that the Gairdner Dykes were extruded from a crustal magma chamber of much greater depth, but the similar geochemistry suggests they may have stemmed from the same magma chamber as the other <b>volcanics.</b> Geochemical discrimination diagrams indicate the <b>volcanics</b> are tholeiitic continental flood basalts, and this is reinforced by using a spidergram plot developed by Pearce (1979). Comparison of these <b>volcanics</b> with <b>volcanics</b> from the central Karoo Province and northern Utah and southeastern Idaho on spidergrams show very similar trace element patterns. The basic <b>volcanics</b> of Depot Creek, Wooltana, and the Beda <b>Volcanics,</b> along with the Gairdner Dyke Swarm represent co-magmatic tholeiitic igneous activity associated with the Spencer Gulf rift. The more enriched Port Pirie <b>volcanics</b> were extruded at a later stage of the reactivation of the rift. Thesis (B. Sc.

5|$|Silverthrone {{is part of}} the Pemberton <b>Volcanic</b> Belt, {{which is}} {{circumscribed}} by a group of epizonal intrusions. At another deeply eroded caldera complex called Franklin Glacier Volcano, the Pemberton <b>Volcanic</b> Belt merges with the Garibaldi <b>Volcanic</b> Belt, a northwest-trending belt of <b>volcanic</b> cones and fields extending from near the Canada–United States border east of Vancouver on the British Columbia Coast. The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a <b>volcanic</b> front that was active in the Miocene, during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate. With the notable exception of King Island, all the intrusive and eruptive rocks are calc-alkaline, mainly granodioritic bodies and dacite ejecta.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range {{is part of}} an east-west {{trending}} <b>volcanic</b> zone {{called the}} Anahim <b>Volcanic</b> Belt. This consists of large shield volcanoes, small cinder cones, lava domes and lava flows that become progressively younger from west to east. Several explanations have been made regarding the creation of this feature, each citing a different geologic process. If <b>volcanic</b> activity were to resume at the Itcha Range, Canada's Interagency <b>Volcanic</b> Event Notification Plan (IVENP) is prepared to notify people threatened by eruptions.|$|E

5|$|<b>Volcanic</b> ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and <b>volcanic</b> glass, created during <b>volcanic</b> eruptions and measuring less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term <b>volcanic</b> ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. <b>Volcanic</b> ash is formed during explosive <b>volcanic</b> eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of <b>volcanic</b> rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E

The panjal <b>volcanics</b> structurally lie between the Panjal Thrust and the Main Boundary Thrust at the upper and lower structural levels, respectively. The Agglomeratic slates and the Panjal <b>volcanics</b> were formed in two phases In the first phase Agglomeratic slates were deposited in Late Carboniferous and were followed by the second phase eruptions of basaltic lavas that. took place during Permian to Triassic. The feeders to basaltic lavas in {{the northwest}} Himalaya of Pakistan have been dated at 284 Â± to 262 Â± 1 Ma by previous workers. The <b>volcanics</b> are characterized by massive lava flows and pillow lavas with intercalations of limestone and bedded chert.
