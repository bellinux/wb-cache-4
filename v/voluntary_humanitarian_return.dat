40|$|Humanitarian crises, {{including}} natural disasters, epidemics {{and armed}} conflicts are managed mainly by humanitarian NGOs (non governmental organizations). In their work, NGOs have to encounter challenging ethical dilemmas, within other social organizations {{this has led}} to aspects of professionalism. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze if and in that case how professionalism appears within Swedish humanitarian NGOs who work within international humanitarian aid. To meet the purpose of the study, four different Swedish NGOs have been studied through semi-structured interviews with five unit chiefs and two officers within humanitarian departments. The empirical material implied an organizational perspective to understand how external pressures influenced the NGOs ability to either accept or challenge these pressures towards professionalism. Theoretical concepts by Bourdieu have also been used to analyze environmental terms within the field of NGOs and their internal abilities to adapt to these conditions. The results of the study indicated that the humanitarian field of NGOs can be divided into a theoretical and practical hierarchy between professional and <b>voluntary</b> <b>humanitarian</b> work. The professional part of the hierarchy within the Swedish departments had adapted all aspects of professionalism, whilst some of these aspects also had influenced the voluntary work in the local countries exposed to disasters. This division can also be understood within a western societal development towards an increase in scientific knowledge in favour of knowledge based on social interactions. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{appraise}} {{the literature}} related to <b>voluntary</b> <b>humanitarian</b> work provided by international nurses in low to {{middle income countries}} (LMICs). Background Nurses and other health professionals are engaged with both governmental and non-governmental organisations to provide care within international humanitarian relief and development contexts. Current literature describes accounts of charitable health professional activity within short-term health focused humanitarian trips; however, there is minimal research describing the care that nurses provide and the professional roles and tasks they fulfil whilst participating in international volunteer health care service. Design Integrative review. Methods A search of articles published between 1995 - 2015 was conducted using seven bibliographic databases. Inclusion criteria incorporated nurses and allied health professionals’ involvement in a volunteer short term medical team capacity. Papers describing military and/or disaster response, with a service learning focus were excluded. Nineteen papers were selected for review, description and discussion of findings. Results Findings revealed limited data describing the care nurses provide and the professional roles and tasks they fulfil {{within the context of}} international humanitarian short-term medical trips. Issues raised included a description of demographic data regarding participants and sending agencies, motivation for volunteer participation, perceptions of effectiveness of particular programmes and sustainability issues related to cultural, ethical or moral obligations of foreign health professionals working in a LMIC. Conclusion Study findings highlighted that although nurses are recruited and participate in health-focused humanitarian activities in LMICs, there is extremely limited documented research about the amount and type of care that nurses specifically provide in this context. Furthermore, when identified, it is most often hidden within studies outlining services provided by health care teams and not specific to the discipline of nursing. Further research is therefore required to enable greater understanding of nursing care in this context, and to inform prospective volunteers of expected nursing practice. Relevance to Clinical Practice This paper provides an analysis of available literature describing nursing involvement within the particular context of short term medical teams delivering charitable health care...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} on volunteering in Norway and the voluntary sector is an important part of the Norwegian welfare society. Volunteering helps us to socialize people into a life in the Norwegian society. At the same time, it is an important function as an organizer of different interest groups. The <b>voluntary</b> and <b>humanitarian</b> organizations have a central role in implementing public policy. In view of the increasing interest for Odda Municipality and Trolltunga, and the need for assistance related to bad weather conditions and accidents related to the trip, I wanted to find out what motivates members of the local Red Cross Act to participate as volunteers. Traditional economic theory assumes that human beings are self-centered by nature and that they will act out of what is best for us. That's why I've looked at motivational factors for volunteers to put down the effort they make - unprofitable and for the community's best. In this assignment, I have chosen a quantitative approach in the form of a questionnaire. This survey was sent to all the active members of the three Red Cross teams in Odda Municipality; Odda, Tyssedal and Røldal Red Cross. The data that I collected in this survey has then been interpreted and analyzed against my chosen theory. The results of the survey show that being part of a social group motivates members. Here they get the chance to build a larger social network, make new friends and grow self-confidence. In addition, the results indicate that volunteers are motivated by acquiring new experiences and knowledge through practical experience. The survey also shows that the volunteers feel strongly connected towards the Red Cross organization...|$|R

40|$|In 2015, {{military}} {{conflicts and}} related humanitarian crises neighbouring areas of Europe made {{millions of people}} leave their homes. Europe, including Finland, experienced a rapid {{increase in the number}} of asylum seekers. In this article, we examine the reception of asylum seekers by Finnish higher education institutions mainly by analysing media data written about and written by universities and universities of applied sciences in Finland. The higher education institutions, in keeping with their societal role, spontaneously developed various kinds of pop-up courses, co-operation projects and other activities for asylum seekers. These activities range from crisis work to medical clinics and sports events to language teaching. This led us to ask in this article, whether new tasks were emerging in the Finnish higher education institutions’ understanding of the societal role of higher education. This main question is operationalised in three subquestions. Firstly, we are interested in seeing how higher education institutions motivate their actions on developing activities for asylum seekers. Secondly, we analyse the goals and gainers of these activities. Thirdly, we discuss the challenges faced by the higher education institutions in their refugee and asylum seeker activities. Based on our findings, we suggest that new kinds of <b>voluntary</b> and <b>humanitarian</b> activities appear to be emerging at Finnish higher education institutions, as they responded to the {{increase in the number of}} asylum seekers, suggesting a change in the traditions of societal impact of Finnish higher education. Our analysis also shows an apparent paradox in the activities of the institutions: while they had no way of knowing how many asylum seekers will remain in Finland, they still organised activities that implied staying in Finland for a longer time. The higher education institutions themselves benefitted from the activities: they could exhibit their expertise and previous research in the area of immigrant studies, and aspects of service-learning system of societal activity could be taken into their curricula. Helping the asylum seekers brought the university community together while the asylum seekers themselves remained passive objects of the activities...|$|R
