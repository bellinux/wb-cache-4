Project phases include: •	Concept stage •	Material selection •	Prototyping o	Number of 3 D printout using stereolithography o	Laser cutting of cutter blades o	Manufacturing {{of a number of}} <b>VAC</b> <b>form</b> mouldings •	Testing Most packaging techniques require complementary opening tools (scissors/knife) which cause significant safety risks to the user. ‘Easy Open’ provides users the flexibility to access the purchased product at any time. The technique is based on advanced materials/typology, caused by highly localised pressure resulting in polymer melt enabling a slice-through. The company provided an idea of using vacuum-formed guide groove where the plastic packaging walls are intentionally thinned, contributing to the reduction of waste materials in current packaging. The design take into account the increasing requirement for safer & simplified solutions for consumers of special needs, i. e. elderly, infirm or disabled...|$|R
50|$|Non-governmental organisations formed {{swiftly and}} have {{remained}} prominent in addressing AIDS in Australia. The most notable include the AIDS Trust of Australia, formed in 1987, The Victorian AIDS Council (<b>VAC),</b> <b>formed</b> in July 1983, and the Bobby Goldsmith Foundation, founded in mid 1984. The Bobby Goldsmith Foundation {{is one of}} Australia's oldest HIV/AIDS charities. The Foundation is named in honour of Bobby Goldsmith, one of Australia's early victims of the disease, who was an athlete and active gay community member, who won 17 medals in swimming at the first Gay Olympics, in San Francisco in 1982. The Foundation had its origins in a network of friends who organised care for Goldsmith {{to allow him to}} live independently during his illness, until his death in June 1984. This approach to supporting care and independent living in the community is the basis of the Foundation's work, but is also an approach reflected in the activities and priorities of many HIV/AIDS organisations in Australia.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a seismic interpretational study of {{amplitude}} anomalies in the East Falkland basin using an extensive grid of approximately 8000 line kilometers (4971 line miles) of high-resolution two-dimensional seismic reflection data. We mapped 474 discrete amplitude anomalies developed within a dominantly hemipelagic and highly reflective megasequence of the Cretaceous to early Cenozoic that is distributed in a northeast-southwest swath across the basin. The amplitude anomalies range from a kilometer to over 25 km (15. 5 mi) in lateral extent, have sharp lateral amplitude cutoffs, sometimes at faulted margins, and are invariably associated with reflections with negative acoustic impedance contrasts. They exhibit class III amplitude versus offset (AVO) responses, frequency shadows, and push-down effects, from which the amplitude anomalies are interpreted as related to free gas. All the amplitude anomalies are characterized by vertical clustering, and based on this strong spatial association we refer to these mappable groups of amplitude anomalies as vertical anomaly clusters (VACs). We suggest that <b>VACs</b> <b>form</b> by strongly focused vertical hydrocarbon migration in a heterogeneous stacked sequence of poor-quality reservoirs interbedded with layers with lower permeability, and where the necessary bottom-to-top cross-stratal flow exploits a well-developed fault and fracture network. Similar vertical associations of gas-related amplitude anomalies could be expected in many other basins, so VACs may be a useful direct hydrocarbon indicator with specific genetic significance for hydrocarbon migration mechanisms...|$|R

Questions of {{identification}} of the mortgage devices (MD) on tunnel diodes which are in a waiting mode or work for record in memory of a chip, by means of nonlinear radars are considered. Conditions of change of a ratio on opposite between levels of spectral components of a scattered signal when sounding by the nonlinear radar of the considered class of mortgage devices are investigated. Inverse change of this ratio significantly worsens reliability of an identification sign of nonlinear scatterers based on the ratio of levels of multiple harmonics of a response signal.

40|$|Abstract Background Village AIDS {{committees}} (<b>VAC)</b> were <b>formed</b> by the Tanzanian {{government in}} 2003 to provide HIV education to their communities. However, their potential {{has not been}} realised due to their limited knowledge and misconceptions surrounding HIV, which could be addressed through training of VAC members. In an attempt to increase HIV knowledge levels and address common misconceptions amongst the VACs, an HIV curriculum was delivered to members in rural north western Tanzania. Methods An evaluation of HIV knowledge was conducted prior to and post-delivery of HIV training sessions, within members of three VACs in Kisesa ward. Quantitative surveys were used with several open-ended questions to identify local misconceptions and evaluate HIV knowledge levels. Short educational training sessions covering HIV transmission, prevention and treatment were conducted, with each VAC using quizzes, role-plays and participatory learning and action tools. Post-training surveys occurred up to seven days after the final training session. Results Before the training, "good" HIV knowledge was higher amongst men than women (p = 0. 041), and among those with previous HIV education (p = 0. 002). The trade-centre had a faster turn-over of VAC members, and proximity to the trade-centre {{was associated with a}} shorter time on the committee. Training improved HIV knowledge levels with more members achieving a "good" score in the post-training survey compared with the baseline survey (p = Conclusions In this setting, a series of HIV training sessions for VACs demonstrated encouraging results, with increased HIV knowledge levels following short educational sessions. Further work is required to assess the success of VAC members in disseminating this HIV education to their communities, as well as up-scaling this pilot study to other regions in Tanzania with different misconceptions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since 1970, the {{orthotic}} {{management of}} myelomeningocele children treated at Indiana University has {{focused primarily on}} musculo skeletal deformities that develop after birth. Much of our effort has been directed to children with L 3 through L 5 lesions, because of their potential to be community walkers. 1 The deci sion to direct {{our attention to the}} problems that these lesion levels present also relates {{to the fact that they}} constitute the majority group among the myelomeningocele population. The range of orthotic dysfunctions, in kind or degree, that children with these lesion levels are prone to today, are identical to the orthotic dysfunctions that like youngsters had to endure in 1970. Myelomeningocele remains "the most com plex, treatable congenital anomaly consistent with l i fe. " 2 What has changed, in the interim, is our understanding of the pathodynamics act ing upon the musculoskeletal systems of chil dren with L 3 through L 5 lesions. The introduc tion of thermoplastic materials, along with <b>vac</b> uum <b>forming</b> techniques, now allow orthotists greater freedom of design. Consequently, there is a gradual change occurring in orthotic man agement, from the traditional approach based upon statics, to a growing appreciation of dy namics as a means of preserving function by preventing the formation of secondary dysfunc tions caused by gravity, growth, and time. How may one describe the benefits these changes portend for the L 3 through L 5 myelomeningo cele child, present and future? It now appears that while present-day children with L 3 through L 5 lesions may have the same vulnerability to secondary dysfunctions as the children of 1970 [...] . they may not have to endure them, in kind or degree. Those concerned with the care of these chil dren face the same dilemma today as was experi enced in 1970 —how to provide long-term pro tection from secondary dysfunctions without in troducing unacceptable inhibitions to daily ac tivities. Fortunately, some of the specific chal lenges within the makeup of this dilemma have been satisfactorily met...|$|R
40|$|Recently, interferon-induced transmembrane {{proteins}} (IFITMs) {{have been}} identified to be key effector molecules in the host type I interferon defense system. The invasion of host cells by a large range of RNA viruses is inhibited by IFITMs during the en-try step. However, the roles of IFITMs in DNA virus infections have not been studied in detail. In this study, we report that hu-man cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a large human DNA virus, exploits IFITMs to facilitate {{the formation of the}} virion assembly compartment (vAC) during infection of human fibroblasts. We found that IFITMs were expressed constitutively in human em-bryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC 5 cells). HCMV infection inhibited IFITM protein accumulation in the later stages of infection. Overexpression of an IFITM protein inMRC 5 cells slightly enhanced HCMV production and knockdown of IFITMs by RNA interference reduced the virus titer by about 100 -fold on day 8 postinfection, according to the findings of a virus yield assay at a lowmultiplicity of infection. Virus gene expression and DNA synthesis were not affected, but the typical round structure of the <b>vAC</b> was not <b>formed</b> after the suppression of IFITMs, thereby resulting in defective virion assembly and the production of less infectious virion particles. Interestingly, the replication of herpes simplex virus, a human herpesvirus that is closely related to HCMV, was not affected by the suppression of IFITMs inMRC 5 cells. These results indicate that IFITMs are involved in a spe-cific pathway required for HCMV replication. IMPORTANC...|$|R
40|$|The Autographa californica {{multiple}} nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) GP 64 {{protein is}} an essential virion protein that is involved in both receptor binding and membrane fusion during viral entry. Genetic {{studies have shown that}} GP 64 -null viruses are unable to move from cell to cell and this results from a defect in the assembly and production of budded virions (BV). To further examine requirements for virion budding, we asked whether a GP 64 -null baculovirus, vAc 64 −, could be pseudotyped by introducing a heterologous viral envelope protein (vesicular stomatitis virus G protein [VSV-G]) into its membrane and whether the resulting virus was infectious. To address this question, we generated a stably transfected insect Sf 9 cell line (Sf 9 VSV-G) that inducibly expresses the VSV-G protein upon infection with AcMNPV Sf 9 VSV-G and Sf 9 cells were infected with vAc 64 −, and cells were monitored for infection and for movement of infection from cell to cell. <b>vAc</b> 64 − <b>formed</b> plaques on Sf 9 VSV-G cells but not on Sf 9 cells, and plaques formed on Sf 9 VSV-G cells were observed only after prolonged intervals. Passage and amplification of vAc 64 − on Sf 9 VSV-G cells resulted in pseudotyped virus particles that contained the VSV-G protein. Cell-to-cell propagation of vAc 64 − in the G-expressing cells was delayed in comparison to wild-type (wt) AcMNPV, and growth curves showed that pseudotyped vAc 64 − was generated at titers of approximately 106 to 107 infectious units (IU) /ml, compared with titers of approximately 108 IU/ml for wt AcMNPV. Propagation and amplification of pseudotyped vAc 64 − virions in Sf 9 VSV-G cells suggests that the VSV-G protein may either possess the signals necessary for baculovirus BV assembly and budding at the cell surface or may otherwise facilitate production of infectious baculovirus virions. The functional complementation of GP 64 -null viruses by VSV-G protein was further demonstrated by identification of a vAc 64 −-derived virus that had acquired the G gene through recombination with Sf 9 VSV-G cellular DNA. GP 64 -null viruses expressing the VSV-G gene were capable of productive infection, replication, and propagation in Sf 9 cells...|$|R
