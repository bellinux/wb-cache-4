5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly <b>vaccinate</b> infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is a {{prospective}} study of mycobacterial infections in children. The aims of the study were: - to ascertain the incidence of mycobacterial diseases in BCG <b>vaccinated</b> and BCG non <b>vaccinated</b> children, - to compare the risk of mycobacterial diseases in BCG <b>vaccinated</b> and BCG non <b>vaccinated</b> children, - to evaluate the clinical status and laboratory levels in tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial disease. The risk of tuberculosis in children between 1 - 8 years of age in BCG non <b>vaccinated</b> and BCG <b>vaccinated</b> cohort is not statistically significant. The risk of nontuberculous avian mycobacteriosis is significantly higher in BCG non <b>vaccinated</b> cohort. BCG immunization in newborns significantly protects children between 0 - 8 years of age against Mycobacterium avium disease. BCG non <b>vaccinated</b> children between 1 - 5 years of age are the most endangered group for these infections.

Bactericidal activity of freshly drawn heparinized blood against the organism was determined after each vaccination. In all cases bactericidal activity of the blood of <b>vaccinated</b> rabbits was higher than for nonvaccinated rabbits. The in vitro bactericidal activity of the blood was determined in two separate experiments. In experiment I the bactericidal activity of the blood of rabbits <b>vaccinated</b> with PGB antigen {{was the same as}} that of rabbits <b>vaccinated</b> with WC antigen and higher than that of rabbits <b>vaccinated</b> with A antigen after the third vaccination.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} compares {{the profile of}} NK cells in an in vitro re-exposure by Vaccinia virus (VACV), in groups that have had a {{previous}} vaccination or natural infection. Our data suggests that stimulation with VACV triggers a cytotoxic response by NK cells marked by an increase of NCRs: NKp 30, NKp 44, and NKp 46 in infected (<b>vaccinated</b> and unvaccinated) subjects and in non-infected <b>vaccinated</b> patients, when compared with non-infected unvaccinated individuals. However, the degranulation and secretion processes are inhibited in infected (<b>vaccinated</b> and unvaccinated) subjects and in the non-infected <b>vaccinated</b> patients, when compared with non-infected unvaccinated individuals. We demonstrated that stimulation with VACV downregulates the percentage of expression of Perforin, Granzyme A, and CD 107 a, but upregulate CD 94 in infected (<b>vaccinated</b> and unvaccinated) subjects and in non-infected <b>vaccinated</b> patients, when compared with non-infected unvaccinated individuals. Furthermore, the percentage of IFN-Œ≥+ NK cells was significantly lower in non-infected unvaccinated subjects, when compared with infected (<b>vaccinated</b> and unvaccinated) and non-infected <b>vaccinated</b> individuals.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} risk factors for measles vaccine failure and to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a selective revaccination strategy during a measles outbreak. DESIGN: Matched case-control study. SETTING: Thirty-one schools in Mississauga, Ont. SUBJECTS: Eighty-seven previously <b>vaccinated</b> school-aged children with measles that met the Advisory Committee on Epidemiology's clinical case definition for measles. Two previously <b>vaccinated</b> control subjects were randomly selected for each case subject from the same homeroom class. INTERVENTIONS: All susceptible contacts were <b>vaccinated,</b> and contacts who had been <b>vaccinated</b> before Jan. 1, 1980, were revaccinated. When two or more cases occurred in a school all children <b>vaccinated</b> before 1980 were revaccinated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of measles associated with age at vaccination, time since vaccination, vaccination before 1980 and revaccination. RESULTS: Subjects <b>vaccinated</b> before 12 months of age were at greater risk of measles than those <b>vaccinated</b> later (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 6 to 38. 3; p = 0. 01). Those <b>vaccinated</b> between 12 and 14 months of age were at no greater risk than those <b>vaccinated</b> at 15 months or over. Subjects <b>vaccinated</b> before 1980 were at greater risk than those <b>vaccinated</b> after 1980 (adjusted OR 14. 5, 95 % CI 1. 5 to 135. 6). Time since vaccination was not a risk factor. Revaccination was effective in reducing the risk of measles in both subjects <b>vaccinated</b> before 1980 and those <b>vaccinated</b> after 1980 (adjusted OR reduced to 0. 6 [95 % CI 0. 1 to 5. 3] and 0. 3 [95 % CI 0. 13 to 2. 6] respectively). However, only 18 cases were estimated to have been prevented by this strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to routine measles vaccination for all eligible children is important in ensuring appropriate coverage with a single dose. The selective revaccination strategy's high labour intensiveness and low measles prevention rate during the outbreak bring into question the effectiveness of such a strategy...|$|R
25|$|After Edward Jenner's 1796 {{demonstration}} that the smallpox vaccination worked, the technique became better known and smallpox became less deadly in the United States and elsewhere. Many colonists and natives were vaccinated, although, in some cases, officials tried to <b>vaccinate</b> natives {{only to discover}} that the disease was too widespread to stop.

25|$|Multiple {{measures}} {{were used to}} contain the potential outbreak {{in the town of}} Merca. The response was coordinated by Weisfeld and Karl Markvart.

There were 91 people who had been in face-to-face contact with Maalin, 12 of whom were unvaccinated. Some of his contacts lived up to 120km outside the town. All contacts were kept under surveillance for six weeks. His face-to-face contacts and their families were vaccinated, but none showed any sign of having been infected. Merca Hospital was closed to new patients, all its medical staff were vaccinated and existing patients were quarantined in situ. The residents of the fifty houses neighbouring Maalin's lodgings were vaccinated, and vaccinations were later extended to the ward of the town in which Maalin lived. House-to-house searches throughout the entire town looked for cases.

The study is a nationwide register-based cohort study. Both the HPV and the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccines were offered to 12 -year-old girls in Denmark in the study period (2008 - 2015).
