2500|$|In the {{carpentry}} industry, {{the timber}} {{is referred to}} as satin walnut [...] {{and is one of the}} most important materials for plywood manufacturers. It is used for furniture, interior trim, railroad ties, cigar boxes, crates, flooring, barrels, woodenware, and wood pulp. It is also used for veneer for plywood. The wood is very compact and fine-grained, the heartwood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, <b>veneer,</b> <b>plywood,</b> slack cooperage, fuel, and pulpwood. The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, cabinets for radios, televisions, and phonographs, interior trim, and millwork. The veneer and plywood, (typically backed with some other kind of wood which shrinks and warps less) are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork. [...] It was formerly used in the interior finish of railroad sleeping cars. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes substituted for ebony for such uses as inexpensive picture frames.|$|E

5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including <b>veneered</b> <b>plywood</b> and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|R

Weyerhaeuser opened its Springfield complex in 1949, and after years of aggressive logging was forced to downsize as old growth lumber became less available. In the 1990s, the Weyerhaeuser sawmill and <b>veneer</b> (<b>plywood)</b> plants closed, and the paper plant was downsized. Springfield has now developed a more diversified economy.|$|E
50|$|Timber is pale blond, {{and is a}} {{commercial}} species, under the name Australian White Birch. The timber was notably used as an interior finish in the Sydney Opera House. <b>Plywood</b> <b>veneered</b> with Schizomeria ovata {{was used for the}} ceiling, upper walls, and seating of the Concert Hall, and for wall and ceiling panelling and doors in other internal areas. The Schizomeria ovata veneer had been specially dyed to meet the Opera House specifications at the <b>Veneer</b> and <b>Plywood</b> Pty Ltd. plant at Yarras in the Hastings valley and was given the commercial name of 'Cinnamon birch', a warm 'cinnamon' color.|$|R

Preliminary tests were performed to determine plywood sample size, replication, and treating schedule. ACZA produced better preservative treatment than CCA in plywood from all regions. For both treatments, outer veneers had higher preservative penetration than inner <b>veneers.</b> <b>Plywood</b> panels from Washington, Oregon, or Idaho were similar in treatability and were better treated than plywood from Montana. Differences in plywood treatability between Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana differed from those previously found in lumber. Species composition and veneer distribution also influenced plywood treatability. Within a geographic region log source was linked to plywood treatability in panels containing only one species...|$|R
50|$|Columbia Forest Products is {{the largest}} {{manufacturer}} of hardwood <b>veneer</b> and hardwood <b>plywood</b> in the United States. Founded in 1957, it is headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The company distributes its products primarily through a network of wholesale distributors, mass merchandisers and OEMs. Since 1976, the company has been completely employee-owned and currently has 10 manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and Canada. At the end of 2006, Columbia converted all of its standard hardwood plywood production to produce formaldehyde-free panels called PureBond. In 2007 Columbia added PureBond formaldehyde-free particleboard to its product range.|$|R

50|$|It is {{a medium}} weight timber (about 680 kg/m³) and rather coarse (stringy) in texture. Gum veins are common. The wood {{is easy to}} work and the grain is {{straight}} with long, clear sections without knots. The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending.Primary uses for sawn wood are furniture, flooring (where its very pale blonde colour is highly prized), panelling, <b>veneer,</b> <b>plywood,</b> window frames, general construction. The wood has sometimes been used for wood wool and cooperage. However, the wood needs steam reconditioning for high value applications, due to a tendency to collapse on drying.

In addition, the walls are angled inward at 4 degrees to [...] "create a compressive structure with a low center of gravity further aiding in resistance to lateral turnover forces produced by strong earthquakes."

50|$|Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation was {{involved}} {{with the development of}} a plastic <b>veneer</b> <b>plywood</b> called Plymold. It was known also as duramold plywood by the Fairchild Engine and Aircraft Corporation. These veneer wood pieces were infused with phenolic resin synthetics for extra strength. They could be shaped into three dimensions which was advantageous for airplane and ship parts. Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation added 21000 ft2 m2 of floor space to their existing building in Grand Rapids in 1942. The main purpose for this was the need for special shaped plywood pieces for WWII military airplane body parts and ship interior parts. The plymold material was also used in railway cars, buses, automobiles, and boats.|$|E
50|$|Although the Egyptians {{achieved}} extraordinary {{feats of}} engineering, {{they appear to}} have done so with relatively primitive technology. As far as is known they did not use wheels or pulleys. They transported massive stones over great distances using rollers, ropes and sledges hauled by large numbers of workers. The ancient Egyptians are credited with inventing the ramp, lever, lathe, oven, ship, paper, irrigation system, window awning, door, glass, a form of plaster of Paris, the bath, lock, shadoof, weaving, a standardized measurement system, geometry, silo, a method of drilling stone, saw, steam power, proportional scale drawings, enameling, <b>veneer,</b> <b>plywood,</b> rope truss, and more.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Face {{checking}} in decorative maple <b>veneered</b> <b>plywood</b> panels {{is a significant}} problem for hardwood plywood manufacturers, furniture makers, cabinetmakers, and consumers. Efforts made by panel producers and researchers to minimize checking conducted to-­‐date have been limited, and produced contradictory results. In this study the impact of four manufacturing factors believed to contribute to check development in decorative maple veneer panels were determined. The factors investigated were face veneer thickness and preparation, lathe-­‐check orientation, adhesive and core type. An efficient, automated, optical technique based on digital image correlation principles was developed and used to detect and measure checks as they develop. The novel new method for characterizing check severity and development was effective in efficiently measuring checking for {{a substantial number of}} samples. The results of the factor screening analysis reveal intricate four way interactions between factor levels contribute to check development, and that some combinations are likely to exhibit much more checking than others...|$|R

Samples of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 in.) thick and 19. 05 mm (3 / 4 in.) thick oak <b>veneer</b> <b>plywood</b> were coated with 3, 6, and 9 coats of either oil-based polyurethane or water-based polycrylic clear finishes and tested at incident heat fluxes of 35, 50, and 75 kW/m 2 along with uncoated samples. Both {{the type of}} finish {{and the number of}} coatings were found to influence the ignition time, the measured peak heat release rate, and the minimum flux for ignition of the samples. The ignition times for the coated samples were 2 to 3 times lower than the unfinished samples. Predicted times to ignition differed by a factor of 2 to 3 from the measured values (with the exception of the samples with nine coats of finish.) The predicted ignition temperatures differed by as much as 100 ºC from the measured temperatures. The Quintiere flammability parameter, b, was found to be positive for all testing scenarios, suggesting a propensity for flame spread at the incident heat fluxes evaluated...|$|E
