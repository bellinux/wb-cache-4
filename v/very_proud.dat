5|$|We had Belzer in {{the band}} for six months. I {{want to believe it}} was purely musical, and I {{honestly}} believe that it wasn't working musically.

And Bill was and is a <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E

60|$|The urchin {{had found}} out that when once Cherry's crutch was out of her reach she could not get at him; and he had ridden off upon it so often, before {{committing}} any of his worst misdemeanours, that Cherry always lay down on it to secure it. After all, he was a fine, affectionate, impetuous little fellow, but with a <b>very</b> high, <b>proud,</b> unmanageable will; and she was <b>very</b> fond and <b>proud</b> of him; but never more so than when he slept till dinner-time.|$|R

She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E

Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of the}} first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena.

6000|$|Thus, {{there had}} come to the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale--as to most men, in their various spheres, though seldom {{recognised}} until they see it far behind them--an epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one, or than any which could hereafter be. He stood, at this moment, on the <b>very</b> <b>proudest</b> eminence of superiority, to which the gifts or intellect, rich lore, prevailing eloquence, and a reputation of whitest sanctity, could exalt a clergyman in New England's earliest days, when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal. Such was the position which the minister occupied, as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit at the close of his Election Sermon. Meanwhile Hester Prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory, with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast! ...|$|R

The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E

5|$|When he was {{fourteen}} {{he was sent}} to Winchester College, which was known as both the most academic of the main public schools and also for its discomfort. Schuster's time at St George's had prepared him for discomfort, however, and he was noted as being <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> of attending the school. While at Winchester Schuster played Winchester College football and was occasionally involved in debates; he was not, however, noted as a particularly exceptional pupil. He matriculated at New College, Oxford in 1888 and graduated with a second-class degree in history in 1892; again he was not noted as a particularly outstanding student, which was attributed to the time he spent enjoying himself rather than studying. Despite his lack of academic brilliance he was invited to present the Romanes Lecture in 1949, an honour normally only given to the most eminent alumni of Oxford. After graduation, he applied to become a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford but was rejected.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah but,' {{you will}} say, 'we like what is right, {{but we do}} not always do it. We like to see pity and mercy: but we are <b>very</b> often <b>proud</b> and selfish and tyrannical.
