50|$|ANSI T1.413 is a {{technical}} standard {{that defines the}} requirements for the single asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) for the interface between the telecommunications network and the customer installation {{in terms of their}} interaction and electrical characteristics. ADSL allows the provision of <b>voiceband</b> <b>services</b> including plain old telephone service (POTS) and data services up to 56 kbit/s, and a variety of digital channels. In the direction from the network to the customer premises (downstream), the digital bearer channels may consist of full-duplex low-speed bearer channels and simpler high-speed bearer channels; in the other (upstream) direction, only low-speed bearer channels are provided.|$|E
40|$|This {{standard}} {{presents the}} electrical {{characteristics of the}} Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) signals appearing at the network interface. The physical interface between the network and the customer installation is also described. The transport medium for the signals is a single twisted-wire pair that sup-ports Plain Old Tephone <b>Service</b> (POTS) or <b>voiceband</b> data <b>services</b> and high-speed duplex (simulta-neous two-way) and simplex (from the network to the customer installation) digital services. This interface standard provides the minimal set of requirements for satisfactory transmission between the network and the customer installation. Equipment may be implemented with additional functions and procedures. Approval of an American National Standard requires review by ANSI that the requirements for due process, consensus, and other criteria for approval have been met by the standards developer. Consensus is established when, in the judgement of the ANSI Board of Standards Review, substantial agreement has been reached by directly and materially affected interests. Substantial agreement means much more tha...|$|R
