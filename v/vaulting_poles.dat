5000|$|John Thomas Pennel (July 25, 1940 - September 26, 1993) was an American pole vaulter, and four-time {{world record}} holder.

30|$|However, in some cases, a {{technology}} which creates {{some level of}} re-skilling can be eventually adopted by a sport’s governing body within its constitutive rules. For example, the digging of holes to locate the athlete’s pole in the sport of pole-vaulting was initially considered unethical and subsequently banned by athletics’ governing body. However its structure, dimensions and position was actually later formally adopted by them (VerSteeg 2005). Likewise, the adoption of fibreglass <b>vaulting</b> <b>poles</b> in the 1950 ’s radically altered the achievable heights by athletes (Dyer et al. 2010) and required athletes to modify their technique (VerSteeg 2005). Fibreglass poles provide an increased mechanical advantage and increased vaulting height to its user by bringing the ends closer together as it bends, thereby temporarily lowering the vaulter’s handgrip. As a result, the pole shortens its overall length by 15 – 25  % and allows the vaulter to raise their grip in turn by 15 – 25  % above the height that {{they are capable of}} holding without bending the pole (VerSteeg 2005). The new material was initially sanctioned by the international governing body in 1962 but then temporarily banned them in 1972 when it was felt they would have a detrimental impact in the Munich Olympics (VerSteeg 2005). This ban was later overturned. The impact of any governing body changing its mind was also identified in this review. In cycling, Graeme Obree introduced several revolutionary bicycle designs which were raced but then later legislated against (Trabal 2008). However, this example is considered on the boundary of inclusion in this review as it was felt that it was their novel riding position (rather than the actual bicycle), that formed the source of any controversy. One of Obree’s innovations was the ‘superman’ riding position which provided a more aerodynamically efficient method of cycling (Miah 2006).|$|E
