5|$|After its creation, SEATO {{quickly became}} {{insignificant}} militarily, {{as most of}} its member nations contributed <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> the alliance. While SEATO military forces held joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in conflicts in Laos because France and the United Kingdom rejected use of military action. As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962. Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the Vietnam War was denied {{because of lack of}} British and French cooperation.|$|E

As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|The name Molluscoida was {{formerly}} used to denote {{a division of}} the animal kingdom containing the brachiopods, bryozoans, and tunicates, the members of the three groups having been supposed to somewhat resemble the molluscs. As it is now known these groups have no relation to molluscs, and <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> one another, the name Molluscoida has been abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} Little Ice Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 1916, Kippenberger {{underwent}} {{basic training}} at Trentham Military Camp {{as part of}} the 12th Reinforcement of the NZEF. On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus has a {{complicated}} taxonomic history, beginning in 1902 with Lawrence Lambe's naming of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally GSC 419) from Alberta as Trachodon marginatus. Paleontologists began finding better remains of hadrosaurids {{from the same}} rocks in the 1910s, {{in what is now}} known as the late Campanian-age (Upper Cretaceous) Dinosaur Park Formation. Lambe assigned two new skulls to T. marginatus, and based on the new information, coined the genus Stephanosaurus for the species in 1914. Unfortunately, there was <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> associate the skulls with the scrappy earlier marginatus material, so in 1923 William Parks proposed a new genus and species for the skulls, with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe: Lambeosaurus lambei (type specimen NMC 2869, originally GSC 2869).|$|E

5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E
5|$|Thus in this version, Simon did not {{immediately}} demolish the Acra, but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself. 1 Maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate. The fortress had been built as an internal checkpoint to monitor and control Jerusalem and its population. If situated in the City of David as most scholars agree, its location would have added <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem's defenses against external threats. It may have fallen out of use and been dismantled {{around the end of}} the 2nd century BCE following the construction of the Hasmonean Baris and Hasmonean Palace in Jerusalem's upper city.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E

5|$|Martín de Ursúa {{had little}} {{interest}} in administering the newly conquered territory and delegated its control to military officers who he did <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> support, either militarily or financially. With Nojpetén safely {{in the hands of the}} Spanish, Ursúa returned to Mérida, leaving Kan Ek' and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, isolated among the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ladino civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to Santiago; Ajaw Kan Ek' and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the colonial capital.|$|E

25|$|In October 1834 a great fire {{destroyed}} {{much of the}} Palace of Westminster, which Adelaide considered divine retribution for {{the vagaries}} of reform. When the Whig ministry of Lord Melbourne was dismissed by the King, The Times newspaper blamed the Queen's influence, though {{she seems to have}} had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with it. Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the Duke of Cumberland, she did write to the King against reform of the Church of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of Black hairstyles involve parting the natural hair into individual sections before styling. Research shows that excessive braiding, tight cornrows, relaxing, and vigorous dry-combing of afro-textured hair can {{be harmful to}} the hair and scalp. They have also been known to cause ailments such as alopecia, balding {{at the edges of}} the scalp, excessive dry scalp, and bruises on the scalp.

25|$|However, some {{computational}} {{problems are}} easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources.

The non-deterministic Turing machine has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time {{is a very important}} resource in analyzing computational problems.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — {{as reported in the}} earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E

A PC version was proposed for 1995, but the plan was abandoned when the series finished. The latter game was an RPG similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye Of The Beholder games which, whilst well received at the time, had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with the TV series besides the fantasy setting.|$|E
