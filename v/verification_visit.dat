5000|$|Electronic <b>visit</b> <b>verification</b> {{was created}} to help cut down on fraud and ensure that people receive the {{documented}} care they need. EVV was designed to help verify that services billed for home healthcare are for actual visits made. The passing of the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010 made provisions for the cut down of fraud and over-payments, requiring states to stop Medicaid payments to providers when there is credible evidence of fraud. At least 10 states implemented an office of inspector general to oversee Medicaid fraud investigations, with many moving towards a system of verifying home healthcare visits {{in order to help}} reduce fraud.Several states have introduced electronic <b>visit</b> <b>verification</b> with some mandating it for home healthcare. In January 2014, Illinois became the first state to mandate the use of EVV when the Department of Human Services required it for its home services program. As of June 1, 2015, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission mandates that electronic <b>visit</b> <b>verification</b> be used for all home healthcare visits billed to the state. [...] The state of Ohio began the process of implementing an electronic verification system that would be used starting in 2016. It estimated the use of EVV will save the state approximately $9.5 million in its first two years of use. Other states that use but do not mandate EVV include Louisiana, Alaska, and Tennessee.|$|R

40|$|The Physical Model (PM) is an {{internal}} multi-Volume document for the IAEA’s Department of Safeguards describing the nuclear fuel cycle. This report describes work {{carried out by}} the JRC with the IAEA to prototype the integration of the PM with The Big Table (TBT), a document search tool developed by the JRC and in use at the IAEA. The core of TBT is an integrated collection of reference documents including regulatory documents, technical handbooks and trade nomenclatures. The documents are stored in a database. They are searchable by text in a structured way (i. e. on database fields) and also by correspondence tables that relate items by their meaning. To integrate the Physical Model into TBT, the IAEA/SG/SGIM has first turned the PM into a tabular format. JRC has then proposed and implemented a way of coding the PM in TBT tables to better reflect the PM structure. Eleven PM Volumes have been integrated in a TBT-PM database for use by the IAEA. The PM Volumes are linked by correspondence tables to other documents in the TBT collection. By coding the Physical Model into a TBT database format, the original intended uses of the PM are still supported. TBT can ease the consultation of the PM for evaluating States’ nuclear activities by IAEA’s analysts. TBT can be an aid for IAEA’s inspectors preparing for routine and ad hoc inspections, design information <b>verification</b> <b>visits</b> and complementary access operations. Further the PM integrated into TBT {{can be used as a}} tool for training inspectors on steps of the nuclear fuel cycle. Finally implementing the Physical Model multi-level structure into a database-coded format opens the possibility of linking the PM to other taxonomies and collections of open sources relevant for safeguards analyses.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{places with}} poor vital registration, {{measurement}} of maternal mortality and monitoring {{the impact of}} interventions on maternal mortality is difficult and seldom undertaken. Mortality ratios are often estimated and policy decisions made without robust evidence. This paper presents a prospective key informant system to measure maternal mortality and the initial findings from the system. Methods In a population of 228 186, key informants identified all births and deaths to women of reproductive age, prospectively, {{over a period of}} 110 weeks. After birth <b>verification,</b> interviewers <b>visited</b> households six to eight weeks after delivery to collect information on the ante-partum, intra-partum and post-partum periods, as well as birth outcomes. For all deaths to women of reproductive age they ascertained whether they could be classified as maternal, pregnancy related or late maternal and if so, verbal autopsies were conducted. Results 13 602 births were identified, with a crude birth rate of 28. 2 per 1000 population (C. I. 27. 7 – 28. 6) and a maternal mortality ratio of 722 per 100 000 live births (C. I. 591 – 882) recorded. Maternal deaths comprised 29 % of all deaths to women aged 15 – 49. Approximately a quarter of maternal deaths occurred ante-partum, a half intra-partum and a quarter post-partum. Haemorrhage was the commonest cause of all maternal deaths (25 %), but causation varied between the ante-partum, intra-partum and post-partum periods. The cost of operating the surveillance system was US$ 386 a month, or US$ 0. 02 per capita per year. Conclusion This low cost key informant surveillance system produced high, but plausible birth and death rates in this remote population in India. This method could be used to monitor trends in maternal mortality and to test the impact of interventions in large populations with poor vital registration and thus assist policy makers in making evidence-based decisions. </p...|$|R
5000|$|When the [...] "Vietnam" [...] war finally stopped, {{the huge}} number of bombs which had been dropped on Indo-China became apparent, as did the very high {{proportion}} which had not exploded as they hit the trees and soft soil. It was {{at the invitation of}} the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) that Alford was enabled, in February 2000, to return to Laos, which he had first visited during the war. Accompanied by his son Roland, they tested the usefulness of the precursor of the Vulcan at rendering safe the larger bombs without destroying for a second or third time the village which had been targeted during the war. This led to the production of the Vulcan itself and further <b>verification</b> and instructional <b>visits</b> to Laos followed and valuable data was gathered which contributed to the device going into use in many countries. In 1987, Alford's invention and ownership of water lined and water projecting shaped charge technology was reluctantly recognised by the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD). A settlement was reached with Alford, enabling UK MOD to legitimately develop their own water-based charge technology which incorporated Alford's ideas.|$|R
40|$|Hail {{insurance}} {{is provided by}} the private sector in South Africa but crop insurance (drought insurance) programmes, after a promising start, failed to attract customers. A crop insurance programme (drought) for small-scale commercial farmers, who are not yet paying tax, has been recommended to government. The purpose in this research is to study the economic viability of such a programme drawing on the US experience. The US programme is well developed but heavily subsidised. During 1998 US growers paid $ 900 million in premiums while during 1995 - 98 the US government spent $ 1. 2 billion per year on subsidies. An area insurance plan (farmers are insured as a group) is shown to be more appropriate for small farmers growing dryland field crops such as maize because risk is systemic (drought related) while adverse selection, moral hazard etc are overcome. Individual crop insurance will not be viable due to the cost of farm <b>visits</b> (<b>verification</b> of claims) and the non-availability of information. As {{a large part of the}} cost to government goes to administration of crop insurance it is recommended that an Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) scheme for small growers receive serious consideration with the government making a contribution as for example in Canada.

40|$|Thesis (PhD. (Law) North-Wets University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues of}} anti-dumping law and practice from a critical and juridical analysis position. In particular, the thesis seeks {{to determine whether}} the South African anti-dumping regime is compliant with the anti-dumping regime of the World Trade Organization (hereafter WTO), and to consider possible solutions for addressing instances where the South African law is not WTO compatible. The thesis departs from the hypothesis that the WTO merely requires functional equivalence of the implementation of national legislation on anti-dumping, and not the verbatim adoption of WTO jurisprudence and relevant provisions of the Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994 (hereafter URAA), into the legislation of State Parties. Some of the provisions of the URAA are not completely clear, and are cast in convoluted and complicated technical jargon, leaving loopholes that may be justifiably exploited by State Parties. The study in this thesis was achieved through the critical analysis of legislation and relevant legal documents, case law and contemporary literature. The primary research paradigm used in this study is interpretive and analytical, which is the same as qualitative research methodology. The legal comparative research method, with a historical component, also {{played an important role in}} this study. The literature study undertaken and the critical analyses made of the South African anti-dumping regime show mixed findings. The South African antidumping regime was found to have both positive aspects and problematic aspects when compared with WTO regulations. Some of the critical areas of the South African anti-dumping regime are WTO compatible whilst others are not. In some areas the South African anti-dumping regime has adopted functionally equivalent provisions to the provisions of the WTO law. However, the practice of the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) is sometimes fraught with inconsistencies. The compatibility of the South African anti-dumping system with the WTO regime came close to being examined by the WTO on 1 April 1999 in the dispute of South Africa - Anti-dumping Duties on the Import of Certain Pharmaceutical Products from India based on allegations that the method for calculating normal value used by the ITAC was found to be inconsistent with the URAA. Similarly, the conformity of the procedures and findings of the International Trade and Administration Act (ITAA) in anti-dumping cases came under attack in the cases of Algorax v The International Trade Administration Commission and others, and Scaw v The International Trade Administration Commission and others, respectively. Finally, the thesis ends with recommendations in response to the challenges identified and key submissions made throughout the analysis. Key recommendations include the broadening of the concept of interested parties to include registered trade unions and trade union federations; introducing an explicit and mandatory "public Interests" provision to ensure that South Africa's anti-dumping administration is free from political trappings in the form of the involvement of the Minister of Trade and Industry; introducing the new section 31 bis of the ADR in order to allow the initiation of anti-dumping petitions by a registered trade union or trade union federation; providing procedural guidelines for self-initiation of anti-dumping petitions by the ITAC; increasing transparency in anti-dumping proceedings and enquires; setting realistic time-lines for all anti-dumping processes and ensuring compliance with the same; improving the institutional and functional capacity of the ITAC; amending section 18. 3 of the ADR to allow search and seizure operations pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 and the Customs Act; having a clear provision on <b>verification</b> <b>visits</b> confidentiality and a clear provision on producer knowledge; introducing a clear provision in the ADR dealing explicitly with zeroing pursuant to Article 2. 4. 3 (ii) of URAA; and the introduction of duty refund procedures. It is hoped that the recommendations made in this thesis, which are in the form of suggested legislative interventions required to upgrade certain areas of South African anti-dumping law and practice to be fully WTO compliant, will influence the introduction of suitably crafted anti-dumping legislation in South Africa. It is further hoped that the thesis will become an invaluable source of information for practitioners and students, and a critical source on the best practice for the imposition and implementation of anti-dumping measures. Moreover, the thesis will add to the body of academic writing on South African anti-dumping law. Doctora...|$|R
