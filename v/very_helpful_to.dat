5|$|Leterrier had {{to direct}} four units {{with a broken}} foot. Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting {{primarily}} took place in Toronto, because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to be <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day. The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out. There was also shooting in the Financial District. A factory in Hamilton, Ontario, which was due for demolition, was {{the interior of the}} Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center. The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a backlot in Hamilton. Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. While there, the crew shot at Rocinha, Lapa, Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.|$|E

500|$|Hutchinson {{was born}} in Alford, Lincolnshire, England, the {{daughter}} of Francis Marbury, an Anglican cleric and school teacher who gave her a far better education than most other girls received. [...] She lived in London as a young adult, and there married her old friend from home William Hutchinson. The couple moved back to Alford where they began following dynamic preacher John Cotton in the nearby port of Boston, Lincolnshire. Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633, and the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 11 children and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in New England. [...] Anne was a midwife and <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> those needing her assistance, as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings. [...] Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly, providing commentary on recent sermons. These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well, including the young governor of the colony Henry Vane.|$|E

500|$|Many Dutch statesmen were {{essentially}} politiques; they soon became disenchanted with the Earl's enthusiastic fostering {{of what he}} called [...] "the religion". His most loyal friends were the Calvinists at Utrecht and Friesland, provinces in constant opposition to Holland and Zeeland. Those rich provinces engaged in a lucrative trade with Spain which was <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> either side's war effort. On Elizabeth's orders Leicester enforced a ban on this trade with the enemy, thus alienating the wealthy Dutch merchants. He also effected a fiscal reform. In order to centralise finances and to replace the highly corrupt tax farming with direct taxation, a new Council of Finances was established which was not under supervision of the Council of State. The Dutch members of the Council of State were outraged at these bold steps. English peace talks with Spain behind Leicester's back, which had started within days after he had left England, undermined his position further.|$|E
500|$|Elements of {{the book}} were rewritten while several songs {{underwent}} minor transformations. This included the excision of [...] "Which Way is the Party?", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, which was subsequently replaced by [...] "Dancing Through Life" [...] in Schwartz's fear that the former failed to be a clear [...] "statement of Fiyero's philosophy of life". In addition, there was concern that Menzel's Elphaba [...] "got a little overshadowed" [...] by Chenoweth's Glinda. San Francisco Chronicle critic Robert Hurwitt wrote, [...] "Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [...] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda", so the creative team set about making her character [...] "more prominent". On {{the subject of the}} Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, [...] "It was clear there was work to be done and revisions {{to be made in the}} book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> us. We learned a lot from the reviews, which were honest and constructive in the aggregate, unlike New York, where the critics make up their minds before they come to the theatre." [...] On October 30, 2003, the musical opened on Broadway.|$|E
500|$|Tesla never married, {{explaining}} that his chastity was <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> his scientific abilities. He once said in earlier {{years that he}} felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This [...] "new woman" [...] was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In {{an interview with the}} Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, [...] "In place of the soft voiced, gentle woman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me". Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.|$|E

2500|$|The debate {{likewise}} covered {{an upcoming}} {{vote on the}} use of coercive interrogation methods on enemy combatants. Allen stated that he had not yet made a decision on how to vote, but stated [...] "Now, the key {{in all of this is}} I don’t want to stop these interrogations. I’m not for torture, I’m not for waterboarding, but some of these techniques have been <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> us, whether they are sleep deprivation, or whether there’s loud music. And I need to be absolutely certain that what the interrogations — interrogators are doing now — which is completely fine as far as I’m concerned, protecting Americans — will not be harmed by the proposal." [...] Webb expressed that this was an issue close to him as a former soldier, but also stated that he did not believe interrogations should be ended completely. Webb however reaffirmed his concerns that if the U.S. abandons the Geneva Convention its soldiers will suffer abroad.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{problems}} with Dershowitz's {{heavy reliance on}} Morris. The first is that Morris is hardly the left-wing peacenik that Dershowitz makes him out to be, which means that calling him as a witness in Israel's defense is not <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> the case. The more important problem {{is that many of}} the points Dershowitz cites Morris as supporting—that the early Zionists wanted peaceful coexistence with the Arabs, that the Arabs began the 1948 War to destroy Israel, that the Arabs were guilty of many massacres while the Israelis were scrupulous about protecting human rights, and that the Arabs fled at the behest of their leaders rather than being ethnically cleansed by the Israel Defense Forces—turn out to be based on a partial reading or misreading of Morris's books. Finkelstein documents these charges in exhaustive detail in Appendix II of his book and the preponderance of evidence he provides is conclusive." [...] (30–31) ...|$|E

60|$|However, I {{did come}} away, and lived {{almost a year}} more with my honest old woman, and began now to be <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> her; for I was almost {{fourteen}} years old, was tall of my age, and looked a little womanish; but I had such a taste of genteel living at the lady's house that I was not so easy in my old quarters as I used to be, and I thought it was fine to be a gentlewoman indeed, for I had quite other notions of a gentlewoman now than I had before; and as I thought, I say, that it was fine to be a gentlewoman, so I loved to be among gentlewomen, and therefore I longed to be there again.|$|E
