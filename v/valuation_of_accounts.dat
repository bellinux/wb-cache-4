40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{evidence}} pertaining to accounting valuation and accounting earnings. The paper presents evidence so far on how capital markets value accounting information with specific reference to accounting earnings numbers. Design/Methodology/Approach: The specific review of the development of models used in <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> information is beyond the scope of this study. However, the paper makes a general review of literature on how capital markets value accounting information with specific reference to accounting earnings numbers. Findings: It is evident from literature review that accounting information is related to prices and market value; therefore accounting earnings are related to market returns. However, evidence is provided that <b>accounting</b> earnings consists <b>of</b> different components such as cash flows, non discretionary accruals and discretionary accruals; each with different implications on market valuation. Originality/Value: This paper is the first review of its kind that focuses specifically on the market <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> earnings...|$|R

Using both cross-sectional and time-series valuation models, we first find that the market accords less weight to earnings when the accounting numbers are fraudulent. We also show that the market better anticipates the presence of fraud when there is information {{in the public domain}} indicating a high ex-ante risk of fraud. Our findings suggest that investors are able to accurately assess the probability of fraud and that such assessments affect the market's <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> earnings even before it is publicly announced that fraud has occurred. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Specifically, we test for valuation differences in the boom and crash relative to the more stable 1980 s. Additionally, we investigate whether accounting variables, growth, and insider retention of technology IPOs and internet IPOs are valued differently. Our major findings are as follows. For profitable non-tech firms in the 1980 s, income, sales, R&D, industry price-to-sales comparables, and insider retention are positively related to offer values. In the boom period, relative to the 1980 s, income, industry comparables, and insider retention are valued more. Sales, book value of equity, and R&D are valued less. The finding on income is surprising and contrary to claims made in the financial press. In the crash period, relative to the 1980 s, income is valued more, but R&D and industry comparables are valued less. We also document that, relative to the boom period, crash period sales were valued more, whereas insider retention and industry comparables were valued less. Relative to non-tec...|$|R

Although there is an agreement of mutual recognition in the European stock markets of financial statements adapted to the directives, the differences between the European countries are still great. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the value relevance <b>of</b> alternative <b>accounting</b> measures (earnings and book value) constructed under different accounting systems in Europe. We investigate the differences in accounting practices through the relationship between earnings and book value, and the stock market value of the firm. The aim of the study is to answer the following three questions: (1) Are there systematic differences in value relevance between earnings and book value across the different European accounting systems? (2) Do book value and earnings convey different information to stock valuation? (3) Are accounting numbers more value relevant in those countries traditionally orientated to market investors? The sample consists of listed firms from eight European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain and the UK).

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, this study {{develops}} a new firm-level conservatism measure from the Basu (1997) model and then examines the consistency {{and validity of}} the new conservatism measure and two extant firm-level conservatism measures, Beaver and Ryan 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) and accruals-based approaches. Because Basu 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) and Beaver and Ryan 2 ̆ 7 s (2000) market-based conservatism measures represent conservatism measures from an income statement and balance sheet perspective, respectively, I further suggest two reasons that may cause the two measures capture different aspects of conservatism, i. e., different contracting roles of the two financial statements and different time period inherent in the two statements 2 ̆ 7 preparation. ^ In the second chapter, this study investigates whether firm-specific accounting conservatism is positively related to the market <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> information presented in the income statement and/or balance sheet. I test whether conservatism is valued by the market, using three alternative firm-specific conservatism measures. In each market and accounting data regression, I include a firm-specific conservatism variable and interactions between the firm-specific conservatism variable and accounting variables. The results show that the market assigns higher value to the conservatively reported balance sheet information but not income statement information. Moreover, I find that conservatism does not improve the return-earnings relation because conservatism makes earnings less timely and predictable when accounting conservatism is measured from income statement perspective, i. e., accruals and modified Basu (1997) approaches. I do not find the same impact of conservatism on earnings when the balance sheet conservatism measure is employed. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Accounting</b> <b>of</b> {{intangible}} assets have increased {{during the last}} years which have created a debate about if trademarks should be accounted as assets with {{the uncertainty of the}} value in mind. <b>Valuation</b> and <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> trademarks are of interest for accountants and investors. These should be able toget information about the assets that are of importance for the company. A solid brand can be of great value for a company, which should be accounted for. Purpose: The purpose of this master is to examine the function of the brand in the different companies in the study and map the definitions that the different companies have of brands. We also want to describe and investigate how and why companies choose to present its brands and also investigate the reliability of the used methods <b>of</b> <b>valuation.</b> Accomplishment: To fulfil our purpose, the annual reports from the companies on the Stockholm Stock Exchange were studied. An inquiry was sent to complement the collected information. For further draught we interviewed a lender and a brand expert. Result: Companies define a brand from three different perspectives; marketing-, accounting- and legally perspectives. The companies definitions differ depending on which line of business they work. The most important functions of the brand also differ depending on which line of business they work, generally the companies bring out the distinction and the customer loyalty functions of the brand. Six of the 33 companies in the study has valuated their trademarks. These also have chosen to activate the obtained values. The fact that all companies that have valued its trademarks also activate them may have its reason in that they don´t see a relevance in just valuating the trademark for internal use. The methods <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> the companies have used are the Cash-flow method, the cost- based method <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> and the market-based method <b>of</b> <b>valuation.</b> In <b>accounting</b> <b>of</b> trademarks the companies bring out the precautionary principle and solely aquired trademarks are activated in accordance to RR 15...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that because <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> conservatism, the contemporaneous correlation between returns and earnings is lower (higher) for good (bad) news firm-years. Meanwhile, prior analytical agency work suggests that the compensation role <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> earnings is potentially greater (for tasks such as noise filtering and incentive balancing) when the contemporaneous correlation between earnings and returns is lower. Hence, since accounting conservatism implies that earnings have a lower correlation with returns in good news firm-years, the present paper hypothesises that UK CEO cash compensation exhibits a stronger (weaker) sensitivity to accounting earnings in good (bad) news firm-years. The empirical findings offer substantial support for this hypothesis and are robust to alternative estimation methodologies. In addition, the results appear not to be attributable to the well-established impact of earnings persistence on the compensation-earnings association. Overall, the {{findings are consistent with}} the notion that UK compensation committees appear to take cognisance of the impact <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> conservatism when awarding earnings-based compensation. In addition, the present work offers additional insights into the nature of the interaction between the contracting and <b>valuation</b> roles <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> numbers. ...|$|R

40|$|We use a {{variance}} decomposition {{approach to}} examine why aggregate valuation ratios differ across countries. In {{a cross section}} of 22 developed countries from 1980 to 2009, we find that 50 percent of all cross-country differences in the aggregate price-to-book ratio (P/B) can be explained by cross-country differences in expected future five-year profitability. In the second half of our sample period, this percentage exceeds that of the first half, rising to almost 64 percent. Although international differences in accounting standards and conventions may have made earnings from different countries more difficult to compare relative to dividends, we find that it is still cross-country differences in expected future profitability, rather than dividend growth rates, that are more closely related to international differences in valuation ratios. Even among 25 emerging markets, we find that expected future profitability at the five-year horizon can account for 29 percent of all cross-country P/B variations.
