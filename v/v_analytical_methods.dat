40|$|A new {{electrochemical}} methodology {{has been}} developed {{for the detection of}} ozone using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The method presented here is based on the reaction of ozone with indigo blue dye producing anthranilic acid (ATN). The electrochemical profile of ATN on an electrode of glassy carbon (GC) modified with MWCNT showed an oxidation peak potential at 750 mV <b>vs.</b> Ag/AgCl. An <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> was developed using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) to determine ATN in a range of 50 - 400 nmol L(- 1), with a detection limit of 9. 7 nmol L(- 1). Ozonated water samples were successfully analyzed by GC/MWCNT electrode and the recovery procedure yielded values between of 96. 5 and 102. 3 %.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} and the geometric {{properties of the}} Potential Energy Surfaces (PES) of the k-Trigonometric Model (kTM), defined by a fully-connected k-body interaction. This model has no thermodynamic transition for k= 1, a second order one for k= 2, and a first order one for k> 2. In this paper we i) show that the single particle dynamics {{can be traced back}} to an effective dynamical system (with only one degree of freedom); ii) compute the diffusion constant analytically; iii) determine analytically several properties of the self correlation functions apart from the relaxation times which we calculate numerically; iv) relate the collective correlation functions to the ones of the effective degree of freedom using an exact Dyson-like equation; <b>v)</b> using two <b>analytical</b> <b>methods,</b> calculate the saddles of the PES that are visited by the system evolving at fixed temperature. On the one hand we minimize |grad V|^ 2, as usually done in the numerical study of supercooled liquids and, on the other hand, we compute the saddles with minimum distance (in configuration space) from initial equilibrium configurations. We find the same result from the two calculations and we speculate that the coincidence might go beyond the specific model investigated here. Comment: 36 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|Modes in {{equilateral}} triangle resonator (ETR) are analyzed and classified {{according to the}} irreducible representations of the point group C- 3 <b>v.,</b> Both the <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> based on the far field emission and the numerical method by FDTD technique are {{used to calculate the}} quality factors (Q-factors) of the doubly degenerate states in ETR. Results obtained from the two methods are in reasonable agreement. Considering the different symmetry properties of the doubly degenerate eigenstates, we also discuss the ETR joined with an output waveguide at one of the vertices by FDTD technique and the Pade approximation. The variation of Q-factors versus width of output waveguide is analyzed. The numerical results show that doubly degenerate eigenstates of TM 0. 36 and TM 0. 38 whose wavelengths are around 1. 5 mu m in the resonator with side-length of 5 mu m have the Q-factors larger than 1000 when the width of the output waveguide is smaller than 0. 4 mu m. When the width of the output waveguide is set to 0. 3 mu m, the symmetrical states that are more efficiently coupled to output waveguide have Q-factors about 8000, which are over 3 times larger than those of asymmetric state.

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the ICH Q 8 document concerning the development of pharmaceutical processes following a Quality by Design (QbD) approach, there have been many discussions on the opportunity for <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> developments to follow a similar approach. A key component of the QbD paradigm is the definition of the Design Space of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> where assurance of quality is provided.

40|$|The Nile {{problem by}} Ronald Fisher may be {{interpreted}} as the problem of making statistical inference for a special curved exponential family when the minimal sufficient statistic is incomplete. The problem itself and its versions for general curved exponential families pose a mathematical-statistical challenge: studying the subalgebras of ancillary statistics within the σ-algebra of the (incomplete) minimal sufficient statistics and closely related questions {{of the structure of}} UMVUEs. In this paper a new method is developed that, in particular, proves that in the classical Nile problem no statistic subject to mild natural conditions is a UMVUE. The method almost solves an old problem of the existence of UMVUEs. The method is purely statistical (<b>vs.</b> <b>analytical)</b> and works for any family possessing an ancillary statistic. It complements an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> that uses only the first order ancillarity (and thus works when the existence of ancillary subalgebras is an open problem) and works for curved exponential families with polynomial constraints on the canonical parameters of which the Nile problem is a special case...|$|R

40|$|<b>Analytical</b> <b>method</b> {{validation}} is {{a mandatory}} step {{to evaluate the}} ability of developed methods to provide accurate results for their routine application in order to trust the critical decisions that will be made with them. Even if several guidelines exist to help perform <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validations (ICH Q 2 R 1 [1], USP [2], …) {{there is still the}} need to clarify the meaning and interpretation of <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation criteria and methodology. Indeed, actually method validation is mostly realised as the traditional check list implementation of e. g. the ICH Q 2 R 1 or USP method validation requirements. However, within the trend of Quality by Design [3], there is the need to switch from this traditional vision to an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation really adding value and providing a high level of assurance of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> results reliability. Yet, different interpretations can be made of the validation guidelines {{as well as for the}} definitions of the validation criteria. This will lead to diverse experimental designs implemented to try fulfilling these criteria. Finally, different decision methodologies can also be interpreted from these guidelines. Therefore, the risk that a validated <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> may be unfit for its future purpose will depend on a personal interpretation of these guidelines. The objective of this presentation is thus to show that <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation should be planned and performed by first starting with the end in mind: what is the objective of the <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> under study? In such a way <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation is coherent with the actual Quality by Design regulatory expectations. The risk of having validated an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> unfit for its purpose is strongly reduced as well as the risk of generating Out of Specification (OOS) results due to an unfit method.
