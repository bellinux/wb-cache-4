[...] Their efforts were assisted by Commissioner Hla Aung {{and his partner}} Mya May, along with several young Burmese artists including Ba Zaw, Ba <b>Nyan,</b> Tha Dun, <b>Tun</b> Hla, and Ba Kyi. [...] Located {{on the grounds of}} the Rangoon Government High School, [...] the Burma Art Club was a colonial art institution with the objective of promoting Western-style painting and drawing, including cartooning, to select Burmese students. [...] It has been suggested by art historian Andrew Ranard that: [...] Burmese students who studied cartoon art at the Burma Art Club felt some affinity for this new genre because it possessed elements of exaggeration with which they were already familiar in Traditional painting… Pagan painting and the mural painting of Burma from the 17th to 19th centuries had a strong taste for caricature in its depictions of fairy-tale figures, demons, and beasts… [...] Among the first initiates to receive training from the establishment were the now notable Burmese cartoonists Ba Gale, also known as Shwe Talay or Shwe Yoe, and Ba Gyan. [...] It is considered that the beginning of Burma’s comic art movement was defined by these individuals.|$|R
