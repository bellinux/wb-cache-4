30|$|The {{majority}} of yellow dye {{used on the}} green samples from both Persian and Indian <b>velvets</b> was yellow larkspur (Figure  4). The UYD-A was also used on a few Persian <b>velvets</b> (Figure  5 A). Turmeric was used on green samples {{of some of those}} Indian <b>velvets</b> (Figure  6). This summary is different from the yellow samples of those Indian <b>velvets</b> where yellow larkspur was not used as often.|$|R

30|$|There {{seem to be}} {{types of}} dyes which {{specifically}} characterize the <b>velvets</b> of each culture, as well as types of dyes commonly found in <b>velvets</b> of both cultures. Dyes typical of Persian <b>velvets</b> are cochineal and yellow larkspur, while lac and turmeric are characteristic of Indian <b>velvets.</b> The dyes commonly found are a combination of yellow larkspur and indigo dye in green, as well as safflower, indigo dye, soluble redwoods, and tannin dye. There were exceptions however. Because of those exceptions, examining the range of dyes used in the <b>velvets</b> would be important in differentiating the <b>velvets.</b> Metal used for wrapping the threads was in all cases found to be silver of fairly high purity, the majority {{of which had been}} gilded. The silver from Persia metal threads showed very slightly higher copper content, while Indian threads showed nearly pure silver. This is the first extensive comparative study of dyes and metal threads of Safavid and Mughal velvets: the first evidence of yellow larkspur being the most used yellow dye in Persia, and of the possible differences in the two cultures’ metal threads.|$|R
