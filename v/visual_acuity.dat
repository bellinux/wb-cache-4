5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits <b>visual</b> <b>acuity.</b> Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E

40|$|Pur po se: To {{analyze the}} visual {{functions}} {{of patients who}} had cataract operation and accommodative intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Ma te ri al and Met hod: Simultaneous bilateral phacoemulsification and Crystalens HD accommodative IOL implantation were performed to 30 eyes of 15 patients {{who had come to}} our clinic with bilateral cataracts. Dominant eyes were planned to be emmetropic and non-dominant eyes were planned to be 0. 75 diopters (D) myopic. Postoperative early examinations and 3 month-interval routine eye and refractive examinations were performed. Mean follow-up time was 23. 1 ± 2. 6 months. Uncorrected and far corrected, monocular and binocular far and near <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were analyzed. Re sults: At the first postoperative month, mean spherical and cylinder refractions were 0. 00 ± 1. 03 D and - 0. 82 ± 0. 47 D, respectively. Mean uncorrected and corrected monocular near <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were 0. 05 ± 0. 92 and 0. 13 ± 0. 92 logMAR (logarithm of minimum angle of resolution), respectively. Mean uncorrected and corrected binocular near <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were 0. 03 ± 1. 00 and 0. 10 ± 1. 00 logMAR, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed between the uncorrected and corrected, monocular and binocular near <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> (p= 0. 004, p= 0. 005, respectively). Results of first month postoperative examinations were compared with the results of 6 -, 12 -, and 18 -month examinations - no statistically significant difference was observed (p> 0. 05). Dis cus si on: As a result of simultaneous bilateral accommodative IOL implantations, significant increase was observed in the near <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> of the patients in the early postoperative period and at 18 -month follow-up visit.

5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor <b>visual</b> <b>acuity,</b> no species is blind. Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E

5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and {{has been reported to}} persist for three hours after it has been taken out of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> and/or at close distances.|$|E
5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good <b>visual</b> <b>acuity,</b> while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—In {{the past}} 5  years {{there has been}} a {{dramatic}} increase in the use of radiotherapy to treat subfoveal neovascular membranes (NVMs) in both Europe and the USA despite the high cost. An alternative, more cost effective method of delivery using x ray simulation and bite block head fixation is described.  METHOD— 15 patients were recruited with classic subfoveal NVMs. Head fixation was achieved with a customised Perspex mask for eight patients and a bite block for seven. An x ray simulator was used to check the field of irradiation. No computerised tomography (CT) was performed. All patients received a total dose of 13. 3  Gy ionising radiation. <b>Visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were charted before and after treatment over a 24  month period.  RESULTS—After 24  months, 5 / 8 (67 %) in the mask group showed stable <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> (less than two line change on Snellen chart) compared with 3 / 7 (43 %) in the bite block group. This difference may be attributed to a variation in the pretreatment <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> in the two groups. From several studies {{it has been estimated that}} 24  months after diagnosis 28 % untreated individuals would have stable vision compared with 53 % patients in this study.  CONCLUSIONS—These results compare favourably with other studies and show that teletherapy can be a safe and effective form of treatment for subfoveal NVMs. The authors have described an alternative method of head fixation and shown that CT scanning is not essential. This method of delivery is considerably less costly than that traditionally used and may allow greater numbers of patients to benefit from radiotherapy treatment.    Keywords: radiotherapy; age related macular degeneratio...|$|R
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. <b>Visual</b> <b>acuity</b> is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} trial with 11 subjects {{was conducted to}} compare the Armorlite Multiple Drop, the Signet Hyperaspheric, the Sola Hi-Drop, and the American Optical Fulvue types of aspheric aphakic lenses. Reasonable off-axis <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were obtained with the Signet, Sola, and Fulvue types, but poor <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were found with the Armorlite type. Similar visual field limits were found with the Armorlite, Signet, and Sola types. Considerably larger limits were found with the Fulvue types than with the other types. However, subjects failed to appreciate these larger limits; this was attributed to the extremely poor image quality {{near the edge of}} the visual field with this lens type. Some subjects disliked the poor off-axis image quality with the Armorlite lens type, and it had poor acceptance relative to the other types. Concerning subjective perception of weight, cosmetic appearance, and visual field size, and subjective evaluation of performance of everyday activities, there were no significant differences between lens types. It was concluded that reducing lens off-axis power errors, corresponding to the rotating eye, should remain the most important principle of aphakic spectacle lens design...|$|R

5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its {{head from side}} to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts.

5|$|Underwater {{vision is}} {{affected}} by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.|$|E
25|$|Stereoacuity {{is limited}} by the <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> of the eyes, and in {{particular}} by the <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> of the weaker eye. That is, the more a patient's vision of any one of the two eyes is degraded compared to the 20/20 vision standard, the lower are the prospects of improving or re-gaining stereo vision, unless <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> itself were improved by other means.
