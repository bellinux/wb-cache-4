60|$|That very evening I {{went to see}} Bunter on board, and {{sympathized with}} him on his {{prospects}} for the voyage. He was subdued. I suppose {{a man with a}} secret locked up in his breast loses his buoyancy. And there was another reason why I could not expect Bunter to show a great elasticity of spirits. For one thing he had been <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> lately, and besides--but of that later.|$|R
6000|$|... 'April 22.--The storm {{seems to}} have passed, though one or two are still very weak. But there are no active {{symptoms}} of disease. How mercifully God has dealt with us!

In spite of two teeth taken out a fortnight ago, my whole jaw has been paining me much, heavy cold, and I can't get good sleep by reason of the pain, and I want sleep much. I think I {{must go to the}} dentist again. You see we hope to sail in ten days or so, and I want to be well.|$|R
60|$|I {{had called}} upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the {{intention}} of wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.|$|R

6000|$|The three lectures which {{followed}} {{were not so}} successful as the first, but my audience remained. Indeed I {{think it would have}} increased night by night had the room permitted it, and Mrs. Payne was still perfectly sure that her protégé had in him all the elements of success, but I fear Prof. Church expressed the sad truth when he said in writing, [...] "Your man Garland is a diamond in the rough!" [...] Of course I must have appeared <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> and uncouth to these people and I am filled with wonder at their kindness to me. My accent was western. My coat sleeves shone at the elbows, my trousers bagged at the knees. Considering the anarch I must have been, I marvel at their toleration. No western audience could have been more hospitable, more cordial.|$|R
60|$|As for Good and myself, the armour did not suit us {{nearly so}} well. To begin with, Good insisted upon keeping on his new-found trousers, and a stout, short gentleman with an eye-glass, and {{one half of}} his face shaved, arrayed in a mail shirt, {{carefully}} tucked into a <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> pair of corduroys, looks more remarkable than imposing. In my case, the chain shirt being too big for me, I put it on over all my clothes, which caused it to bulge in a somewhat ungainly fashion. I discarded my trousers, however, retaining only my veldtschoons, having determined to go into battle with bare legs, {{in order to be}} the lighter for running, in case it became necessary to retire quickly. The mail coat, a spear, a shield, that I {{did not know how to}} use, a couple of tollas, a revolver, and a huge plume, which I pinned into the top of my shooting hat, in order to give a bloodthirsty finish to my appearance, completed my modest equipment. In addition to all these articles, of course we had our rifles, but as ammunition was scarce, and as they would be useless in case of a charge, we arranged that they should be carried behind us by bearers.|$|R
40|$|The {{subtropical}} horticultural {{sector in}} Australia has undergone profound {{change in the}} last 20 years and {{there is now a}} strong emphasis on quality of produce. Pollination is an important influence on quality in subtropical fruit and nut crops and pollination with different pollen genotypes is known to influence quality variables such as sugar content, fruit size and seediness. The effect of two cross pollen genotypes, ‘Murcott’ tangor and ‘Imperial’ mandarin, and the effect of self pollen, bagging and no pollination on ‘Oroval Clementine’ mandarin in Bundaberg, Australia were tested. ‘Oroval Clementine’ fruit set was reduced in the self, bagged and unpollinated treatments. These treatments produced 0 to 5 % fruit set, less than one third of the fruit set for cross-pollinated treatments (15 %). There {{was no significant difference between}} the cross-pollinated treatments. Fruit weights were also significantly affected by pollination. ‘Oroval Clementine’ fruit from cross pollen treatments weighed 1. 5 times more than fruits of the unpollinated treatments. However, the cross-pollinated fruits were <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> and contained 15 to 20 seeds per fruit. These results show that ‘Oroval Clementine’ may have very low parthenocarpic fruit set under Australian conditions. Higher fruit set and larger, more seedy fruits are likely to be obtained by interplanting ‘Oroval Clementine’ with ‘Imperial’ mandarin and ‘Murcott’ tangor...|$|R
6000|$|The {{trip was}} signalized but by one little incident, and that {{occurred}} {{just as we}} were about to start. A <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> looking vagabond passenger got out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver bricks was thrown in. He was standing on the pavement, when an awkward express employee, carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds, stumbled and let it fall on the bummer's foot. He instantly dropped on the ground and began to howl in the most heart-breaking way. A sympathizing crowd gathered around and were going to pull his boot off; but he screamed louder than ever and they desisted; then he fell to gasping, and between the gasps ejaculated [...] "Brandy! for Heaven's sake, brandy!" [...] They poured half a pint down him, and it wonderfully restored and comforted him. Then he begged the people to assist him to the stage, which was done. The express people urged him to have a doctor at their expense, but he declined, and said that if he only had a little brandy to take along with him, to soothe his paroxyms of pain when they came on, he would be grateful and content. He was quickly supplied with two bottles, and we drove off. He was so smiling and happy after that, that I could not refrain from asking him how he could possibly be so comfortable with a crushed foot.|$|R
60|$|On this {{occasion}} Captain Stubber was forthcoming after a delay {{of about a}} quarter of an hour. During that time Cousin George had stood in the filthy little parlour of the house of call in a frame of mind which was certainly not to be envied. Had Mr. Boltby also been with Captain Stubber? He knew his two creditors well enough to understand that the Jew, getting his money, would be better pleased to serve him than to injure him. But the Captain would from choice do him an ill turn. Nothing but self-interest would tie up Captain Stubber's tongue. Captain Stubber was a tall thin gentleman, probably over sixty years of age, with <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> clothes, and a red nose. He always had Berlin gloves, very much torn about the fingers, carried a cotton umbrella, wore--as his sole mark of respectability--a very stiff, clean, white collar round his neck, and invariably smelt of gin. No one knew where he lived, or how he carried on his business; but, such as he was, he had dealings with large sums of money, or at least with bills professing to stand for large sums, and could never have been found without a case in his pocket crammed with these documents. The quarter of an hour seemed to George to be an age; but at last Captain Stubber knocked at the front door and was shown into the room.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Benatar playing a rebellious teenage girl storming {{out of her}} home while being berated by her abusive father (played by actor Trey Wilson) who warns {{her that if she}} leaves, she can forget about ever coming back. Her mother looks on helplessly and her brother (played by actor Philip Cruise) watches sadly from an upper-story window. She later becomes a taxi dancer at a <b>very</b> <b>seedy</b> club to get by in the city, outwardly New York. She writes to her little brother, telling him about her exciting new life and her father seems to feel guilty about being angry at her. Later in the video, she witnesses a pimp (played by actor Gary Chryst) harassing another dancer. Benatar rounds up the girls and leads a rebellion against him. As the pimp is cornered by the girls against his will, he tries to seduce Benatar only to have her throw a drink in his face. Angered by this, he tries once again to assault her but Benatar and the girls overpower and defeat the pimp, then storm out of the club dancing into the sunrise before bidding goodbye to one another, thanking Benatar for their escape. The girls escape and strike out on their own and Benatar walks into the sunrise. The final scene shows Benatar sitting {{in the back of the}} bus headed for an unknown destination. The video was choreographed by Michael Peters, who appears briefly in the video.|$|R

6000|$|Mr Bethany {{remained}} {{still and}} silent, striving to entertain one thought at a time. His lips moved {{as if he}} were talking to himself.
