An 11 October 2011 statement by the White House stated the charges and conduct of the trial has raised serious concerns about Ukraine's commitment to democracy {{and the rule of}} law and urged Ukraine to release Tymoshenko, as well as other political leaders and former government officials. On 22 January 2012 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed that the United States supported Tymoshenko's immediate release.

40|$|Following a {{military}} coup in 2006 the Pacific island-nation of Fiji has become an increasingly autocratic state. The international community has responded by imposing sanctions against Fiji. These sanctions are mainly targeted sanctions consisting of <b>visa</b> <b>bans</b> and restriction on financial flows, as well as diplomatic sanction, which aim to force the Fijian regime to hold elections and return the country to democratic rule. While {{it is impossible to}} predict the outcome of such sanctions, it is still interesting to observe which factors {{have an effect on the}} success of sanctions and how these factors apply to the case of Fiji. The thesis finds that several factors which influence the effectiveness of sanctions are significant in the case of Fiji. While travel sanctions may be mostly symbolic, the financial sanctions imposed may have more direct effects on the Fijian economy and hamper the regime‟s ability to uphold power. The difficulty of the policy goal sought by the sanctioners and the authoritarian character of the regime may be hinders to sanctions success, while the up until now mostl...|$|R

5000|$|The {{run-up to}} the 2013 Vilnius Summit between the EU and its eastern {{neighbours}} saw what The Economist called a [...] "raw geopolitical contest" [...] not seen in Europe {{since the end of}} the Cold War, as Russia attempted to persuade countries in its [...] "near abroad" [...] to join its new Eurasian Union rather than sign Association Agreements with the EU.

The further unfolding of the events in the Ukraine starting from November 22, 2013 diminished the “euro” direction making it solemnly “MAIDAN”. The direction of Eurointegration in Ukraine’s foreign policy was no longer the priority of the rebel movement, shifting the focus of those protesting to the internal issues. During the Maidan the EU’s representatives initiated and participated in the negotiation process {{between the government and the}} opposition, thus demonstrating support to Ukraine on its way to democracy.

40|$|This is {{the fourth}} {{in a series of}} Working Papers {{published}} by the CDS on Kerala migration. Unlike the other three, this one is financed by the Kerala Government and the data were collected in UAE. The objectives of this Working Paper are to: document changes in the labour demand for different categories of emigrant workers, enumerate the emigration policies, examine employment and working conditions, wage levels and related problems of the Kerala emigrants, understand the education and training requirements of future emigrants to UAE. This paper is noteworthy {{in a number of ways}} for its contributions to our understanding of Kerala migration to the Gulf countries. It gives the most authentic estimate of the annual remittances to Kerala from the Gulf countries and from other parts of the world. The average annual estimate of the total remittances from all countries of the world is Rs 13, 815 crores for the period 1998 - 2000. Remittances from the Gulf countries alone would be about Rs 12, 640 crores. The paper concludes that changes in the immigration policy of the UAE government, completion of major infrastructure projects and economic recession in the region have reduced substantially the demand for unskilled and semi-skilled labourers in the UAE. The new policies are related to demographic balancing, emiratization, <b>banning</b> <b>visa</b> for unskilled Asian workers, large-scale mechanisation to make unskilled labour very expensive, etc. The UAE government has also stopped accepting applications for visas for unskilled workers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh with effect from 18 th July 1999. Future demand will be for categories of skilled workers, technicians, computer workers, heavy equipment operators, electrical workers and professional categories such as doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers and accountants. The future emigrants from Kerala should be equipped to meet the changing demand for migrant labour in UAE. Kerala, remittances, emigration, United Arab Emirates...|$|R
