40|$|International audienceAcquisition of an Electrocardiogram (ECG) during MRI is challenging. Applications of {{magnetic}} field gradients induces artifacts on ECG signals, so that patient monitoring or sequence triggering remain complicated. Signal processing {{is required to}} accurately detect QRS. To overcome this issue, specific QRS detector based on <b>vectocardiogram</b> were designed [1] or artifact suppression methods were proposed [2, 3, 4] using information of the gradient signals as input.

40|$|The {{object of}} the study was to define {{spreading}} and quantitative criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy in echocardiography by using a "score" [...] for this, the left ventricle has been divided into 11 regions and a "score" attributed to each one of them [...] and to find the correlation with the <b>vectocardiogram</b> (VCG) in 42 patients with hypertrophic myocardiopathy (HM). The results obtained show the following: 1) the left ventricular hypertrophy aspect on the ECG and the VCG is very sensitive for the identification of a diffuse HM; 2) the necrosis, hemiblock or septal hypertrophy indicate a hypertrophy located in the forepart septum or the whole of the septum; 3) the giant T waves indicate a hypertrophy of the apex; 4) a left ventricular hypertrophy associated with a necrosis or a hemiblock indicate a global myocardiopathy, with the basal region of the septum largely affected...|$|E
40|$|A {{modification}} of the Matching Pursuit algorithm is presented which allows the recovery of a vector-valued signal from partial data (a relaxed version of the algorithm is also introduced, and shown to converge). The new algorithm is illustrated by its application {{to the analysis of}} a <b>vectocardiogram</b> signal. EDICS Classifications: 1 -MDIG, 2 -SAMP. *Corresponding author 2 I. Introduction The Matching Pursuit algorithm [10], [7], [12], [5] is an algorithm that has been used in such settings as signal and image processing when one has large amounts of information available from which one must select the most important features. This enables one to obtain a more easily-analysed approximation to the given data. Versions of this algorithm have also been used in medical contexts for the analysis of breathing rhythms [1] and brain patterns [8]. In this paper we present two refinements of the algorithm. One is a relaxed version which in some situations leads to faster convergence. The other re [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the use of}} sequence coding algorithm to the compression of <b>vectocardiograms.</b> The loops representing P, QRS and T waves are considered as three sequences of threedimensional objects. Thanks to the similarity of neighbouring loops, encoding the values of prediction error reduces the data set volume. The similarity is enhanced with spatial transforms eliminating the extracardiac variations. The residual values are de-correlated with DCT and truncated at not relevant values. The performance of the proposed algorithm is confirmed by results of numerical experiment carried out {{for a wide range}} of parameters. The data reduction ratio reaches a value of 8. 15 while the PRD distortions for the most important sections of signal does not exceed 1. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a sequence coding technique {{applied to the}} compression of <b>vectocardiograms.</b> The loops corresponding to P, QRS and T waves in an appropriate temporal window form Groups Of Beats (GOB). All inner loops in a group are predicted using the neighboring loops' values and the prediction error is subject to encoding. The lossless Huffman coding and the lossy DCT-based coding are considered and discussed in the paper. Detailed study of various compression aspects is provided thanks to the numerical experiment carried out {{for a wide range}} of parameters. Results of both methods are quite promising: the method preserving loops identity reduces the data volume 3 times (i. e. 2000 bps) and the lossy version reaches the reduction ratio of 4. 15 times at a price of 5 % PRD distortions...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{two issues}} involved in reduction of the <b>vectocardiogram's</b> data volume. The fundamental novelty of our approach is the processing of the spherical coordinates (magnitude, latitude and longitude) instead of Cartesian (XYZ) signal representation. The quantization of the angular values at different levels and the resulting distortions of main recording segments are studied at the beginning. Next, the spectral representations of the angular values were investigated with a {{special attention to the}} energy distribution. Finally, two decimation stages were applied together with the quantization aiming at finding the compromise between the resulting data rate and the distortion coefficients for particular signal segments. Every our outcome is supported by the numerical experiment carried out with use of a real VCG data. Further considerations for the implementation of the compression algorithm terminate the paper. Main advantage of the method is the possible use of custom-defined compression profiles. An example profile yields the compression ratio 3, 2 and distortion level of 17, 2 % (in loops 5, 8 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{the present}} work, we have studied dynamic changes of QRS loop in the <b>Vectocardiogram</b> (VCG) of 80 {{patients}} that underwent Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA). The VCG was obtained for each patient using the XYZ orthogonal leads of their electrocardiographic (ECG) records acquired before, {{during and after}} PTCA procedure. In order to analyze the variations of VCG, it has been proposed in this study the following parameters a) Maximum module of the cardiac depolarization vector, b) Volume, c) and Area of vectocardiographic loop corresponding to the QRS complex of each beat, d) Maximum distance between Centroid and the Loop, e) Angle between the XY plane and the Optimum Plane, f) Relation between the Area and Perimeter. The results obtained indicate that the parameters proposed show significant statistics differences (p-value< 0. 0001) before, during and after PTCA. We conclude that the variations observed in the proposed parameters correctly represent not only the morphological changes in the depolarization VCG but also they reflect the modifications in the levels of cardiac ischemic induced by PTCA.

40|$|International audienceDue {{to heart}} motion, cardiac MRI is made {{difficult}} and image acquisitions {{have to be}} synchronized with heart activity to suppress cardiac motion artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most accurate tool for this purpose, and Triggering consists in synchronizing MR sequences on the R-waves. The complex MR environment worsens ECG acquisition conditions because of the static magnetic field (Hall Effect), Radio Frequency (RF) and fast switching magnetic field gradients. Many hardware developments have been achieved so as to limit these undesirable effects [1], but gradient artifacts are still a problem and signal processing is required. Two ways of research have been followed; (a) first way consists in building a MR specific QRS detector [2], {{which is based on}} the <b>vectocardiogram</b> (VCG) the 3 D representation of heart activity. This method does unfortunately not provide a clear ECG and is unable to process patient with low VCG amplitude. (b) Secondly a real-time gradient artifact suppression method has been designed. This method is based on adaptive signal processing [3] and achieves real-time accurate denoising which enables triggering. This method requires gradient signals information, which is a major drawback as the connection to the MR system is rarely available. In this paper a new real-time gradient artifact correction, which does not require any connection to the MR system, is presented. The magnetic field pulse signals will be provided by a new specifically MR designed 3 D Hall probe, integrated on a low cost 0. 35 CMOS technology [4, 5]...|$|E
40|$|The resting 12 lead {{electrocardiogram}} and <b>vectocardiogram</b> {{were reviewed}} in 47 {{patients with the}} Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (a) who had pre-excitation on the resting 12 lead electrocardiogram, (b) who had a single anterograde conducting accessory pathway assessed and located during preoperative electrophysiological study and during epicardial mapping at operation, and (c) in whom surgical division of the accessory pathway resulted in loss of pre-excitation. The site of the accessory pathway established during operation was compared with that established by evaluating the polarity of the delta wave and QRS complex on the resting 12 lead electrocardiogram. The electrocardiogram was assessed by the Rosenbaum criteria (Wolff-Parkinson-White type A, left-sided pathway; or type B, right-sided pathway), the Gallagher criteria (atrial pacing resulting in maximal pre-excitation), and the World Health Organisation criteria (a composite of previous studies). The Gallagher and World Health Organisation criteria were derived from patients demonstrating maximal pre-excitation that often required atrial pacing. The present {{study was designed to}} determine whether these criteria could be accurately applied to the resting 12 lead electrocardiogram on which the degree of pre-excitation was variable. The Rosenbaum criteria correctly identified a left sided accessory pathway in 26 of 34 patients and a right-sided accessory pathway in nine of 13 patients. The Gallagher and World Health Organisation criteria correctly identified the location in only 15 (32 %) of the 47 patients. The resting vectorcardiogram was inaccurate for locating the accessory pathway. Although published criteria are useful for identifying the site of the accessory pathway from an electrocardiogram obtained when rapid atrial pacing is being used to achieve maximal pre-excitation, they are not suitable for identifying the exact site of an accessory pathway from the resting 12 lead electrocardiogram...|$|E
