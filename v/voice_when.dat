5|$|Jon Cryer {{originally}} voiced Kevin Swanson in {{his first}} appearance, before the role was passed temporarily onto Seth MacFarlane. The character was written out of the series for several years, with Scott Grimes taking over the <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> the character returned.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{was cast}} as {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing {{it would be easier}} to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> playing Brian. The voice of Quagmire was inspired by fast-speaking radio advertising spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one-time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E

5|$|Jim Cummings was {{the only}} past TMNT actor to appear in this film, where he had {{previously}} contributed voice-work in the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. The film also features three voice actors for Ratchet in the Ratchet & Clank series, Mikey Kelley and Kevin Michael Richardson from the first game, and James Arnold Taylor from the others, playing Michelangelo and Leonardo respectively. TMNT would be Mako Iwamatsu's final acting role. Mako was announced {{as the voice of}} Splinter at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2006. He then died the next day, aged 72. A dedication to Mako appears {{at the end of the}} film's credits. Although Iwamatsu is the only actor credited in the role, Greg Baldwin performs a substantial portion of Splinter's dialogue in the finished film; Baldwin had already mimicked Iwamatsu's <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> he took up the late actor's role as Iroh in the concurrently-produced cartoon , and used this precedent to successfully lobby to join the cast of TMNT as Splinter following Iwamatsu's death.|$|E

25|$|Tom Chaplin's vocal {{style is}} {{measured}} and elegantly delivered; he uses no grit and doesn't drive his <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> the music ramps up, stepping up in volume rather than aggression as most other rock singers {{are prone to}} do. Therefore, Keane's signature sound is a gentle, refined but full-bodied brand of romantic pop-rock which does not crunch or overdrive itself, but manages to soar using orchestration and other arrangement means.|$|E
25|$|A {{dedicated}} professional, François {{worked hard}} to achieve success, producing a string of massively popular hit songs and touring constantly. With the onslaught of Beatlemania, he covered their hits in French, slightly adjusted the hairstyle, and kept his success moving ahead.

25|$|The {{stories are}} {{primarily}} told in third {{person from the}} points {{of view of the}} two main characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. The author sometimes employs a form of first person <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> his characters write in private journals or letters about events that are not otherwise described. The narrative point of view strays from the two main characters only briefly and seldom {{over the course of the}} series. One example is the opening scene of The Hundred Days, in which a gossipy conversation between anonymous sailors imparts important news and information about the main characters.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November 2005 a fans forum voted 417–0 {{in favour}} of forming Glentoran Community Trust, the first supporters' trust to be formed in Northern Ireland. It was officially formed on 15 May 2006 and {{registered}} with the Registry of Companies Belfast under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1965–1978. The trust sits completely independent of the parent club, giving the ordinary non-shareholding supporter a voice. On the 29 January 2008, the GCT took another historic step in giving the fans a <b>voice,</b> <b>when</b> one of its members, Stephen Henderson {{was elected to the}} board of directors by the shareholders of Glentoran FC.|$|E

25|$|Most voice {{teachers}} {{believe that}} it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the <b>voice.</b> <b>When</b> techniques of posture, breathing, phonation, resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop. Many acclaimed voice instructors suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The {{reason for this is that}} the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to misclassify or damage the voice.|$|E
25|$|To appease her worried father, Bella {{attends a}} movie with her school friend, Jessica. While there, she {{carelessly}} approaches a group of dangerous-looking men outside a bar and discovers she can hear Edward's <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> her adrenaline is high. Desperate to hear his voice again, Bella continually seeks out danger; she convinces Jacob Black to repair two old motorcycles and teach her to ride. Their friendship grows, and Jacob admits that he has romantic feelings for Bella, though she does not reciprocate them. When a vampire named Laurent tries to attack and kill her, Bella is saved by a pack of giant wolves. Later, Bella learns that Jacob and other tribe members are shapeshifters who assume a wolf form to protect humans from vampires. Bella also discovers that the vampire Victoria has returned to Forks, seeking to kill Bella to avenge her mate, James', death.|$|E
25|$|In September 1916, Christie {{enlisted in}} the army; he was called up in April 1917 to join the 52nd Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, {{to serve as an}} infantryman. In April 1918, the {{regiment}} was despatched to France, where Christie was seconded to the Duke of Wellington's (West Riding) Regiment as a signalman. That June, he was injured in a mustard gas attack and spent a month in a military hospital in Calais. Christie claimed this attack left him permanently unable to speak loudly. Later in life, he also claimed the attack had rendered him blind and mute {{for three and a half}} years. His period of muteness was, he claimed, the reason for his inability to talk much louder than a whisper for the rest of his life. Ludovic Kennedy points out that no record of his blindness has been traced and that, while Christie may have lost his <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> he was admitted to hospital, he would not have been discharged as fit for duty had he remained a mute. His inability to talk loudly, Kennedy argues, was a psychological reaction to the gassing rather than a lasting toxic effect of the gas. That reaction, and Christie's exaggeration of the effects of the attack, stemmed from an underlying personality disorder that caused him to exaggerate or feign illness as a ploy to get attention and sympathy.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Counterfeit" [...] story {{features}} the character Lisa undergoing plastic surgery to become Tessa's double. Lisa was played by Meilani Paul before the surgery and by Vandernoot after it. The producers {{wondered whether the}} story needed to explain the change in Lisa's voice, as she would be played by a different actor. They considered suggesting that her voice changed because of the surgery, then decided that Lisa would have voice training. After her operation, Lisa speaks with Vandernoot's <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> posing as Tessa, and with Meilani Paul's <b>voice</b> <b>when</b> the character was not acting.
