40|$|The {{development}} of correctly working logistic systems is a tedious task.

40|$|Gamma-ray and neutron imaging {{technology}} {{is emerging as}} {{a useful tool for}} nuclear materials safeguards. Principal applications include improvement in accuracy for nondestructive assay of heterogeneous material (e. g., residues) and wide-area imaging of nuclear material in facilities (e. g., holdup). Portable gamma cameras with gamma-ray spectroscopy are available commercially and are being applied to holdup measurements. The technology has the potential to significantly reduce effort and exposure in holdup campaigns; and, with imaging, some of the limiting assumptions required for conventional holdup analysis can be relaxed, resulting in a more general analysis. Methods to analyze spectroscopic-imaging data to assay plutonium and uranium in processing equipment are being development. Results of holdup measurements using a commercial, portable gamma-cameras are presented. The authors are also developing fast neutron imaging techniques for NDA, search, and holdup. Fast neutron imaging provides a direct measurement of the source of neutrons and is relatively insensitive to surroundings when compared to thermal or epithermal neutron imaging. The technology is well-suited for in-process inventory measurements and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> in interim storage, for which gamma-ray measurements may be inadequate due to self-shielding.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} effort was to: (1) provide a concise and well-defined property profile of current and developing composite materials using thermal and chemical characterization techniques and (2) optimize analytical testing requirements of materials. This effort applied a diverse array of methodologies to ascertain composite material properties. Often, a single method of technique will provide useful, but nonetheless incomplete, information on material composition and/or behavior. To more completely understand and predict material properties, a broad-based analytical approach is required. By developing a database of information comprised of both thermal and chemical properties, material behavior under varying conditions may be better understood. THis {{is even more important}} in the aerospace community, where new composite materials and those in the development stage have little reference data. For example, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy spectral databases available for identification of vapor phase spectra, such as those generated during experiments, generally refer to well-defined chemical compounds. Because this method renders a unique thermal decomposition spectral pattern, even larger, more diverse databases, such as those found in solid and liquid phase FTIR spectroscopy libraries, cannot be used. By combining this and other available methodologies, a database specifically for new materials and materials being developed at Marshall Space Flight Center can be generated. In addition, characterizing materials using this approach will be extremely useful in the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and identification of anomalies in NASA-wide investigations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> is an {{increasingly}} important need in pharmaceutical distribution. XStream Systems, Inc has developed an Energy Dispersive X-ray Diffraction (EDXRD) system which can quickly verify crystalline pharmaceuticals in the distribution cycle. Materials may be in solid or powder form, and the technique is non-destructive. Unlike Angular X-ray Diffraction (AXRD), a “white ” x-ray beam between 20 and 80 keV is used. This energetic beam can penetrate through relatively thick materials, diffracting from crystallites within the samples. Materials can be observed {{even when they are}} located within opaque, sealed containers. That is, for most cases the drugs can be examined in their sealed, packaged vials without any sample preparation. The table top unit uses a confocal geometry to maximize the x-ray intensity from a relatively low-powered, air-cooled x-ray source. The beam is collimated by a circular slit assembly before the sample. A similar slit assembly after the sample collimates the diffracted beam. A single, state-of- the-art, CdTe solid-state detector with a multichannel analyzer is used to process the diffracted signal. This collimation system interrogates a doughnut-shaped volume within the sample under test. One of the design goals was to develop a unit that is capable of performing quick verification or detection of complex materials and mixtures at a number of points along the distribution paths yet can be operated by personnel with minimal scientific knowledge. Rapid identification of unknowns is possible using neural network search algorithms or pattern matching techniques. The Material Recognition Software Engine (MRSE) utilizes a localized SQL database to store and process the raw spectra data. The MRSE takes the sample data and determines if it matches any known patterns within its database. This engine has demonstrated that it can verify a number of drugs within 30 sec with better than 97 percent accuracy...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> controls in <b>material</b> handling systems. While currently these controls are mostly validated using simulation, in the proposed approach, the correctness of the involved controls is automatically proven by means of model checking. Model checking is a formal method that automatically verifies whether a system meets its specification by exhaustively analyzing {{a model of the}} corresponding system. To achieve a model <b>of</b> the <b>material</b> handling system, a modeling methodology has been developed and is introduced in this thesis. The methodology is based on the definition <b>of</b> <b>material</b> handling system elements, which are models of technical components such as conveyors or pushers. By interconnecting these elements, a model <b>of</b> the <b>material</b> handling system is built, which thereafter can be fed into a model checker to prove certain properties on the model. In order to also verify large and complex material handling systems, a compositional approach is proposed. There, the overall material handling system is partitioned into subsystems, which are subsequently verified separately. From the proofs of the subsystems, a proof of a property <b>of</b> the whole <b>material</b> handling system is derived. Practical experiments show how the proposed approach handles the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> real-world <b>material</b> handling systems...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a CAE-based application with a convenient GUI for identification and <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> parameters for hyperelastic models available in the current release of the FE code ANSYS Mechanical APDL. This Windows application implements a two-step procedure: (1) fitting of experimental stress–strain curves provided by the user; (2) <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the obtained <b>material</b> parameters by the solution of a modified benchmark problem. The application, which was developed using the Visual Basic. NET language, implements a two-way interaction with ANSYS as a single loop using the APDL script as input and text, graphical and video files as output. With this application, nine isotropic incompressible hyperelastic material models are compared by fitting them to the conventional Treloar’s experimental dataset (1944) for vulcanised rubber. A ranking of hyperelastic models is constructed according to model efficiency, which is estimated using fitting quality criteria. The model ranking is done based upon the complexity of their mathematical formulation and their ability to accurately reproduce the test data. Recent hyperelastic models (Extended Tube and Response Function) are found to be more efficient compared to conventional ones. The verification is done by the comparison of an analytical solution to an FEA result for the benchmark problem of a rubber cylinder under compression proposed by Lindley (1967). In the application, the classical formulation of the benchmark is improved mathematically to become valid for larger deformations. The wide applicability of the proposed two-step approach is confirmed using stress–strains curves for seven different formulations of natural rubber and seven different grades of synthetic rubber...|$|R
