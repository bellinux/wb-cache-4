5|$|In 2013 <b>Voyager</b> 1 was {{exiting the}} solar system at a speed of about 3.6 AU per year, while <b>Voyager</b> 2 is going slower, leaving {{the solar system}} at 3.3 AU per year. Each year <b>Voyager</b> 1 {{increases}} its lead over <b>Voyager</b> 2.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Voyager</b> 1 probe was {{launched}} on September 5, 1977, from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, aboard a Titan IIIE launch vehicle. The <b>Voyager</b> 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched later, <b>Voyager</b> 1 reached both Jupiter and Saturn sooner, following a shorter trajectory.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Voyagers</b> are Hoggard's {{advanced}} choral ensemble. The <b>Voyagers</b> {{were established}} {{within the first}} year of Hoggard's existence and participate in numerous events, including The North Carolina Choral Festival, New Hanover County Best Foot Forward, and Chords for a Cause. The original <b>Voyagers</b> class were responsible for the composition of Hoggard's alma mater, to the tune of Eternal Father, Strong to Save.|$|R
5|$|After its {{discovery}} by <b>Voyager</b> 1, Thebe {{was photographed}} by the <b>Voyager</b> 2 space probe in 1979. However, before the Galileo spacecraft arrived at Jupiter, knowledge {{about it was}} extremely limited. Galileo imaged {{almost all of the}} surface of Thebe and helped clarify its composition.|$|E
5|$|As <b>Voyager</b> {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} the Forge to tear <b>Voyager</b> apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to <b>Voyager.</b> <b>Voyager</b> is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the Forge and disable its defensive systems, allowing the <b>Voyager</b> crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the Forge, the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by the Forge to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the Forge and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, <b>Voyager</b> attacks the Forge and destroys the station, beaming Munro off {{in the last few}} moments. <b>Voyager</b> and other active ships in the area are freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Because {{observations}} of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for <b>Voyager</b> 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below {{the south pole}} of Saturn {{and out of the}} plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had <b>Voyager</b> 1 failed or been unable to observe Titan, <b>Voyager</b> 2s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to Uranus and Neptune. The trajectory <b>Voyager</b> 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to Uranus and Neptune, but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.|$|E

25|$|CrossCountry {{inherited}} 34 four-carriage Class 220 <b>Voyagers</b> and 40 five-carriage and 4 four-carriage Class 221 Super <b>Voyagers</b> from Virgin CrossCountry {{as well as}} 11 two-carriage and 18 three-carriage Class 170 Turbostars from Central Trains.|$|R
50|$|<b>Voyagers</b> ran for {{one season}} of 20 episodes, {{broadcast}} opposite the top-rated 60 Minutes. The series averaged a 17 share. <b>Voyagers!</b> seemed {{likely to be}} renewed for a second season, but controversies in 60 Minutes reporting led executives to believe that 60 Minutes might be successfully challenged by a competing news program instead. NBC canceled <b>Voyagers!</b> {{and replaced it with}} the news magazine program Monitor, which averaged only a 7 share.|$|R
5|$|Chakotay pleads their case, but Janeway {{decides not to}} help them. As Chakotay {{returns to}} <b>Voyager</b> on board a shuttle, the Co-operative use their telepathic link {{to force him to}} travel to the Borg cube with <b>Voyager</b> in pursuit. Both Chakotay and an away team board the cube, and despite a firefight, he manages to reactivate the generator. This creates the new joint mind as expected, but also {{activates}} the cube, which begins powering up to attack <b>Voyager.</b> Chakotay and the away team are beamed back to <b>Voyager</b> as the Co-operative trigger the cube's self-destruct before it can endanger the Federation ship. The planet's inhabitants thank <b>Voyager,</b> but {{as a result of their}} actions, Chakotay later questions the morality of the Co-operative's motives with Janeway, as it connected many of the former Borg together in a new hive mind without consulting them.|$|E
5|$|Outside Mars, Jupiter {{was first}} visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, {{and became the}} first {{spacecraft}} to orbit the planet. Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with <b>Voyager</b> 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both <b>Voyager</b> 1 and <b>Voyager</b> 2.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} the Hazard Team {{conducting}} a holodeck training exercise {{set on a}} Borg ship; however, the team fails the exercise as most get captured by the Borg, and Munro accidentally destroys the ship while trying to rescue them. Following the termination of the exercise, <b>Voyager</b> is attacked by an unidentified ship. <b>Voyager</b> manages to destroy the ship, but takes heavy damage in the battle. The hostile ship explodes, emitting a shockwave that teleports the nowâ€“crippled <b>Voyager</b> to an unknown location, surrounded by derelict ships. As the <b>Voyager</b> crew attempts repairs, the ship is boarded by scavengers, who steal some of Voyagers cargo supplies before being driven off. In an effort to establish where <b>Voyager</b> is, the Hazard Team is sent to a derelict ship where power is still functioning to download the derelict's database. The mission goes awry when aliens begin transporting in and attacking the team; however, the aliens, identifying themselves as Etherians, eventually manage {{to communicate with the}} team, and the ordeal is waved off as a misunderstanding, allowing the Hazard Team to access the Etherian database.|$|E
50|$|Fare Forward <b>Voyagers</b> (Soldier's Choice) (or simply, Fare Forward <b>Voyagers)</b> is {{an album}} by American fingerstyle guitarist and {{composer}} John Fahey, released in 1973. It contains three songs, one comprising a complete {{side of the}} original LP.|$|R
25|$|To {{operate the}} Birmingham to Edinburgh and Glasgow {{services}} transferred from CrossCountry in December 2007, three four-carriage and thirteen five-carriage Class 221 Super <b>Voyagers</b> were transferred. A further five five-carriage Class 221 Super <b>Voyagers</b> followed in December 2008.|$|R

5|$|The outer {{boundary}} of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is {{the point at which}} the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space. <b>Voyager</b> 1 and <b>Voyager</b> 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84AU from the Sun, respectively. <b>Voyager</b> 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>Voyager</b> {{spacecraft}} {{made the}} first close-up images of Enceladus. <b>Voyager</b> 1 {{was the first to}} fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000km on November 12, 1980. Images acquired from this distance had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. <b>Voyager</b> 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, <b>Voyager</b> scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus's surface.|$|E
5|$|Titan was {{examined}} by both <b>Voyager</b> 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981, respectively. <b>Voyager</b> 1s trajectory {{was designed to}} provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan's mass. Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through <b>Voyager</b> 1s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la, which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. <b>Voyager</b> 2, {{which would have been}} diverted to perform the Titan flyby if <b>Voyager</b> 1 had been unable to, did not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune.|$|E

All 2002 <b>Voyagers</b> now used a four-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
5000|$|Virgin {{inherited}} {{a fleet of}} Class 47s, Class 86s, Mark 2 Carriages, High Speed Trains and Class 158s from British Rail. Class 47s on hire from English Welsh & Scottish and Fragonset were also fairly common. A franchise commitment was the replacement of these trains with new stock. In December 1998 Virgin signed a deal to lease 34 four-carriage Class 220 <b>Voyagers</b> and 40 five-carriage and four four-carriage Class 221 Super <b>Voyagers</b> built by Bombardier Transportation. [...] The latter were intended for use by Virgin West Coast on services from London Euston to Holyhead although they ended up being pooled with the other <b>Voyagers.</b> When Virgin West Coast started using Class 221 Super <b>Voyagers</b> on Holyhead services in September 2004, the five-carriage units were used.|$|R

5|$|To date five {{spacecraft}} (<b>Voyager</b> 1, <b>Voyager</b> 2, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 and New Horizons) are on trajectories {{which will}} {{take them out of}} the Solar System and into interstellar space. Barring an extremely unlikely collision with some object, the craft should persist indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|<b>Voyager</b> 1 and <b>Voyager</b> 2 were next, {{passing by}} Ganymede in 1979. They refined its size, {{revealing}} it {{was larger than}} Saturn's moon Titan, which was previously {{thought to have been}} bigger. The grooved terrain was also seen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Voyager</b> 1 {{reached a}} {{distance}} of 135 AU from the Sun on May 18, 2016. By September 5, 2017 that had increased to about 139.64 AU from the Sun, {{and at that time}} <b>Voyager</b> 2 was 115.32 AU from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|<b>Voyager</b> 1s first {{images of}} Io {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} impact craters, suggesting a very young surface. Craters are used by geologists to estimate the age of a planetary surface; the number of impact structures increase with {{the age of the}} planetary surface. Instead, <b>Voyager</b> 1 observed a multi-coloured surface, pockmarked with irregular-shaped depressions, which lacked the raised rims characteristic of impact craters. <b>Voyager</b> 1 also observed flow features formed by low-viscosity fluid and tall, isolated mountains that did not resemble terrestrial volcanoes. The surface observed suggested that, just as Peale and colleagues had theorized, Io was heavily modified by volcanism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Voyager</b> 2 is {{the only}} {{spacecraft}} that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because {{this was the last}} major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for <b>Voyager</b> 1s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from <b>Voyager</b> 2 became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, Neptune All Night.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Voyager</b> 1 {{is unable}} to {{communicate}} directly with the Earth, its digital tape recorder (DTR) can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time. Signals from <b>Voyager</b> 1 take over 19 hours to reach Earth.|$|E
