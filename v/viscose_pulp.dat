40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{economical}} production of bacterial cellulose (BC) by Gluconacetobacter subsp. Xylinus (ATCC 10245) in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks cultivated under static conditions. The fermentation media used contained food industrial by-product liquors, such as black strap molasses solution and {{corn steep liquor}} (CSL), which represents {{some of the most}} economical carbon and nitrogen sources. However, {{because of the presence of}} undesirable components in molasses (such as coloring substances, heavy metals, and other compounds) that may act as inhibitors, and in order to eliminate them, crude molasses has been treated with an acid, as an attempt to increase BC productivity. The amount of BC produced using these carbon and nitrogen sources was determined and compared to that produced using previously reported fermentation media. The characterizations of the bacterial cellulose (BC) pellicles obtained using either conventional or by-product media were studied by thermal and spectral techniques and compared to those of plant-derived cellulose such as cotton linter, <b>viscose</b> <b>pulp,</b> and microcrystalline cellulose...|$|E
40|$|Chemical pulp mills such as Kraft, soda, or sulfite mills are current {{examples}} of biorefineries that can convert lignocellulosic biomass into energy, pulp or cellulose derivatives, and tall oil.   While existing <b>viscose</b> <b>pulps</b> use a hemicellulose extraction to generate soluble sugars for ethanol production, in general there still exists a large potential for other more profitable {{applications of the}} biomass (Fig. 1), i. e. the mill needs to present a widespread product portfolio.   The biofuels under development from fermentation that will be discussed are the diesel fuel oxygenates dibutyl succinate and diethyl succinate {{to be used for}} reduced particulate emissions and fossil fuel replacement for diesel engines and butanol for Otto engines.   It's important to stress that succinic acid, butanol and ethanol, needed for the production of the diesel additives and gasoline replacement will be produced from renewable resources and hence replacing products currently produced from non-renewable fossil sources.   Since wood will be used, there will be no issue of competing with raw material used for food production.   Besides biofuel production, succinic acid and butanol, can be used directly or further refined into numerous different products classified as green chemicals.

5000|$|Viscose rayon is a {{fiber of}} {{regenerated}} cellulose; it is structurally similar to cotton {{but may be}} produced {{from a variety of}} plants such as soy, bamboo, and sugar cane. Cellulose is a linear polymer of β-D-glucose units with the empirical formula (C6H10O5)n. To prepare <b>viscose,</b> dissolving <b>pulp</b> is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide (typically 16-19% w/w) to form [...] "alkali cellulose," [...] which has the approximate formula C6H9O4-ONan. The alkali cellulose is then treated with carbon disulfide to form sodium cellulose xanthate.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>viscose</b> process dissolves <b>pulp</b> with aqueous sodium {{hydroxide}} and carbon disulfide. This produces a viscous solution. This solution {{was the first thing}} to bear the name [...] "viscose". The cellulose solution is used to spin the viscose rayon fiber, which may also be called viscose.|$|R
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} carbon {{disulphide}} are {{consumed in the}} conventional production of viscose. Until a novel, eco-friendly, wood-based process {{for the production of}} cellulose textile fibres has been developed and implemented, it is important to try to find ways to improve the conventional viscose process, e. g. in terms of reducing the carbon disulphide requirement of the process. The aim of this thesis was {{to reduce the amount of}} carbon disulphide consumed in the preparation of high-viscosity <b>viscose</b> by pre-treating <b>pulps</b> with enzymes. It also aimed at investigating and linking the different measurements of reactivity, i. e. gamma number, Fock reactivity and Kw, and determining the sensitivity of the gamma number to the hemicellulose content of pulp. Reactivity was measured as Fock reactivity and gamma number. The gamma number of viscose solutions remained unchanged when an enzyme stage was used prior to the viscose process. The gamma number analysis was found to be selective not only to cellulose but also to the hemicellulosic material. It was verified that both cellulose and hemicellulose molecules in the pulp material were substituted in the viscose preparation stages, showing that the gamma number of the pulp is due to both substituted cellulose and substituted hemicelluloses. The mechanisms responsible for the Fock reactivity, or the filter-clogging value (Kw) on the one hand and the gamma number on the other, are probably not the same. It was speculated that the analysis method employed in Fock´s test and the filter-clogging value measure the results on a fibre level, whereas the gamma number measures changes mainly on a molecular level. This could explain the difference in the levels of reactivity found in this study...|$|R
