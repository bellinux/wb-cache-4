50|$|The {{supercluster}} {{is close}} to the location where the Milky Way, and hence the Solar System, is currently moving with respect to the cosmic microwave background, a phenomenon known as the dark flow. This movement was found to be significant relative to the normal Hubble flow of the galaxies caused by the metric expansion of space. Although the Planck spacecraft showed no evidence for this flow, propositions to explain this bulk movement includes the influence of the nearby Shapley Supercluster and the Great Attractor {{at the center of the}} Laniakea Supercluster. <b>Vela</b> <b>Supercluster</b> is estimated to contribute at least 50 km/s (180 000 km/hr) of this bulk movement.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Vela</b> <b>Supercluster</b> (Vela SCl, VSCL) is {{a massive}} galactic {{supercluster}} about 265.5 megaparsecs (870 million light-years) away within {{the vicinity of the}} Zone of Avoidance of the Milky Way, centered on the constellation Vela. It {{is one of the largest}} structures found in the universe; covering about 25 × 20 degrees of the sky. It consists of two walls: a broad main wall and a secondary merging wall. The combined dimensions of the walls are 115 km/s Mpc on the major dimensions and 90 km/s Mpc on the minor ones, which corresponds to about 385 million and 300 million light years, respectively. It is about [...] "1 000 times the mass of the Milky Way galaxy", which corresponds to a mass of [...] About 20 initial galaxy clusters have been identified spectroscopically.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a potentially major supercluster that extends across the Galactic Plane in the constellation of Vela, at a mean recessional velocity of 18, 000 km/s. Recent multi-object spectroscopic observations of this <b>Vela</b> <b>Supercluster</b> (VSCL), using AAOmega+ 2 dF and the Southern African Large Telescope, confirm an extended galaxy overdensity in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) located where residual bulk flows predict a considerable mass excess. We present a preliminary analysis of 4, 500 new spectroscopic galaxy redshifts obtained in the ZOA centred on the Vela region (l= 272. 5 +- 20 deg, b= 0 +- 10 deg). The presently sparsely-sampled dataset traces an overdensity that covers 25 deg in Galactic longitude {{on either side of the}} Plane, suggesting an extent of 25 deg x 20 deg, corresponding to 115 x 90 h_ 70 Mpc at the supercluster redshift. In redshift space, the overdensity appears to consist of two merging wall-like structures, interspersed with clusters and groups. Both the velocity histogram and the morphology of the multi-branching wall structure are consistent with a supercluster classification. K_s^o galaxy counts show an enhancement of 1. 2 over the survey area for galaxies brighter than M_K^* at the VSCL distance, and a galaxy overdensity of δ= 0. 50 - 0. 77 within a photometric redshift shell around the VSCL, when compared to various Two-Micron All-Sky Survey samples. Taking account of selection effects, the VSCL is estimated to contribute v_LG≳ 50 km/s to the motion of the Local Group. Comment: Matches the final version published in MNRAS Letters.

40|$|We derive {{peculiar}} velocities for the 6 dF Galaxy Survey (6 dFGS) {{and describe}} the velocity field of the nearby (z < 0. 055) Southern hemisphere. The survey comprises 8885 galaxies for which we have previously reported Fundamental Plane data. We obtain peculiar velocity probability distributions for the redshift-space positions {{of each of these}} galaxies using a Bayesian approach. Accounting for selection bias, we find that the logarithmic distance uncertainty is 0. 11 dex, corresponding to 26 per cent in linear distance. We use adaptive kernel smoothing to map the observed 6 dFGS velocity field out to cz ∼ 16 [*] 000 km s− 1, and compare this to the predicted velocity fields from the PSCz Survey and the 2 MASS Redshift Survey. We find a better fit to the PSCz prediction, although the reduced χ 2 for the whole sample is approximately unity for both comparisons. This means that, within the observational uncertainties due to redshift-independent distance errors, observed galaxy velocities and those predicted by the linear approximation from the density field agree. However, we find peculiar velocities that are systematically more positive than model predictions {{in the direction of the}} Shapley and <b>Vela</b> <b>superclusters,</b> and systematically more negative than model predictions in the direction of the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster, suggesting contributions from volumes not covered by the models...|$|R

40|$|Recent spectroscopic {{observations}} {{of a few}} thousand partially obscured galaxies in the Vela constellation revealed a massive overdensity on supercluster scales straddling the Galactic Equator (l ∼ 272. 5 deg) at cz ∼ 18000 km/s. It remained unrecognised because it is located just beyond the boundaries and volumes of systematic whole-sky redshift and peculiar velocity surveys - and is obscured by the Milky Way. The structure lies close to the apex where residual bulkflows suggest considerable mass excess. The uncovered <b>Vela</b> <b>Supercluster</b> (VSCL) conforms of a confluence of merging walls, but its core remains uncharted. At the thickest foreground dust column densities (|b| < 6 deg) galaxies are not visible and optical spectroscopy is not effective. This precludes a reliable estimate {{of the mass of}} VSCL, hence its effect on the cosmic flow field and the peculiar velocity of the Local Group. Only systematic HI-surveys can bridge that gap. We have run simulations and will present early-science observing scenarios with MeerKAT 32 (M 32) to complete the census of this dynamically and cosmologically relevant supercluster. M 32 has been put forward because this pilot project will also serve as precursor project for HI MeerKAT Large Survey Projects, like Fornax and Laduma. Our calculations have shown that a survey area of the fully obscured part of the supercluster, where the two walls cross and the potential core of the supercluster resides, can be achieved on reasonable time-scales (200 hrs) with M 32.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesAs part of {{a larger}} effort to uncover the {{structures}} hidden behind the Milky Way, we analyse 5, 190 spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in the Hydra/Antlia and Vela regions (245 °≤ l ≤ 295 °, /b/ ≤ 10 °). These galaxies are based on deep optical galaxy source catalogues in the Zone of Avoidance in the Hydra/Antlia region (Kraan-Korteweg 2000 a), the Vela region (von Maltitz 2012), and the near infrared 2 MASS Extended Source Catalogue(XSC) (Jarrett et al. 2000 a, Skrutskie et al. 2006). The observed redshifts were mainly obtained from the 2 dF+ AAOmega spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (80 % of the redshifts); the remaining data are from other telescopes {{as well as from the}} literature. This analysis is suggestive of the existence of a massive supercluster in this region, hereafter called the <b>Vela</b> <b>Supercluster</b> (VSC). The prospective VSC is at a mean redshift of cz ~ 18, 000 km s⁻¹, and extends approximately about 87 x 87 Mpc on-sky. We use a nearest neighbour algorithm to identify the galaxy clusters and groups within the potential VSC, determine their velocity dispersions and the corresponding virial masses. Although the VSC is sparsely sampled, we find 13 galaxy clusters and 22 galaxy groups contained within it. The richness and the masses of these galaxy clusters/groups are comparable with the galaxy clusters/groups found within the Shapley Supercluster by Proust et al. (2006). Taking account of the sparse sampling, the VSC seems comparable to the Shapley Supercluster (SSC). Given the fact that the SSC contributes about 9 % of the Local Group motion (Muñoz & Loeb 2008), if not more (see Kocevski & Ebeling 2006). The proximity of a further supercluster (VSC) in its vicinity, might have serious implications on the bulk flows studies. Consequently, the existence of this supercluster is likely key in resolving the long-enduring bulk flow controversies and the misalignment of flows with the dipole determined via the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations...|$|E
