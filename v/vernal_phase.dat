Continued evaluation of autumnal phase and early <b>vernal</b> <b>phase</b> {{data indicate that}} the quality of ERTS- 1 imagery over the Great Plains Corridor test sites are adequate to show relatively small temporal changes in the condition and quantity of vegetation at the several test sites. Vegetation changes measured from August through April are observable in reflectance changes recorded by ERTS- 1. Vegetation changes due to grazing treatment and environmental conditions at the test sites are being monitored with ground data and ERTS- 1 data, and appear adequate to complete all phases of the Great Plains Corridor investigation. NASA high flight aerial photography proved to be an indispensable tool for locating the Great Plains Corridor test sites on the computer derived grey maps of ERTS- 1 digital data...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A {{comprehensive review of}} ERTS- 1 MSS color composite imagery, obtained during the autumnal and <b>vernal</b> <b>phases</b> over the Great Plains Corridor test sites, shows that temporal changes in rangeland vegetation can be manually interpreted. The degree to which manual interpretations {{can be made from}} the MSS color composites appears to be limited primarily by variations in image reproduction quality. The vernal advancement and other phenophase related phenomena are observable from cycle to cycle and within a single frame for rangeland vegetation. Vegetation changes due to environmental conditions among the test sites and among grazing treatments within test sites are readily observable. An investigation has been initiated which will evaluate band-to-band ratios as an index of rangeland vegetation condition. Data currently available from August 1972 through April 1973 for the five southern test sites are being used to characterize band-to-band ratios as a function of quantity and quality of rangeland vegetation at each of the test sites...|$|R
