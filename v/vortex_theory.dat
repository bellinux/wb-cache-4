We {{consider}} vortices of topological-type for a {{class of}} selfdual gauge models, with periodic boundary conditions and as {{the ratio of the}} vortex core size to the separation distance between vortex points (the scaling parameter) tends to zero. We use a gluing technique (shadowing lemma) for solutions to the corresponding semilinear elliptic equation on the plane, where the vortex points are periodically arranged. This approach is particularly convenient and natural {{for the study of the}} asymptotics as the scaling parameter tends to zero. In particular, we prove a factorization ansatz for multivortex solutions, up to an error which is exponentially small. Key words.

50|$|On the {{one hand}} Cavalleri's {{objection}} to Descartes' theory was mainly that it effectively dismissed the obvious tidal influence of the sun. On the other he rejected Newton's theory of remote gravitational attraction.

He tried to construct a theoretical basis for an inverse square law of gravitational attraction arising from Cartesian vortices.

40|$|The sound {{produced}} by vortex pairing in a Mach 0. 1, acoustically excited air jet is considered. The sound {{produced by}} vortex pairing is predicted {{on the basis}} of an experimental description of the flow field and using an aeroacoustical analogy. The experimental data is provided by particle image velocimetry. The aeroacoustical analogy is a conservative formulation of the <b>vortex</b> sound <b>theory</b> that has been developed in a previous work. This formulation {{has been shown to be}} robust when the flow data contains approximations or experimental uncertainties, as is the case here. The prediction is compared to measurements of the sound produced by the excited jet. The spectrum exhibits frequency components that are associated to the pairing, an intermittent second pairing, and the acoustical excitation. The agreement between the sound prediction and the acoustical measurements is good for the first two harmonics related to the first pairing. This demonstrates that the authors' conservative formulation of the <b>vortex</b> sound <b>theory</b> allows a correct sound prediction in spite of the uncertainties on the flow data...|$|R
