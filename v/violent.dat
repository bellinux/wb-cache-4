5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: <b>violent</b> crime and property crime. Historically, <b>violent</b> crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for <b>violent</b> crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most <b>violent</b> crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw <b>violent</b> crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw <b>violent</b> crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its <b>violent</b> crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of <b>violent</b> crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E

5|$|Budgetary reasons caused Licence to Kill to be {{the first}} Bond film shot {{completely}} outside the United Kingdom, with locations in both Florida and Mexico. The film earned over $156 million worldwide, and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception, with ample praise for the stunts, but attracted some criticism of Dalton's dark and <b>violent</b> interpretation of Bond {{and the fact that the}} film was significantly darker and more <b>violent</b> than its predecessors.|$|E

5|$|In Dark Forces II, {{the player}} has {{the option of}} a third-person view, plus an option to switch {{automatically}} to third-person when the lightsaber is the selected weapon. Three types of Force powers are introduced in this game: Light powers provide non <b>violent</b> advantages, Dark powers provide <b>violent</b> ones, while Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities.

5|$|In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of {{occurrence}} drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are <b>violent</b> tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, <b>violent</b> tornadoes are extremely rare. This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both <b>violent</b> and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of <b>violent</b> acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a <b>violent</b> act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and <b>violent</b> crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of <b>violent</b> criminals), the <b>violent</b> crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
5|$|Omaha's rate of <b>violent</b> crimes per 100,000 {{residents}} {{has been}} {{lower than the}} average rates of three dozen United States cities of similar size. Unlike Omaha, those cities have experienced an increase in <b>violent</b> crime overall since 2003. Rates for property crime have decreased for both Omaha and its peer cities {{during the same time}} period. In 2006, Omaha was ranked for homicides as 46th out of the 72 cities in the United States of more than 250,000 in population.|$|E

5|$|Prosecutor John McGohey did not {{assert that}} the {{defendants}} had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the <b>violent</b> overthrow of governments. The prosecution called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as Angela Calomiris and Herbert Philbrick, or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as Louis Budenz. The prosecution witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including The Communist Manifesto) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin. Belknap (1994), p 209. The prosecution argued that the texts advocated <b>violent</b> revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants were guilty of advocating <b>violent</b> overthrow of the government.|$|E
5|$|St. John's has {{traditionally}} {{been one of the}} safest cities in Canada to live; however, in recent years crime in the city has steadily increased. While nationally crime decreased by 4% in 2009, the total crime rate in St. John's saw an increase of 4%. During this same time <b>violent</b> crime in the city decreased 6%, compared to a 1% decrease nationally. In 2010 the total crime severity index for the city was 101.9, an increase of 10% from 2009 and 19.2% above the national average.

5|$|The Turkish {{army was}} at first {{quartered}} in Baghdad, but quickly came into conflict with {{the remnants of the}} old Abbasid establishment in the city and the city's populace. The latter resented their loss of influence and career opportunities to the foreign troops, who were furthermore often undisciplined and <b>violent,</b> spoke no Arabic, and were either recent converts to Islam or still pagans. <b>Violent</b> episodes between the populace and the Turks thus became more and more common.|$|E

5|$|The volcano also erupted phreatically several times, as {{recorded}} by Vogel in 1913 and 1920, with its activity increasing from 1916 to 1926. During these years, the eruptions grew {{more frequent and}} more <b>violent.</b> A major outburst on November 2, 1927 started a period of nearly continuous <b>violent</b> eruptions that lasted until 1929. During this period, Cerro Azul sometimes erupted daily, sending columns of ash as far as 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air. Quizapu Crater grew slightly during this eruptive period.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes.

In the case of <b>violent</b> tornadoes, {{only a small portion}} of the path is of <b>violent</b> intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.|$|E
5|$|<b>Violent</b> crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims.
