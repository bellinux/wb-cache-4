500|$|In {{a perfect}} {{conductor}} (...) , {{there would be}} no diffusion. By Lenz's law, any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the frozen-in-field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.|$|E

30|$|The {{reduction}} <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> {{balance with}} maintenance of hemodynamic stability and {{the correlation between}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> administered and urine output appear to explain the beneficial effect of GDT on the outcomes of surgical patients. A previous comparative study observed delayed recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients who received larger <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> after colon surgery [14]. Another study observed increased rates of cardiopulmonary and wound-healing complications after colon surgery in patients who received larger <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> [15]. The hypothesis that fluid restriction improves postoperative outcomes has been tested by many investigators, but the results are conflicting. Clearly, fluid restriction increases the risk of hypoperfusion. Nowadays, avoidance <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> excess, rather than absolute restriction, is considered an important key to improve postoperative outcomes [16]. What constitutes “avoidance <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> excess” is difficult to define, but background administration <b>of</b> relatively small <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluids,</b> combined with fluid loading triggered by signs of inadequate cardiac output and expected fluid responsiveness, is generally recommended [16, 17]. This is also a basis for recommendation of GDT in major surgery.|$|R

30|$|Introduction The {{harmfulness}} of fluid-induced hyperchloremia (H-Cl) remains debated. Large randomized trial {{showed that}} chloride-rich crystalloids did not worsen outcome [1].

2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can also}} be derived directly from Isaac Newton's Second Law of Motion. [...] If a small <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, then there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline.|$|E
2500|$|Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a {{procedure}} whereby a small <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> {{is put into}} the airways in order sample the cells and fluids of the aveoli and epithelium of the bronchi. BAL may be performed using a BAL tube, which allows fluid {{to be added to}} and removed from the bronchi, or may be performed during endoscopy, if the endoscope has an irrigation channel. To perform BAL, the horse is usually sedated, and local anaesthetic is usually instilled into the airways to reduce coughing.|$|E
2500|$|Serial {{dilution}} {{is achieved}} by taking an amount of the mixture and adding solvent, but the [...] "Korsakovian" [...] method may also be used, whereby the vessel in which the preparations are manufactured is emptied, refilled with solvent, and the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> adhering to {{the walls of the}} vessel is deemed sufficient for the new batch. The Korsakovian method is sometimes referred to as K on the label of a homeopathic preparation, e.g. 200CK is a 200C preparation made using the Korsakovian method.|$|E

2500|$|The {{modeling}} of two-phase flow {{is still under}} development. Different methods have been proposed, including the <b>Volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> method, the Level set method and front tracking. [...] These methods often involve a tradeoff between maintaining a sharp interface or conserving mass [...] [...] This is crucial since {{the evaluation of the}} density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface. Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase.|$|E

[...] Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including: heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure, and filtration. Sterilization is distinct from disinfection, sanitization, and pasteurization in that sterilization kills, deactivates, or eliminates all forms of life and other biological agents which are present.|$|E

40|$|Microfluidic {{analysis}} devices, {{often referred}} to as Micro Total Analysis Systems or the Lab-on-a-Chip, are often based on the manipulation <b>of</b> small <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluid.</b> These devices require the design and fabrication <b>of</b> components for <b>fluid</b> handling, control and measurement, such as micropumps, micromixers and flow sensors. The fabrication of miniature versions of large scale components such as pressure sensors and flow rate meters has been demonstrated. However, complicated fabrication is prohibitive and devices which involve flow constriction can be prone to blocking if particle containing samples are used. This paper presents results of the design and fabrication of a microimpedance measurement cell, designed to measure the impedance <b>of</b> sub-nanolitre <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluids.</b> The measurement system was designed to measure the electrical impedance at several different frequencies, allowing identification and analysis of the material contained within the sample <b>volume.</b> Measurements <b>of</b> different <b>fluids</b> at different flow rates through a microchannel containing the measurement cell are presented.
