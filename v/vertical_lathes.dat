It will be noticed that Asian large bells are often bowl shaped but lack the lip and are often not free-swinging. Also note the special shape of Bianzhong bells, allowing two tones. The scaling or size of most bells to each other may be approximated by the equation for circular cylinders: f=Ch/D2, where h is thickness, D is diameter, and C is a constant determined by the material and the profile. Previously tuned through chipping, bells are now tuned after casting with <b>vertical</b> <b>lathes</b> by paring out the inside to flatten or edge to sharpen, with sharpening best being avoided.|$|E

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this {{doctoral}} thesis is {{the influence of the}} geometrical accuracy of large CNC machine tools on desired features of produced work pieces. Doe to globalized market environment and competition producers of machine tools have changed their strategy for delivery of their products to customers. The main issue is not only to deliver a machine tool as such; supporting instructions related to the technology of the cutting process on the machine tool are of great importance. When taking delivery, the customer can see a new machine tool that will produce by him specified work piece with a desired accuracy. In the proposed thesis, a development of a novel methodology of measuring <b>vertical</b> <b>lathes</b> for prediction of chosen geometrical parameters of work pieces is introduced. The main goal of this work has been to determine the influence of the geometrical accuracy of selected design groups of a vertical lath on the future geometric accuracy of the work piece. The proposed methodology has been developed and verified on a selected vertical lath SKIQ 30 produced by TOSHULIN, a. s. For identification of chosen parameters of the vertical lath a measuring system using latest measuring technologies has been applied. The basic tool for measured data processing has been a set of statistic methods for prediction of behaviour of measured design groups of the machine. The foundation for statistical processing has been calculation of geometrical deviations obtained from algorithms designed for proposed measurement methodology. The proposed measurement methodology for <b>vertical</b> <b>lathes</b> has been divided into two parts. In the first part, the methodology of measurement and evaluation of linear axes is solved, where a measuring system Laser Track has been used. The employment of the system Laser Track turned out to be very suitable. Conclusions related to the accuracy of the measuring device have been drawn in the thesis. The second part of the proposed methodology is represented by observation and description of the rotating disk, where non-contact position transducers have been used. In the course of the doctoral dissertation it has been observed that the studied (with respect to the geometry) behaviour of the machine is significantly affected by the cutting conditions. To these belong the loading of the rotating disc by the mass of the work piece, angular velocity of the rotating disc and the operating time of the machine. Based on these observations it can be stated that for prediction of work piece features it is essential to know the behaviour of the machine tool in the whole range of the operating speeds and loading of the rotating disc. A part of the proposed methodology for measuring <b>vertical</b> <b>lathes</b> seems to be very suitable for a design of a diagnostic system that could be applied on large rotating disc. Furthermore, it is recommended to extend the doctoral thesis in order to develop a unit for compensation of geometrical errors on rotating discs of <b>vertical</b> <b>lathes...</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{research}} {{topic of}} this dissertation thesis {{deals with the}} influence of the working accuracy related to large CNC machines on the required workpiece properties. The state-of-the art has constantly been developed and the customer’s requirements directed to manufacturers of the machine tools are increasingly demanding. There is required a high accuracy, reliability, shortening delivery times etc. The manufacturer is expected to fulfill all the customer’s requirements. The machining accuracy is dependent, among others, on the positioning accuracy of a machine tool that represents the position of the cutting tool relative to a workpiece. The accuracy of a particular machine tool is therefore a limiting factor concerned with reaching the highest accuracy and quality of a workpiece. Acceptance test procedures are initially realized within a manufacturing shop floor and then within a customer environment. The main subject of the testing procedures is to verify. basic properties of a machine tool such as basic dimensions of a machine, strokes in all respective coordinates, machine travels and spindle speeds. A machining of a workpiece with a desired precision specified by the customer is also performed. In this thesis, a new methodology to calculate and determine errors concerned with machining on <b>vertical</b> <b>lathes</b> is proposed with the aim of predicting the machining accuracy of CNC machine tools. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of machining accuracy of a CNC machine in connection with a subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece. Considered position of a tool relative to a workpiece will be affected by errors concerned with a kinematical inaccuracy, geometrical errors and errors related to machining forces. A vertical lathe SKIQ 30 produced by TOSHULIN, a. s. {{has been used as a}} testing machine on which the proposed methodology has been verified. During processing various calculations in this thesis there has been found out that the machining inaccuracy of the machine – main topic of interest – is influenced by the machining conditions such as cutting conditions, material to be machined and even the setting of working positions of the machine. For instance, a position of the cross slide is determined by a workpiece height and a position of the lathe carriage that is determined by a workpiece diameter and a travel of the slide that is also determined by a workpiece height. It can be stated then that to predict the machining accuracy of work pieces, it is important to know the behavior of the machine in its all range of working envelope. Based on the information acquired about the behavior of the machine, it can be determined an appropriate position for a workpiece setting that allows utilizing the maximum reachable accuracy with respect to the stiffness and geometrical accuracy of the machine tool. An appropriate setting of initial working position may influence the subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary barrier}} to the {{production}} of better machined parts is machine tool error. Present day applications are requiring closer machine part tolerances. The errors in dimensional part accuracy derive from the machine, in this case, a vertical two axis CNC lathe. A two axis <b>vertical</b> <b>lathe</b> can be utilized to produce a variety of parts ranging from cylindrical features to spherical features. A <b>vertical</b> <b>lathe</b> requires a spindle to rotate the work at speeds reaching 3000 rpm, while simultaneously requiring the machine tool to be positioned in such a manner to remove material and produce an accurate part. For this to be possible, the machine tool must be precisely controlled in order to produce the correct contours on the part. There are many sources of errors to be considered in the two axis <b>vertical</b> <b>lathe.</b> Each axis of importance contains six degrees of freedom. The machine has linear displacement, angular, spindle thermal drift, straightness, parallelism, orthogonal, machine tool offset and roundness error. These error components must be measured {{in order to determine the}} resultant error. The characterization of the machine addresses thermal behavior and geometric errors. This thesis presents the approach of determining the machine tool errors and using these errors to transform the actual tool path closer to the nominal tool path via compensation schemes. One of these schemes uses a laser interferometer in conjunction with a homogenous transformation matrix to construct the compensated path for a circular arc, facing and turning. The other scheme uses a ball bar system to directly construct the compensated tool path for a circular arc. Test parts were created to verify the improvement of the part accuracy using the compensated tool paths. M. S. Committee Chair: Dr. Thomas R.

This improvement is more remarkable, the higher the scale on which the machine work, due to the tolerances and decrease of stiffness of this type of machines. But to feed these models is necessary to characterize the stiffness of the machine. To perform theoretically this characterization using finite elements is in general very difficult and sometimes impossible because the user often does not know the structural characteristics of the machine.
