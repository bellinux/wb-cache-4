5|$|Opposite the {{internal}} doors, {{in the south}} wall, there is a plain pointed priest's door with cut stone <b>voussoirs,</b> by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone <b>voussoirs.</b> There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} sighting tower, {{the north}} and south portals and the retaining walls to the south portal are all Grade II listed structures. The portals are on Network Rail land with no public access. The southern portal at the Horsforth end is a plain sandstone horseshoe-shaped arch with rusticated <b>voussoirs</b> below a cornice and a parapet. It is approached by a slightly curved 300-metre cutting faced with sandstone retaining walls. They have a concave batter, slightly-projecting piers at regular intervals and are topped with square coping stones.|$|E
50|$|Although {{each unit}} in an arch or vault is a <b>voussoir,</b> two units are of {{distinct}} functional importance: the keystone and the springer. The keystone {{is the center}} stone or masonry unit {{at the apex of}} an arch. The springer is the lowest <b>voussoir</b> on each side, located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or abutment of the wall or pier.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>voussoir</b> [...] is a {{wedge-shaped}} element, {{typically a}} stone, {{which is used}} in building an arch or vault.|$|R
5000|$|The word is a mason's term {{borrowed}} in Middle English from French verbs connoting a [...] "turn" [...] (OED). Each wedge-shaped <b>voussoir</b> turns {{aside the}} thrust of the mass above, transferring it from stone to stone to the springer's bottom face ('impost'), which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports. <b>Voussoir</b> arches distribute weight efficiently and take maximum advantage of the compressive strength of stone, as in an arch bridge.|$|R
5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of the arch, {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of <b>voussoirs,</b> have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of the arch were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west.|$|E
5|$|The arch {{was built}} {{as part of}} the Temple Mount's massive western {{retaining}} wall, which forms its eastern support. The <b>voussoirs</b> spring from a row of impost blocks which were cut to produce a dentil pattern. There have been some theories which speculate that the dentils were employed as part of a system used to shore up timber forms used during construction. However, this was a common decorative element employed in the region at the time, and archaeologists have noted that in this region of limited forests it is much more likely that packed earth, rather than expensive timbers, was used to support the form on which the arch was constructed.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of <b>voussoirs</b> with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E

50|$|The Rhodes Footbridge is {{an ancient}} Greek arch bridge {{in the city of}} Rhodes, Greece. Dating to the 4th century BC or early Hellenistic period, the modest {{structure}} represents the oldest known Greek bridge with a <b>voussoir</b> arch.|$|R
5|$|The museum {{contains}} information {{relating to}} the history of the site and some of the artefacts discovered during the excavations. These include carved coffin lids, medieval mosaic tiles, pottery, scribe's writing equipment and domestic items from the various buildings on the site such as buttons, combs and wig curlers. Two medieval skeletons recovered in the excavations are on display, including one showing signs of Paget's disease of bone. Standing in the museum is a reconstruction of the cloister arcade as it had been built following the fire of 1236. It consists of moulded pointed arches with springer blocks, <b>voussoirs</b> and apex stones, supported on triple shafts with foliate capitals and moulded bases. Above the capitals, at the bases of the arches, are sculptures that include depictions of human and animal heads. The human heads consist of two canons with hoods and protruding tonsures, other males, and females with shoulder-length hair. In one spandrel is a seated figure with an outstretched arm holding a book. Other carvings depict such subjects as fabulous beasts, and an otter or a snake.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two <b>voussoirs</b> decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E

50|$|Along {{the coast}} are the defence towers, which were built between 1530 and 1630 {{to fend off}} pirates. They are all square, with door with <b>voussoir,</b> floor and vault. Most {{of them have been}} renovated, and are now used as houses or summer residences.|$|R
50|$|The side fa√ßade, which faces calle Miradero del Barrionuevo, has two heights, {{with eight}} {{half-point}} windows per floor. The <b>voussoir</b> of these arches are highlighted with bricks of different coloration. Both the impost {{line and the}} cornice have the same characteristics of the main fa√ßade.|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} kind of vault is {{the barrel}} vault (also called a wagon or tunnel vault), {{which is generally}} semicircular in shape. The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of <b>voussoirs</b> are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by centering consisting of a framed truss with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the <b>voussoirs</b> until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.|$|E
25|$|Decorations in Mamluk {{buildings}} {{concentrated on}} the most conspicuous areas of buildings: minarets, portals, windows, on the outside, and mihrab, qiblah wall, and floor on the inside. Decorations at the time may be subdivided into structural decoration (found outside the buildings and incorporate the medium of construction itself such as ablaq walls, plain or zigzag moldings, fishscale motifs, joggled lintels or <b>voussoirs,</b> inscriptions, and muqarnas) and applied decoration (found inside the buildings and {{include the use of}} marble marquetry, stucco, and glass mosaic).|$|E
25|$|Public School No. 17, 43 Second Avenue. No {{longer in}} use, this three-story ten-by-four-bay brick {{structure}} {{is built into}} the slope at the top of Stephen Street, revealing its brownstone foundation at the north and east sides. Brick pilasters rise to the corbelled flat roof with unusual projecting round arches. Along the south facade are two gabled entrance porches whose arches have radiating stone <b>voussoirs.</b> When built in 1875 it was the first major institutional building in the South End.|$|E

50|$|Can Serra, {{built in}} 1565, is Renaissance-style {{building}} with a ground floor and two upper floors. The facade is particularly noteworthy for its <b>voussoir</b> doorway and its windows framed by mouldings and corbels. The original interior structure has been preserved, including the original wood panelling, which is of particular interest.|$|R
50|$|A curved outside {{staircase}} still provides {{access to}} the three upper floors of this little tower {{so it can be}} explored. It has mullioned windows and is noteworthy for its finely carved fireplace with a joggle <b>voussoir</b> arch and its tall round chimney. The rounded chimney may be a later improvement.|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} {{entrance is}} through the tower archway {{by way of a}} large, semi-circular arch that is decorated by rubbed brick and am impost three bricks high {{at the lower end of}} the arch. The arch itself consists of <b>voussoirs</b> with plastered over, white bricks forming the interior of the arch. Above the arch is a primitive, triangular tympanum the lower line of which extends beyond the raked borders. It is embellished by a fascia on the outer course with a fillet and ovolo on the inner course. It was alternately decorated with white cement, a marble tablet, and now a wash of mortar.|$|E
25|$|Roman arch bridges {{were usually}} semicircular, {{although}} a few were segmental (such as Alcon√©tar Bridge). A segmental arch is an arch that {{is less than a}} semicircle. The advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones (<b>voussoirs)</b> of the same in size and shape. The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard and Segovia Aqueduct. Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world's oldest major bridges still standing.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone <b>voussoirs</b> making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch faces at right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E
2500|$|Possibly {{the oldest}} {{existing}} arch bridge is the Mycenaean Arkadiko bridge in Greece from about 1300 BC. The stone corbel arch bridge is still {{used by the}} local populace. The well-preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge has a triangular corbel arch. The 4th century BC Rhodes Footbridge rests on an early <b>voussoir</b> arch.|$|R
50|$|The new station {{building}} is a long, low rectangular block with a bell-cast hip roof and projecting bay windows on both the track and Lorne Street sides of the structure. The overhanging eaves expose wood brackets and tongue-and-groove boarding. A gabled dormer and round-arched window with stone <b>voussoir</b> projects above each bay window.|$|R
40|$|The consent {{conditions}} at Mandalong Mine require that subsidence deformations must {{not change the}} flood hazard category or subject a dwelling to deformation beyond safe surface and repairable (SSR) unless permission is granted by the effected landholder. The subsidence prediction in 2003 utilised an analysis of sag based on <b>voussoir</b> beams and of pillar compression based on foundation engineering principles. The model uncertainty for the sag analysis was assessed to be relatively high with a low parameter uncertainty, while for the pillar compression the model uncertainty was low but the parameter uncertainty was high. Up to June 2009, seven longwalls have been extracted. The consent conditions have not been breached. Both the <b>voussoir</b> beam and pillar compression models have been demonstrated to be valid. There have been {{changes in the way}} in which key input parameters are estimated...|$|R
