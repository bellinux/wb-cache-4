40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} {{the class of}} <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> committees {{to be used by}} a society to collectively choose a subset of a given set of objects. We o¤er a simple criterion to compare two <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> committees without dummy agents according to their manipulability. This criterion is based on the set-inclusion relationships of the two corresponding decisive and vetoer sets of agents. We show that the binary relation to be as manipulable as endows the set of equivalence classes of anonymous <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> committees (i. e., <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> quotas) with a complete upper semilattice structure, whose supremum is the equivalence class containing all <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> quotas with the property that the quota of each object is strictly larger than one and strictly lower than the number of agents. Finally, we extend the comparability criterion to the full class of all <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> committees...|$|R
40|$|I {{introduce}} <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> {{proxy for}} constructing and operating legislatures, and then {{compare it to}} direct representation, plurality, and single transferable vote (STV), which <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> proxy most closely resembles. When each voter uses <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> proxy to select his proxy among given legislators and elections are costless, <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> proxy maximizes the legislature's representation of the voting population. When each voter uses preferential <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> proxy, selecting a proxy during the vote count {{as well as a}} proxy in the legislature, and some ancillary rules are followed, I find that <b>voting</b> <b>by</b> proxy dominates STV and offers favorable tradeoffs against plurality. It improves representation and constituent service; eliminates gerrymandering; improves voter turnout; ranks the legislature's representatives by the proxies they hold rather than seniority; creates tighter representative-constituent links that lead to better informed voters, reducing the influence of special interests; and eliminates primary and runoff elections. Extra costs associated with its relative complexity or better representation can be made small. Copyright Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006...|$|R

5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to <b>vote</b> <b>by</b> engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote.
