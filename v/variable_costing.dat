50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>costing</b> is a {{managerial}} {{accounting cost}} concept. Under this method, manufacturing overhead is incurred {{in the period}} that a product is produced. This addresses the issue of absorption costing that allows income to rise as production rises. Under an absorption cost method, management can push forward costs to the next period when products are sold. This artificially inflates profits {{in the period of}} production by incurring less cost than would be incurred under a <b>variable</b> <b>costing</b> system. <b>Variable</b> <b>costing</b> is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP.|$|E

One type of relevant cost is incremental cost, which is additional cost when an alternative is not chosen in a process of decision making.

Example of short range decision is special order, which is order from a buyer asking price below normal price, and often management directly refuses this order without further consideration. Concept of incremental cost can be used to evaluate this kind of problem.
