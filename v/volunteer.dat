5|$|In January 1945, {{the handful}} of naval {{personnel}} that survived were transferred to the 32nd SS <b>Volunteer</b> Grenadier Division 30 Januar, and {{the remnants of the}} former division were reorganized as II Battalion of the 14th SS <b>Volunteer</b> Mountain Infantry Regiment of the 7th SS <b>Volunteer</b> Mountain Division Prinz Eugen.

After the war, he was found guilty of war crimes and hanged. In February 1945, the battalion was disbanded altogether and its remaining manpower was assigned to the German police regiment near Zagreb.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis titled "Pro-Social Behaviour of <b>Volunteers</b> addresses <b>volunteering</b> and <b>volunteers,</b> {{and compares}} differences in pro-social behaviour of <b>volunteers</b> {{and the common}} population.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of formal <b>volunteering</b> varies widely across European countries, {{and rates of}} formal <b>volunteering</b> are especially low among Eastern European countries. Why are there such large differences in <b>volunteering</b> rates when {{it is known that}} <b>volunteering</b> is beneficial for well-being? Using data from the latest round of the European Social Survey, we test three hypotheses to explain these cross-national differences in <b>volunteering.</b> We ask whether people in countries with low frequencies of <b>volunteering</b> spend more of their time on informal <b>volunteering</b> activities; whether they differ on socio-demographic variables which are known to be linked to <b>volunteering</b> rates; or whether they show less well-being benefit from formal <b>volunteering.</b> Contrary to the first hypothesis, we find a positive correlation between formal and informal <b>volunteering.</b> We further conclude that national differences in rates of <b>volunteering</b> cannot be fully explained by differences in the social, psychological or cultural factors associated with <b>volunteering</b> nor the outcome of <b>volunteering.</b> It is likely that contextual factors, such as a country’s historical background or institutions, determine levels of <b>volunteering</b> to a large extent...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{increased}} competitive {{pressures in}} the <b>volunteering</b> industry, {{the structure of}} competition within this non-profit sector has not been examined in the past. This study uses selected respondents from the 1999 - 2002 World Values Survey who have previously <b>volunteered</b> for multiple organisations. Based on the patterns of organisations that <b>volunteers</b> donated their time for, competition between <b>volunteering</b> organisations with different missions was analysed, resulting in five dimensions of <b>volunteering</b> missions within which <b>volunteering</b> organisations appear to be competing: altruistic, leisure, political, church, and other missions. The altruistic mission groups is the broadest and includes {{a wide variety of}} <b>volunteering</b> goals, whereas the church seems to stand without much competition, thus being confronted with the least competitive threat in the fight for <b>volunteers.</b> Such analyses would be useful for managers faced with the challenge of retaining current <b>volunteers</b> and recruiting new <b>volunteers</b> in an increasingly competitive <b>volunteering</b> marketplace. As such, the proposed approach represents a way of analysing the competitive market structure analysis in the <b>volunteering</b> market, thus providing <b>volunteering</b> organisations with a useful tool from the marketing toolbox...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the research process}} that was carried out to investigate the relationship between <b>volunteering</b> and employability amongst university students. Much literature is available on <b>volunteering</b> in general, however there is limited literature {{in the area of}} student <b>volunteering.</b> Upon carrying out secondary research, it becomes clear that although there is a broad range of literature, it is lacking in depth. This is due to several gaps in the literature being present. In particular there is very little literature discussing the disadvantages of <b>volunteering.</b> The existing literature describes <b>volunteering</b> as a healthy and beneficial phenomenon and states that the primary motivations for <b>volunteering</b> are to increase employability and for altruistic reasons. This research attempted to provide {{a better understanding of the}} phenomenon known as <b>volunteering.</b> The secondary research allowed the researcher to better understand the topic and be able to design and implement the research. As part of the research process, 15 students or recent graduates were interviewed about their <b>volunteering</b> experiences. It was discovered that the primary motivations for <b>volunteering</b> amongst students was reflective of the motivations for others <b>volunteering.</b> However a number of new and developing themes arose. This paper discusses <b>volunteering</b> with religious motivations and negative aspects of <b>volunteering,</b> which have been previously missing from the academic literature. This paper also explores the disadvantages of <b>volunteering</b> to students and the role that organisations play when using <b>volunteers.</b> The key finding of this research was that <b>volunteering</b> is greatly benefits a student’s employability. However, as this is a preliminary investigation, further research is needed to support a broader understanding of this topic, to promote successful and beneficial <b>volunteering</b> activities.
