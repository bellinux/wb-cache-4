5000|$|A flow-restricted, oxygen-powered <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> (FROPVD), also {{referred}} to as a manually triggered <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> (MTV), is used to assist ventilation in apneic or hypoventilating patients, although these devices {{can also be used to}} provide supplemental oxygen to breathing patents. When ventilating a patient with a (FROPVD) you must ensure an adequate, constant oxygen supply is available. Once the oxygen source is depleted, the device can no longer be used because it is driven completely by an oxygen source. The device must have a pressure relief valve that opens at 60cm of water pressure to avoid over ventilation and trauma to the lungs.|$|E

40|$|Current {{devices for}} {{providing}} noninvasive respiratory support contain sensors and built-in intelligence for automatically modifying ventilation {{according to the}} patient's needs. These devices, including automatic continuous positive airway pressure devices and noninvasive ventilators, are technologically complex and offer {{a considerable number of}} different modes of ventilation and setting options, the details of which are sometimes difficult to capture by the user. Therefore, better predicting and interpreting the actual performance of these <b>ventilation</b> <b>devices</b> in clinical application requires understanding their functioning principles and assessing their performance under well controlled bench test conditions with simulated patients. This concise review presents an updated perspective of the theoretical basis of intelligent continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>devices,</b> and of the tools available for assessing how these devices respond under specific ventilation phenotypes in patients requiring breathing support...|$|R

30|$|Introduction The {{noise is}} {{associated}} with morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, related to sleep fragmentation and delirium primarily (1 - 3). The <b>ventilation</b> <b>devices</b> can generate noise, with further impact {{on the effectiveness of}} the technique.

50|$|A {{rudimentary}} type {{of mechanical}} ventilator device {{that has the}} advantage of not needing electricity is a flow-restricted, oxygen-powered <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> (FROPVD). These are similar to manual resuscitators in that oxygen is pushed through a mask to force-inflate the patient's lungs, but unlike a manual resuscitator where the pressure used to force-inflate the patient’s lungs comes from a person manually squeezing a bag, with the FROPVD the pressure needed to force-inflate the lungs comes directly from a pressurized oxygen cylinder. These devices will stop functioning when the compressed oxygen tank becomes depleted.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{feature of}} the 1887 {{building}} is its provision of natural light and ventilation. The large, tapered-wall roof lantern (8 m high) with operable windows straddles the hallway and front two offices, bathing them in natural light. Fanlights are located above all doorways {{and there is a}} variety of high level windows in external timber walls throughout as well as timber fretwork ceiling roses in each of the rooms. An unusual <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> is located in the rooms along the windowless north-eastern built-to-boundary wall. In the corners of each room, triangular ventilation ducts (1.2 m high) draw air from beneath the building {{as well as from the}} hallway through holes in the partition walls into the rooms.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, tunnel fire {{accidents}} {{of about}} 20 occur {{every year in}} Japan. The Nihonzaka and the Sakai tunnel fire accidents are as famous typical examples. When concentrated exhaust <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> is activated in such a tunnel fire, it is of concern {{that the people who}} take shelter receive damage from the fire smoke. When a tunnel fire occurs, the concentrated exhaust <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> is stopped in Japan. Therefore, the research on the use of concentrated exhaust <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> at a tunnel fire has not advanced in Japan. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify the smoke propagation when concentrated exhaust <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> is activated. The model tunnel in the scale of 1 / 5 was used in this study. Froude scaling law was used to make the experimental results of the model tunnel correspond to the real scale tunnel. The concentrated exhaust <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> installed on the model tunnel extracts the fire smoke from a chimney. The smoke distribution in the model tunnel was measured with smoke concentration meters. In the case that the exhaust <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> was activated, the smoke layer thickness of the downstream of the chimney thinned. However, in the upstream of the chimney, the smoke layer thickness did not change though the exhaust <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> was activated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this study, we {{proposed}} an innovative design for mechanical ventilation {{by applying the}} previously implemented optimal respiratory control simulator as the controller of an experimental <b>ventilation</b> <b>device.</b> Instead of providing a fixed airflow pattern, an optimal spontaneous flow pattern was optimized by the simulator based on patient’s estimated respiratory mechanics and was applied to drive a <b>ventilation</b> <b>device.</b> We also implemented an experimental ventilation control system, including the simulator, a <b>ventilation</b> <b>device,</b> an artificial lung, and a feedback control mechanism to attain minimum work of breathing during mechanical ventilation. The experiments were elaborated to verify that once patient’s respiratory physiology was significant changed, the breathing signals and measured respiratory mechanics were instantaneously monitored, and the optimization process was renewed by the simulator under the feedback control strategy...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Exposure to {{organophosphates}} (OP) {{may lead}} to a life threatening cholinergic crisis with death attributed to a rapidly progressive respiratory failure. In a toxicological mass casualty event involving organophosphate exposure, many of the victims may depend on immediate short-term ventilation to overcome the respiratory distress which may exhaust life supporting resources. In addition, the mandatory use of personal protective gear by first responders emphasizes the need for a noninvasive, easy-to-operate <b>ventilation</b> <b>device.</b> Our objective was to assess the efficacy of MRTX, a Biphasic Cuirass <b>Ventilation</b> <b>device,</b> in comparison with standard bag-valve mask ventilation following acute organophosphate poisoning. Methods: Pigs were exposed to paraoxon poisoning (1. 4  LD 50), and treated 8  min later with atropine (0. 05  mg/kg). The control group received no further support (n =  9), the two experimental groups received ventilation support initiated 15  min post exposure and lasted for 25  min: one group was ventilated with the commonly used bag-valve mask (Mask group, n =  7) and the other was ventilated with the Biphasic Cuirass <b>Ventilation</b> <b>device</b> (Cuirass group, n =  7). Clinical signs and physiological parameters were monitored during the first hour, and mortality up to 24  h post exposure was recorded. Results: No mortality was observed in the Cuirass group following OP poisoning, while mortality in the Control and in the Mask groups was high (67 % and 71 %, respectively). Mouth excretions of the cuirass-ventilated animals were frothy white as in deep suctioning, as opposed to the clear saliva-like appearance of secretions in the other two groups. No further group differences were recorded. Conclusions: The noninvasive, easy-to-operate Biphasic Cuirass <b>Ventilation</b> <b>device</b> was effective in reducing OP-induced mortality and might be advantageous in an organophosphate mass casualty event. This finding should be validated in further investigations...|$|E

40|$|The current {{methods used}} to assess the energy {{performance}} of <b>ventilation</b> <b>devices</b> do not consider all the aspects necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of decentralised ventilation concepts and can only be partially adapted to their needs. In order to improve the energy evaluation and to ensure the comparability of different systems, a calorimetric method was developed and implemented in test facilities for the evaluation of two decentralised devices: one equipped with a recuperative counter flow heat exchanger and one with a regenerative heat exchanger. This method, based on direct measurements of the heating load in an insulated test room, includes the effect of the electrical consumption of the fans on the energy performance of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>devices.</b> The calorimetric evaluation method was extended to a seasonal evaluation {{on the basis of a}} heating-degree-day method implemented for a warm, a cool and a moderate location in Europe: Athens, Strasbourg and Copenhagen.

30|$|Coal {{charging}} and seal. Certain 70 -mesh {{stainless steel}} wire meshes were placed under the cribriform <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> {{at the bottom of}} the experimental platform primary box. Coal granules cannot cross the steel wire meshes, so the cribriform <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> under the steel wire meshes would not be blocked by coal granules. With the steel wire meshes in place, a layer of stones (10  cm thick; 20, 10 and 5  mm diameter) was laid to enable even gas to charge. After the stone paving had been laid, several 70 -mesh steel wire meshes were placed on the stone layer. The stable stone pad forms the structure of the gas-charging base. The prepared coal is placed into a primary box and tamped. Pressure, stress and temperature sensors were placed in the coal sample at different layers and locations. The top shell was set in place and sealed. Leak detection was conducted to ensure that the experimental box was airtight.|$|E

40|$|A local {{operating}} theatre <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> which ventilates {{the wound}} area only, was investigated applying a parameter study. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>device</b> {{is combined with}} a blanket which lies over the patient during the operation. Two configurations were studied: configuration 1 where HEPA-filtered air was supplied around and parallel to the wound area and configuration 2 where HEPA-filtered air was supplied from the top surface of the blanket, perpendicular to the wound area. The objective of the parameter {{study was to identify}} critical parameters. A simplified setup, which consisted of a sideways contaminated airflow and a HEPA-filtered airflow, was studied by experiments and CFD simulations. Particle concentrations (= 0. 5 µm) were measured at the wound, relative to a non-ventilated situation with only sideways contaminated airflow (N= 30 per series; expressed in %). The effect of supply velocity, temperature and contaminant velocity were investigated. In isothermal conditions relative particle concentrations of 0 - 11 % and 0 - 1 % were measured for configuration 1 and 2 with a supply velocity of 0. 40 m/s and 0. 30 m/s respectively. However, differences between both configurations were not significant. Furthermore, configuration 1 was more sensitive to lower supply velocities (...|$|E
