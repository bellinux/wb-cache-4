25|$|High school diplomas {{received}} from countries outside of Germany are, in many cases, not considered {{equivalent to the}} Abitur, but rather to a Realschulabschluss and therefore do not qualify the bearer for admission to a German university.

25|$|From 1926 to 1941, {{scores on}} the SAT were scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section. In 1941 and 1942, SAT scores were {{standardized}} via test equating, and as a consequence, average verbal and math scores could vary from that time forward. In 1952, mean verbal and math scores were 476 and 494, respectively, and scores were generally stable in the 1950s and early 1960s. However, starting in the mid-1960s and continuing until the early 1980s, SAT scores declined: the average <b>verbal</b> <b>score</b> dropped by about 50 points, and the average math score fell by about 30 points. By the late 1970s, only the upper third of test takers were {{doing as well as}} the upper half of those taking the SAT in 1963. From 1961 to 1977, the number of SATs taken per year doubled, suggesting that the decline could be explained by demographic changes in the group of students taking the SAT. Commissioned by the College Board, an independent study of the decline found that most (up to about 75%) of the test decline in the 1960s could be explained by compositional changes in the group of students taking the test; however, only about 25 percent of the 1970s decrease in test scores could similarly be explained. Later analyses suggested that up to 40 percent of the 1970s decline in scores could be explained by demographic changes, leaving unknown {{at least some of the}} reasons for the decline.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{relations between}} the Big Five personality traits and academic outcomes, specifically SAT scores and grade-point average (GPA). Openness was the strongest predictor of SAT <b>verbal</b> <b>scores,</b> and Conscientiousness was the strongest predictor of both {{high school and college}} GPA. These relations replicated across 4 independent samples and across 4 different personality inventories. Further analyses showed that Conscientiousness predicted college GPA, even after controlling for high school GPA and SAT scores, and that the relation between Conscientiousness and college GPA was mediated, both concurrently and longitudinally, by increased academic effort and higher levels of perceived academic ability. The relation between Openness and SAT <b>verbal</b> <b>scores</b> was independent of academic achievement and was mediated, both concurrently and longitudinally, by perceived verbal intelligence. Together, these findings show that personality traits have independent and incremental effects on academic outcomes, even after controlling for traditional predictors of those outcomes...|$|R

30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{is the relationship}} between the construct of intelligence and SAT scores. The relationships observed in this study could reflect another construct influencing SAT scores, such as motivation. One’s level of motivation to perform well on the SAT seems related to PWB dimensions, e.g., Environmental Mastery. Thus, {{it is possible that the}} relationships between SAT and these dimensions are not solely attributable to intelligence, but rather to motivation, preparation, etc., or a combination. For example, the observed negative relationship between SAT <b>Verbal</b> <b>scores</b> and the EM subscale score could be a reflection of motivation, in that students who felt that they had poorer environmental mastery would prepare more for, and try harder on, the SAT. If such additional effort and preparation were more likely to improve <b>Verbal</b> <b>scores</b> than Math, then a relationship could be observed for the former but not the latter: a plausible explanation for that very finding in this study.|$|R

5000|$|Lech's {{alternative}} {{suggestions for}} further research in that 2007 dissertation indicated that it is quite likely the math-verbal achievement gap could be partially explained by the rapid proliferation of math and science Advanced Placement courses in American high schools. This wave of science and math AP courses, over that of humanities AP courses, is rising concurrently with higher math scores over that of <b>verbal</b> <b>scores</b> on these standardized tests. [...] He added that this effect could be multiplied if large numbers of savvy students are front-loading the math and science AP courses in high school to intentionally [...] "bone-up" [...] for corresponding sections on the SAT/ACT. Indeed {{there does seem to}} be a solid preference for better math and science marks by college admission personnel. This would simultaneously explain both better scores on the math portions of the SAT/ACT and stagnating <b>verbal</b> <b>scores</b> on those tests. After all, AP English in 12th grade will not provide praxis for college-entry tests taken in 11th grade.|$|R
