50|$|One {{proposed}} {{current application}} for {{the device is}} a waste pump, in factories and mills where normal <b>vane-type</b> turbine pumps typically get blocked.|$|E
50|$|This type {{was most}} common pre-war, {{although}} Ferrari {{continued to use}} the Houdaille <b>vane-type</b> for Formula One racing cars into the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 1987 G4A-EL {{included three}} shift solenoids, a lockup solenoid, a <b>vane-type</b> pump, and a throttle cable. It was redesigned for 1988 {{and used in}} the Ford Probe the next year under the 4EAT-G name by Ford.|$|E
50|$|The 9HP is only 0.24 inches (6mm) longer than, {{and weighs}} 16.5 lbs (7.5 kg) less than, the {{outgoing}} six-speed transmission. The compact packaging {{is achieved by}} using a number of innovative design features: a new compact hydraulic <b>vane-type</b> pump, two patented dog clutches, which replace bulkier conventional clutch packs, and a nested gear set.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} MX-5 {{came with}} a 1.6 L dual overhead cam inline four-cylinder engine, producing [...] at 6500 rpm, and 136 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm. The engine employs an {{electronic fuel injection system}} using a <b>vane-type</b> air flow meter and an electronic ignition system with a camshaft angle sensor instead of a distributor. This engine, codename B6ZE(RS), was specifically designed for the MX-5 and featured a lightened crankshaft, flywheel, and aluminum sump with cooling fins.|$|E
5000|$|The 4A-GE {{produced}} [...] at 6,600 rpm and 131 Nm {{of torque}} at 4,800 rpm in the American market. The {{use of a}} <b>vane-type</b> air flow meter (AFM), which restricted air flow slightly but produced cleaner emissions that conformed to the U.S. regulations, limited the power considerably - the Japanese model, which uses a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, was originally rated at [...] However, this was a gross power rating and the motor was later re-rated at [...] net. Nonetheless, Japanese cars tested no faster than their American counterparts despite their higher power rating and a lower curb weight.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fourth-generation}} 4A-GE {{engine was}} produced from 1991 to 1995. It has silver cam covers with chrome lettering, hence the nickname [...] "silver top". This engine yet again features {{a completely new}} cylinder head which uses five valves per cylinder instead of four. It uses Toyota's Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system on the intake cam, an increased compression ratio (10.5:1), and the intake system was replaced with a short manifold with individual throttles and velocity stacks, however the <b>vane-type</b> airflow meter was retained, requiring {{the use of a}} plenum. The previous 16-valve head used a sharply curved intake port, while the 20-valve engine used a very upright straight port. This engine produces [...] at 7,400 rpm with 16.5 kgm Nm of torque at 5,200 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Air (or other gas) {{pressure}} {{is the power}} source for pneumatic valve actuators. They are used on linear or quarter-turn valves. Air pressure acts on a piston or bellows diaphragm creating linear force on a valve stem. Alternatively, a quarter-turn <b>vane-type</b> actuator produces torque to provide rotary motion to operate a quarter-turn valve. A pneumatic actuator may be arranged to be spring-closed or spring-opened, with air pressure overcoming the spring to provide movement. A [...] "double acting" [...] actuator use air applied to different inlets to move the valve in the opening or closing direction. A central compressed air system can provide the clean, dry, compressed air needed for pneumatic actuators. In some types, for example, regulators for compressed gas, the supply {{pressure is}} provided from the process gas stream and waste gas either vented to air or dumped into lower-pressure process piping.|$|E
5000|$|The pushrod Standard {{inline-four}} engine, {{was designed}} {{for use by the}} Fergusun TE20 tractor. The TR4 engine was continued from the earlier TR2/3 models, but the displacement was increased from 1991cc to 2138 cc in the TR4 by increasing bore size. Gradual improvements in the manifolds and cylinder head allowed for some improvements culminating in the TR4A model. The 1991 cc engine became a no-cost option for those cars destined to race in the under-two-litre classes of the day. Some cars were fitted with <b>vane-type</b> superchargers, as the three main bearing engine was prone to crankshaft failure if revved beyond 6,500 rpm; superchargers allowed a TR4 to produce much more horsepower and torque at relatively modest revolutions. The standard engine produced [...] SAE but, supercharged and otherwise performance-tuned, a 2.2-litre I4 version could produce in excess of [...] at the flywheel. The TR4, in common with its predecessors, was fitted with a wet-sleeve engine, so that for competition use the engine's cubic capacity could be changed by swapping the cylinder liners and pistons, allowing a competitor to race under different capacity rules (i.e. below or above 2 litres for example).|$|E
50|$|A type of {{pneumatic}} motor, {{known as}} a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane. The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and {{the diameter of the}} housing. One application for <b>vane-type</b> air motors is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to investigate the flow characteristics over two rounded contour bumps. <b>Vane-type</b> vortex generators or longitudinal aligned passive by-pass jets were implemented in attempt to achieve wake flow control in rounded contour bumps. According to the results collected from the surface oil flow visualisation experiments, {{it was observed that}} the use of both the <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators and the longitudinally aligned passive by-pass jet could reduce the size of the spanwise vortices in the bump valley. In addition, a pair of streamwise horseshoe vortices was observed downstream of the bump crest of the contour bump that equipped with the <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators. From the data collected in the particle image velocimetry measurements, {{it was found that the}} use of both the <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators and the longitudinally aligned passive by-pass jet could not reduce the size of the wake region but they could reduce its strength. It is deduced that the two streamwise horseshoe vortices generated by the <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators enhance flow mixing which results in reducing the strength of the wake region. In contrast, blowing passive by-pass jet in the bump valley increases the local flow velocity in order to reduce the strength of the wake region...|$|E

40|$|Mist entrained in vapour {{coming out}} from {{commonly}} used equipment, as evaporators, boilers, distillation columns, has to be separated since it can cause air pollution, corrosion, decrease in equipment performance or loss of the processed material. Among the separation devices, <b>vane-type</b> demisters, which separate the liquid droplets by inertial impaction, are usually adopted in many applications, but the desing if often based only on experience. Due {{to the absence of}} reliable data and design equations, the present study shows a theoretical and experimental analysis of this type of separators aimed at defining the collection efficiency as a function of working conditions and some geometrical characteristics. Various packing-types were tested in order to investogate the dependence of the separation efficiency on the most important geometric characteristics of <b>vane-type</b> demistes. The analysis and the results allow to evidence the adimentional numbers characterizing the process and to develop a predicting equation to compute the abatement efficiency for both commercial and not commercial <b>vane-type</b> demisters...|$|E
40|$|Variable {{displacement}} <b>vane-type</b> oil pumps represent one of {{the most}} innovative pump types for industrial applications, especially for engine lubrication systems. This article deals with a mathematical modeling method for theoretical performance investigation of a typical variable displacement <b>vane-type</b> oil pump. This theoretical model is based on the pump geometric design and dynamic analyses. It can be considered as a generation step for {{a deeper understanding of the}} pump operation as well as for effectively implementing the pump control mechanisms to satisfy the urgent demands of engine lubrication systems. The developed theoretical pump model is finally illustrated by numerical simulations...|$|E
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  3, Cases 3, 6 and 7 {{have the}} same seam to seam length and diameter. However, these vessels are {{equipped}} with different internals. A spherical inlet diverter is used for Case 3, while Case 6 is equipped with a <b>vane-type</b> inlet diverter. In addition, Case 7 is equipped with a <b>vane-type</b> inlet diverter, perforated plates and a high-efficiency mist extractor device. The comparison between these cases could highlight the effect of different internals on the three-phase separation performance. It should also be emphasized that Case 7 has the dimensions and internals quite similar to those of an industrial separator currently in use for one of the Iranian oil fields. The results obtained from this vessel were reviewed in a CFD evaluation. The overall arrangement of this separator (Case 7) is shown in Fig.  1 b. Note that the mist extractor device and perforated plates were modeled as the porous zone, while the curved plates were used for modeling of the <b>vane-type</b> inlet diverter.|$|E

Firstly, the conception of interior corner flow and its application in the research of <b>vane-type</b> surface tension tank are introduced. Then the development of analytical solutions about the interior corner flow is expounded, besides some important numerical solutions and experiments in microgravity condition. Up to now, a great deal researches of interior corner flow are carried out overseas, including many drop tower experiments and some space experiments. This paper will provide valuable references for the surface tension tank and interior corner flow research...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a complete and accurate mathematical model for a typical variable-displacement <b>vane-type</b> oil pump to investigate its working performance. First, the detailed theoretical model was built on the basis of pump geometric design and dynamic analyses. Next, numerical simulations with the constructed model and experiments on the actual pump system were carried out to analyse the main power loss factors in order to develop the complete model for high modelling accuracy. The estimated pump performance using the complete pump model was finally verified by numerical simulations in comparison with practical tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to investigate the effects of <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators in affecting the flow pattern of the wake region using a 1 : 20 scale tractor-trailer model. The de Haviland wind tunnel of the University of Glasgow was employed in this study. Surface oil flow visualisation, smoke visualisation and two-component time-averaged particle image velocimetry measurements were used for flow diagnostics. Experimental data showed that putting the vortex generators near {{the front end of}} the trailer model could reduce the size of the vortex in the wake region. In addition, it was observed that the use of the <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators at the front of the trailer model might change the shear layer angle so that a smaller wake region was formed downstream of the trailer. No obvious effects of wake flow control could be observed by placing the vortex generators near the rear end of the trailer model. Finally, it was found that the <b>vane-type</b> vortex generator with the vane height of 6 mm is more effective in achieving wake flow control than the one with the vane height of 4 mm...|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} simulations are performed {{as part of}} a process to design a vortex generator array for a two-dimensional inlet for Mach 1. 6.

40|$|Three {{distinct}} Enterococcus faecalis <b>VanE-type</b> isolates—BM 4574, BM 4575, and BM 4576 -obtained in Australia were studied. Expression of {{the resistance}} genes was constitutive in BM 4575, probably due to a 2 -bp deletion into the vanSE gene, and inducible in BM 4574 and BM 4576. Transcription analysis of the vanE operons suggested that the five genes were cotranscribed from an initiation site located 25 bp upstream from the ATG start codon of vanE...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} on glycopeptide {{activity of}} low-level resistance to vancomycin due to <b>VanE-type</b> resistance were evaluated in vitro and in experimental endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecalis BM 4405 (MICs of vancomycin and teicoplanin: 16 and 0. 5 μg/ml, respectively), its susceptible derivative BM 4405 - 1, and susceptible E. faecalis JH 2 - 2. After 24 h of incubation, vancomycin at 8 μg/ml was not active against E. faecalis BM 4405 whereas it was bacteriostatic against strains BM 4405 - 1 and JH 2 - 2. Against all three strains, vancomycin at 30 μg/ml and teicoplanin at 8 or 30 μg/ml were bacteriostatic but bactericidal {{when combined with}} gentamicin. In rabbits with aortic endocarditis due to <b>VanE-type</b> resistant strain BM 4405, treatment with a standard dose of vancomycin generated subinhibitory plasma concentrations (i. e., peak of 36. 3 ± 2. 1 μg/ml and trough of 6. 0 ± 2. 2 μg/ml) and led to no significant reduction in mean aortic valve vegetation counts compared to no treatment of control animals. In contrast, a higher dosing regimen of vancomycin (i. e., resulting in a peak of 38. 3 ± 5. 2 μg/ml and a trough of 15. 0 ± 8. 3 μg/ml), providing plasma concentrations above the MIC for the entire dosing interval, led to significant and similar activities against all three strains, which were enhanced by combination with gentamicin. Treatment with teicoplanin led to results similar to those obtained with vancomycin at a high dose. No subpopulations with increased resistance to glycopeptides were selected in vitro or in vivo. In conclusion, {{the use of a}} high dose of vancomycin was necessary for the treatment of experimental enterococcal endocarditis due to <b>VanE-type</b> strains...|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, the coalescence and {{breakup of}} particles were {{considered in the}} present study. The simulation {{results showed that the}} droplet coalescence happened at a very low rate of less than 0.5 % in Cases 3, 6 and 7. However, the droplet breakup was more common. For Cases 3, 6 and 7, the droplet breakup occurred at a significant rate of 15.10, 17.94 and 18.37 %, respectively. As a result, it can be concluded that the installation of the <b>vane-type</b> momentum breaker and perforated plates increased the number of breakups.|$|E

Wind-tunnel results obtained for small <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators mounted on a multielement airfoil showed that vortex generators as small as 0. 18 percent of total chord can effectively reduce or eliminate boundary-layer separation on the flap at approach conditions. It was found that both the outerrotating and the corotating streamwise vortices were effective in reducing flow separation...|$|E

40|$|The {{flow control}} in twin air-intakes is {{necessary}} to improve the performance characteristics, since the flow traveling through curved and diffused paths becomes complex, especially after merging. The paper {{presents a comparison between}} two well-known techniques of flow control: active and passive. It presents an effective design of a vortex generator jet (VGJ) and a <b>vane-type</b> passive vortex generator (VG) and uses them in twin air-intake duct in different combinations to establish their effectiveness in improving the performance characteristics. The VGJ is designed to insert flow from side wall at pitch angle of 90 degrees and 45 degrees. Corotating (parallel) and counterrotating (V-shape) are the configuration of vane type VG. It is observed that VGJ has the potential to change the flow pattern drastically as compared to <b>vane-type</b> VG. While the VGJ is directed perpendicular to the side walls of the air-intake at a pitch angle of 90 degree, static pressure recovery is increased by 7. 8 % and total pressure loss is reduced by 40. 7 %, which is the best among all other cases tested for VGJ. For bigger-sized VG attached to the side walls of the air-intake, static pressure recovery is increased by 5. 3 %, but total pressure loss is reduced by only 4. 5 % as compared to all other cases of VG...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the current status and potential application of pyrotechnic gas generators and energy convertors for the space shuttle program. While most pyrotechnic devices utilize some form of linear actuation, only limited use of rotary actuators has been observed. This latter form of energy conversion, using a <b>vane-type</b> actuator as optimum, offers considerable potential {{in the area of}} servo, as well as non-servo systems, and capitalizes on a means of providing prolonged operating times. Pyrotechnic devices can often be shown to provide the optimum means of attaining a truly redundant back-up to a primary, non-pyrotechnic system...|$|E

Airfoil NACA 63 A 421 with simple flap and low profile <b>vane-type</b> vortex generators were used. The investigation {{was carried out}} using experimental and numerical method. The flow over the airfoil was visualized by tuft filaments technique in {{closed circuit wind tunnel}} for two flap deflections and four angles of attack. Two size and two different shapes of vortex generators were tested. The data from numerical simulation of flapped airfoil without VG's control were used for vortex generator designing...|$|E

To study the coil perfomance, the theoretical signal-to-noise ratio predictions of this coil design were computed using a different number of slots. Results were also compared with theoretical results obtained for a circular coil with similar dimensions. It can be appreciated that slotted surface coil performance improves {{as the number of}} coils increases and, outperformed the circular-shaped coil. This makes it a good candidate for other MRI applications involving coil array techniques...|$|E
40|$|Using {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} as the key tool for analysis, this paper looks into the generic designs of two popular types of breakwater, i. e., V-shape breakwater and <b>vane-type</b> breakwater. These are common practices to prevent the intrusion of green water deep into the deck and to protect deck structures and containers from direct impact loading. A hydrodynamic model to present green water flow on deck is also summarized together with brief validation for its appropriateness. The geometrical parameters of these two breakwaters are systematically varied and the effects on their performance against green water are evaluated. The effectiveness of coping with green water loading of each type of breakwater is also analyzed and compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} herein described {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} performance characteristics of the oscillating <b>vane-type</b> fan. The fan was the invention of Mr. Van Dorn and Mr. Cornwell, primarily for use in circulating air in railroad refrigerator cars. In the present system of railroad refrigeration for the transportation of perishable foodstuffs, the refrigerator car is a heat insulated car, with bunkers at each end for the cakes of ice. When the car is loaded and the doors shut, cooling is obtained only due to the natural circulation of air in the car, caused by the difference in temperature between the ice in the bunker and the fruit. This circulation has not been found sufficient, in {{that there is a}} large temperature difference between the top and bottom fruit (see Appendix B) and the top half is too warm, often spoiling during transportation. Also, because of this, the car cannot be filled to its volumetric capacity. Therefore the requirements which led to the invention of this type of fan were as follows: 1. To provide a sufficient volume of air, against the resistance developed in passing through the fruit, to obtain the cooling characteristics required. 2. To provide a fan which would not require major changes in the structural design of the car, or lessen the amount of fruit which could be carried. 3. To provide a fan, simple in construction and installation, and in its drive mechanism from the car axle. The oscillating <b>vane-type</b> fan met conditions 2 and 3 in that it could be situated in the four and one half inch space between the floor racks and the floor of the car, through which the air naturally circulated, and in that it could be driven by a simple wheel and crank drive directly off the axle. This thesis presents the results of the investigation of the first condition. ...|$|E
