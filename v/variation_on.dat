5|$|A <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> {{this theme}} were oil-lamp clocks. These early {{timekeeping}} devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> {{the theme}} was {{produced}} {{later in the}} season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E

5|$|The {{church of}} Hagia Sophia in the Empire of Trebizond dates to between 1238 and 1263 {{and has a}} <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> the {{quincunx}} plan.

2500|$|Composers {{have paid}} homage to Mozart by writing sets of <b>variations</b> <b>on</b> his themes. Beethoven wrote four such sets (Op.66, WoO28, WoO40, WoO46).

5|$|The {{main course}} of the second series of the Great British Menu was won by Mark Hix, head chef at The Ivy in London, with a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> stargazy pie, which {{combined}} rabbit and crayfish for the filling, poking some crayfish through the pie crust. Hix had previously created a mutton and crayfish for a festival aimed at increasing {{the use of the}} meat, and it was served at his London restaurants for a time.|$|E
5|$|Washington, D.C., observes {{all federal}} {{holidays}} and also celebrates Emancipation Day on April 16, which commemorates {{the end of}} slavery in the District. The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> George Washington's family coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|After {{his victory}} in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the Spanish Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> the Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of technical support {{for the construction of}} ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{abutment}} {{material or}} technique, {{an impression of}} the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement. Another <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant. There {{does not appear to}} be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter is believed to be easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance.|$|E
5|$|Seven Halo soundtracks {{have been}} released. The Halo Original Soundtrack {{contains}} most of Combat Evolveds music. Due to the varying nature of gameplay, the music present {{was designed to}} use the game's dynamic audio playback engine. The engine allows for the mood, theme, and duration of music played to change according to gameplay. To afford a more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites, which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including a <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> the Halo theme that was first played at Halos debut at Macworld 1999.|$|E

5|$|The Chicken Big King {{was added}} April 2014. This new <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> the {{original}} Big King sandwich {{was part of}} a corporate menu restructuring that began the previous year. This was part of Burger King CEO Alex Macedo's plan to introduce simpler products that require few or no new ingredients in order to simplify operations. This new sandwich uses the company's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist.|$|E
5|$|The Jedi Knight {{series is}} {{composed}} primarily of first/third-person shooter gameplay elements, {{with a number}} of <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> the norms of the genre within each game. All of the games use a level based system which contains a series of objectives that must be completed before the player can continue. From Dark Forces II onwards, the games have included lightsaber combat and the use of Force powers, which have been tweaked and modified as the series has progressed.|$|E
5|$|The Region Cadet Leadership Schools (RCLS) provide {{training}} to increase knowledge, skills, and attitudes as they pertain to leadership and management. To {{be eligible to}} attend, cadets must be serving in, or preparing to enter, cadet leadership positions within their squadron. RCLSs are conducted at region level, or at wing level with region approval. The RCLS programs {{are more or less}} modeled on USAFA upper classmen programs, the college Air Force ROTC Professional Officer Course (POC) and latter stages of OTS. One <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> this theme are CAP Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer Schools and Academies, which are cadet NCO schools designed to teach basic leadership and principles to cadet leaders during their earlier duty positions in the cadet program.|$|E

5|$|The score {{established}} Herrmann as {{an important}} new composer of film soundtracks and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> that theme as {{the passage of time}} leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, naive and heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised <b>variation</b> <b>on</b> the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
