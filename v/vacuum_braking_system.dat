50|$|A major advance was the {{adoption}} of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> in which flexible pipes were connected between all the vehicles of the train, and brakes on each vehicle could be controlled from the locomotive. The earliest scheme was a simple vacuum brake, in which vacuum was created by operation of a valve on the locomotive; the vacuum actuated brake pistons on each vehicle, and the degree of braking could be increased or decreased by the driver. Vacuum, rather than compressed air, was preferred because steam locomotives can be fitted with ejectors; venturi devices that create vacuum without moving parts.|$|E
50|$|Earmarked for the National Railroad Museum in Ashwaubenon, {{a suburb}} of Green Bay, Wisconsin, the {{locomotive}} was cosmetically restored at Doncaster Works 19 July 1963. The following spring, it was shipped to the US, arriving in New York Harbor on 11 May 1964. Shipped by rail, it arrived at the museum later that month. In October 1990 it was moved to Abilene, Kansas for the celebrations of the centenary of Eisenhower's birth. The move both ways was done as a special train at slow speed, since the locomotive and two cars from the command train used the British <b>vacuum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> incompatible with the American air-braked trains.|$|E
50|$|PD2/1: Although the {{prototype}} was called PD2 {{when it appeared}} in 1946, carrying an Alexander-built Leyland design body identical to those on PD1, and carrying the evocative (and very non-standard) chassis number EX1, {{it was decided that}} the initial production version would be called the PD2/1. The PD2/1 shared 26 ft by 7 ft 6 in chassis dimensions and 16 ft 3 in wheelbase with the PD1, and had a similar triple-servo <b>vacuum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system,</b> the first true PD2/1 (a pre-production bus) was chassis number 470848 which had the first standard Leyland body for the PD2, it went to Birmingham Corporation, who registered it HOJ396 and operated it until 1968. Central SMT had a PD1 with PD2 engine and transmission, chassis number 47009, which they registered CVA391. The first production PD2/1 complete with Leyland body went to Todmorden Joint Omnibus Committee, in July 1947 and another early example went to the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board. Birmingham Corporation Transport followed up its initial interest by taking no fewer than 200 with bodies by Brush Coachworks Ltd (100), Leyland and Park Royal (50 each) until 1949 as part of a complete fleet replacement which ran from 1946 to 1954 and included tramway and trolleybus replacement. The standard Leyland body for the PD2 differed only slightly from that on the PD1, by having the front offside mudguard extended around the front of the cab, where the PD1 had the cab front panel sweeping down to a lower level.|$|E

A variant, the automatic <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system,</b> became almost universal in British train equipment and in countries influenced by British practice. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>brakes</b> also enjoyed {{a brief period of}} adoption in the United States, primarily on narrow-gauge railroads. Its limitations caused it to be progressively superseded by compressed air systems starting in the United Kingdom from the 1970s onward.

40|$|Vacuum brakes {{are first}} used {{in place of}} the air brake in railway locomotives. This braking system uses a vacuum pump for {{creating}} vacuum in the brake pipe. The integral construction of the brake cylinder uses this vacuum reservoir for the application of brakes. Nowadays most of the light vehicles are fitted with vacuum-assisted hydraulic braking system where vacuum is created from the engine which reduces the driver effort on foot pedal. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> was modified from above said reasons and the same was tested for implementation in both light and heavy vehicles. In this work, vacuum is created and used for the application of brakes. The system operation is somehow similar to air braking system. The main difference with air brake system is that vacuum is used instead of compressed air. The design and modified system also includes the Vacuum brake system i. e., the loss of vacuum will cause the brake to be applied due to spring force...|$|E

5000|$|During 1944 Dr. M.M.

All the post-war locomotives came equipped with <b>vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>systems</b> in addition to the steam brakes.

The application and release valves greatly increase the rate of train pipe vacuum destruction and creation. This, in turn, greatly increases the speed of brake application and release.

50|$|The {{chain brake}} was {{operated}} by a 5/8 in link chain, which was carried on sheaves underneath the train along the centre, connected by coupling hooks between carriages or trucks. Under each vehicle, the chain hanged slack while not in use. It passed under two pulleys which were attached to pulling-rods to operate the wooden brake blocks. To operate the brakes, the chain could be tightened from {{either end of the}} train. The guard's van could be used to retard a train on down grades, or to stop the entire train. In the event of a broken or disconnected chain, however, the <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> was useless.
