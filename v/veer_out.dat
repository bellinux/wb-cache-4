2500|$|In 1977, Hopewell again {{made the}} {{national}} news due to another accident involving a drawbridge when the tanker S.S. Marine Floridian outbound {{under the command}} of a James River pilot suffered a steering malfunction just after dawn on February 24 that caused it to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of the channel and hit the Benjamin Harrison Memorial Bridge just east of town. [...] The accident caused serious damage to the bridge and it was closed for months.|$|E
2500|$|The trip {{north was}} from the start a near fiasco. [...] Anderson’s owners had {{oversold}} her tickets, and the passengers, finding much less space aboard then they’d been promised, were only prevented from throwing the purser overboard by the personal intervention of Captain Powers. [...] Shortly after departure, it was found she was missing a large variety of basic seagoing equipment, such as a compass. [...] Fights broke out among the passengers and crew. [...] When the Eliza Anderson arrived at Comox, British Columbia, incompetent coal loading by her crew caused the steamer to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of control into the ship Glory of the Seas sustaining minor damage {{to one of her}} paddle guards.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 March 1942, Olean was sailing from Norfolk, Virginia, to Beaumont, Texas. The {{ship was}} sailing unescorted and—according to Theodore Bockhoff, the ship's master—with all lights extinguished. One survivor, however, {{reported}} that a dim light was burning {{on one of the}} masts. At 23:05, while near position , about [...] from Cape Lookout, North Carolina, Olean was hit in the engine room by a single torpedo launched from [...] under the command of Kapitänleutnant Erwin Rostin. Damage from the torpedo caused the ship to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of control. The Naval Armed Guard spotted U-158, but were unable to depress their gun far {{enough to be able to}} hit the U-boat. At 23:45 the order to abandon ship was given and the 36 officers, men, and gunners took to the lifeboats. As the no. 3 boat reached the water, however, a second torpedo launched by Rostin hit the engine room and destroyed the lifeboat, killing one officer and six men. Lifesaving stations at Cape Lookout and Fort Macon sent motor launches and were able to rescue the remaining 30 men from Olean nine hours after the attack, and landed them at Morehead City.|$|E

25|$|The 2005–2008 {{period was}} {{characterized}} by over-enthusiasm after joining the EU. During the first term of Janez Janša's government, {{for the first time}} after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their loan-deposit ratios <b>veering</b> <b>out</b> of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local tycoons.|$|R
2500|$|William Turpel, {{owner of}} a marine railway in Victoria, testified that his company had hauled Sechelt {{out of the water}} on March 14, 1911 to repair her propeller, which, because one blade had been lost, the {{opposite}} blade had to be removed to keep the shaft in balance. In his opinion, without plenty of ballast, the boat was too tall and narrow to be a good sea boat. Harold G. Jarvis, her surviving owner testified to the contrary, that he felt, as an experienced seaman, that Sechelt was perfectly suitable for the Victoria-Sooke run and that when he and Captain James had inspected her when she was hauled out at Turpel's yard, they both found her to be in [...] "first-class" [...] condition. He did not consider the vessel top-heavy, and stated she had made several trips just before her loss in worse weather conditions, which on the 24th he characterized as [...] "fresh" [...] but not a gale. He said that on March 24, 1911, he had been aboard the vessel before she sailed. All the cargo was stowed as low as possible on the main deck, and no cargo was carried on the upper deck, nor did they ever carry cargo on the upper deck. He could not give an opinion as to the cause of the loss of the vessel, but thought it must have been due to a sudden accident or mechanical problem which caused her to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of control broadside to the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] Jack said; [...] "if you {{signal to}} them to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> some more rope I could soon do it. I could not swim across the tide now, {{but if it were}} twenty fathom further astern I could manage it." ...|$|E
60|$|About {{eight o'clock}} in the evening the wind shifted to east-south-east; and at ten it became what seamen term a hard gale, {{rendering}} it necessary to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> about fifty additional fathoms of the hempen cable. The gale still increasing, the ship rolled and laboured excessively, and at midnight eighty fathoms more were veered out, while the sea continued to strike the vessel {{with a degree of}} force that no one had before experienced.|$|E
50|$|Janša was for {{the first}} time Prime Minister of Slovenia from November 2004 to November 2008. During the term {{characterized}} by over-enthusiasm after joining EU, between 2005 and 2008 the Slovenian banks have seen loan-deposit ratio <b>veering</b> <b>out</b> of control, over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting private sector, leading to its unsustainable growth.|$|R
6000|$|During {{the course}} of the gale nearly the whole length of the hempen cable, of 120 fathoms, was <b>veered</b> <b>out,</b> besides the chain-moorings, and, for its preservation, the cable was {{carefully}} [...] "served", or wattled, with pieces of canvas round the windlass, and with leather well greased in the hawse-hole, where the chafing was most violent.|$|R

60|$|It {{was thick}} weather outside, with a rising wind, and the elder men {{stretched}} their watches. The hours struck {{clear in the}} cabin; the nosing bows slapped and scuffled with the seas; the fo'c'sle stovepipe hissed and sputtered as the spray caught it; and the boys slept on, while Disko, Long Jack, Tom Plait, and Uncle Salters, each in turn, stumped aft {{to look at the}} wheel, forward to see that the anchor held, or to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> a little more cable against chafing, with a glance at the dim anchor-light between each round.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Dowsett. That will {{certainly}} be best; but I {{think it will be}} prudent, before we leave, to run out a kedge with forty or fifty fathoms of cable towards the middle of the stream, and then <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> the cable on her anchor so as to let her ride thirty fathoms or so farther out. We left six men sluicing her side and deck, but it certainly would be prudent to get her out a bit farther. Even here, the heat is {{as much as we can}} stand." ...|$|E
50|$|Edward {{was fascinated}} by early automobiles, which were simply {{traditional}} wagons or carriages with primitive engines. While the springs were adequate at the lower speeds of horse-drawn vehicles, they proved dangerous at higher speeds because they continued to bounce after hitting an uneven surface, potentially causing the vehicle to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of control. Early bicycles had a similar problem.|$|E
50|$|On December 15, 2005, Russell was a {{passenger}} in a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix driven by {{close friend and}} former USC teammate Michael Bastianelli when it <b>veered</b> <b>out</b> of control, hitting several items including a tree and a fire hydrant before hitting a parked bus. Both men were found unconscious and taken to area hospitals, where they were pronounced dead.|$|R
60|$|La Bijou <b>veered</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} stream, and their paddles, {{flashing}} mechanically in the sunshine, held {{her to the}} return angle across the river.

50|$|Quintus, nicknamed Quinn, is Septina's triplet brother. He is more {{rational}} and book smart than his sisters. Septina relies on Quinn heavily {{to provide a}} sense of reality and to pull her back from the edge when circumstances <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of control, as it's sometimes hard for her to tell. When Quinn learns that Septina can control her numerical abilities through concentration, he blames her for unwittingly causing their sister's disappearance.|$|E

50|$|KARR's only {{weakness}} is his primary directive of self-preservation and Michael uses this to his advantage. When KARR threatens to destroy KITT in a head-on collision, Michael plays chicken with him, on a hunch that KARR will <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of KITT's path {{in order to}} protect himself. KARR indeed swerves out of the way, but unable to stop in time: he drives off a cliff and seemingly explodes in the ocean (using footage of the climactic scene from the 1977 film The Car, footage that was also used for KITT on a couple of other occasions).|$|E
60|$|The {{floating}} {{light was}} made snug--in other words, prepared for action-- {{by having a}} good many more fathoms of her chain <b>veered</b> <b>out,</b> in order that she might strain less and swing more freely. Loose articles were secured or stowed away. Hatches were battened down, and many other little nautical arrangements made which it would require a seaman to understand {{as well as to}} describe in detail.|$|R
5000|$|Typhoon Oscar's winds reached 174 {{kilometres}} {{per hour}} (108 miles per hour), making it comparable to Typhoon Ida that killed 1,269 people in 1958 and 5,098 from Typhoon Vera in 1959 in the Tokyo-Yokohama area. [...] It {{was one of the}} most powerful typhoons to hit Japan since World War II dealt the east coast a glancing blow before <b>veering</b> <b>out</b> to sea. Two people were killed, and three were missing.|$|R
60|$|The captain {{suddenly}} sprang {{upon the}} railing of the lanai, {{held on to}} a pillar with one hand, and again picked up the two specks of heads through the glasses. His surprise was verified. The two fools had <b>veered</b> <b>out</b> of the channel toward Diamond Head, and were directly seaward of the kanaka surf. Worse, as he looked, they were starting to come in through the kanaka surf.|$|R
5000|$|In Plane Crazy {{the player}} pilots a fast, cartoon-like plane, built for speed across {{a variety of}} levels against seven other opponents.

There is also a set time limit where players must fly through checkpoints dotted along the course. The timer resets once you have flown through the checkpoint. If the player should fail, and don't reach the checkpoint before the timer runs out, the plane will <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of control and crash, and it will be [...] "Game Over".|$|E

5000|$|On {{the night}} of the final Johansen {{performed}} 15th in the running order, following Germany and preceding Cyprus. Johansen's vocals were noticeably off-key {{at the start of the}} song, and continued to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of tune throughout; clips from the performance are frequently used in montages put together to illustrate Eurovision vocal faux pas. Johansen was criticised for having paid too much attention to choreography and not enough to the song. At the close of voting [...] "Kloden drejer" [...] had received 16 points (7 from Sweden, 4 from Spain, 2 from Cyprus and the United Kingdom and 1 from Turkey), placing Denmark 17th of the 20 entries. The result continued a run of undistinguished placements for Denmark since their return to Eurovision in 1978, with only one top 10 finish in six attempts. The Danish jury awarded its 12 points to Yugoslavia.|$|E
60|$|At last Aaron was found--wearing a bowler hat. Julia groaned in spirit. Josephine's brow knitted. Not {{that anybody}} cared, really. But as one must frown at something, why {{not at the}} bowler hat? Acquaintances and elegant young men in uniforms insisted on rushing up and bowing and exchanging a few words, either with Josephine, or Jim, or Julia, or Lilly. They were coldly received. The party <b>veered</b> <b>out</b> into the night.|$|R
50|$|On 24 January, Wayne {{departed}} Leyte; {{en route}} back to Luzon, her convoy {{came under attack}} by Japanese torpedo planes. One succeeded in hitting the dock landing ship , just astern of Wayne in the steaming disposition. Shadwell, able to proceed on one engine, consequently <b>veered</b> <b>out</b> of formation and returned to Leyte. Wayne, meanwhile, continued onward {{with the rest of}} the convoy and reached Lingayen Gulf with her embarked reinforcements on the 27th.|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} {{to drop the}} anchor should be approached from down wind or down current, whichever is stronger. As the chosen spot is approached, the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back. The anchor should be lowered quickly but under control until {{it is on the}} bottom. The vessel should continue to drift back, and the cable should be <b>veered</b> <b>out</b> under control so it will be relatively straight.|$|R
50|$|On March 8, 1992, the USHRA Monster Jam Circuit had a {{show at the}} center. During a {{race between}} Taurus and Bad Medicine, Bad Medicine's driver, Don Van Loo, had a bad landing from off the set of cars. He smashed {{his head against the}} rollbar and was knocked out. The truck was still moving at the time, and preceded to <b>veer</b> <b>out</b> of control and crash into the stands, killing 82-year-old Lester Gilliam. Gilliam could have saved himself, but instead pushed a young child out of harm's way, sacrificing himself. Van Loo was not new to being knocked out during a run: a year previously, in Oklahoma City, when Bad Medicine was making its debut, Van Loo's truck leaped into the air and took a bad bounce. The impact knocked him out. His foot accidentally fell onto the throttle, which sent the truck ramming into the wall.|$|E

This method has the following three advantages: (1) It can detect even if parts of the vehicles are occluded. (2) It can detect even if vehicles are translated due to <b>veering</b> <b>out</b> of the lanes. (3) It does not require segmentation of vehicle areas from input image...|$|R
