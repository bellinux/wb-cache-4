5|$|Elizabeth's {{plan to have}} Mary {{married to}} Louis of France divided the court. The Lackfis, {{the master of the}} {{treasury}} Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August, which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and replacing them with Garai's partisans. The kingdom was on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil war when Charles decided to invade, encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul, Bishop of Zagreb. Charles' imminent arrival forced Elizabeth to yield and abandon the idea of French marriage. While her envoys in Paris were preparing for Louis's journey, Elizabeth came to terms with her opponents and designated Szécsi as the new palatine.|$|E

5|$|As Rafael moved northward, it {{continued}} to intensify rapidly in spite of moderate wind shear. An eye became visible on microwave imagery during the morning hours of October16, during which time the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 969mb (hPa; 28.61inHg). By the afternoon hours of that same day, data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicated that Rafael was on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weakening trend, attributed to decreasing sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear. Though the system retained hurricane-force winds, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone on October17, a process it completed by 1800UTC that same day after interacting with a cold front; {{at the time of}} the transition, Rafael was positioned well southwest of Nova Scotia. The remnants of the cyclone looped around a larger extratropical low, over the north-central Atlantic Ocean for several days, before resuming its eastward motion.
