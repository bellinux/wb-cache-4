5|$|Four young practices, CEBRA, COBE, Transform and Effekt, {{contributed to}} the project CO-EVOLUTION: Danish/Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China, which was awarded the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture. The project was {{commissioned}} by the Danish Architecture Centre and curated by the Danish architect-urbanist Henrik <b>Valeur</b> and UiD. All four practices later {{went on to win}} high-profile competitions in Denmark and abroad. Effekt has won the competition for a new building for the Estonian Art Academy in Tallinn, Transform has a project on the City Hall Square in Copenhagen and COBE has won first prize in a competition for Scandinavia's largest sustainable district in Nordhavnen, Copenhagen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valeur</b> had twenty 9-pounder guns, four 12-pounder guns, and {{a crew of}} 110 men. Favourite {{had only}} sixteen 6-pounder guns and four 3-pounder guns, though she too had a nominal crew of 110 men. In the engagement, <b>Valeur</b> had 13 men killed and 9 wounded; Favourite {{suffered}} extensive damage to her hull, masts, yards and rigging, but had only seven men wounded. <b>Valeur</b> was carrying a valuable cargo of sugar, coffee and indigo.|$|E
25|$|HMS <b>Valeur</b> was a 28-gun sixth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy, {{initially}} {{launched in}} 1754 as the <b>Valeur</b> for the French Navy, and classified by {{them as a}} corvette. The British captured her in 1759. In Royal Navy service she captured several merchant vessels and privateers before she was sold in 1764.|$|E

25|$|The Admiralty {{purchased}} <b>Valeur</b> at Gibraltar on 13 December 1759. The Royal Navy commissioned {{her as a}} post-ship and Boscawen awarded {{command of}} her to Edwards (and promotion to post-captain in recognition of his feat in capturing a better-armed vessel than his own. Edwards apparently took command in August 1759. While under Edward's command <b>Valeur</b> captured the privateer Heureux Retour on 5 July 1760. Heureux Retour, of Marseilles, was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 56 men.|$|E
25|$|Lambert {{paid off}} <b>Valeur</b> in October 1763 {{and she was}} {{surveyed}} on 3 October 1763. She was then sold at Woolwich Dockyard on 26 January 1764 for £905.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1760, <b>Valeur</b> {{captured}} two Genoese merchant ships. One, sailing from Marseilles to St. Domingo, {{she took}} into Gibraltar. The other, sailing to Martinique, she took into Barcelona.|$|E

25|$|On 19 October, Hampshire, with Lively and <b>Valeur,</b> cornered the King's frigate Fleur de Lis in Freshwater Bay, {{a little}} to leeward of Port-de-Paix; her crew too set her on fire. The {{merchant}} frigate Duc de Choiseul, of 32 guns and 180 men {{under the command of}} Captain Bellevan, escaped into Port-de-Paix.|$|E
25|$|HMS Lively was a 20-gun post ship of the Royal Navy, {{launched}} in 1756. During the Seven Years' War she captured several vessels, {{most notably the}} French corvette <b>Valeur</b> in 1760. She then served during the American Revolutionary War, where she helped initiate the Battle of Bunker Hill. The French captured her in 1778, but the British recaptured her 1781. She was sold in 1784.|$|E
25|$|Some {{significant}} new buildings {{were added to}} the future district during this period. Stanford White converted Lewis's old home into a new mansion for Ogden Mills, as well as doing some renovations at Rokeby. Another Astor had Mott B. Schmidt design <b>Valeur,</b> and Charles A. Platt designed an American Renaissance home for the Chapman family. The last major country seat came when Harrie T. Lindeberg built Fox Hollow on the thousand acres (4km²) Tracy Dows had acquired.|$|E

25|$|The {{units of}} the National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale) have colours which {{are very similar to}} those of the Land Army. Each region (formerly legion), {{instruction}} centre, college or Republican Guard Regiment has its flag or standard, altogether 56 flags and 2 standards. The reverse of colours of the Departmental Gendarmerie units and Gendarmerie instruction centres have the same motto as the Land Army units (Honneur et Patrie) but the colours of the Mobile Gendarmerie have their own particular motto: <b>Valeur</b> et Discipline (Valour and Discipline). Most subordinate or smaller units use 50cm large x 40cm high pennants.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} {{coevolution}} {{was introduced in}} architecture by the Danish architect-urbanist Henrik <b>Valeur</b> as an antithesis {{to the concept of}} [...] "star-architecture". As the curator of the Danish Pavilion at the 2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture he conceived and orchestrated an exhibition project named 'Co-evolution', awarded the Golden Lion for Best National Pavilion.|$|E
500|$|The {{exhibition}} included {{urban planning}} {{projects for the}} cities of Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai and Xi'an, which had been developed in collaboration between young professional Danish architects and students and professors and students from leading universities in the four Chinese cities. By creating a framework for collaboration between academics and professionals representing two distinct cultures, {{it was hoped that}} the exchange of knowledge, ideas and experiences would stimulate [...] "creativity and imagination to set the spark for new visions for sustainable urban development." [...] <b>Valeur</b> later argued that: [...] "As we become more and more interconnected and interdependent, human development is no longer a matter of the evolution of individual groups of people but rather a matter of the co-evolution of all people." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of his career, Uzanne focused on the lesser-known writers of the 18th century, {{creating}} four volumes of work published by Jouast, and an additional 20+ volumes published by Albert Quantin. He was an admirer of the Goncourt brothers, who were also writers on the subject of 18th-century France. Uzanne looked for mentors who were bibliophiles like him, rather than literary scholars (érudits) like his companions at the Arsenal. While focusing on past subjects, he was very up-to-date on the technical aspects of printing and publishing. His 1879 work Le bric-à-brac de l'amour (literally, A bric-a-brac of love) {{was one of the first}} to employ the gillotage, a zincography technique, and photo-mechanical reproduction. Jackson points out that Uzanne, in Les Zigzags d'un curieux (literally, Zigzags of a Curious Man), divided the book collectors in two groups: those who are interested in the book as if it were a kind of stock market share (<b>valeur</b> de Bourse), a market quotation whose fluctuations [...] "they follow with a gamester's interest", and those—whom he considers [...] "pures"—attracted to the book itself, its contents, rarity or beauty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next day}} Lively, using her sweeps, {{caught up with}} the sternmost enemy vessel, the French 20-gun {{corvette}} <b>Valeur.</b> <b>Valeur</b> had a crew of 160 men under the command of a Captain Talbot.
