40|$|New {{data from}} the Department of <b>Veterans</b> Affairs (VA) show that {{approximately}} 131, 000 <b>veterans</b> were homeless {{at a point in}} time in 2008. This is a rate of 58 homeless <b>veterans</b> for every 10, 000 <b>veterans,</b> more than double the rate of homelessness among the general population. New data on the demographics of <b>veterans</b> and homeless <b>veterans</b> also reveal that some <b>veterans</b> of the current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are beginning to receive homeless services from the VA and that female <b>veterans</b> are increasingly represented in the pool of <b>veterans</b> who may face homelessness. The high prevalence of homelessness among <b>veterans</b> means that programs that serve homeless <b>veterans</b> must be expanded...|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, the US <b>Veterans</b> Administration began a state {{grant program}} to help states build state <b>veterans</b> cemeteries. [...] In March 1989, US <b>Veterans</b> Administration became a cabinet-level post, {{designated}} US Department of <b>Veterans</b> Affairs, (herein “Veterans Affairs"). [...] By the early 2000s Montana had three <b>Veterans</b> Affairs state grant supported <b>veterans</b> cemeteries: Montana State <b>Veterans</b> Cemetery at Helena; Western Montana State <b>Veterans</b> Cemetery at Missoula; and Eastern Montana State <b>Veterans</b> Cemetery at Miles City. [...] The Montana state legislature authorized a state <b>veterans</b> cemetery in Yellowstone County, but did not provide funding. Yellowstone County, Montana’s most populous county with Montana’s largest city, Billings, has the state’s largest veterans’ population, but no <b>veterans</b> cemetery.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The authors {{analyzed}} self-reported {{questionnaire data}} from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) to determine the smoking patterns of <b>veterans.</b> METHODS: Using NMES data, the authors compared <b>veterans</b> versus nonveterans overall, women <b>veterans</b> versus women nonveterans, Vietnam-era <b>veterans</b> versus other <b>veterans,</b> and <b>veterans</b> whose usual source of medical care was the Department of <b>Veterans</b> Affairs (VA) system versus <b>veterans</b> who received care elsewhere. RESULTS: The likelihood of ever having smoked cigarettes was higher for <b>veterans</b> than for nonveterans and for women <b>veterans</b> than for women nonveterans. The prevalence of current smoking was higher for <b>veterans</b> than for nonveterans and higher for those seeking care within the VA system than for other <b>veterans.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Given the enormous health care costs associated with smoking, health promotion efforts should be developed to reduce {{the high rate of}} smoking among <b>veterans</b> [...] especially those who are consumers of VA health care...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Yellowstone County <b>veterans,</b> citing long travel {{distances}} to Montana state <b>veterans</b> cemeteries or open national cemeteries, began a grass-roots {{effort to build}} a <b>veterans</b> cemetery in Yellowstone County without <b>Veterans</b> Affairs state grant monies. A coalition of Yellowstone County <b>veterans</b> and civic leaders agreed {{on a plan to}} fund, design, build, and operate a <b>veterans</b> cemetery in Yellowstone County to <b>Veterans</b> Affairs, National Cemetery Administration, standards, and then petition <b>Veterans</b> Affairs to designate the cemetery a national cemetery.|$|R
40|$|With {{the move}} toward {{dissemination}} of empirically supported treatments in the <b>Veterans</b> Health Administration (VHA), dissemination of additional data concerning the effectiveness of prolonged exposure (PE) among <b>veterans</b> is important. The authors present clinical treatment data from <b>veterans</b> with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treated in a VHA PTSD clinic (N = 10). <b>Veterans</b> demonstrated significant reductions in total PTSD symptoms from pre- to posttreatment. Returning <b>veterans</b> from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq and other era <b>veterans</b> (Vietnam <b>Veterans</b> and military sexual trauma <b>veterans)</b> demonstrated significant reductions in PTSD. In addition, <b>veterans</b> demonstrated significant reductions in depression from pre- to posttreatment. In conclusion, PE is effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD in <b>veterans...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Yellowstone County <b>veterans</b> {{and civic}} leaders began {{a concerted effort}} through Montana’s US congressional delegation, led by Senator Jon Tester, D-Mont, {{a member of the}} Senate <b>Veterans</b> Affairs Committee, to have <b>Veterans</b> Affairs {{designate}} Yellowstone County <b>Veterans</b> Cemetery a national cemetery. The effort centered on showing <b>Veterans</b> Affairs the need for smaller-in-scale national cemeteries for America’s predominantly rural states. [...] In 2011, <b>Veterans</b> Affairs began its Rural <b>Veterans</b> Burial Initiative Program (herein “Rural Initiative”) to improve burial access for <b>veterans</b> residing in America’s rural areas. <b>Veterans</b> Affairs looked at states lacking a National cemetery with available space for first interments. [...] In 2012, <b>Veterans</b> Affairs designated eight states to have smaller national burial grounds. The states are Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Maine.

40|$|<b>Veterans</b> {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of the student population on higher education campuses since the conclusion of World War II. The purpose of this study was to examine <b>veterans</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of how their military experiences affected their experience as college students. Twenty-six <b>veterans</b> were interviewed at six Illinois higher education institutions. Study findings suggest five ways in which the military experience helped <b>veterans</b> adjust to college: (a) <b>veterans</b> were experienced with group collaboration; (b) <b>veterans</b> held high expectations of themselves; (c) <b>veterans</b> were organized and task-oriented; (d) <b>veterans</b> were experienced learners, and; (e) <b>veterans</b> had experience and ability to work with others. In addition, the interviews uncovered five ways in which military experience made adjustment to college life difficult: (a) <b>veterans</b> faced difficulty with lack of direction; (b) <b>veterans</b> had challenges transitioning from the military to college; (c) <b>veterans</b> faced socialization concerns; (d) <b>veterans</b> had difficulty in coming to terms with age difference; and (e) <b>veterans</b> were frustrated when working on group projects. Study results led to four recommendations. First, the military and universities can offer coordinated transition assistance. Second, colleges and universities can offer college orientation with <b>veterans</b> in mind. Third, the military and universities can offer assistance for <b>veterans</b> who desire to socialize more with others. Fourth, colleges and universities should implement mentoring and peer counseling programs for <b>veterans.</b> In addition to these recommendations, this study also suggests areas for further research...|$|R
