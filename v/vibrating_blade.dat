40|$|In the flutter {{or forced}} {{response}} {{analysis of a}} turbomachine blade row, the blade row in question is commonly treated {{as if it is}} isolated from the neighboring blade rows. Disturbances created by <b>vibrating</b> <b>blades</b> are then free to propagate away from this blade row without being disturbed. In reality, neighboring blade rows will reflect some portion of this wave energy back toward the <b>vibrating</b> <b>blades,</b> causing additional unsteady forces on them. It is of fundamental importance {{to determine whether or not}} these reflected waves can have a significant effect on the aeroelastic stability or forced response of a blade row. Therefore, a procedure to calculate intra-blade-row unsteady aerodynamic interactions has been developed which relies upon results available from isolated blade row unsteady aerodynamic analyses. In addition, an unsteady aerodynamic influence coefficient technique is used to obtain a model for the vibratory response in which the neighboring blade rows are also flexible. The flutter analysis shows that interaction effects can be destabilizing, and the forced response analysis shows that interaction effects can result in a significant increase in the resonant response of a blade row...|$|R

50|$|Since carbide {{saw blades}} are circular, they are {{radially}} the stiffest {{elements of the}} power train {{in the direction of}} the feed, but very unstable perpendicular to the feed direction. Due to the thin blade body the blades must be stabilized to minimize the side vibration amplitudes. When the first experiments with carbide saws were made, a development engineer of Advanced Machine & Engineering in Rockford stabilized the blade by using a broomstick which he pushed against the <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade,</b> minimizing the vibrations. From this experience a blade stabilizer was developed using two plastic coated ball bearings mounted on eccentric shafts and supported by a welded bracket to the gearbox. Horst Doepcke, who saw this method during experiments carried out by Metalcut, also describes them in his dissertation “Sägen von Rohren mit hartmetallbestückten Kreissägeblättern”. Further Amsaw developments lead to segment stabilizers, whereby on both sides of the blade adjustable plastic-coated plates minimized the blade vibrations (AME). Other manufacturers later used similar slide elements as “vibration dampeners”. These erroneously labeled vibration dampeners did not however dampen the oscillations, but merely minimized the amplitudes. Mr. Doepke describes this function in detail in his dissertation.Recently the Advanced Machine & Engineering Company has developed a pair of front stabilizers for its AMSAW machines arranged close to the point at which the blade enters the material. These stabilizers hydraulically extend, when the carbide teeth have moved past the stabilizer tips before cutting and stabilize the blade which also help to guide the blade into the cut to improve the accuracy. Other forms of stabilizers are listed in German in the VDI Verlag Nr. 1999 by Dipl.-Ing. Rainer Liebrecht. This report especially addresses the effect of vibration on saw blades.|$|E
30|$|With {{ultrasonic}} technology, {{electrical energy}} is converted into vibration and heat. The {{combination of a}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade</b> together with the produced heat forms the mechanism by which the instrument cuts and coagulates tissue. The heat generated by ultrasonic instruments is typically less compared to mono- and bipolar electrosurgery, resulting in less thermal injury to surrounding tissues. This optimizes the histopathology assessment of surgical margins. An ultrasonic instrument ensues less smoke emission and probably less toxin production since tissue destruction is by vaporization and avoid charring [42]. As no electrical current is applied, there is no risk of direct coupling or capacitive coupling injuries. There are some disadvantages of ultrasonic technology: the formation of steam from tissues being treated can interfere with visualization through a laparoscope. After prolonged use, the <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade</b> may remain hot {{for a long period}} and create a risk of inadvertent thermal injury.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{shows the}} {{comparison}} between steady-state and unsteady results from two versions of a flow solver and measurements in a linear cascade at transonic flow conditions for forced vibration of a single blade. Experiments have been conducted in a linear test facility with a cascade composed of five turbine blades. The center blade was forced to oscillate in a pure bending mode with a frequency of 160 Hz. Tailboards are fixed in this test facility at the trailing edges of the border blades to create a periodic flow at the outlet of the cascade. A 2 D inviscid flow solver for unsteady flows through <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade</b> rows was adapted to simulate the flow conditions in the linear cascade. The initial adaptation of the flow solver was the limitation to only one <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade.</b> Comparisons with measurements showed discrepancies which were hypothesized {{to be due to}} the presence of the tailboards which can create reflections of pressure waves and shocks. Therefore, as a second modification of the program, the periodic boundaries downstream of the blades were replaced by solid walls. Based on these computations it can be concluded that for transonic flows the tailboards have a significant influence on both the steady-state and unsteady flow in the outlet region {{as well as on the}} blade in the shock region. In particular, the unsteady data measured in a linear cascade has to be analyzed very carefully to estimate the influence of the tailboards...|$|E

40|$|A linearized Euler solver for calculating {{unsteady}} {{flows in}} turbomachinery blade rows due to both incident gusts and blade motion is presented. Using the linearized Euler technique, one decomposes the flow into a mean (or steady) flow plus an unsteady, harmonically varying, small disturbance flow.

40|$|NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) {{program is}} {{developing}} {{new technologies to}} increase the fuel efficiency of commercial aircraft engines, improve the safety of engine operation, and reduce engine emissions and noise. With {{the development of new}} designs for ducted fans, compressors, and turbines to achieve these goals, a basic aeroelastic requirement is {{that there should be no}} flutter or high resonant blade stresses in the operating regime. To verify the aeroelastic soundness of these designs, we need an accurate prediction and analysis code. Such a two-dimensional viscous propulsion aeroelastic code, named TURBO-AE, is being developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The TURBO-AE aeroelastic code is based on a three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamic Euler/Navier-Stokes turbomachinery code TURBO, developed under a grant from NASA Lewis. TURBO-AE can model viscous flow effects that play an important role in certain aeroelastic problems, such as flutter with flow separation (or stall flutter) and flutter in the presence of shock and boundary-layer interaction. The structural dynamics representation of the blade in the TURBO-AE code is based on a normal mode representation. A finite element analysis code, such as NASTRAN, is used to calculate in-vacuum vibration modes and the associated natural frequency. A work-per-cycle approach is used to determine aeroelastic (flutter) stability. With this approach, the motion of the blade is prescribed to be a harmonic vibration in a specified in vacuum normal mode. The aerodynamic forces acting on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade</b> and the work done by these forces on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade</b> during a cycle of vibration are calculated. If positive work is being done on the blade by the aerodynamic forces, the blade is dynamically unstable, since it will extract energy from the flow, leading to an increase in the amplitude of the blade's oscillation. Initial calculations have been done for a configuration representative of the Energy Efficient Engine fan rotor. The accompanying figure shows the work-per-cycle after each cycle of vibration. It can be seen that the work-per-cycle does not vary much after the fourth cycle. The negative sign of the converged work-per-cycle shows that the fan blade is dynamically stable and will not flutter. TURBO-AE will provide a useful aeroelastic prediction/analysis capability for engine manufacturers. It will reduce design cycle times by allowing new blade designs to be verified for aeroelastic soundness before blades are built and tested. With this prediction capability, it will be possible to build thinner, lighter, and faster rotating blades without encountering aeroelastic problems like stall flutter and high-cycle fatigue due to forced vibrations...|$|E

In order to obtain precise insight into the aerodynamic damping of a <b>vibrating</b> <b>blade</b> assembly, a basic experiment was performed where unsteady pressure distributions were measured for subsonic and transonic flow conditions. The experiments were performed on a non-rotating, two-dimensional section of a compressor cascade in an annular test facility. The cascade consists of 20 blades (NACA 3506 profile) mounted on elastic spring suspensions. In order to measure the unsteady pressure distribution, the cascade was set to tuned pitching oscillations (travelling wave modes). Each blade was driven to controlled harmonic torsional motions around midchord by a magnetic excitation system and by inductive displacement probes which measure the feedback signal of the motion. Steady and unsteady pressures were measured by steady pressure taps and piezo-electric pressure transducers, respectively. The measurement of the unsteady aerodynamic response to a shock vibrating on the suction side of the blades was enabled by a dense spacing of transducers in this region The global aeordynamic stability is assessed by a damping coefficient evaluated from the out-of-phase parts of the unsteady moment coefficients and by the contributions from the local work coefficient, using the measured pressure data...|$|E

The structural model {{of the first two}} rotor bladerows is based on a standard finite element representation. The fluid mesh is moved at each time step according to the structural motion so that changes in blade aerodynamic damping and flow unsteadiness can be accommodated automatically. An efficient domain decomposition technique, where special care was taken to balance the memory requirement across processors, was developed as part of the work. The calculation was conducted in parallel mode on 128 CPUs of an SGI Origin 3000. Ten vibration cycles were obtained using over 2. 2 CPU years, though the elapsed time was a week only. Steady-state flow measurements and predictions were found to be in good agreement. A comparison of the averaged unsteady flow and the steady-state flow revealed some discrepancies.
