25|$|The {{contrasting}} {{characteristics of}} the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Kenji Satake. The significant amount of <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement</b> in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80–100-year recurrence interval) normally result in regions with high topographic relief, which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented that might explain this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.|$|E

Electromagnetic alignment and electromagnetic focusing use evaporation {{material that is}} in the form of an ingot, while the pendant drop configuration uses a rod. Ingots are enclosed in a copper crucible or hearth, while a rod will be mounted at one end in a socket. Both the crucible and socket must be cooled. This is typically done by water circulation. In the case of ingots, molten liquid can form on its surface, which can be kept constant by <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement</b> of the ingot. The evaporation rate may be on the order of 10−2 g/(cm2·s).|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} controlling parameters in bridges are the <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements.</b> Measuring deflections is not only valuable at {{the early stages of the}} construction, but during the service lifetime of the structure also. Furthermore, <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> are one {{of the most}} important indicators of the healthy state of the bridges among other structural health monitoring parameters used in the assessment of the structural response of the bridges and for foreseeing eventual damage or deterioration issues. Bridges are often placed over watercourses or over accidentally terrain and normally load tests are carried out before starting its use with the purpose of evaluating the structural response. Measuring <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> are always a challenge and many technics have been developed during the past few years.

40|$|In many bridges, <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} parameters for structural health monitoring in both the short- and long-terms. Bridge managers around the globe are always looking for a simple way to measure <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> of bridges. However, it is diff cult to carry out such measurements. On the other hand, in recent years, with the advancement of fibre-optic technologies, fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are more commonly used in structural health monitoring due to their outstanding advantages including multiplexing capability, immunity of electromagnetic interference as well as high resolution and accuracy. For these reasons, a methodology for measuring the <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> of bridges using FBG sensors is proposed. The methodology includes two approaches. One of which is based on curvature measurements while the other utilises inclination measurements from successfully developed FBG tilt sensors. A series of simulation tests of a full-scale bridge was conducted. It shows that both approaches can be implemented to measure the <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> for bridges with various support conditions, varying stiffness along the spans and without any prior known loading. A static loading beam test with increasing loads at the mid-span and a beam test with different loading locations were conducted to measure <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> using FBG strain sensors and tilt sensors. The results show that the approaches can successfully measure <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements.</b> Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} an {{analysis}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> in Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) using two satellite radar interferometry methods: Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) (Ferretti et al. 2007). To detect ground deformations using the PSInSAR method many satellite images (even tens) are needed, while using the DInSAR method, a pair of satellite images is needed. Satellite images are provided inter alia by European Space Agency and were obtained between 1990 - 2001 (PSInSAR) and 1996 - 2001 (DIn-SAR) by ERS- 2 satellite. The USCB is located in south-western Poland and is highly industrialized and densely inhabited region, {{because of the presence of}} many active underground stone coal mines. <b>Vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> presented in work are conducted by underground mining exploitation and neotectonic movements. In the main, the DIn-SAR method allows detecting big (a few or several centimeters) and intensive (formed in a few days, 35 – 140 days) <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> on a big area in the same time. The PSInSAR method in the main allows detecting small and permanent <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> (Leśniak & Porzycka 2008), which are correlated with neotectonic movements. It is note-worthy that results obtained using the PSInSAR method have low coherence in the areas of <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> detected by using the DInSAR method. Big and intensive <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> are not detected while using the PSInSAR method. Only using both methods (DInSAR and PSInSAR) allows generating a complex map of <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements,</b> which is essential for the realization of local zoning plans in the USCB area. Obtained in this work map of <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> is collated with: (1) seismic data from Główny Instytut Geologiczny (GIG), (2) locations of mines in the USCB, (3) borders of coal deposits, (4) tectonics map (Jureczka & Kotas 1995), (5) mining extraction data from Kompania Węglowa S.

25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the <b>vertical</b> <b>displacement.</b> Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to vertical time shifts commonly observed in time-lapse seismic images, horizontal displacements are apparent as well. These apparent horizontal displacements may be small relatively to seismic wavelengths, perhaps only 5 m at depths of 5 km, but they consistently suggest an outward lateral expansion of images {{away from a}} compacting reservoir. It {{is well known that}} apparent <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> are caused mostly by a decrease in seismic wave velocities above compacting reservoirs. Those same velocity changes contribute to horizontal displacements. This contribution can be computed from the velocity changes that, in turn, can be estimated from measured <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements.</b> Horizontal displacements computed in this way are similar to those measured, and this similarity suggests that horizontal as well as <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> may be largely due to velocity changes.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{outlined}} {{by means of}} which it is possible to estimate high-resolution <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> due to an earthquake even in the case where high-resolution topography is lacking before the earthquake.

The method is illustrated by calculating <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> for the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. For this earthquake, there are both pre- and post-event lidar DEMs from which <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> may also be estimated after correcting for the lateral advection of topography due to horizontal displacements. A comparison between the two means of deriving <b>vertical</b> <b>displacements</b> shows generally good agreement, with the displacements obtained using satellite imagery performing better in high relief areas.
