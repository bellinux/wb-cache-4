5|$|An {{alliance}} between Przemysł II and Henry IV placed Bolesław the Pious in a <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> situation, because he {{being a member}} of Pro-Hungarian coalition of Polish princes (in addition to him, it included Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black and Konrad II of Masovia) could not remain indifferent to this close cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, which was the leader of the Pro-bohemian coalition (where other Silesian princes also belonged).|$|E
5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Madeline Smith, {{who played}} Miss Caruso, sharing Bond's {{bed in the}} film's opening, was {{recommended}} for the part by Roger Moore after he had appeared with her on TV. Smith said that Moore was extremely polite to work with, but she felt <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> being clad in only blue bikini panties while Moore's wife was on set overseeing the scene.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{a silence}} fell [...] . a <b>very</b> creepy, <b>uncomfortable</b> silence. Annetta Bell was of two minds {{whether to go}} into hysterics again or not, {{especially}} as she didn't know just where the mouse had gone. But she decided not to. Who could take any comfort out of hysterics with a teacher so white-faced and so blazing-eyed standing before one? ...|$|R
5|$|After {{entering}} the Indian Ocean, the convoy sailed south-east. The ships manoeuvred {{together in a}} zigzag course; avoiding collisions during the frequent turns placed heavy demands on the watch-keeping officers, who found their shifts exhausting. The troops endured <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> conditions on the hot and crowded ships, but morale was high. They entertained themselves with sports, sun baking and gambling, and those on Queen Mary could attend concerts performed by a regimental brass band. The 9th Division's officers enjoyed somewhat better conditions, which frustrated {{some of the other}} ranks. The 9th Division's preparations for jungle warfare continued during the voyage, with all personnel attending daily lectures delivered by officers on the lessons learnt during the previous fighting in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
25|$|While usually {{connected}} to a barge, the pushers are also capable of operating independently. However, the low metacentric height of the vessels, only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the pushers <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> in severe weather. For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it is absolutely necessary.|$|E

25|$|The halakha {{requires}} {{eating and}} traditionally {{sleeping in the}} sukkah. However, Jews {{are not expected to}} remain in the sukkah if they would be <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> there. For this reason, Jews living at northern latitudes will generally not sleep in the sukkah due to the cold temperatures of autumn nights. Some Jews in these locales will spend some time in the sukkah eating and relaxing but go indoors to sleep.|$|E
25|$|Stainless {{steel and}} {{aluminum}} handles are durable and sanitary, {{but can be}} slippery. To counter this, premium knife makers make handles with ridges, bumps, or indentations to provide extra grip. Another problem with knives that have metal handles is that, since metal is an excellent heat-conductor, these knives can be <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> and even painful or dangerous, when handled without gloves or other protective handwear in (very) cold climates.|$|E
60|$|I {{am writing}} in a very poor condition; I have a bad cold all over me, pains in my back and limbs, and a <b>very</b> {{sensitive}} and <b>uncomfortable</b> throat. There was a great draught up some stone steps near me last night, and I daresay that caused it.|$|R

25|$|Standard Lightnings {{were used}} as crew and cargo {{transports}} in the South Pacific. They were fitted with pods attached to the underwing pylons, replacing drop tanks or bombs, that could carry a single passenger in a lying-down position, or cargo. This was a <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> way to fly. Some of the pods were not even fitted with a window to let the passenger see out or bring in light.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} with Alex Carruthers and his ERC Group which owned Edinburgh Rugby {{proved to be}} <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> The SRU defaulted {{in a number of}} payments of competition prize money to ERC, requiring the consortium to invest their own additional funds, and the SRU refused to share bar takings from Edinburgh Rugby matches at Murrayfield with ERC - at the same time, the SRU was unhappy about the signing policy and the unavailability of players for international team training.|$|E
25|$|Following {{operations}} in {{observation of the}} Elbe and the relief of a POW camp containing around 100 Belgians the regiment entered Hamburg after the surrender of that city. The condition {{of the city and}} its people made him feel <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> and his feelings towards the German populace mellowed from that of hate to that of pity. After VE Day he was able to work alongside the Catholic relief agency CCRA based at Greven near Münster, helping displaced persons.|$|E
60|$|It {{was easy}} advice to give, and I {{followed}} {{it to the}} best of my power; but I felt <b>very</b> hot and <b>uncomfortable</b> till the curtain drew up, and then I was too entirely absorbed in the music to have noticed it, even if the whole house had been looking at me.|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} {{however, the}} Type 10 {{proved to be}} troublesome. Water leaks into the battery compartments and pilot's compartment were commonly reported by test pilots. It was also <b>very</b> cramped and <b>uncomfortable</b> for the pilot. The war ended before development could really iron out these problems so the type never went into mass production.|$|R

'I {{can always}} get away if I choose,' thought he, 'it is {{better not to}} be in a hurry;' so he {{remained}} quite still while the skin was drawn over his head, which made him <b>very</b> hot and <b>uncomfortable,</b> and resisted the temptation to snap off the fingers or noses that were so close to his mouth.|$|R
25|$|Davis had {{determined}} {{most of the}} town to be {{within the boundaries of}} Fort Riley; it's eastern edge at the mouth of Onemile Creek. Only the capitol building was spared from demolition. During its brief service by the legislature, it was a <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> meeting space due partly {{to the fact that it}} was not complete. The floor boards were not nailed down, and a hole in the exterior wall left for construction purposes still remained at the second floor.|$|E
25|$|When Lü Bu left Yuan Shao to join Zhang Yang in Henei (河內; {{in present-day}} Henan), he passed by Chenliu and met Zhang Miao. Zhang Miao treated him generously {{and made a}} pledge of {{friendship}} {{with him when he}} saw him off. Yuan Shao was angry when he heard that Zhang Miao had befriended Lü Bu. Zhang Miao also feared that Cao Cao might ally with Yuan Shao to attack him so he felt <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> Besides, his jurisdiction, Chenliu, was in Yan Province, which was under Cao Cao's control.|$|E
25|$|In Milgram's {{first set}} of {{experiment}}s, 65 percent (26 of 40) of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock, though many were <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> doing so; at some point, every participant paused and questioned the experiment; some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating in the experiment. Throughout the experiment, subjects displayed varying degrees of tension and stress. Subjects were sweating, trembling, stuttering, biting their lips, groaning, digging their fingernails into their skin, and some were even having nervous laughing fits or seizures.|$|E

But the old gentleman did NOT dry there, but went on drip, drip, {{dripping}} among the cinders, and the fire fizzed and sputtered and began to look <b>very</b> black and <b>uncomfortable.</b> Never was such a cloak; every fold in it ran like a gutter.|$|R
5000|$|When Ballmer {{took over}} as CEO, the company was {{fighting}} an antitrust lawsuit {{brought on by the}} U.S. government and 20 states, plus class-action lawsuits and complaints from rival companies. While it was said that Gates would have continued fighting the suit, Ballmer made it his priority to settle these saying: [...] "Being the object of a lawsuit, effectively, or a complaint from your government is a <b>very</b> awkward, <b>uncomfortable</b> position to be in. It just has all downside. People assume if the government brought a complaint that there's really a problem, and your ability to say we're a good, proper, moral place is tough. It's actually tough, even though you feel that way about yourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} Edgar {{was so far}} recovered {{that he was able}} to sit up. His wounds were sore and painful, and the strapping of plaster in which they were enveloped rendered him <b>very</b> stiff and <b>uncomfortable.</b> But, as he said to another soldier, he had been just as stiff and sore after a football match, and felt confident that in a few days he should be as well as ever.|$|R
25|$|Steel is {{classified}} by Det Norske Veritas with a class notation of +1A1 ICE-1A+ Pusher and Pusher/Barge Unit E0. It {{has the highest}} Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1A Super, {{which means that the}} pusher is designed to operate in difficult ice conditions both alone and when coupled to a barge mainly without icebreaker assistance. While usually connected to a barge, Steel is also capable of operating independently. However, the low metacentric height of the pusher, only , results in large roll amplitudes and pitching, making the vessel <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> in severe weather. For this reason short transit journeys without a barge are done only when it is absolutely necessary.|$|E
25|$|Temperatures fell rapidly after dark, {{making a}} <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> {{night for the}} men of both armies. Curtis called Davis' 3rd Division to Ruddick's field during the night. When Davis arrived he was put in line {{to the left of}} Carr. Sigel marched the 1st and 2nd Divisions in circles all night but finally had them camp near Pratt's Store. Asboth, who was wounded in the last action of the day, {{believed}} that the United States Army's position was hopeless and pressed Curtis several times during the night to retreat. Though his army was now cut off from Missouri, Curtis refused to consider retreat and confidently predicted victory in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Normally, the pyloric valve at {{the lower}} end of the stomach regulates the release of food into the bowel. When the gastric bypass patient eats a sugary food, the sugar passes rapidly into the intestine, where it gives rise to a {{physiological}} reaction called dumping syndrome. The body will flood the intestines with gastric content in an attempt to dilute the sugars. An affected person may feel their heart beating rapidly and forcefully, break into a cold sweat, get a feeling of butterflies in the stomach, and may have an anxiety attack. The person usually has to lie down, and could be <b>very</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> for 3045 minutes. Diarrhea may then follow.|$|E

25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be <b>very</b> difficult and <b>uncomfortable</b> for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing to say no to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|R
