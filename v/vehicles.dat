5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of electric <b>vehicles</b> that includes all-electric or battery electric <b>vehicles</b> (BEVs), plug-in hybrid <b>vehicles</b> (PHEVs), and {{electric vehicle}} conversions of hybrid electric <b>vehicles</b> and conventional internal combustion engine <b>vehicles.</b> In China, plug-in electric <b>vehicles</b> are called new energy <b>vehicles</b> (NEVs).|$|E

5|$|A large {{variety of}} {{different}} armoured combat <b>vehicles</b> were developed on the T-26 chassis in the 1930s. Among them were KhT-26, KhT-130 and KhT-133 flame-throwing (chemical) tanks (552, 401 and 269 <b>vehicles</b> were produced, respectively); T-26T artillery tractors (197 were produced); TT-26 and TU-26 remotely controlled tanks (162 teletanks of all models were produced); ST-26 bridge-laying tanks (71 were produced); SU-5 self-propelled guns (33 were produced); experimental armoured cargo/personnel carriers, reconnaissance <b>vehicles,</b> and many others. The majority of these <b>vehicles</b> were developed at the Leningrad Factory of Experimental Mechanical Engineering (from 1935 known as the Factory No. 185 named after S.M. Kirov) by talented Soviet engineers P.N. Syachentov, S.A. Ginzburg, L.S. Troyanov, N.V. Tseits, B.A. Andryhevich, M.P. Zigel and others. Various vehicle-mounted equipment was developed for the T-26, including mine-clearing attachments, inflatable pontoons and a snorkel system for fording water obstacles, devices for overcoming obstacles and many others. T-26 light tanks were also modified into different armoured combat <b>vehicles</b> in the field during wartime.|$|E

5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle with rechargeable battery packs {{that can be}} charged from the electric grid, and the electricity stored on board drives or contributes to drive the wheels for propulsion.

40|$|<b>Vehicle</b> {{has several}} types {{and each of}} them has {{different}} color, size, and shape. The appearance of <b>vehicle</b> also changes if viewed from different viewpoint of traffic surveillance camera. This situation can create many possibilities of <b>vehicle</b> poses. However, the one in common, <b>vehicle</b> pose usually follows road direction. Therefore, this research proposes a method to estimate the pose of <b>vehicle</b> for <b>vehicle</b> detection and tracking based on road direction. <b>Vehicle</b> training data are generated from 3 D <b>vehicle</b> models in four-pair orientation categories. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Linear-Support Vector Machine (Linear-SVM) are used to build <b>vehicle</b> detectors from the data. Road area is extracted from traffic surveillance image to localize the detection area. The pose of <b>vehicle</b> which estimated based on road direction will be used to select a suitable <b>vehicle</b> detector for <b>vehicle</b> detection process. To obtain the final <b>vehicle</b> object, <b>vehicle</b> line checking method is applied to the <b>vehicle</b> detection result. Finally, <b>vehicle</b> tracking is performed to give label on each <b>vehicle.</b> The test conducted on various viewpoints of traffic surveillance camera shows that the method effectively detects and tracks <b>vehicle</b> by estimating the pose of <b>vehicle.</b> Performance evaluation of the proposed method shows 0. 9170 of accuracy and 0. 9161 of balance accuracy (BAC) ...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric <b>vehicles</b> in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those <b>vehicles</b> operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid <b>vehicles</b> when compared to noisier <b>vehicles</b> when both types of <b>vehicles</b> were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply.

According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic <b>vehicles</b> cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy <b>vehicles</b> in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure.
