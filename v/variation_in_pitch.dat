5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch</b> while a note is being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E
5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound.

50|$|For instance, in Cantonese, {{there are}} 6 tones in syllables {{that do not}} end in stops but only 3 in syllables that do. Therefore, {{although}} Cantonese has only 6 tones {{in the sense of}} 6 contrasting <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch,</b> it is often said to have 9 tones.|$|R
50|$|Above the rated wind speed, the {{pitching}} mechanism is employed. This allows a good {{level of control}} over the angle of attack, thus control over the torque.

50|$|Vibrato {{is often}} {{perceived}} {{to create a}} more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era. The acoustic effect of vibrato has largely to do with adding interest and warmth to the sound, {{in the form of a}} shimmer created by the <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> projection of strongest sound. A well-made violin virtually points its sound pattern in different directions depending on slight <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{rate and}} extent of the <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch</b> during vibrato is {{controlled}} by the performer. The extent of vibrato for solo singers is usually less than a semitone (100 cents) either side of the note, while singers in a choir typically use narrower vibrato with an extent of less than a tenth of a semitone (10 cents) either side. Wind and bowed instruments generally use vibratos with an extent of less than half a semitone either side.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{wider and}} less common {{sense of the}} term, [...] "pitch accent" [...] is {{sometimes}} also used to describe intonation, such as methods of conveying surprise, changing a statement into a question, or expressing information flow (topic–focus, contrasting), using <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch.</b> A great number of languages use <b>pitch</b> <b>in</b> this way, including English {{as well as all}} other major European languages.

5000|$|The {{language}} possesses five vowels (or six, {{under the}} St.Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters {{depending on whether}} the preceding consonant is palatalized. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called hard and soft. (The hard consonants are often velarized, especially before front vowels, as in Irish). The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch.</b> Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear schwa. (See also: vowel reduction in Russian.) ...|$|E
5000|$|More iconic systems use tone {{numbers or}} an {{equivalent}} set of graphic pictograms known as [...] "Chao tone letters."

50|$|However, among serious amateurs and professionals, other pitch {{standards}} are commonly found. For {{the performance of}} baroque music, A=415 Hz is the de facto standard, while pre-Baroque music is often performed at A=440 Hz or A=466 Hz. These pitch {{standards are}} intended to reflect the broad <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch</b> standards {{throughout the history of}} the recorder. In various regions, contexts, and time periods, pitch standards have varied from A=~392 Hz to A=~520 Hz. The pitches A=415 Hz and A=466 Hz, a semitone lower and a semitone higher than A=440 Hz respectively, were chosen because they may be used with harpsichords or chamber organs which transpose up or down a semitone from A=440. These pitch standards allow recorder players to collaborate with other instrumentalists at a pitch other than A=440Hz.|$|E
5000|$|Radial pitch-shifting (also {{referred}} to as [...] "string bending" [...] or [...] "bending") is produced by moving the stopped (held-down) string with the fretting hand in a direction perpendicular to its axis and parallel to the frets. This type of pitch-shifting is associated with blues, rock, country and pop music. The effect generally shifts the pitch over a wider range than axial pitch-shifting. It can produce vibrato as a cyclic <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch,</b> a single up-and-down swoop, or as a shift from one pitch to another that is then held. If the strings and action of the guitar are light enough, a player can bend notes by a semitone or more—so string bending can {{be a way of}} making a portamento transition between notes, and not just as a decoration on a note. String bends {{are one of the few}} ways to achieve microtonality, especially blue notes, on the guitar.|$|E
50|$|The terms vibrato and tremolo are {{sometimes}} incorrectly used interchangeably, although (in the classical world) they are properly defined as separate effects with vibrato {{defined as a}} periodic variation in the pitch (frequency) of a musical note, and tremolo as a fast repetition of the same note (usually a semiquaver) {{in order to produce}} the audible effect of a longer note, especially on instruments which do not have the ability of producing long sustained notes, such as the guitar. In practice, it is difficult for a singer or musical instrument player to achieve a pure vibrato or tremolo (where only the pitch or only the volume is varied), and variations in both pitch and volume will often be achieved at the same time. Electronic manipulation or generation of signals makes it easier to achieve or demonstrate pure tremolo or vibrato. In the world of electric guitar and record production vibrato retains the same meaning as in the classical world (a periodic <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch)</b> but tremolo describes a periodic variation in volume usually achieved using outboard effects units.|$|E
25|$|Pitch accent (tone accent) is {{a feature}} of certain {{languages}} whose <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch</b> (linguistic tones) {{can be used to}} differentiate words, but the potentially distinctive tones are restricted to one or two syllables within a word. This contrasts with fully-tonal languages like Standard Chinese in which each syllable can have an independent tone. <b>In</b> a <b>pitch</b> accent language, the syllable with phonemic tone is typically acoustically prominent (stressed). Also, many words may not be marked for tone at all.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the global nature of trapped {{particle}} motion in phase space makes it entirely plausible that particles with pitch angles near 90 deg are trapped for extremely long times, probably indefinitely.

For particles with low pitch angles an 'overstability' develops which serves to produce rapid <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch</b> angle and, presumably, random walk into the loss cone...|$|R
5000|$|The {{classical}} guitar vibrato is {{executed by}} rocking {{the tip of}} the left-hand finger(s) back and forth horizontally within the same fret space (i.e. along the string axis, and not across it as for a vertical [...] "bend" [...] in rock or blues music) producing a subtle <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch,</b> both sharper and flatter than the starting note, without noticeably altering the fundamental tonal focus of the note being played. The speed of the vibrato often has a great effect on the way the note is perceived, with faster vibratos commonly adding tension and stress, while slower vibratos produce a more lyrical sound. The slowest of vibratos can be used to imitate a bowed instrument [...] "growing" [...] a note after its initial inception. Even though this effect refers to volume in bowed instruments, having a pitch variation that follows the same structure of the volume variation in many situations can have the same effect for the listeners.When vibrato is required at the first or second fret it is sometimes beneficial to push the string across its axis as it produces a more noticeable vibrato sound there. This second method will only vary the pitch by raising it sharper than the starting note, but is the most common method of vibrato used by steel-string and electric guitar players, lacking the precise tonal qualities of nylon strings.|$|E

To solve this problem, we assigned 9 -bit codes so that in each consecutive section, each code changes by 1 bit, i.e., 000000000 → 000000001, 000000001 → 000000011, 000000011 → 000000111 [13, 17].|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} whether the occurrence of lexical tones in a language imposes restrictions on its pitch range.

50|$|The use of vibrato is {{intended}} to add warmth to a note. In the case of many string instruments the sound emitted is strongly directional, particularly at high frequencies, and the slight <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>pitch</b> typical of vibrato playing can cause large changes in the directional patterns of the radiated sound. This can add a shimmer to the sound; with a well-made instrument it may also help a solo player to be heard more clearly when playing with a large orchestra.|$|R
