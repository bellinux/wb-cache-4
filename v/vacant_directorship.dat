5000|$|When in 1783 Legros {{was finally}} granted {{permission}} to retire with a pension of 2,000 livres, {{he was a}} member of the committee of artistes which had been charged with the management of the Opéra since the former director Antoine Dauvergne's resignation in 1782. Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon de la Ferté, the long-serving sole Intendant of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, who was ultimately in charge of the theatre, referred to Legros in commendatory terms: he was [...] "the first singer of the Opéra" [...] and his departure [...] "would be a real loss for the administration". He even suggested Legros alone was qualified to fill the <b>vacant</b> <b>directorship</b> of the theatre. Papillon de la Ferté's suggestion, however, met with opposition from the rest of the committee and remained a dead letter.|$|E
50|$|In 1898, Paul, {{together}} with Behrens, Pankok, and Riemerschmid, {{was working as}} an applied artist. He was a leading figure {{in the development of}} the Jugendstil, and quickly established himself as the premier designer for the Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk, a maker of artistic housewares in Munich. The Jugendstil Hunter’s Room he designed for the Vereinigte Werkstätten in 1900 received a gold medal at the 1900 Paris International Exposition and was the first of a series of prestigious commissions that won widespread professional admiration. He won another gold medal at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, introducing his interior designs to a broad American audience. In 1906, Paul designed a festival decoration for a barracks in Munich, his first commission on an architectural scale. His design (perhaps apocryphally) impressed Kaiser Wilhelm II and facilitated his appointment to the <b>vacant</b> <b>directorship</b> of the Unterrichtsanstalt des königlichen Kunstgewerbe-Museums (educational institution of the royal museum of applied arts) in Berlin, an institution analogous to the South Kensington (later, Victoria and Albert) Museum in London or to the Art Institute in Chicago.|$|E
5000|$|Written by: Lise Nørgaard. Runtime: 58 minutes.Skjold Hansen has {{announced}} his retirement from the Korsbæk Bank Board. Bank President Jessen suggests that Jørgen Varnæs return to the board as Skjold Hansen's replacement, but he wishes {{to meet with him}} first. Hans Christian Varnæs organizes a dinner for them. There, Jessen confronts Jørgen with his suspicion that his wife, who is the sister of the seller, was defrauded of her share of the proceeds from the farm sale that Jørgen conducted as a front for Mads Skjern. Jessen demands an investigation, before he will nominate Jørgen for the <b>vacant</b> bank <b>directorship.</b> Jørgen seeks out Mads Skjern who advises him to keep quiet about what he knows. Kathrine Larsen receives a package from Herbert Schmidt, who has settled in Los Angeles. The package contains gifts of food, cigars and stockings, to be shared among Vicki, Agnes and Lauritz, and Katrine and Oluf Larsen. His short letter strangely lacks any special message for Vicki, which disappoints her. A plaque and portrait is hung in the District Bank in honor of the bank clerk and Resistance fighter, Poul Kristensen, who was shot by the Germans. After the ceremony, the new bank clerk Arne Schmidt invites Ulla Jacobsen to dinner at the Post House. That same day, a similar ceremony is held in the Korsbæk Bank for Mrs. Fernando Møhge who also died [...] "confronting the Germans." [...] Ms. Jørgensen and Violet Winter's relationship deteriorates further, and Jørgensen flees to Agnes Jensen's workroom, where she will spend the night. Agnes soon devises a plan by which she can help Miss. Jørgensen and her business. By renting the upstairs apartment to Jørgensen, who will then sublet the main room back to the business, she can by-pass regulations that restrict the conversion of residences for business use. Agnes asks Mads Skjern to put in a good word with the mayor, to allow the tenancy. Daniel Skjern has quit business school to work as an haute couture dress designer. This news enrages Mads, who is eventually calmed down by Ellen. Regitze Varnæs informs her family of her intention to work in Hamburg censoring mail for the occupying authorities. Ulrik Varnæs comes home with a waitress named Maja, who it turns out he has made pregnant. His father refuses to give him money for an abortion. On the same visit, Ulrik secretly meets with his old flame Ellen Skjern, who is herself unhappily married. Her husband Mogens Lamborg breaks his arm in a drunk-driving auto accident with the company car - while out carousing with Iben Skjern and her friend Jenny. In the final scene, Mads receives a letter awarding him a knighthood.|$|R
