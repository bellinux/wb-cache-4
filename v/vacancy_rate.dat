40|$|In {{this paper}} I present some {{evidence}} on the magnitudes and determinants of job <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> at the firm level. The data are from a survey of firms in 1980 and 1982, {{as well as from}} 1980 Census data on industry and local area characteristics. The results show that overall job <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> are low but there is substantial variation across firms, occupations, industries, and local areas. Unemployment rates, either local or aggregate, have negative effects on <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> while average industry skill levels have positive effects, thus indicating the importance of the firm's demand for skills. Large and/or unionized firms have relatively low <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates,</b> which also account for the low <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> of high-wage firms; and firms with high turnover and recent sales growth have higher <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, a variety of market conditions and firm characteristics influence <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> at the firm level. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} and {{estimate}} {{a model that}} decomposes the variance in office <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> into market-specific, time-specific, and random components. The results indicate significant differences in natural <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> across markets. We also find some persistence in deviations from these natural <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates.</b> The analysis is applied to both central business district (CBD) and suburban office markets. We find that natural <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> differ across CBD markets and across suburban markets. Further, the persistence of disequilibrium in one CBD market seems to differ significantly from that in another. This is not shown to be true for suburban markets.

5|$|Denver's {{position}} {{near the}} mineral-rich Rocky Mountains encouraged mining and energy companies to spring {{up in the}} area. In {{the early days of}} the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the city's economic success. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera Dynasty. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy also dropped, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and current governor John Hickenlooper, a former geologist), and the nation's highest office <b>vacancy</b> <b>rate</b> (30%). The industry has recovered and the region has 700 employed petroleum engineers. Advances in hydraulic fracturing have made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver's economy today, with companies such as EnCana, Halliburton, Smith International, Rio Tinto Group, Newmont Mining, Noble Energy, and Anadarko headquartered or having significant operations.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a <b>vacancy</b> <b>rate</b> of 12.8%.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{literature}} has followed an evolutionary {{path in the}} examination of office market volatility. Where initial models were designed to show the close relationship between economic fundamentals and volatility at the national level, more recent models have focused on metro-level volatility.

The analysis suggests that movements in <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates</b> {{are likely to be}} affected by different factors at different stages of the cycle. In the long run, this analysis shows that the availability of capital had the strongest effect on the volatility of office <b>vacancy</b> <b>rates.</b> In periods that follow excess construction, market-specific, demand-side factors appear to be the dominant influence. ...|$|R
