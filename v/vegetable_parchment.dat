25|$|Vegetable (paper) {{parchment}} is made {{by passing}} a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the <b>vegetable</b> <b>parchment</b> paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.|$|E

The Group is a producer of <b>vegetable</b> <b>parchment</b> and has parchmentizing and converting operations located in West Carrollton, Ohio, USA. The transaction was completed in March 2008.|$|E
50|$|Per Thomas Keller's recipe, a pipérade {{is made of}} peeled, finely chopped, {{and reduced}} peppers, yellow onions, tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. The piperade is spread thinly in a baking tray or {{casserole}} dish, then layered on top with evenly sized, thinly sliced rounds of zucchini, yellow squash, Japanese eggplant, and roma tomatoes, covered in parchment paper, then baked slowly for several hours to steam the <b>vegetables.</b> The <b>parchment</b> is removed so that the vegetables may then roast, acquiring additional flavor through caramelization. To serve, the piperade is formed into a small mound, and the rounds arranged in a fanned-out pattern to cover the piperade base. A balsamic vinaigrette is drizzled on the plate, which may be garnished.|$|R
40|$|This {{pioneering}} volume {{brings together}} specialists from contemporary craft and industry and from archaeology to examine both the material properties {{and the cultural}} dimensions of leather. The common occurrence of animal skin products through time, whether <b>vegetable</b> tanned leather, <b>parchment,</b> vellum, fat-cured skins or rawhide attest to its enduring versatility, utility and desirability. Typically grouped together as ‘leather’, the versatility of these materials is remarkable: they can be soft and supple like a textile, firm and rigid like a basket, or hard and watertight like a pot or gourd. This volume challenges a simple utilitarian or functional approach to leather; {{in a world of}} technological and material choices, leather is appropriated according to its suitability on many levels. In addressing the question Why leather? authors of this volume present new perspectives on the material and cultural dimensions of leather. Their wide-ranging research includes the microscopic examination of skin structure and its influence on behaviour, experiments on medieval cuir bouilli armour, the guild secrets behind the leather components of nineteenth-century industrial machinery, new research on ancient Egyptian leather chariots, the relationship between wine and wineskins, and the making of contemporary leather wall covering...|$|R
50|$|Women {{artists in}} this period began {{to change the way}} women were {{depicted}} in art. Many of the women working as artists in the Baroque era were not able to train from nude models, who were always male, but they were very familiar with the female body. Women such as Elisabetta Sirani created images of women as conscious beings rather than detached muses. One of the best examples of this novel expression is in Artemesia Gentileschi's Judith beheading Holofernes, in which Judith is depicted as a strong woman determining her own destiny. While other artists, including Botticelli and the more traditional woman, Fede Galizia, depicted the same scene with a passive Judith, in her novel treatment, Gentileschi's Judith appears to be an able actor in the task at hand. Action is the essence of it and another painting by her of Judith leaving the scene. Still life emerged as an important genre around 1600, particularly in the Netherlands. Women were at the forefront of this painting trend. This genre was particularly suited to women, as they could access the materials for still life readily. In the North, these practitioners included Clara Peeters, a painter of banketje or breakfast pieces, and scenes of arranged luxury goods; Maria van Oosterwijk, the internationally renowned flower painter; and Rachel Ruysch, a painter of visually charged flower arrangements. In other regions, still life was less common, but there were important women artists in the genre including Giovanna Garzoni, who created realistic <b>vegetable</b> arrangements on <b>parchment,</b> and Louise Moillon, whose fruit still life paintings were noted for their brilliant colors.|$|R
50|$|During {{the final}} years of the Hepburn government, it sought to stimulate {{employment}} in Northern Ontario in order to stabilize its political position. In that regard, it encouraged negotiations between Abitibi and Kalamazoo <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Parchment</b> Company of Parchment, Michigan, which resulted in the sale of Abitibi's Spanish River facility (at that time its largest non-economic asset) in 1943. It subsequently resumed operation as the KVP Company.|$|E
5000|$|A further advance {{was the use}} of {{so-called}} [...] "sachets", a misnomer, because they were small absorbent pads containing certain chemicals, attached to foil or other waterproof material, such as <b>vegetable</b> <b>parchment.</b> The sachets were placed in water and then wound rapidly round the curlers. These were popular with hairdressers as a labour-saving device, and with manufacturers, as they were only used once and some 20 would be used for a head of hair.|$|E

50|$|Packaging {{preserves}} aroma {{and flavor}} and eases shipping and dispensation. Wax paper seals against air, moisture, dust, and germs, while cellophane is valued by packagers for its transparency {{and resistance to}} grease, odors and moisture. In addition, it is often resealable. Polyethylene is another form of film sealed with heat, and this material {{is often used to}} make bags in bulk packaging. Plastic wraps are also common. Aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight, non-toxic and odor proof. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>parchment</b> lines boxes of high-quality confections like gourmet chocolates. Cardboard cartons are less common, though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil.|$|E
50|$|Folio {{publications}} {{are printed}} {{in a range}} of standard sizes (in 1951, for example, these included Royal Octavo, Medium Octavo, Crown Octavo and Demy Octavo), and custom sizes are also employed. The most common material for bindings is buckram or a similar bookcloth, but there are many exceptions: aluminium foil was used in binding Aldous Huxley's Brave New World in 1971, and <b>vegetable</b> <b>parchment</b> in binding Voltaire's The Calas Affair in 1994; more commonly, marbled papers (often produced by Ann Muir Marbling Ltd.) have been used for several volumes in recent years, either as endpapers or as board-papers of quarter bindings; moiré silk (usually artificial) has been used sporadically over the years as a binding material, and leather (vellum and goatskin) and bonded leather are sometimes used, chiefly for the more expensive editions. Most bindings for works of fiction are designed by the illustrator. Non-fiction binding designers include David Eccles, Jeff Clements, and Neil Gower.|$|E
5000|$|The Kalamazoo <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Parchment</b> Company {{was founded}} in 1909. The founder, Jacob Kindleberger set up shop along the Kalamazoo River. The company then started selling pieces of land located around the mill to the mill workers. In 1932, [...] "Uncle Jake" [...] left a tract of 40 acres (160,000 m2) located {{in the center of}} the city, this later became Kindleberger Park in his honor. Later in 1939 Parchment became a city by a {{majority}} vote, and has become known as [...] "The Paper City" [...] since then. Over the years the KVP company was bought out by or merged with other companies including, Sutherland Paper Company, Brown Company, James River, and finally Crown-Vantage. 2000 marked the end of paper making in Parchment and the city has struggled to keep itself afloat. Now a great debate in the city exists as to what to do with the old paper mill property. As of 2011 the first mill building has been demolished with plans to demolish the other building at a later date.|$|E
5000|$|In 1787 this mill {{was being}} run by Henry Brightly. John Hall was the owner in 1816. Charles Cowan {{was working at the}} mill in 1819, when the mill had two vats and was {{producing}} an estimated 1500 lb of paper a week. William Joynson took over in 1834. He had previously been at a paper mill in Snodland. Paper produced here bore the watermarks [...] "Joynson Superfine" [...] or [...] "WJ&S" [...] over [...] "St Mary Cray Kent". In 1839, Joynson was granted a patent for watermarking paper produced by machine. The waterwheel was of cast iron construction and may have been overshot, as the head was some 8 ft to 9 ft. The mill was expanded in 1853, when a second machine was installed, enabling the steam driven mills to produce 25 to 30 tons of paper a week. William Joynson died in 1874 and the mills were left in trust to his two grandsons. One of them, William, drowned in 1875 leaving Edmund Hamborough Joynson as sole heir. Cowan mentions that the mill was producing an estimated 70000 lb of paper a week in 1878. Some 700 people were employed at the mill in 1881 and E. H. Joynson took over the mill in September 1882, expanding it the following year with a new steam engine and machinery. An engraving of the mill in 1891 can be seen here. Joynson produced only high quality writing papers. In the late 1890s, a dryer was sold to Nash's and installed in their mill at St Pauls Cray. Edmund Joynson took his son into partnership shortly before World War One. The firm became William Joynson & Son. In 1914, Joynson's paper was used in the first £1 and 10/- banknotes issued by the Bank of England. Edmund H Joynson retired in 1930 and the mills were taken over by Messrs Wiggins Teape & Co. who promptly closed the mills in order to rebuild them. 350 people were made redundant, and only 200 were employed in the reopened factory. The paper factory made greaseproof and <b>vegetable</b> <b>parchment</b> paper. The mill reopened in April 1933 as the <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Parchment</b> Mills (Delcroix) Ltd. The production of [...] "vulcanised fibre" [...] began around 1943. In 1963 the mill was the home of the National Paper Museum The mill closed in 1967 and the paper museum collection was transferred to the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester.|$|E
