5|$|On July 23, 1911, Earp {{was arrested}} in Los Angeles and charged with {{attempting}} to fleece J. Y. Peterson, a realty broker, in a fake faro game. Since money had not changed hands, the charge against Earp was reduced to <b>vagrancy</b> and he was released on $500 bail.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 11 September 1867, police arrested two men found {{loitering}} in Oak Street, Shudehill, suspecting them of planning to rob a shop. Both were charged under the <b>Vagrancy</b> Act and held in custody. The Manchester police were initially unaware of their identities, until their colleagues in the Irish police identified them as Kelly and Deasy.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the <b>Vagrancy</b> Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Opinion of the Rivadavia {{government}} was {{divided between the}} two ideologies. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia's presidency was a positive experience. He set up a European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the gauchos were arrested by Rivadavia for <b>vagrancy</b> and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is non-migratory in the milder {{west and}} south of its breeding range, but some northern birds move south in winter, and individuals breeding on mountains may descend to a lower altitude in winter. Winter movements and post-breeding dispersal may lead to <b>vagrancy</b> outside the normal range. Wintering migrants of the Asian subspecies have been recorded in South Korea and China, and the nominate form has been recorded west of its breeding range as far as Orkney, Scotland. The Eurasian treecreeper has also occurred as a vagrant to the Channel Islands (where the short-toed is the resident species), Majorca and the Faroe Islands.|$|E
5|$|The Reverend John Vachell {{stayed on}} as vicar of St George's Littleport in title until 1830; he {{appointed}} a curate, George Britton Jermyn from 1817. Some of the St George's church registers were destroyed during the riots. The remaining registers start from 1754 (marriages), 1756 (burials), and 1783 (baptism). General unrest and riots {{such as that}} at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the <b>Vagrancy</b> Act of 1824. Due in part to some difficulties in enforcing the law and to continued public unease, the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 was created leading to the first modern police force.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the English Poor Law system {{can be traced back}} to late medieval {{statutes}} dealing with beggars and <b>vagrancy</b> but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors Reformation causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|Edward Christian, {{brother of}} Fletcher Christian, had been {{appointed}} Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely in 1800 by the Bishop of Ely. As the Chief Justice, Christian was entitled to try the rioters alone. The government, in this case via the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, nevertheless appointed a Special Commission, consisting of Justice Abbott and Justice Burrough. The rioters were tried in the assizes at Ely during the week commencing June 1816. 23 men and one woman were condemned, of which five were subsequently hanged. General unrest and riots such as that at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the <b>Vagrancy</b> Act of 1824 and subsequently the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{a popular}} revolt {{following}} the unrest {{created by the}} Great Depression, wealthy Guatemalan landowners lent their support to Jorge Ubico, who won an uncontested election in 1931. Ubico's regime {{became one of the}} most repressive in the region. He abolished debt peonage, replacing it with a <b>vagrancy</b> law which stipulated that all landless men of working age needed to perform a minimum of 100 days of forced labor annually. He authorized landowners to take any actions they wished against their workers, including executions. Ubico was an admirer of European fascist leaders such as Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but had to ally with the U.S. for geopolitical reasons, and received substantial support from this country throughout his reign. A staunch anti-communist, Ubico reacted to several peasant rebellions with incarcerations and massacres.|$|E
5|$|The new {{industrial}} workforce often {{lived and}} worked under very poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left their jobs in protest could find themselves arrested by the mounted police {{under the terms of}} the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the <b>vagrancy</b> laws. Although the position of organised labour was weak in Canada – the trade unions only had very limited legal rights – the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly used for this purpose, but the mounted police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be more politically reliable.|$|E
5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the <b>vagrancy</b> laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E
5|$|Antarctic explorers Robert Falcon Scott and Frank Bickerton both {{lived in}} the city. Artists include Beryl Cook whose {{paintings}} depict the culture of Plymouth and Robert Lenkiewicz, whose paintings investigated themes of <b>vagrancy,</b> sexual behaviour and suicide, {{lived in the}} city from the 1960s until his death in 2002. Illustrator and creator of children's series Mr Benn and King Rollo, David McKee, was born and brought up in South Devon and trained at Plymouth College of Art. Jazz musician John Surman, born in nearby Tavistock, has close connections to the area, evidenced by his 2012 album Saltash Bells. The avant garde prepared guitarist Keith Rowe was born in the city before establishing the jazz free improvisation band AMM in London in 1965 and MIMEO in 1997. The musician and film director Cosmo Jarvis has lived in several towns in South Devon and has filmed videos in and around Plymouth. In addition, actors Sir Donald Sinden and Judi Trott. George Passmore of Turner Prize winning duo Gilbert and George was born in the city, as was Labour politician Michael Foot whose family reside at nearby Trematon Castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 an {{exhibition}} at Leeds College of Art of paintings by the Cyprus-born British artist Stass Paraskos, entitled Lovers and Romances, was prosecuted by the City of Leeds {{police and the}} Director of Public Prosecutions under the <b>Vagrancy</b> Acts of 1828 and 1837, and the Obscene Publications Act 1959. When the exhibition opened it was allegedly visited by a local school group, the leader of which objected to an image depicting a woman masturbating a man. The exhibition was raided {{by the police and}} closed down. Despite luminaries of the art world speaking in Paraskos's defence, including Herbert Read and Norbert Lynton, and a message of support from Britain's Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, Paraskos lost the trial and was fined twenty-five pounds. The case was later cited in the report of a working party convened in 1968, under the chairmanship of John Montgomerie, by the Arts Council of Great Britain, to review the obscenity laws in England and Wales. In this report it was suggested the artist should not have been prosecuted in this case, even if the works of art were deemed obscene, as he was not the publisher as defined by the Obscene Publications Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} in 1944 left {{many of the}} biggest opponents of organized labor unaffected, such as the landed elite and the United Fruit Company. The revolution, and election of Arévalo, nonetheless marked a significant shift in the fortunes of labor unions. The protests of 1944 strengthened the labor movement {{to the point where}} Ponce Vaides stopped enforcing the repressive <b>vagrancy</b> law, which was abolished in the 1945 constitution. On 1 May 1945, Arévalo made a speech celebrating organized labor, to a tremendously positive reception. The freedom of press guaranteed in the new constitution also drew much attention to the brutal working conditions in Guatemala City. From the beginning, the new unions that were formed fell into two camps, those that were communist and those that were not. The repressive policies of the Ubico government had driven both factions underground, but they re-emerged after the revolution.|$|E
5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a <b>vagrancy</b> law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the most}} efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states began}} the process of forming governments, Johnson's {{policies}} received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners {{to ensure that the}} war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed Black Codes, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for <b>vagrancy</b> and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory annual message to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.|$|E
25|$|Modern Times, 1936 film, shows {{negative}} effects of <b>vagrancy</b> laws.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, Floyd {{was wanted}} in {{numerous}} cases. On March 9, {{he was arrested}} in Kansas City on investigation, and again on May 6 for <b>vagrancy</b> and suspicion of highway robbery, but he was released the next day. Two days later, {{he was arrested in}} Pueblo, Colorado, and charged with <b>vagrancy.</b> He was fined $50.00 and sentenced to 60 days in jail.|$|E
25|$|Deputy sheriffs began arresting {{striking}} {{miners and}} charging them with <b>vagrancy.</b> Anyone without a job, meaning all those on strike, were being {{found guilty of}} <b>vagrancy,</b> so that WFM strikers {{had to leave the}} district to avoid repeated arrests and fines. On 23 December, 11 WFM members were arrested and charged with intimidating strikebreakers. The charges were dropped 5 days later, and the 11 were released, but they were released from the jail in Montrose, Colorado, 71 miles away from Telluride.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, he {{was arrested}} in a San Francisco {{waterfront}} bar and charged with <b>vagrancy</b> and jailed, though the charges were later dropped because of his family and wealth.|$|E
25|$|In April 1930, Capone {{was arrested}} on <b>vagrancy</b> charges when visiting Miami Beach; the {{governor}} had ordered sheriffs to run {{him out of the}} state. Capone claimed that Miami police had refused him food and water and threatened to arrest his family. He was charged with perjury for making these statements, but was acquitted after a three-day trial in July. In September, a Chicago judge issued a warrant for Capone's arrest on charges of <b>vagrancy,</b> and then used the publicity to run against Thompson in the Republican primary. In February 1931, Capone was tried on the contempt of court charge. In court, Judge James Herbert Wilkerson intervened to reinforce questioning of Capone's doctor by the prosecutor. Wilkerson sentenced Capone to six months, but he remained free while on appeal of the contempt conviction.|$|E
25|$|This {{treecreeper}} {{is essentially}} non-migratory but post-breeding dispersal {{may lead to}} <b>vagrancy</b> outside the normal range. It has occurred as a vagrant to England, Sweden, Lithuania and the Balearic Islands. Three birds on Corsica in 1969 appeared {{to be of the}} North African subspecies C. b. mauritanica.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Hickok was {{diagnosed}} {{by a doctor}} in Kansas City, Missouri, with glaucoma and ophthalmia. Though just 39, his marksmanship and health were apparently in decline, {{as he had been}} arrested several times for <b>vagrancy,</b> despite earning a good income from gambling and displays of showmanship only a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|In the South, <b>vagrancy</b> laws {{had allowed}} {{the states to}} force free Negroes into labor, and {{sometimes}} to sell them into slavery. Nevertheless, free Africans across the country performed a variety of occupations, and a small number owned and operated successful farms. Others settled in Southern Ontario and Nova Scotia, possible endpoints of the Underground Railroad.|$|E
25|$|In {{the title}} X-Factor, the {{crystals}} {{are removed from}} Quicksilver's body by another mutant, leaving him powerless once again. Destitute and jailed for <b>vagrancy</b> in the one-shot X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead, Quicksilver has a series of hallucinations and inexplicably regains his super speed. Escaping jail, Quicksilver rescues an innocent and rediscovers his {{desire to be a}} hero.|$|E
25|$|Noboa's company {{claims that}} to be untrue since child labor in the {{agricultural}} sphere {{is part of the}} existing countryside culture which not only asked but demanded the performance of some type of agricultural labor from its siblings during vacations, in order to make ends meet, and to avoid <b>vagrancy</b> and therefore the possibility of delinquent behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{violence}} intensified. After a mine explosion on November 21, 1903 {{killed a}} superintendent and foreman, Bell announced a <b>vagrancy</b> order that required all strikers {{to return to}} work or be deported from the district. When a bomb exploded at the Independence Depot near Victor, Colorado on June 6, 1904, killing thirteen strikebreakers, Sheriff H.M. Robertson went to investigate. The situation became very volatile, with throngs of angry men gathered in the streets.|$|E
25|$|After a stint with Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theater and a {{short period}} of <b>vagrancy,</b> {{involving}} hitchhiking, freight hopping, picking fruit, and logging in the Pacific Northwest (Preston Sturges conceived the film Sullivan's Travels after hearing Garfield tell of his hobo adventures) Garfield made his Broadway debut in 1932 in a play called Lost Boy. It ran for only two weeks, but gave Garfield something critically important for an actor struggling to break into the theater: a credit.|$|E
25|$|On his release, May {{continued}} his life of crime, impersonating various characters (policemen, doctors etc.) and spinning fantastic tales {{as a method}} of fraud. He was arrested, but when he was transported to a crime scene during a judicial investigation, he escaped and fled to Bohemia, where he was detained for <b>vagrancy.</b> For another four years, from 1870 to 1874, May was jailed in Waldheim, Saxony. There he met a Catholic Catechist, Johannes Kochta, who assisted May.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{following}} Maranzano's death, Luciano and Lansky {{formed the}} National Crime Syndicate, {{an organization of}} crime families that brought power to the underworld. The Commission was established for dividing Mafia territories and preventing future gang wars. With his associates, Siegel formed Murder, Inc. After Siegel and Lansky moved on, control over Murder, Inc. was ceded to Buchalter and Anastasia. Siegel continued working as a hitman. Siegel's only conviction was in Miami. On February 28, 1932, {{he was arrested for}} gambling and <b>vagrancy,</b> and, from a roll of bills, paid a $100 fine.|$|E
25|$|Before {{returning}} to office in 1956, Connor quickly resumed his brutal approach {{to dealing with}} perceived threats to the social order. His forces raided a meeting at the house of African-American activist, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, where three Montgomery ministers were attending. Connor feared that the Montgomery Bus Boycott underway would spread to Birmingham, in an effort to integrate city buses. He had the ministers arrested on charges of <b>vagrancy,</b> which did not allow a prisoner bail, nor any visitors during the first three days of their incarceration. A federal investigation followed, but Connor refused to cooperate.|$|E
25|$|His {{arrest for}} <b>vagrancy</b> and theft in March 1969 was widely {{covered by the}} media. Appalled by his circumstance, a number of {{influential}} friends from his cricketing days, such as the former Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies, aided him by organising him legal assistance. The hearing was later adjourned, and he reconciled with his wife Bea after committing to remain sober. They lived together again for {{the last years of}} his life. However, the years of homelessness left him in poor health, and he died from cancer at St Vincent's Hospital in Fitzroy a fortnight before his 63rd birthday.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Stewart began {{hanging around}} folk singer Wizz Jones, busking at Leicester Square and other London spots. Stewart took up playing the then-fashionable harmonica. On several trips {{over the next}} 18 months Jones and Stewart took their act to Brighton and then to Paris, {{sleeping}} under bridges over the River Seine, and then finally to Barcelona. Finally this resulted in Stewart being rounded up and deported from Spain for <b>vagrancy</b> during 1963. At this time, Stewart, who had been at William Grimshaw School with three of their members, was briefly considered as singer for the embryonic Kinks.|$|E
25|$|For {{this and}} other misdemeanors, {{including}} repeated acts of <b>vagrancy,</b> he was sent {{at the age of}} 15 to Mettray Penal Colony where he was detained between 2 September 1926 and 1 March 1929. In The Miracle of the Rose (1946), he gives an account of this period of detention, which ended at the age of 18 when he joined the Foreign Legion. He was eventually given a dishonorable discharge on grounds of indecency (having been caught engaged in a homosexual act) and spent a period as a vagabond, petty thief and prostitute across Europe—experiences he recounts in The Thief's Journal (1949).|$|E
25|$|In Tepetitán he was proclaimed General Commandant of the Liberation Army and {{he proclaimed}} the famous Declaration of Tepetitán on February 16. In it he ordered drastic punishments for murder (death), {{wounding}} someone (loss of a hand), joining the government forces (as specified by law), robbery (loss of a hand) and <b>vagrancy,</b> among other crimes. The declaration also contained {{a section on}} the protection of married women. Aquino also ended payment of taxes to the government, especially on indigo (the main product of the region), banned aguardiente, and proclaimed the end of forced labor. He prohibited collection of debts contracted before the rebellion, with a punishment of ten years in prison.|$|E
25|$|After {{six months}} {{residency}} at Pinocchios, Spry started booking The Flies into Sydney {{where they were}} arrested for <b>vagrancy</b> for having hair over their shoulders, but it was great publicity making all the papers. Back in Melbourne, Spry employed Carole West to organise a publicity shoot for TV and press to display his band having their long hair done at a women's hair salon in South Yarra. During the shoot, Burns sang with his guitar and was joined by apprentice hairdresser Lynne Randell – who was promptly signed by Spry and managed by West. In January 1965, they supported The Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison on their first Australian tour.|$|E
