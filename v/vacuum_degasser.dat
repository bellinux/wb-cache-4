50|$|Solids {{control is}} a {{technique}} used in a drilling rig to separate the solids in the drilling fluids that are crushed by the drill bits and carried out of the well surface. Normally, a solid control system contains five stages: the mud tank, shale shaker, <b>vacuum</b> <b>degasser,</b> desander, desilter, and centrifuge. The shale shaker is used to separate big solids with diameter above 75μm, the desander addresses solids from 45-74μm, and the desilter segregates solids between 15-44μm. Sometimes the desander and desilter are combined as one high efficiency mud cleaner. When air enters the drilling fluids, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>degasser</b> is used to separate the air. When there is no air in the mud, the degasser works as a big agitator. All these stages are mounted {{on the top of}} the mud tank. After separating the solids, the clean mud can be pumped into the borehole again.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} the mud tanks that are needed on the {{drilling}} rig depends on {{the depth of the}} well, and also the mud demands of drilling. Normally the shale shaker and <b>vacuum</b> <b>degasser</b> and desander are mounted together on the same mud tank as the first tank at the oilfield, while desilter and centrifuge on the second tank. Also, the drilling rig has other different tanks such as a reserve tank, emergency tank, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Desanders have no moving parts. The {{larger the}} {{internal}} {{diameter of the}} desander is, the greater the amount of drilling fluids {{it is able to}} process and the larger the size of the solids removed. A desander with a (10 in cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 40-50 μm (micrometre) range at a flow rate of , whilea desilter (4 in Cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 15-20 μm range at a flow rate of [...] Micro-fine separators are able to remove 50% of solids within the 10-15 μm range at a flow rate of [...] A desander is typically positioned next-to-last in the arrangement of solids control equipment, with a desander centrifuge as the subsequent processing unit. Desanders are preceded by gas busters, gumbo removal equipment (if utilized), shale shaker, mud cleaner (if utilized) and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>degasser.</b> Desanders are widely used in oilfield drilling.Practice has proved that hydrocyclone desanders are economic and effective equipment.|$|E
30|$|Analyses {{were carried}} out using a Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) HPLC HP 1100 system {{comprising}} a <b>vacuum</b> solvent <b>degasser,</b> a binary pump, autosampler and column oven. The column used for the separation was a Luna C 18 (2) 100  Å, 150  ×  2.0  mm, 3  μm particle size (Phenomenex) stabilized at 40  °C in the column oven. Detection was performed using an HP 1100 DAD with a 500  nL flow cell and using detection wavelengths from 200 to 700  nm. The solvent system used comprised two solvents: (A) 99.9 % water/ 0.1 % trifluroacetic acid (v/v); and (B) 99.9 % acetonitrile/ 0.1 % trifluroacetic acid (v/v). The elution programme was a first gradient from 95 % A/ 5 % B to 70 % A/ 30 % B {{over a period of}} 25  min followed by a second linear gradient to 100 % B after a further 15  min. After 10  min elution with pure B, a third linear gradient was used to return to the initial composition (95 % A/ 5 % B) in 15  min. The flow rate was fixed throughout at 0.2  mL per/minute creating a system back-pressure of 120 bars (12.0  MPa).|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{steelmaking}} plays a great role {{in enhancing}} {{the quality of}} the final steel product. The metal quality is a function of metal bath stirring in ladles. The metal bath is often stirred by an inert gas to achieve maximum compositional and thermal uniformity throughout the melt. Ladle operators often observe the top surface phenomena, such as level of meniscus disturbance, to evaluate the status of stirring. However, this type of monitoring has significant limitations in assessing the process accurately especially at low gas flow rate bubbling. The present study investigates stirring phenomena using ladle wall triaxial vibration at a low flow rate on a steel-made laboratory model and plant scale for the case of the <b>vacuum</b> tank <b>degasser.</b> Cold model and plant data were successfully modeled by partial least-squares regression to predict the amount of stirring. In the cold model, {{it was found that the}} combined vibration signal could predict the stirring power and recirculation speed effectively in specific frequency ranges. Plant trials also revealed that there is a high structure in each data set and in the same frequency ranges at the water model. In the case of industrial data, the degree of linear relationship was strong for data taken from a single heat...|$|R

40|$|The {{technique}} {{used at the}} Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) to measure the concentration of 222 Rn in water is described. Water from the SNO detector is passed through a <b>vacuum</b> <b>degasser</b> (in the light water system) or a membrane contact degasser (in the heavy water system) where dissolved gases, including radon, are liberated. The degasser is connected to a vacuum system which collects the radon on a cold trap and removes most other gases, such as water vapor and N 2. After roughly 0. 5 tonnes of H 2 O or 6 tonnes of D 2 O have been sampled, the accumulated radon is transferred to a Lucas cell. The cell is mounted on a photomultiplier tube which detects the α-particles from the decay of 222 Rn and its progeny. The overall degassing and concentration efficiency is about 38 % and the single-α counting efficiency is approximately 75 %. The sensitivity of the radon assay system for D 2 O is equivalent to ∼ 3 × 10 - 15 g U/g water. The radon concentration in both the H 2 O and D 2 O is sufficiently low {{that the rate of}} background events from U-chain elements is {{a small fraction of the}} interaction rate of solar neutrinos by the neutral current reaction. © 2003 Elsevier B.
