25|$|Because the new <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>is</b> {{the former}} {{governor}} of Pennsylvania, a special election is to be held for his successor.

When Russo decides to come clean about his role in Underwood's schemes, Frank kills Russo and stages his death as a suicide. With the special election in chaos, Underwood convinces the vice president to step down and run for his old position of governor – leaving the vice presidency open to Underwood, as was his plan all along.|$|E
25|$|The {{meeting is}} held at 1 p.m. in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.

The vice president and the Speaker of the House sit at the podium, {{with the vice president}} in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of each two-year session the House elects a speaker who does not {{normally}} preside over debates but serves as the majority party's leader. In the Senate, the <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> <b>is</b> the ex officio president of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the President pro tempore. Pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there's a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore {{at the beginning of a}} new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.|$|E
