To each differential monomial we put in correspondence a point innthat is it's <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> exponent. To the differential equation there corresponds it's support that is a set of the <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> exponents of it's monomials. The affine hull of the support is called a supersupport and it's dimension is called the dimension of the equation. If the dimension is less than n then the equation is quasihomogeneous and has the quasihomogeneous (self-similar) solutions. Such a solution is defined by a function of less number of independent variables. Here it is shown how to calculate all kinds of self-similar solutions of the equation by means of the methods of linear algebra using the support of the equation.

Materials and MethodsThirty-one myopic eyes in 17 patients were studied. Subjective manifest refraction was measured and deemed {{as the true}} refraction status. After inducing cycloplegia by administering 1 % tropicamide, cycloplegic autorefraction was measured using a Topcon autorefractor, and wavefront refraction was measured with an Allegretto wave analyzer. Refraction data were presented as the spherical equivalent and astigmatism. Astigmatism was converted to <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> and analyzed by the Alpins method. ResultsBoth cycloplegic wavefront refraction and autorefraction showed good correlations with subjective refraction. The adjusted R 2 value was 0. 9726 between cycloplegic autorefraction and subjective manifest refraction, and 0. 9693 between cycloplegic wavefront refraction and subjective manifest refraction. Compared with subjective manifest refraction, a myopic shift of − 0. 14  ±  0. 06 D was noted in cycloplegic wavefront refraction (p =  0. 0182). However, cycloplegic autorefraction was not different from subjective manifest refraction (p =  0. 55). Astigmatism in both wavefront refraction and autorefraction differed from subjective astigmatism (p <  0. 0001 for both). The difference of astigmatism <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> from subjective refraction was 0. 16 D larger in the cycloplegic wavefront refraction group than in the cycloplegic autorefraction group (p =  0. 0039).

40|$|Using the {{framework}} provided by Clifford algebras, we consider a non-commutative quotient-difference algorithm for obtaining {{the elements of}} a continued fraction corresponding to a given vector-valued power series. We demonstrate that these elements are ratios of vectors, which may be calculated {{with the aid of a}} cross rule using only vector operations. For vector-valued meromorphic functions we derive the asymptotic behaviour of these vectors, and hence of the continued fraction elements themselves. The behaviour of these elements is similar to that in the scalar case, while the vectors are linked with the residues of the given function. In the particular case of <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> series arising from matrix iteration the new algorithm amounts to a generalisation of the power method to sub-dominant eigenvalues, and their eigenvectors...|$|E

30|$|Detector C {{in general}} {{does not require}} any {{additional}} hardware because it is implemented in a software. It is relatively easily implemented as a <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> detector. The drawback of this detector {{is the fact that}} the complete receiver chain including amplifiers, mixers and ADCs is passed before the detector. For linear functionality, this complete chain has to operate in the linear domain as well. This increases the requirements on the whole receiver and at the end makes the use of an LCC questionable - if the receiver operates in a linear fashion under leakage carrier conditions, why bother to implement an LCC? It still makes sense to compensate the leakage in this case because the requirements on dynamic range regarding detecting the weak received tag response under the presence of leakage are very demanding, especially when we concern the necessary ADC resolution.|$|E

In this limit, the power spectrum coming from massive tensor modes decays quickly, leading to the conventional tensor power spectrum. Also, we find that {{in the limit of}} m^ 2 → 0 (keeping the Weyl-squared term only), the vector and tensor power spectra disappear. It implies that their power spectra are not gravitationally produced because they (vector and tensor) are decoupled from the expanding de Sitter background, as a result of conformal invariance.

Complex numbers, quaternions and Cartesian vectors can be described by the vari-ous components within a Clifford multivector and from our results {{we are able to}} demonstrate new inter-relationships between these algebraic systems.

40|$|Cosmological {{magnetic}} fields induce temperature and polarization {{fluctuations in the}} cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A cosmological magnetic field with current amplitude of order $ 10 ^{- 9 }$ G is detectable via observations of CMB anisotropies. This magnetic field (with or without helicity) generates vector perturbations through vortical motions of the primordial plasma. This paper shows that magnetic field helicity induces parity-odd cross correlations between CMB temperature and $B$-polarization fluctuations and between $E$- and $B$-polarization fluctuations, correlations which are zero for fields with no helicity (or for any parity-invariant source). Helical fields also contribute to parity-even temperature and polarization anisotropies, cancelling part of the contribution from the symmetric component of the magnetic field. We give analytic approximations for all CMB temperature and polarization anisotropy <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> spectra due to helical {{magnetic fields}}.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} robust MIMO precoding designs against deterministic imperfect channel state {{information at the}} transmitter (CSIT). In contrast to the existing works based {{on one or two}} particular channel uncertainty models, {{we consider}} a general uncertainty set defined by a generic matrix norm, called the Schatten norm, which includes most deterministic imperfect CSIT as special cases. Adopting worst-case robustness, the robust MIMO precoding design is formulated as a maximin problem to maximize the worst-case received signal-to-noise ratio or minimize the worst-case error probability. We show that the robust precoder admits a channel-diagonalizing structure for all Schatten norm based uncertainty sets, and then simplify the complex-valued matrix problem to a real-valued <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> allocation problem. We further show that the simplified power allocation problem can be analytically solved in a waterfilling manner, thus leading to a fully closed-form solution to the robust precoding design.

40|$|Many {{proposals}} about induction-machine broken-bar detection can {{be found}} in the literature. Disturbances that affect phase currents, current space <b>vector,</b> <b>power,</b> fluxes, torque, and speed have been utilized to diagnose mains-supplied machines. Nevertheless, there is still disagreement about how the fault signatures of the different variables correlate with the actual fault and how they depend on the operating conditions. This paper presents a simple but effective analytical representation of induction machines with rotor faults, based on a synchronous reference frame and on Steinmetz's phasors. The developed relationships can be visualized through equivalent circuits, feedback loop block diagrams, or geometrical loci, allowing a deep understanding of the underlying physical phenomena, particularly as functions of inertia and of the machine parameters. The insight thus gained helps to enhance the quantification of fault severity with respect to the usual diagnostic technique based on the sum of the sidebands, clearly defining for the first time the field of validity of such technique. The analytical results are verified through simulations and experiments. Â© 1982 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The {{merits of}} nine methods for zooming {{microwave}} amplitude-sensing monopulse antenna patterns are discussed. Of these, six {{are directly related}} to the TDRSS (Tracking Data Relay Satellite System) and are compatible with a deployable-mesh pseudo-paraboloidal main reflector. The remaining three methods utilize radically different geometrical configurations that depart considerably from the TDRSS parameters existing at this time. Preservation of the monopulse postulates is considered to be of prime importance for any variable-beamwidth candidate, however, it is allowed that approximate satisfaction of the postulates should be accepted for practical reasons. All of the methods discussed admit free choice of the polarization state, and the zooming function is never predicated on polarization. Exploration of the zooming techniques was carried out almost entirely by means of the Kirchhoff-Kottler vector diffraction program.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formulate}} {{the problem of}} finding the optimal precoding/multiplexing strategy in an infrastructureless multiuser scenario as a noncooperative game. We first consider the theoretical problem of maximizing mutual information on each link, given constraints on the spectral mask and transmit power. Then, to accommodate practical implementation aspects, {{we focus on the}} competitive maximization of the transmission rate on each link, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above plus a constraint on the average error probability. We prove that in both cases a NE always exists and the optimal precoding/multiplexing strategy leads to a (pure strategy) diagonal transmission for all the users. Thanks to this result, we can reduce both original complicated matrix-valued games to a simpler unified <b>vector</b> <b>power</b> control game. Thus, we derive sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the NE of such a game, that are proved to have a broader validity than conditions known in the literature for special cases of our game.
