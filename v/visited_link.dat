40|$|While much basic {{research}} {{exists on the}} effects of various visual properties on visual search, the application of such research to real-world tasks is lacking. The purpose of this research is to address the lack of empirical validation for design guidelines that affect visual search. One common design element used in Web interface design is link color. The general research question asked is how text color affects visual search. This research demonstrates, with reaction time and eye movement analysis, the dramatic but imperfect control a designer has on guiding the attention of users with text color. Experimental support for the differentiation of <b>visited</b> <b>link</b> colors is presented, along with analyses of the advantages provided by differentiating link colors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a novel algorithm, called FuzzyAntNet inspired by swarm intelligence and optimized by fuzzy systems. FuzzyAntNet {{is a new}} routing algorithm which is constructed by the communication model observed in ant colonies, and enhanced with fuzzy systems. Two special characteristics of this method are scalability to network changes and capability to recognize the best route from source to destination with low delay, traffic and high bandwidth. Using Ants (or agents) in this method cause to avoid congestion in data packet transmission because Ants walk through pathes and intermediate routers and gather information about their delay, congestion and in return, they update the current delay of each <b>visited</b> <b>link</b> and consequently they bring up to date the routing probabilities table for every traversed router. We compare FuzzyAntNet with other routing algorithms such as AntNet and Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV). In all experimental conditions considered, FuzzyAntNet outperforms the competing algorithms, in which the performance is evaluated by standard criteria such as network throughput, End-to-End packet delay, and packet drop ratio...|$|E

This means {{that if there is a}} lot of information on the web about the same topic the author doesn’t have to design the content of a specific course, he can reuse these pages to build his own course, taking the best pages for the concepts he wants to explain. The author can also construct adaptive courses reusing previously non-adaptive ones.

The accuracy of such claims can affect the use of new technologies in leaning. This study examines gender differences in a hypertext environment. The study focuses on text based electronic documents. The study uses the think-aloud method. Forty two participants (30 males & 12 females) read the hypertext and then, all answered the same set of questions. The experimental hypothesis suggests that gender differences on learning, IT literacy, and visuo-spatial abilities might affect hypertext reading. The results show that gender does not influence reading times, comprehension scores, reading strategies, and the amount of <b>visited</b> <b>links.</b> Additionally, coherence, and selection of hyperlink based on their location seem to be equally important for both genders...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{aggregate}} {{and individual}} Web traffic {{has shown that}} PageRank is a poor model of how people navigate the Web. Us-ing the empirical traffic patterns generated by a thousand users, we characterize several properties of Web traffic that cannot be repro-duced by Markovian models. We examine both aggregate statistics capturing collective behavior, such as page and link traffic, and in-dividual statistics, such as entropy and session size. No model cur-rently explains all of these empirical observations simultaneously. We show {{that all of these}} traffic patterns can be explained by an agent-based model that takes into account several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that are used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along <b>visited</b> <b>links,</b> a branch-ing mechanism that also allows us to reproduce behaviors such a...|$|R

PHC is also the major entry point to the total health system [1]. While a common perception is that improved access to PHC can reduce hospitalisations, the evidence has been mixed. Some studies suggest an inverse association between PHC and hospitalisation [2 - 4], with increased number of PHC <b>visits</b> <b>linked</b> to savings in hospitals and improvements in health outcomes [5, 6]. By contrast, other studies have re-ported a positive association, with improved PHC access leading to increased hospital referrals [7, 8].

40|$|Through {{a variety}} of means, {{including}} a range of browser cache methods and inspecting {{the color of a}} visited hyperlink, client-side browser state can be exploited to track users against their wishes. This tracking is possible because persistent, client-side browser state is not properly partitioned on per-site basis in current browsers. We address this problem by refining the general notion of a “same-origin ” policy and implementing two browser extensions that enforce this policy on the browser cache and <b>visited</b> <b>links.</b> We also analyze various degrees of cooperation between sites to track users, and show that even if long-term browser state is properly partitioned, it is still possible for sites to use modern web features to bounce users between sites and invisibly engage in cross-domain tracking of their visitors. Cooperative privacy attacks are an unavoidable consequence of all persistent browser state that affects the behavior of the browser, and disabling or frequently expiring this state {{is the only way to}} achieve true privacy against colluding parties...|$|R
