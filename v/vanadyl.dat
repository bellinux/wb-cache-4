5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The coordination chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the <b>vanadyl</b> center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the <b>vanadyl</b> center). An example is <b>vanadyl</b> acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate <b>vanadyl</b> complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The coordination chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of vanadium is noteworthy for {{the accessibility of}} the four adjacent oxidation states 25.

500|$|The {{coproduction}} of FeCl3 is undesirable, {{which has}} motivated {{the development of}} alternative technologies. Instead of directly using ilmenite, [...] "rutile slag" [...] is used.

2500|$|The {{field of}} organic geochemistry, {{the study of}} the impacts and {{processes}} that organisms have had on the Earth, had its origins in the isolation of porphyrins from petroleum.
