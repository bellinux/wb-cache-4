40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve upon the {{beneficial}} hemodynamic effects observed previously with active compression decompression (ACD) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients in ventricular fibrillation (VF), we tested the hypothesis that intermittant endotracheal tube (ETT) occlusion, performed when not actively ventilating the patient, will increase coronary perfusion by augmenting positive intrathoracic pressures during the compression phase and increasing negative intrathoracic pressures during active decompression. Eight patients undergoing placement of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators received ACD CPR during sustained VF {{in the operating room}} when the initial defibrillator shock failed and while the defibrillator was recharging. When the 1 st shock failed, the ETT was either transiently occluded or remained patent for 10 seconds while ACD CPR was performed. The operator blinded to the status of ETT patency. Mean±SEM arterial (art), right atrial (ra), and coronary perfusion (cpp) pressures (mmHg) during compression and decompression were measured.

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesMechanical {{ventilation}} (MV) {{strategies have}} been modified {{over the last}} decades with a tendency for increasingly lower tidal volumes (VT). However, in patients without acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) the use of high VTs is still very common. Retrospective studies suggest that this practice {{can be related to}} mechanical ventilation-associated ALI. The objective of this review is to search for evidence to guide protective MV in patients with healthy lungs and to suggest strategies to properly ventilate lungs with ALI/ARDS. ContentsA review based on the main articles that focus on the use of strategies of mechanical ventilation was performed. ConclusionsConsistent studies to determine which would {{be the best way to}} <b>ventilate</b> <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> with healthy lungs are lacking. Expert recommendations and current evidence presented in this article indicate that the use of a VT lower than 10 mL. kg− 1, associated with positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥ 5 cmH 2 O without exceeding a pressure plateau of 15 to 20 cmH 2 O could minimize alveolar stretching at the end of inspiration and avoid possible inflammation or alveolar collapse...|$|R

Airway pressures and inspiratory tidal volumes were measured using an ASL- 5000 test lung and a GE Aisys CS(2) near-patient spirometry sensors. In both lung models, the GE Aisys CS(2) APL valves demonstrated non-linear behaviours for airway pressures and for inspiratory tidal volumes, with a sharp increase at set APL pressure levels of 8 - 10  cmH 2 O. With further closure of the GE Aisys CS(2) APL valves up to 20  cmH 2 O, inspiratory tidal volumes decreased to ~ 50 % of the highest values measured. Airway pressures in the Draeger Fabius APL valves demonstrated a near linear increase and decrease. Airway pressure values measured in the Draeger Fabius were never higher than those set by the APL valves, whereas in the GE Aisys CS(2), they considerably exceeded set pressures (by up to 27  cmH 2 O).

Two rat-derived three-dimensional alveolar microstructures obtained from synchrotron-based x-ray tomography are each exposed to a constant potential difference for different states of ventilation in a finite element simulation. While the alveolar wall volume remains constant during stretch, the enclosed air volume varies, similar to the lung volume during ventilation. The enclosed air, serving as insulator in the alveolar ensemble, determines the resulting current and accordingly local tissue bioimpedance. From this we can derive a relationship between lung tissue bioimpedance and regional alveolar ventilation.

30|$|Over {{the last}} decades, nebulized heparin has been safely {{administered}} {{in a number}} of pulmonary conditions [33 – 35]. Studies in healthy volunteers showed nebulized heparin to reach the lower respiratory tract [36], distribute uniformly in the lungs [36], and exert local anticoagulant effects [35]. In line herewith, nebulized heparin attenuated pulmonary coagulopathy in critically ill patients with acute lung injury [37]. Intrapulmonary administered heparin crosses the alveolar membrane into the circulation, being absorbed rapidly and released gradually into the blood [38]. Indeed, there is evidence of a dose-dependent effect of heparin nebulization on plasma levels of aPTT [35, 39], with a threshold dose of 150, 000  IU of heparin resulting in a measurable increase in aPTT [35]. This effect on systemic coagulation does not seem to potentiate the risk of bleedings [39 – 41], suggesting heparin nebulizations to be safe. Nevertheless, data on the feasibility and safety of heparin nebulizations in ventilated patients are scarce [19], and there are very limited data on the use of nebulized anticoagulants in <b>ventilated</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>A</b> systematic review recently showed conflicting effects of nebulized anticoagulation in burn patients with inhalation injury, <b>a</b> <b>patient</b> population in which this intervention is frequently applied [20].

The volume of saline nebulized was unchanged by variations in positive end expiratory pressure from 0 to 5 cm to 10 cm H 2 O, in minute ventilation and in inspiratory flow rate. An increase in the inspiratory time resulted in an increase in the volume of saline nebulized and this volume was greater as the power setting of the nebulizer was increased.

Patients were stratified into two groups based on the difficulty of mask ventilation and the cohorts were analyzed using univariate analysis and stepwise selection method.
