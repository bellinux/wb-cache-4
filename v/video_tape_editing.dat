In 1963, with the introduction of the Ampex Editec, <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> could be <b>edited</b> electronically with a process known as linear video editing by selectively copying (or dubbing) the original footage to another tape called a [...] "master".

There is an explanation of the pre-printed forms used in assembling the script for the news broadcast. Illustrations are offered throughout the paper to help familiarize the intern with newsroom locations and equipment. He is introduced to the technical jargon of the trade. A simplified breakdown of film and <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> shooting and <b>editing</b> techniques is included. There is a discussion of the proper approach to a reporting assignment with details concerning preparation, communications with producers, writing, and final assembly of the video story.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Center for Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Studies and Research (NPS CISR) invites {{experts in the}} field of INFOSEC to NPS to lecture on computer security. Other universities, government, and non-government organizations need similar lectures. Two problems arise: experienced security practitioners are few in number and cannot spend a considerable amount of time on the lecture circuit. Also, for many institutions a regular lecture series would be too costly. To solve these problems a method for mass distribution of the NPS security lectures must be designed. Multi media tools were used to capture INFOSEC lectures for cost effective mass dissemination. By using the appropriate equipment, computer technology, and software, a tool was developed which can distribute security lectures to an unlimited audience in multiple formats. The resulting product is a tutorial to give content providers a technique to take archived <b>video</b> <b>tapes,</b> digitize them, <b>edit</b> them, and export them. These lectures can be delivered in HTML, compact disk, and <b>video</b> <b>taped</b> formats. An analysis of the production process yields a set of recommendations for optimizing the user interface and balancing producer and user requirements such as memory conservation, increased product quality, and accelerated remote delivery[URL]...|$|R

50|$|Students in the Electronic Media Communications {{department}} {{learn how}} to <b>tape</b> <b>video,</b> to <b>edit,</b> to direct, and to produce shows for television, {{many of which are}} broadcast across the campus' television network. Students can choose one of three curricula: television, digital audio, or digital media. The facilities of EMC include a full TV studio with Program Control and Master Control rooms, audio recording rooms, and non-linear editing (NLE) and digital audio workstation (DAW) labs. The EMC program also offers students the opportunity of taking part in its student run internet radio station, known as Supermix. The station follows an alternative and independent rock format and it also includes various specialty shows that range from sports, hip hop, metal, and country. The station also broadcasts Onondaga Lazers home games and. The station is broadcast through its website Supermix.us, iTunes, the campus' television network, and the Tune In app on smart phones.|$|R

50|$|That {{innovation}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} research conducted by CMX, a joint venture of the CBS and Memorex corporations. The intent was to create a much less haphazard method of editing video directly that had all of the creative control of traditional film editing. The result, the CMX 600, accomplished this goal with a two part process. Camera master tapes were dubbed as black and white analog video to very large computer memory discs. The editor could access any shot exactly, and quickly edit a precise black and white, low quality version of the program. More importantly, re-editing was trivial, as no cuts were actually performed. The shots were simply accessed and played in sequence from the disc in real time. The computer kept track of all the numbers in this offline stage of the process, and when the editor was satisfied, output them as an Edit decision list (EDL). This EDL was used in the final stage of the process, the online edit. To make it work, special computer to <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder (VTR) <b>edit</b> interfaces had to be developed, called I-Squareds. Under the control of a computer reading back the EDL and communications protocols, these I-Squareds took control and shuttled the broadcast quality VTRs exactly to the points necessary to record and edit master with exact edits from the source tapes.|$|R

50|$|While {{computer}} based video editing software {{has been adopted}} {{throughout most of the}} commercial, film, industrial and consumer video industries, linear <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>editing</b> is still commonplace in television station newsrooms for the production of television news, and medium-sized production facilities which havenâ€™t made the capital investment in newer technologies. News departments often still use linear editing because they can start editing tape and feeds from the field as soon as received since no additional time is spent capturing material as is necessary in non-linear editing systems and systems that are able to digitally record and edit simultaneously have only recently become affordable for small operations.|$|E
50|$|However, {{sometimes}} editors will (confusingly) use {{the letter}} B to designate time code breaks on a <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b> If there is broken time code on a <b>video</b> <b>tape,</b> {{there will be}} two (or more) instances of a particular time code on the <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b> When re-capturing, it can be ambiguous as to which timecode is the right one. The letter B may indicate that the right time code is from the second set of timecode on the <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the cometary meteoroids was studied by {{closed circuit television}} observing systems. Vidicon cameras produce basic data on standard <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> and enable the recording of the spectra of faint shower meteors, consequently the chemical study is extended to smaller particles {{and we have a}} larger data bank than is available from the more conventional method of recording meteor spectra by photography. The two main problems in using <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> meteor spectrum records are: (1) the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recording has a much lower resolution than the photographic technique; (2) <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> is relatively new type of data storage in astronomy and the methods of quantitative photometry have not yet been fully developed in the various fields where <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> is used. The use of the most detailed photographic meteor spectra to calibrate the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> records and to make positive identification of the more prominent chemical elements appearing in the spectra may solve the low resolution problem. Progress in the development of standard photometric techniques for the analysis of <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> records of meteor spectra is reported...|$|R
