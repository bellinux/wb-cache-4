25|$|The Claisen {{rearrangement}} (not to {{be confused}} with the Claisen condensation) is a powerful carbon–carbon bond-forming chemical reaction discovered by Rainer Ludwig Claisen. The heating of an allyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> will initiate a -sigmatropic rearrangement to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{process is}} {{demonstrated}} in Wiesner’s synthesis of 13-desoxydelphinone (Scheme c). The {{first step of}} this synthesis is the generation of a conjugated dienone 112 from 111 in 4 steps. This {{is followed by the}} addition of a benzyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> to produce 113. In 11 steps, this compound is converted to ketal 114. The addition of heat, DMSO and o-xylene rearranges this ketol (115), and after 5 more steps (±)-13-desoxydelphinone (15) is formed.|$|E
25|$|Co-polymerizing {{chlorotrifluoroethylene}} or tetrafluoroethylene with {{vinyl ethers}} containing hydroxyalkyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> produces fluorinated (FEVE) polyols. Two-component fluorinated polyurethanes prepared by reacting FEVE fluorinated polyols with polyisocyanate {{have been used}} to make ambient cure paints and coatings. Since fluorinated polyurethanes contain a high percentage of fluorine–carbon bonds, which are the strongest bonds among all chemical bonds, fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit resistance to UV, acids, alkali, salts, chemicals, solvents, weathering, corrosion, fungi and microbial attack. These have been used for high performance coatings and paints.|$|E
40|$|Claisen rearrangements of benzyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers</b> {{are much}} less facile than those of {{aliphatic}} allyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers,</b> and their synthetic utility has remained relatively unexplored. A one-pot procedure is reported for the generation and Claisen rearrangement of benzyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers</b> that contain an activating α-alkoxy substituent on the vinyl group.

40|$|Initially the perfluoroacylation of a {{range of}} commercially {{available}} <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers</b> and conversion of the resulting perfluoroacylated enol ethers to 1 -H-pyrazoles via reaction with hydrazine is reported. The selective synthesis {{of a range}} of alpha-aryl <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers</b> using Heck chemistry is then reported. Subsequent perfluoroacylations of the <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers</b> followed by reaction of the resulting perfluoroacyl enol ethers with hydrazine affords a range of 5 -aryl- 3 -perfluoroalkyl pyrazoles in good yields.;Alternative methodology for the synthesis of 5 -aryl- 3 -perfluoroalkyl pyrazoles is then described in which resin bound esters are converted to <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers</b> <via a Tebbe reaction. Subsequent perfluoroacylations generate the expected resin bound perfluoroacyl enol ethers and cleavage with cyclisation with hydrazine liberates the desired pyrazoles in acceptable yields for this type of methodology. Finally the microwave mediated Suzuki coupling of 4 -iodo- 1 -methyl- 3 -trifluoromethyl- 1 -H-pyrazole with various boronic acids is reported as a general way in which 4 -substituted- 3 -perfluoroalkyl-pyrazoles can be synthesised rapidly in reasonable yields...|$|R
500|$|Discovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig Claisen, the Claisen {{rearrangement}} is {{the first}} recorded example of a -sigmatropic rearrangement.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The synthesis, characterization, and {{reactivity}} of alternating copolymers of maleic anhydride (MA) with new <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethers</b> of mono-O-methyl oligoethylene glycol (MePegnVE, degree of oligomerization = 1 - 4) are described. The linear MA/PegnVE copolymers were partially esterified with alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-butanol, methoxyethanol, and n-dodecanol.

50|$|Overall, vinyl ether’s only {{strengths}} {{compared to}} ethyl ether are favorable induction and recovery. During anesthesia <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> has no particularly wonderful properties and {{is harder to}} control than other agents. Therefore, <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> was commonly used as a preliminary anesthetic before administration of diethyl ether. Additionally, <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> was only used for short operations or analgesia, e.g. dentistry and obstetrics. <b>Vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> was used infrequently for long operations because of toxicity, cost, and superior alternatives.|$|E

50|$|Much to {{the dismay}} of some pharmacologists, the {{synthesis}} and isolation of pure <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> proved to be a difficult challenge for chemists; <b>vinyl</b> <b>ether</b> was suspected to be a nearly ideal anesthetic as its structure was the combination of an alkene and an ether.
