50|$|These {{models can}} be {{classified}} as Superstrats, although their design does not include features popular in this genre, such as pointier body horns, deeper cutaways a double-locking vibrato. They are equipped with locking tuners, an HSS pickup configuration, a graphite nut and the VSC active preamp/EQ. Furthermore, their controls consist of one <b>volume</b> <b>potentiometer</b> (with coil-split for the bridge humbucker) and a master tone potentiometer.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A diagram {{showing the}} wiring of a Gibson Les Paul {{electric}} guitar. Shown are the humbucker pickups with individual tone and volume controls (T and V, respectively), 3-way pickup selector switch, tone capacitors that form a passive low-pass filter, the output jack and connections between those components. The top right shows a modification that allows both pickups {{to have their}} volumes adjusted independently when the selector switch {{is in the middle}} position: the two bottom connections are simply swapped on each <b>volume</b> <b>potentiometer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Most basses have a <b>volume</b> <b>potentiometer</b> ("pot" [...] or [...] "knob"), {{which can}} be turned up or down, and a tone potentiometer, which rolls off the high {{frequencies}} when it is turned to the player's right. Some basses may also have a pickup selector control or switch, to select single-coil or humbucking pickups. Since the 1980s, basses are often available with battery-powered [...] "active" [...] electronics that boost the signal with a preamplifier and provide equalization controls to boost or cut bass and treble frequencies, or both. Some expensive basses have even more equalization options, such as bass, middle and treble.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final stages}} of {{on-board}} sound-shaping circuitry are the <b>volume</b> control (<b>potentiometer)</b> and tone control (which [...] "rolls off" [...] the treble frequencies). Where there are individual volume controls for different pickups, and where pickup signals can be combined, they would affect the timbre of the final sound by adjusting the balance between pickups from a straight 50:50.|$|R

5000|$|Plate {{detector}} circuits usually lack an A.V.C. bias circuit. In receivers {{equipped with}} A.V.C., volume levels are adjusted by a potentiometer (typically 500 kΩ to 2 MΩ audio taper) that controls audio signal levels at the control grid of the A.F. amplifier. In receivers not equipped with A.V.C., {{the most common}} connection of the <b>volume</b> control <b>potentiometer</b> (typically 4 kΩ to 15 kΩ linear taper) is as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|A guitar tech {{is often}} a [...] "jack of all trades" [...] {{when it comes to}} making simple repairs. As such, a guitar tech can often {{resolder}} a loose wiring connection inside a guitar <b>volume</b> <b>potentiometer,</b> replace an amplifier tube, swap out a damaged speaker for a new one, stick a loose wooden part on an acoustic guitar, or adjust a misaligned neck with an allen key. In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is often responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up the item(s), the guitar tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.|$|E
5000|$|The Tweed Deluxe {{is almost}} always used in {{conjunction}} with a late-1950s Magnatone 280 (similar to the amplifier used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a <b>volume</b> <b>potentiometer</b> and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on [...] "See the Sky About to Rain". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an effects pedal. Tom Wheeler's book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.|$|E
30|$|Pickup {{signals are}} fed to the {{amplifier}} section, {{which also includes}} tone controls and a <b>volume</b> <b>potentiometer.</b> The amplifier schematic is publicly available [36], {{and it has been}} used to gather a basic understanding of its functioning. Some of the components, such as the tone controls and the transistors, have been isolated to conduct simulations and obtain an estimate of the frequency response by means of an electric circuit simulator.|$|E
5000|$|Another common {{feature on}} Caparison Guitars {{has been the}} use of [...] "Push/Push" [...] <b>volume</b> and tone <b>potentiometers.</b> These special [...] "pots" [...] are used to {{activate}} coil splitting and pickup selecting functions on certain models.|$|R
5000|$|The {{controls}} {{include a}} Master <b>Volume</b> (Push-Pull <b>Potentiometer</b> to switch between Active Mode and Passive Mode), Pickup Balance, Tone Blend (only {{available in the}} passive mode), a Dual Potentiometer for High Cut and Boost (on Top) and for Mid Cut and Boost (Ring) (only available in active mode), a Dual Potentiometer for Bass Cut and Boost (on Top) and Mid Frequency (Ring)(only available in active mode), Coil Switches for each MASTER BAR Pickup if installed (Up = Humbucker / Down = [...] "Humbucking" [...] Single Coil) and an Output Jack with integrated Power Switch.|$|R
50|$|The FHC-B has a 12 cable but no volume control, and was {{commonly}} sold with {{a volume}} pedal. The FHC-C has a <b>volume</b> control (<b>potentiometer)</b> {{in a small}} box on the cable, 10 inches from the pickup. Many felt that clamping the rod to the strings helped sustain and tone, as the entire unit vibrates {{in concert with the}} strings—and provided a good ground connection to reduce hum. A better ground is achieved by clamping the rod to the strings and using the players body as a ground while playing. This grounding method is still used today on most electric guitars.|$|R
50|$|The Lead Series use 250 kΩ <b>volume</b> {{and tone}} <b>potentiometers</b> and use 0.05 µF tone capacitors.The body is usually made of 3 pieces of either alder or ash while the necks are maple with a walnut 'skunk stripe' {{on their backs}} and a {{matching}} plug {{on the face of}} the headstock covering the end of the truss rod.|$|R
5000|$|As a result, the faders (potentiometers {{that operate}} by sliding up or down) or <b>volume</b> {{controls}} (rotary <b>potentiometers)</b> on the mixing board or audio processor gradually [...] "creep" [...] toward the maximum volume setting, which reduces {{the ability to}} manipulate the relative volumes between channels. It can also result in clipping or distortion of the master mix, which is when the overall volume of sound is too great for the equipment or recording medium intended to hold it.|$|R
50|$|The first {{specially}} built electric violins {{date back}} to the late 1930s and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, Benjamin Miessner, George Beauchamp, Hugo Benioff and Fredray Kislingbury. The majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz and popular music. Electric violins typically have piezoelectric transducer pickups and/or magnetic pickups built into the body of the instrument. Like an electric guitar, an electric violin may also have <b>volume</b> and tone <b>potentiometer</b> knobs for controlling the sound of the instrument.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} load usually consists of resistance (the <b>volume</b> and tone <b>potentiometer</b> in the guitar, and any resistance to {{ground at the}} amplifier input) and capacitance between the hot lead and shield in the guitar cable. The electric cable also has a capacitance, {{which can be a}} significant portion of the overall system capacitance. This arrangement of passive components forms a resistively-damped second-order low-pass filter. Pickups are usually designed to feed a high input impedance, typically a megohm or more, and a low impedance load reduces the high-frequency response of the pickup because of the filtering effect of the inductance.|$|R
5000|$|The JR-200 {{was capable}} of {{producing}} {{a wide range of}} sounds. The JR-200 had a general purpose timer - I/O chip, with three of the timer outputs being hooked up to generate square wave tones. The Basic supported the sound capabilities with commands ranging from a simple BEEP command (BEEP 1 producing an 880 Hz [...] "middle octave A" [...] sound), to the SOUND (f, d) command which took two numerical parameters for frequency and duration, and the PLAY and TEMPO commands which could take multiple commands to play a tone over a 5-octave range, and played them in the background while the Basic program continued. Clever use of the three square wave voices could be used to generate a range of other sounds, such as explosions. A keystroke could be accompanied by an audible feedback signal. Audio was output from an RCA (Tulip) connector onto which an eight ohm speaker could be directly connected, but the JR-200 also had a small built-in speaker. On the back of the device there was a <b>volume</b> control <b>potentiometer</b> that controlled both the internal and external speaker.|$|R
5000|$|A {{defining}} attribute {{largely responsible}} for the 5150 sound is the fixed bias. Commonly described analog a car engine and its respective idle, the 5150 bias was set to a lower value (lower engine [...] "idle") which resulted in the Power Tubes running at a lower energy commonly known as [...] "cold-biased." [...] While the electrical theory behind this can easily be examined and theoreticized, the 5150 and its configuration resulted in a more controllable gain setting (ie. having a more forgiving sonic range than similarly [...] "hot-biased" [...] configurations. This engineering choice set the 5150 up to intrinsically sound its best with minimal augmentation. Since tube-amps are still uncontested in music amplification as far as tonal quality is concerned, (see hard-clipping) the optimal setting for tubes are when they are pushed to natural distortion (ie. Increases in [...] "volume" [...] or Bells(dB).) Thus, by allowing such a heavy amount of gain to be applied without sacrificing tonal definition, the amplifier could then be pushed due to the [...] "colder" [...] biasing requiring more current, versus a [...] "hotter" [...] setting from the beginning (<b>volume</b> knob or <b>potentiometer</b> knob [...] "value of 1.") ...|$|R
