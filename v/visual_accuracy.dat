500|$|Following {{the example}} of his mentor, T. W. Robertson, Gilbert strove {{to ensure that the}} costumes and sets were as {{realistic}} as possible. When preparing the sets for H.M.S. Pinafore, Gilbert and Sullivan visited Portsmouth in April 1878 to inspect ships. Gilbert made sketches of H.M.S. Victory and H.M.S. St Vincent and created a model set for the carpenters to work from. This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, in which naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and in which most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged. This attention to detail was typical of Gilbert's stage management and would be repeated in all of his Savoy Operas. Gilbert's focus on <b>visual</b> <b>accuracy</b> provided a [...] "right-side-up for topsy-turvydom", that is, a realistic point of reference that serves to heighten the whimsicality and absurdity of the situations. Sullivan was [...] "in the full swing" [...] of work on the piece by the middle of April 1878. The bright and cheerful music of Pinafore was composed during a time when Sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone. The cast began music rehearsals on 24 April, and at the beginning of May 1878, the two collaborators worked closely together at Sullivan's flat to finalise the piece.|$|E

The subjects of this research were 87 students of the Faculty of Psychology Ahmad Dahlan University.

Product moment's correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between score of EAS 4 <b>visual</b> speed and <b>accuracy</b> test and score of clerical speed and accuracy test (D 4). The result of this research shows that there was a significant correlation (r= 0, 591; p= 0, 000) between score of EAS 4 <b>visual</b> speed and <b>accuracy</b> test and score of clerical speed and accuracy test (D 4).

The present paper extends these models for <b>visual</b> search <b>accuracy</b> to multidimensional search displays in which the target differs from the distractors along more than one feature dimension (conjunction, disjunction, and triple conjunction displays). The model assumes that each element in the display elicits a noisy representation for each of the relevant feature dimensions.

The model accurately predicts human experimental data on <b>visual</b> search <b>accuracy</b> in conjunctions and disjunctions of contrast and orientation.

50|$|Invisible {{details such as}} {{wiring and}} {{electronics}} do not affect the <b>visual</b> <b>accuracy</b> of the prop, {{as long as the}} effects those components are responsible for producing are identical to that of the original. Blinking lights and illuminated buttons appear everywhere from the bridge of the Enterprise to Darth Vader's belt, and attempting to faithfully reproduce the exact circuit boards and lamps is in most cases impossible or impractical. This is particularly true for older films. Similarly, mechanical effects and even the choice of materials often boils down to practicality and the purpose of the prop rather than close attention to detail.

40|$|Axonal injury after {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) may cause impaired sensory integration. We aim {{to determine the effects}} of childhood TBI on visual integration in relation to general neurocognitive functioning. We compared children aged 6 - 13 diagnosed with TBI (n = 103; M = 1. 7 years post-injury) to children with traumatic control (TC) injury (n = 44). Three TBI severity groups were distinguished: mild TBI without risk factors for complicated TBI (mildRF- TBI, n = 22), mild TBI with ≥ 1 risk factor (mildRF+ TBI, n = 46) or moderate/severe TBI (n = 35). An experimental paradigm measured speed and accuracy of goal-directed behavior depending on: (1) visual identification; (2) visual localization; or (3) both, measuring visual integration. Group-differences on reaction time (RT) or accuracy were tracked down to task strategy, visual processing efficiency and extra-decisional processes (e. g. response execution) using diffusion model analysis. General neurocognitive functioning was measured by a Wechsler Intelligence Scale short form. The TBI group had poorer <b>accuracy</b> of <b>visual</b> identification and visual integration than the TC group (Ps ≤. 03; ds ≤ - 0. 40). Analyses differentiating TBI severity revealed that <b>visual</b> identification <b>accuracy</b> was impaired in the moderate/severe TBI group (P =. 05, d = - 0. 50) and that <b>visual</b> integration <b>accuracy</b> was impaired in the mildRF+ TBI group and moderate/severe TBI group (Ps <. 02, ds ≤ - 0. 56).

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the ability of POP to differentiate malignant from benign diseases of the PD. Methods Patients who underwent POP between 2000 and 2013 for {{the evaluation}} of indeterminate PD strictures, dilatations, or with suspected or known main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm were identified. Main outcome measurements were <b>visual</b> impression <b>accuracy,</b> POP tissue sampling, efficacy, and safety of POP. Results During the study period, 79 patients who underwent POP for the evaluation of pancreatic stricture or dilatation were identified. Technical success was achieved in 78 (97 %). In the PD neoplasia group (n = 33), the final diagnosis was based on index confirmatory POP-guided tissue sampling in 29 (88 %). For the detection of PD neoplasia, POP visual impression had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 87 %, 86 %, 83 %, 91 %, and 87 %, respectively. When combined with POP-guided tissue sampling, the values were 91 %, 95 %, 94 %, 93 %, and 94 %, respectively. Of 102 POPs performed, adverse events were noted in 12 (12 %) cases.

30|$|These {{studies are}} the first to examine the <b>accuracy</b> of <b>visual</b> search {{performance}} for faces using images that have natural variations in appearance. When faces were unfamiliar to the viewer, performance was extremely poor. When searching for an unfamiliar target face among 19 distractors, participants chose the wrong face on approximately half of all trials. This is surprisingly poor accuracy, especially considering that the distractor faces were not chosen to be similar to the target face and even included faces of the opposite sex (men as distractors for female targets and vice versa).

30|$|The PPMI {{data were}} split into {{training}} and test subsets {{in such a way}} as to skew the test data towards more difficult cases.

PD patients for whom the SPECT scan was normal or equivocal were excluded from the database. This screened collection of data was therefore likely to be associated with higher <b>visual</b> reporting <b>accuracy</b> as compared to the local clinical data. To counteract this bias, more challenging cases were preferentially selected for the test set, using striatal binding ratio results as a surrogate marker of the likely difficulty in classifying the data.|$|R
