5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal <b>variations</b> <b>on</b> the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and {{the largest of the}} four terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|In {{this section}} Tolkien {{describes}} <b>variations</b> <b>on</b> the basic patterns. For example, dips (between lifts) were usually monosyllabic, {{but the number}} of syllables was not limited by Old English metre, so a series of weak syllables was permitted in a half-line. Other variations included breaking a lift into two syllables, the first short but stressed, the second weak, with for instance 'vĕssel' in place of 'boat'.|$|E

5|$|Limited {{access to}} life outside the clinic {{resulted}} in a shortage of subject matter. Van Gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artist's paintings, such as Millet's The Sower and Noonday Rest, and <b>variations</b> <b>on</b> his own earlier work. Van Gogh was an admirer of the Realism of Jules Breton, Gustave Courbet and Millet, and he compared his copies to a musician's interpreting Beethoven.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, {{does not}} rise to {{the same level of}} {{inspiration}} as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to {{bring out the best in}} him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of <b>variations</b> <b>on</b> less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.|$|E

Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E

5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma.

The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as <b>variations</b> <b>on</b> the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E
