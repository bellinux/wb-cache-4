5000|$|A <b>vostro</b> <b>account</b> {{will be in}} {{the local}} {{currency}} of the bank where the money is being held i.e. it is the bank in Country B's record of the money kept by the bank from country A with it.|$|E
50|$|A {{correspondent}} account is an account (often called a nostro or <b>vostro</b> <b>account)</b> established by a banking institution to receive deposits from, make payments on behalf of, or handle other financial transactions for another financial institution. Correspondent accounts are established through bilateral agreements {{between the two}} banks.|$|E
50|$|A bank counts a {{nostro account}} with a debit balance as a cash asset in its balance sheet. Conversely, a <b>vostro</b> <b>account</b> {{with a credit}} balance (i.e. a deposit) is a liability, and a vostro with a debit balance (a loan) is an asset. Thus in many banks a credit entry on an account ("CR") is {{regarded}} as negative movement, and a debit ("DR") is positive - the reverse of usual commercial accounting conventions.|$|E
50|$|The {{controlling}} shareholder {{of the bank}} is SCM Finance (92.24% of shares), which is 100% owned by SCM Group. FUIB holds nostro accounts with 37 banks, while 61 banks hold <b>vostro</b> <b>accounts</b> with FUIB.|$|R
50|$|A <b>vostro</b> <b>account</b> is {{the same}} as any other bank account. It is a record of money held by a bank or owed to a bank by a third party (an {{individual}}, company or bank). The nostro account is a way of the bank whose money it is, keeping track of how much is being held by the other bank. It is similar to an individual keeping a detailed record of every payment {{in and out of his}} or her bank account so that she/he knows the balance at any point in time.|$|E
5000|$|For example: First National Bank of A {{does some}} {{transactions}} (loans, foreign exchange, etc.) in USD, but banks in A will only handle payments in AUD. So FNB of A opens a USD account at foreign bank Credit Mutuel de B, and instructs all counter-parties to settle transactions in USD at [...] "account no. 123456 {{in name of}} FNBA, at CMB, X Branch". FNBA maintains its own records of that account, for reconciliation; this is its nostro account. CMB's record of the same account is the <b>vostro</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E
