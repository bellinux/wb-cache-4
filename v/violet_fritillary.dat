50|$|Boloria dia, the Weaver's {{fritillary}} or <b>violet</b> <b>fritillary,</b> is {{a butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. Its English name, after an insect dealer, Richard Weaver, {{comes from his}} capture of an insect early in the 19th century at Sutton Park, Tamworth. However this and {{the small number of}} other English specimens are thought to be of introductions, possibly accidental.|$|E
