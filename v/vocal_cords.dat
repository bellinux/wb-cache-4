5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound {{because of the}} lack of a melon and <b>vocal</b> <b>cords.</b> In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to <b>vocal</b> <b>cords.</b> They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular <b>vocal</b> <b>cords</b> of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E

40|$|<b>Vocal</b> <b>cord</b> palsy {{can have}} myriad causes. Unilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> palsy is common and {{frequently}} asymptomatic. Trauma, head, neck and mediastinal tumors {{as well as}} cerebrovascular accidents have been implicated in causing unilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> palsy. Viral neuronitis accounts for most idiopathic cases. Bilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> palsy, on the other hand, is much less common and is a potentially life-threatening condition. Myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder caused by antibodies targeting the post-synaptic acetylcholine receptor, has been infrequently implicated in its causation. We report here a case of bilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> palsy developing in a 68 -year-old man with no prior history of myasthenia gravis 2 months after he was operated on for diverticulitis of the large intestine. Delay in considering the diagnosis led to endotracheal intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation with attendant complications.

5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the <b>vocal</b> <b>cords.</b> If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundEspecially {{because of}} {{improvements}} in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia {{has become the}} technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations {{where there is a}} pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> function to better understand its possible consequences. MethodsThis prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. <b>Vocal</b> <b>cord</b> function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic. ResultsAll patients had normal <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43 %) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis. It resolved in all cases ≤ 24 hours. There {{were no significant differences in}} operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis compared with those without. ConclusionLocal anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3 %), a preoperative evaluation of <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered...|$|R

After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public.

5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the <b>vocal</b> <b>cords.</b> The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} whether {{the timing of}} early (6 months from time of nerve injury) vs. late (> 6 months) injection medialization laryngoplasty impacts the need for subsequent open-neck recon-struction to restore vocal function in patients with unilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: A total of 112 outpatient or hospital-ized adults with dysphonia resulting from postsurgi-cal or idiopathic unilateral <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis were identified who were injected as initial treatment within 1 year of onset of their paralysis. All subjects underwent awake, transoral, paraglottic injection with absorbable hyaluronic-acid gel. Patients with documented recovery of <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> mobility (22), active disease directly affecting the recurrent laryn-geal nerve (8), 6 months postparalysis) avoided phonosurgical recon-struction (P. 03, v 2 test). Conclusions: Patients receiving early injection medialization for <b>vocal</b> <b>cord</b> paralysis {{were less likely to}} require transcervical reconstruction.
