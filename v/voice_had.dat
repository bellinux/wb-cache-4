5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E
5|$|The last squeaky {{wheel in}} the City Council had been greased. The last {{independent}} <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> joined the chorus...Shiller's endorsement of Daley {{is all the}} more amazing when you look at where she started, about as close to a Marxist as you'd ever find at City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{received}} the film's script while dubbing for Dookudu (2011), {{but due to}} that commitment took ten days to finish reading the script. He {{said in an interview}} that he could maintain the consistency in the character only because of the fewer working days. Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E

5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{announced}} their intentions to develop The Incredibles 2 in March 2014. Bird returned to direct {{and write the}} screenplay. Nelson, Hunter, Vowell, Jackson, and Bird will also return to voice their characters, while Dash will now be voiced by Huck Milner as Fox's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deepened in the intervening years. The film will follow immediately {{from the end of}} The Incredibles with the Parrs facing the Underminer. The film will focus on Holly Hunter's character, Elastigirl. Originally, The Incredibles 2 was to be released on June 21, 2019 as Pixar's next film after Toy Story 4. Due to delays on that title, Pixar swapped the releases, and currently The Incredibles 2 is set for release on June 15, 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Ian Gillan {{announced}} the band would fold, as {{he needed to}} rest his damaged vocal cords. The tone and style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned. His <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> a more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day. His use of multi-tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent. The rest of the band Gillan, particularly McCoy and Towns, were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic, and sued Gillan for royalties.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
25|$|A few {{shows were}} {{cancelled}} initially as vocalist Gary Lightbody's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> worn out. He had been advised by his doctor {{to take a}} week's rest before the tour as he had developed laryngitis (polyps on vocal cords), but he preferred not to because of the pre-booked tour. Tests later showed that Lightbody's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> not healed at all, {{he had lost his}} top range, and the band was forced to cancel all remaining shows. The initially cancelled shows were re-scheduled {{to the end of the}} tour. Lightbody credited the band's agent and managers for their quick work.|$|E
25|$|By early 1946, Curly's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> {{become even}} more coarse than before, and it was {{increasingly}} {{difficult for him to}} remember even the simplest dialogue. He had lost a considerable amount of weight, and lines had creased his face.|$|E

25|$|In 1990 the {{celebrations}} of her 50th career anniversary {{started with a}} major concert in Lisbon's Coliseu dos Recreios {{at the age of}} 69. She was decorated by the President of the Republic on stage. Her <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> changed: it was lower but intense.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} was short-lived but {{was followed by}} the 1974 original London production of The Good Companions, alongside John Mills, Judi Dench and Christopher Gable in which she played Susie Dean, a member of a touring concert party. She was flown to Manchester to join the show during its tryout when the original actress Celia Bannerman, whose <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> proved unsuitable for the role, left the production.|$|E
25|$|When his {{contract}} with Wilson expired in 1927, Canutt was making appearances at rodeos across the country. By 1928, the talkies were coming out, and {{though he had been}} in 48 silent pictures, Canutt knew his career was in trouble. His <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> been damaged from flu in the Navy. He started taking on bit parts and stunts, and realized more could be done with action in pictures.|$|E

25|$|With Britten, Pears was {{a co-founder}} of the Aldeburgh Festival in 1947 and the Britten-Pears School in 1972. After Britten died in 1976, Pears {{remained}} {{an active participant in}} the festival and the school, where he was director of singing. His own <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> a distinctive timbre, not to all tastes, but such was his musical skill that he could use the voice to good effect in many styles of music.|$|E
25|$|Xfinity Voice (formerly Comcast Digital Voice) is a {{landline}} {{telephone service}} that {{was launched in}} 2005 in select markets, and to all of Comcast's markets in 2006. Comcast's older service, Comcast Digital Phone, continued to offer service for a brief period, until Comcast shut it down around late 2007. In 2009, after completing transition from their old service, Comcast had 7.6 million voice customers. As {{of the end of}} 2013, Comcast Digital <b>Voice</b> <b>had</b> reached 10.7 million subscribers.|$|E
25|$|Modern gay icons in {{entertainment}} include both film stars and musicians, {{most of whom}} have strong, distinctive personalities, and many of whom died young or under tragic circumstances. For example, Greek-American opera singer Maria Callas—who reached her peak in the 1950s—became a gay icon because the uniquely compelling qualities of her stage performances were allied to a tempestuous private life, a sequence of unhappy love affairs, and a lonely premature death in Paris after her <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> deserted her.|$|E

25|$|While {{the ensuing}} Reunion tour with all seven Temptations (Ruffin, Kendricks, Otis Williams, Franklin, Edwards, Richard Street, and Glenn Leonard) was financially successful, {{it ended up}} being a {{stressful}} venture. Kendricks' <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> weakened after decades of chain smoking, Ruffin, still addicted to drugs, missed {{a number of the}} performances due to being incapacitated, and current group members Dennis Edwards and Glenn Leonard were causing problems. At the conclusion of the Reunion tour, Ruffin and Kendricks were dismissed, and they began touring and performing together as a duo.|$|E
25|$|With Charlotte in Werther in 1974, Crespin began {{performing}} opera roles {{from the}} mezzo-soprano repertoire {{to adjust to}} the change in her voice. However the timbre of her <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> not altered much from her earlier singing years and she therefore brought a different sound to the roles from that of the typical mezzo-soprano. Regardless, she was well received in her new choice of repertoire. This period also led to her interest in Offenbach and her sophisticated wit found its place in recordings of Métella, the Grand Duchess of Gérolstein and Périchole, along with Dulcinée (Massenet's Don Quichotte).|$|E
25|$|Goodbye and Hello, {{released}} in 1967, featured late 1960s-style poetry and songs in different timings {{and was an}} ambitious release for the then-20-year-old Buckley. Reflecting the confidence Elektra had in Buckley and group, they were given free rein on the music {{and content of the}} album. Beckett continued as lyricist and the album consisted of half Buckley originals and half Beckett–Buckley collaborations. Critics noted the improved lyrical and melodic qualities of Buckley's music. Buckley's <b>voice</b> <b>had</b> also developed since the last release and the press appreciated both his lower register and higher falsetto in equal measure.|$|E
