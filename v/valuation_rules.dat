40|$|No {{issue has}} been the subject of greater debate among both {{practicing}} and academic accountants than asset valuation (and hence income measurement). The debate on this {{issue has been}} going on for over 50 years (e. g., Paton [1922] and Canning [1929]) and, at times, at a high level of intensity. The primary issue is whether historical cost of assets should be adjusted for price changes and, if so, how. Following Ijiri's [1967; 1968] characterization of <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> as linear aggregation functions. Sunder [1978] developed a scheme of algebraic representation of <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> (e. g., historical cost, general price-level-adjusted, current value, etc.) as a function ofthe set of price indexes used to adjust the historical data. A mean-squared difference between current and an estimated value of baskets of assets summarizes the ability of various <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> to approximate current value. This mean-squared difference is an inverse measure of accuracy of <b>valuation</b> <b>rules,</b> and some of its mathematical properties were derived by Sunder [1978]. In this paper we first derive additivity as another important mathematical property of the accuracy of <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> and then present an unbiased statistical estimator of accuracy. These analytical results enable us to conduct empirical estimations of accuracy of <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> using the Producer Price Index data base in Sunder and Waymire [1983].

40|$|Most {{models of}} animal {{foraging}} and consumer choice assume that individuals make choices {{based on the}} absolute value of items and are therefore ‘economically rational’. However, frequent violations of rationality by animals, including humans, suggest that animals use comparative <b>valuation</b> <b>rules.</b> Are comparative valuation strategies {{a consequence of the}} way brains process information, or are they an intrinsic feature of biological decision-making? Here, we examine the principles of rationality in an organism with radically different information-processing mechanisms: the brainless, unicellular, slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We offered P. polycephalum amoebas a choice between food options that varied in food quality and light exposure (P. polycephalum is photophobic). The use of an absolute valuation rule will lead to two properties: transitivity and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Transitivity is satisfied if preferences have a consistent, linear ordering, while IIA states that a decision maker's preference for an item should not change if the choice set is expanded. A violation of either of these principles suggests the use of comparative rather than absolute <b>valuation</b> <b>rules.</b> Physarum polycephalum satisfied transitivity by having linear preference rankings. However, P. polycephalum's preference for a focal alternative increased when a third, inferior quality option was added to the choice set, thus violating IIA and suggesting the use of a comparative valuation process. The discovery of comparative <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> in a unicellular organism suggests that comparative <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> are ubiquitous, if not universal, among biological decision makers...|$|E

The {{literature on the}} intersection of these rules has identified, on the one hand, the potential for double taxation and, on the other hand, exploitation {{of the differences in}} these regimes by taxpayers. After identifying the obstacles to harmonisation of customs valuation and transfer pricing rules and the opportunities for applying these rules in a harmonised way (in order to manage the risks associate with these rules), this mini-dissertation critically analyses the South African income tax and customs legislation and evaluates it by way of a case study based on the author?s recent experience. This analysis and case study illustrates that in general transfer pricing documentation cannot be used to show that the transaction value of the imported goods is arm?s length and that the prospects for harmonisation of transfer pricing and customs <b>valuation</b> <b>rules</b> in South Africa are poor. The means of managing the transfer pricing and customs valuation risks identified in the existing literature and the case study are further analysed to identify whether they are feasible in South Africa. It is established that importers should incorporate information relevant to customs authorities in their transfer pricing documentation and use provisional declarations where future transfer pricing adjustments are expected. The importer should also evaluate its transfer prices continually in order to avoid year-end transfer pricing adjustments. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|The Socialist Republic of Vietnam {{committed}} to bring its laws, regulations and administrative procedures into conformity with the WTO rules-based trading agreements and to honour its obligations {{with respect to}} development {{of the rule of}} law. This study examines the areas of friction that Vietnam is likely to encounter as it implements the WTO legal regime. It hypothesised that a smooth transfer and adaptation of the Western-based customs regime requires Vietnamese recipients to understand and support principles of transparency and liberalisation of the WTO that differ from socialist principles underlying the Vietnameselegal system. Having adopted a social construction view, this study of national interpretation assumed that state actors of Vietnam were not passive receivers of the WTO customs rules but rather constructed the meaning given to the global rules. Discourse analysis was proved as the suitable methodology since Party and State’s understandings about the WTO customs regime were largely generated through communicative processes. The three streams of discourse modes, interpretive communities and discursive strategies were tested to assess the WTO-related regulatory conversations within and amongst groups of domestic implementers at different state levels: the Party and State’s high policy making, customs lawmaking central level, and the law implementation local level. The principal conclusion reached was that the transfer of WTO principal rules in Vietnam is difficult because political leaders, lawmakers and government officials at different state levels did not fully understand and interpret the WTO basic objectives. The domestic reforms toward the Western rule of law revealed the biggest complication of the prevailing socialist constraints of party leadership and power concentration. These political contradictions prevent the Party and State leaders to interpret the WTO principles of economic law and the liberalisation objectives that presented a slow shift from the Soviet-originated thinking of state economic management to the Western thinking of free market access. Another conclusion was that the Party and State’s interpretations of the WTO objectives shaped the Customs’ cognitive assumptions and allowed customs lawmakers and regulators to reinterpret and reformulate the WTO customs rules. The repetitive customs law making discourse did not result in a smooth transfer of the WTO-WCO customs rules because of the incompatible high political level thinking and the Customs’ reinterpretations and reformulation. The results also revealed that power structures and cognitive assumptions in Customs shaped the implementation of the imported customs regimes, especially when the WTO <b>valuations</b> <b>rules</b> were reinterpreted by customs regulators for the daily application. Though customs administrators and judges wanted to promote an effective and efficient customs administration to approach the WTO objectives, there still existed discrepancies in the administrative and judiciary interpretations of the WTO legality requirement...|$|R
