We also compared the relative stride length and the duty factor of the juveniles with respect to adults at three equivalent trotting speeds (Froude numbers 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0), to determine dynamic similarity. Juveniles had a negative allometry in their leg bones, mainly because of little size changes of the distal portions. The negative allometry of extremities allows juveniles to increase stride length without increasing step frequency, which can be biomechanically advantageous. The Froude number during the walk–trot <b>velocity</b> <b>transition</b> of juveniles {{was similar to that}} of adult horses, but walk–trot transition velocity in juveniles was greater than expected for their mass. However, during the change trot–gallop, the trot–gallop <b>velocity</b> <b>transition</b> was conserved, but the Froude number was lower. Thus, juvenile horses did not move in a manner that was dynamically similar to the adult horses. At low speed (walk–trot), the gait approaches the behavior predicted by the inverted pendulum model, but at high speed (trot–gallop) dominates the inertial forces. The trot–gallop gait change would be conducted at speeds that would minimize energy costs of transport owing to collisions and changes in the trajectory of the center of mass...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the rotational dynamics of disk accretion around a strongly magnetized neutron star with an aligned dipole field. The magnetospheric field {{is assumed to}} thread the disk plasma {{both inside and outside}} the corotation radius. As a result of disk-star interaction, the magnetic torque on the disk affects the structure of accretion flow to yield the observed spin- up or spin- down rates for a source of given fastness, magnetic field strength, and mass accretion rate. Within the model we obtain a prescription for the dynamical viscosity of such magnetically modified solutions for a Keplerian disk. We then use this prescription to find a model solution for the rotation rate profile throughout the entire disk, including the non-Keplerian inner disk. We find that the non-Keplerian angular <b>velocity</b> <b>transition</b> region is not necessarily narrow for a source of given spin state. The boundary layer approximation, as in the standard magnetically threaded disk model, holds only in the case of dynamical viscosity decreasing all the way to the innermost edge of the disk. These results are applied to several observed disk-fed X-ray pulsars that have exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The QPO frequencies provide a constraint on the fastness parameter and enable one to determine uniquely the width of the angular <b>velocity</b> <b>transition</b> zone for each source within model assumptions. We discuss the implications of these results on the value of the critical fastness parameter for a magnetized star in spin equilibrium.

The discretization of the velocity variable, rather than being a pure mathematical technicality, plays a role in including the intrinsic granular nature of the flow of vehicles in the mathematical theory of traffic.

40|$|Ceramics {{constitute}} an important group of low-density armour materials. Their high intrinsic strength {{makes it possible}} to design ceramic armour systems capable of defeating projectiles directly on the ceramic surface. This capability, named interface defeat, signifies that the projectile material is forced to flow radially outwards {{on the surface of the}} ceramic without penetrating significantly. This thesis presents impact experiments between long-rod projectiles and ceramic targets. The projectile/target interaction was studied using flash X-ray technique. <b>Transition</b> <b>velocities</b> (the impact velocity at which interface defeat can no longer be maintained and penetration starts) were estimated for different combinations of metallic projectiles and ceramic targets and compared to critical velocities estimated on a theoretical basis. Replica scaling experiments were also performed in order to investigate the possible influence of scale. All ceramic materials tested showed a distinct transition from interface defeat to penetration. Experiments with different silicon carbides showed that the <b>transition</b> <b>velocity</b> correlated better with the fracture toughness than with the hardness of the ceramic materials. For conical projectiles, penetration occurred along a conical surface crack and at a lower <b>transition</b> <b>velocity</b> than that observed for cylindrical projectiles.

The results of the accelerated flow show that there are two patterns in the formation of a sectional <b>velocity</b> profile and <b>transition,</b> one of which is observed when the acceleration is relatively large compared with the propagation of viscous effects, and the other when the acceleration is comparatively small. A friction coefficient of an accelerated flow tends to be larger than that of a quasi-steady flow in the laminar region, while it has reverse tendency in the turbulent region. For a decelerated flow a turbulent region is maintained almost all over the deceleration periods, and the friction coefficient becomes larger than that of a quasi-steady flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{derivation}} of the nucleon-nucleon {{force from}} the Skyrme model is reexamined. Starting from previous {{results for the}} potential energy of quasistatic solutions, we show that a calculation using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation properly {{taking into account the}} mixing of nucleon resonances, leads to substantial central attraction. We obtain a potential that is in qualitative agreement with phenomenological potentials. We also study the non-adiabatic corrections, such as the <b>velocity</b> dependent <b>transition</b> potentials, and discuss their importance. Comment: 24 pages, UPR- 0124 M...|$|R
40|$|Under {{sublethal}} antibiotics concentrations, {{the statistics}} of collectively swarming Bacillus subtilis transitions from normal to anomalous, with a heavy-tailed speed distribution and a two-step temporal correlation of <b>velocities.</b> The <b>transition</b> {{is due to}} changes in the properties of the bacterial motion and the formation of a motility-defective subpopulation that self-segregates into regions. As a result, both the colonial expansion and the growth rate are not affected by antibiotics. This phenomenon suggests a new strategy bacteria employ to fight antibiotic stress...|$|R
