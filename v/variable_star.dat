5|$|Like many low-mass stars, Gliese 876 is a <b>variable</b> <b>star.</b> Its <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> {{designation}} is IL Aquarii and it {{is classified}} as a BY Draconis variable. Its brightness fluctuates by around 0.04 magnitudes. This type of variability {{is thought to be}} caused by large starspots moving in and out of view as the star rotates. Gliese 876 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|A major {{detrimental}} {{factors which}} may prevent life from forming and it being an inhabitable planet {{is the fact}} Gliese 581 is a <b>variable</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability {{because of the presence}} of star spots combined with the rotation of the star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E

50|$|Many {{thousands}} of Algol binaries are now known: the latest {{edition of the}} General Catalogue of <b>Variable</b> <b>Stars</b> (2003) lists 3,554 of them (9% of all <b>variable</b> <b>stars).</b>|$|R
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Capella, is {{an unusual}} multiple star system among the brightest stars in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> AE Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|HS 1216+5032 is a bright, gravitationally-lensed pair of quasars. W Comae Berenices (or ON 231), a blazar in the constellation's northwest, was {{originally}} designated a <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> and later {{found to be}} a BL Lacertae object. As of 2009, it had the most intense gamma ray spectrum of the sixty known gamma-ray blazars.|$|E
5|$|R And is a Mira-type <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> with {{a period}} of 409 days. Its maximum {{magnitude}} is 5.8 and its minimum magnitude is 14.8, and it is {{at a distance of}} 1,250 light-years. There are 6 other Mira variables in Andromeda.|$|E
40|$|ISIS is {{a program}} that specializes in {{detecting}} <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> within clusters, both open and globular. ISIS has historically been used in surveys searching for <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> However, recent work has identified new uses for ISIS, such as the detection of exoplanet transits in clusters of stars. This thesis will evaluate ISIS, both how the program functions and for which objects it is most efficient and appropriate. I examined five clusters: three open, and two globular, for one night surveys. With this survey, I identified twenty-five <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> Twenty-two <b>variables</b> were previously known, and three <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> were previously undiscovered. In total, from my short one night surveys, I confirmed twenty-five previously known <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> and four unknown <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> Furthermore, ISIS has detected several δ Scuti stars whose amplitude of variation is on par with an exoplanet transit. These data suggest that ISIS {{can be used for}} the detection of exoplanet transits. Department of Physics and AstronomyThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>stars</b> have {{periodic}} or random {{changes in}} luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the intrinsically <b>variable</b> <b>stars,</b> the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{catalogue}} of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the near-infrared wavelength detected with overlapping regions of the 2 MASS public images, and discuss their properties. The investigated region is {{in the direction of}} the Galactic center (- 30 < l < 20, |b| < 20), which covers the entire bulge. We have detected 136 <b>variable</b> <b>stars,</b> of which 6 are already-known and 118 are distributed in |b| < 5 region. Additionally, 84 <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> have optical counterparts in DSS images. The three diagrams (colour-magnitude, light variance and colour-colour diagrams) indicate that most of the detected <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> should be largeamplitude and long-period variables such as Mira <b>variables</b> or OH/IR <b>stars.</b> The number density distribution of the detected <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> implies that they trace the bar structure of the Galactic bulge.

5|$|Research in 1996 {{revealed}} that Sakurai's Object possessed {{the characteristics of}} a R Coronae Borealis <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> with the anomaly of Carbon-13 (13C) deficit. Also, the metallicity of Sakurai's object in 1996 was similar to that of V605 Aquilae in 1921. However, it is expected that Sakurai's object will grow in its metallicity to match that of V605 Aquilae.|$|E
5|$|The constellation's two {{brightest}} stars—Alpha and Epsilon Antliae—shine with {{a reddish}} tinge. Alpha is an orange giant of spectral type K4III {{that is a}} suspected <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. It is located 370 ± 20 light-years away from Earth. Estimated to be shining with around 480 to 555 times the luminosity of the Sun, it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and {{on its way to}} becoming a Mira <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> having converted all its core fuel into carbon. Located 710 ± 40 light-years from Earth, Epsilon Antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type K3 IIIa, that has swollen to have a diameter about 69 times that of the Sun, and a luminosity of around 1279 Suns. It is slightly variable. At the other end of Antlia, Iota Antliae is likewise an orange giant of spectral type K1 III.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided {{a more accurate}} localization, and what Metzger had {{assumed to be a}} <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> was still present in this smaller error box. Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were hesitant to publish any conclusions on the variable object. On May10 Howard Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute published his discovery, which was later confirmed to be the burst's optical afterglow.|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of pulsating <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> across the observational Hertzprung-Russel (HR) diagram is presented, {{together with a}} summary of their global properties. The HR diagram is presented with a third colour-coded dimension, visualizing the fraction of variable, the amplitude of variability or the period of variability. The distribution of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the other observational diagrams, such as the Period-Amplitude diagram, is also presented. Some of the progresses performed {{in the field of}} <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> during the last decade are briefly summarized, and future projects that will improve our knowledge of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> are mentioned. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a photometric pipeline {{to be used}} for a wide field survey. This pipeline employs the difference image analysis (DIA) method appropriate for the photometry of star dense field such as the Galactic bulge. To verify the performance of pipeline, the observed dataset of the open cluster M 11 was re-processed. One hundred seventy eight <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> were newly discovered by analyzing the light curves of which photometric accuracy was improved through the DIA. The total number of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the M 11 observation region is 335, including 157 <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> discovered by previous studies. We present the catalogue and light curves for the 178 <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> This study shows that the photometric pipeline using the DIA is very useful in the detection of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in a cluster...|$|R
50|$|The {{latest edition}} of the General Catalogue of <b>Variable</b> <b>Stars</b> (2008) lists more than 46,000 <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the Milky Way, as well as 10,000 in other galaxies, and over 10,000 'suspected' variables.|$|R
5|$|At a {{distance}} of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{classified}} as a semiregular <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> indicating that some periodicity is noticeable in the brightness changes, but amplitudes may vary, cycles may have different lengths, {{and there may be}} standstills or periods of irregularity. It is placed in subgroup SRc; these are pulsating red supergiants with amplitudes around one magnitude and periods from tens to hundreds of days.|$|E
5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with all}} {{categories}} of astronomical objects, names are {{assigned by the}} International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU delegates the task to the Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow, Russia. Sternberg publishes the General Catalog of <b>Variable</b> <b>Stars</b> (GCVS), which is periodically (approximately once every two years) amended by {{the publication of a}} new [...] "Name-List" [...] of <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> For example, in December 2011 the 80th Name-List of <b>Variable</b> <b>Stars,</b> Part II, was released, containing designations for 2,161 recently discovered variable stars; these brought the total number of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the GCVS to 45,678. Among the newly designated objects were V0654 Aurigae, V1367 Centauri, and BU Coronae Borealis.|$|R
50|$|The {{cluster is}} not {{currently}} {{in a state}} of core collapse and the core radius is about 2 arcseconds. It is an Oosterhoff type II (OoII) globular cluster, which means it belongs to the group of metal poor clusters with longer period RR Lyrae <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> The 1997 Catalogue of <b>Variable</b> <b>Stars</b> in Globular Clusters listed 28 candidate <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the cluster, although only 20 have been confirmed. As of 2001, there are 17 known RR Lyrae variables in Messier 92. 10 X-ray sources have been detected within the 1.02 arcminute half-mass radius of the cluster, of which half are candidate cataclysmic <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The General Catalogue of <b>Variable</b> <b>Stars</b> (GCVS) {{is a list}} of <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> Its first edition, {{containing}} 10,820 stars, {{was published}} in 1948 by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and edited by B. V. Kukarkin and P. P. Parenago. Second and third editions were published in 1958 and 1968; the fourth edition, in three volumes, was published 1985 - 1987. It contained 28,435 stars. [...] A fourth volume of the fourth edition containing reference tables was later published, as well as a fifth volume containing <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> outside the Galaxy. [...] The last edition (GCVS v5.1) based on data compiled in 2015 gathers 52011 <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
5|$|Also called Aludra, Eta Canis Majoris is a blue-white supergiant of {{spectral}} type B5Ia with a luminosity 176,000 {{times and}} diameter around 80 {{times that of}} the Sun. Classified as an Alpha Cygni type <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> Aludra varies in brightness from magnitude 2.38 to 2.48 over a period of 4.7 days. It is located 1120 light-years away. To the west of Adhara lies 3.0-magnitude Zeta Canis Majoris or Furud, around 362 light-years distant from Earth. It is a spectroscopic binary, whose components orbit each other every 1.85 years, the combined spectrum indicating a main star of spectral type B2.5V.|$|E
5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star passes {{in front of the}} other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was noted}} for his {{observations}} of <b>variable</b> <b>stars,</b> and published {{a number of}} papers on the subject in Astronomische Nachrichten, and elsewhere, from 1917 until 1936.

However the double-letter system starting with RR was already inwidespread use. As a result, <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> after QZ were numbered according to Nijland's system beginning with V335.|$|R
25|$|The main sub-classes of novae are {{classical}} novae, recurrent novae (RNe), dwarf novae, and luminous red novae.

5|$|Between {{these stars}} and Sirius lie Omicron1, Omicron2, and Pi Canis Majoris. Omicron2 {{is a massive}} supergiant star about 21 times as massive as the Sun. Only 7 million years old, it has {{exhausted}} the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now processing helium. It has an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day interval. Omicron1 is an orange K-type supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an irregular <b>variable</b> <b>star,</b> varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99. Around 18 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 65,000 times its luminosity.|$|E

TT Corvi is a semiregular variable red giant of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun. TU Corvi is a Delta Scuti variable—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars {{that have been used}} as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology.

5|$|Iota Trianguli is {{a double}} star whose {{components}} can be separated by medium-sized telescopes into a strong yellow and a contrasting pale blue star. Both of these are themselves close binaries. X Trianguli is an eclipsing binary system that ranges between magnitudes 8.5 and 11.2 {{over a period of}} 0.97 days. RW Trianguli is a cataclysmic <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> system composed of a white dwarf primary and an orange main sequence star of spectral type K7 V. The former is drawing off matter from the latter, forming a prominent accretion disc. The system is around 1075 light-years distant.|$|E
40|$|This work {{is part of}} {{an effort}} to detect secular {{variable}} objects in large scale surveys by analysing their path in color-magnitude diagrams. To this aim, we first present the variability morphologies in the V/V-I diagram of several types of <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> They comprise both periodic and non periodic <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> from the Large Magellanic Cloud, such as classical Cepheids, long period variables or Be and R Coronae Borealis stars, as well as two of the detected secular <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the Galaxy, FG Sge and V 4334 Sgr. The study of the different variability morphologies allows the identification of regions in the color-magnitude diagram where those secular <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> could be detected. We also estimate the number of such secular <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> expected in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
