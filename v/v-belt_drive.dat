These were also powered by the Waukesha 6RB engine and seated 100, but they were shorter than the first six cars.

40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} parametrically forced excitation and transverse oscillations of {{the belt}} with local heterogeneity, a new dynamic model of a <b>V-belt</b> <b>drive</b> with longitudinal motion has been developed. The model shows that when an appropriate quantitative and qualitative level of local heterogeneity is achieved, the oscillation mode {{of the belt}} starts to change, and the belt tensile force developing due to deformation of the belt significantly increases. Another <b>V-belt</b> <b>drive</b> dynamic model was developed based on the finite element model (FEM) analysis. This {{was used to examine}} the interaction of the belt, containing local heterogeneity, with the pulley in the area of contact angle. The natural frequencies of the system were calcu-lated and the system’s response to harmonic excitation was established. The correlation between the presence of defects in the belt and vibration activity of the driving pulley bearing housing was established. Using the developed model, the relationship between the defective belt and the dynamic component of the vibration reaction force of the driven pulley was studied. Spectrum components are identified and are used in the belt drive’s practical diagnostics. The method developed based on these models enables non-destructive assessment of the failure state of the mounted belt to be performed in order to assess the failure state of different belt drive types...|$|E

For a given satisfaction level and a confidence level, an equivalent formulation of this uncertain optimization model is obtained where only interval parameters are involved. Based on the concepts of maximal and minimal range inequalities for describing interval inequality, the interval parameter model is decomposed into two standard nonlinear programming problems, and an algorithm, called two-step based sampling algorithm, is developed to find an interval optimal solution for the original problem.

40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} the {{electric}} motors in the industrial and commercial sectors use belt drives. 1 Belt drives provide flexibility in the positioning of the motor relative to the load. Pulleys (sheaves) of varying diameters allow {{the speed of the}} driven equipment to be increased or decreased relative to the motor speed. A properly designed belt power-transmission system offers high efficiency and low noise, requires no lubrication, and presents low maintenance requirements. However, certain types of belts are more efficient than others, offering potential energy cost savings. The majority of belt drives use V-belts, which use a trapezoidal cross section to create a wedging action on the pulleys to increase friction and improve the belt’s power transfer capability. Joined or multiple belts are specified for heavy loads. V-belt drives can have a peak efficiency of 95 % or more at the time of installation. Efficiency is dependent on pulley size, pulley wear, V-belt alignment, transmitted torque, under or oversizing belts for load requirements. Efficiency can deteriorate by as much as 5 % over time if slippage occurs because the belt is not periodically retensioned. The most important operational and maintenance issue in a <b>V-belt</b> <b>drive</b> is its tension. I...|$|E

40|$|Multiribbed {{serpentine}} belt drive systems are widely adopted in accessory drive automo- tive applications {{due to the}} better performances relative to the flat or <b>V-belt</b> <b>drives.</b> Nevertheless, they can generate unwanted noise and vibration which may affect the correct functionality and the fatigue life of the belt and of the other components of the transmission. The aim of the paper is to analyze {{the effect of the}} shear deflection in the rubber layer between the pulley and the belt fibers on the rotational dynamic behavior of the transmission. To this end the Firbank's model has been extended to cover the case of small amplitude vibrations about mean rotational speeds. The model evidences that the shear deflection can be accounted for by an elastic term reacting to the torsional oscil- lations in series with a viscous term that dominates at constant speed. In addition, the axial deformation of the belt spans are taken into account. The numerical model has been validated by the comparison with the experimental results obtained on an accessory drive transmission including two pulleys and an automatic tensioner. The results show that the first rotational modes of the system are dominated by the shear deflection of the bel...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to design and develop an experimental shaker for vibratory date detachment. The prototype machine was constructed and tested on Shahani dates fruit bunch. The bunch shaker was powered by a continuous variable speed motor. The rotational speed of the power unit could be continuously varied from 0 to 1400 rpm by means of a volume control knob on a digital board. The rotating output power of the motor was transmitted to a small flywheel through a <b>V-belt</b> <b>drive</b> system, where it was converted to a reciprocating motion by a slider-crank mechanism. The eccentricity of the crank mechanism was adjustable to provide stroke lengths of 20, 40, 80, 100 and 120 mm. The slider motion was transmitted to the shaker clamp by a 500 mm long boom made of 20 mm steel tubing. The boom could reciprocate vertically and horizontally in a brass guide. By this shaker date fruit bunch can be oscillated in vertical, horizontal and hanging modes. At the vertical shaking mode, the resulting motion of slider-crank mechanism was transmitted to the fruit bunch clamped to the shaker frame, through a boom and a clamping device. The required average power for bunch shaking was estimated to be about 1 kW by assuming constant-displacement limb shaker model. Result showed the bunch shaker was capable of removing ripe fruit from the bunch at 5 - 7 second without imparting rubbing and bruising damage to the fruits...|$|E
40|$|The <b>V-belt</b> <b>drive</b> is {{a rather}} popular, widely used form of power {{transmission}} in agricultural and food industry engineering. At the same time, its stability, the lifetime of V-belt is influenced by several environmental factors, namely in the food industry by the contamination affecting the belt sides, the ambient temperature, humidity and the occasionally aggressive (acidic, alkaline air, air saturated with gases, etc.) medium. In the case of agricultural machinery, the vibration caused by uncertainly oriented pulleys with bearing in different plate structures (often being shaken in the fields) as well as alignment adjustment inaccuracies jeopardize {{the reliability of the}} parameters of the drive. Furthermore, the efficiency is determined by several factors together: the slippage occurring during drive transmission, the hysteresis loss resulting from the external and internal friction occurring with the belt entering and exiting the pulley. Experimental equipment and calculation methods were developed to determine the dynamics of temperature increase generated by the belt and pulley relationship. The temperature generated in the V-belt was measured as a function of pretension, pulley diameter and bending frequency. The so-called damping factor characterizing the contact with the pulley (the external friction when entering and exiting the groove) and the hysteresis loss (inner friction) are also determined. On the basis of the damping factor (ζ ≈ 400 Ns/m 2) of the V-belt involved in the experiments the other losses (P oth) occurring from the pulley—V-belt contact and internal friction may be estimated. The drive parameters may be optimized with the mathematical model describing the effect of the pulley diameter and belt frequency on the increase in temperature. A standardized calculation method as well as design factors valid for the properly adjusted drive and normal operating conditions determined through empirical and laboratory experiments are used for the sizing of V-belt drives. The lifetime of V-belt drives designed in this way, used in extreme conditions typical of agricultural machinery will not be appropriate and will not provide clear, predictable information for maintenance planning. In such cases the results of our own many lifetime tests conducted in the given circumstances can be safely relied on. The agricultural harvesting machines are large plate-body self-propelled structures on which most of the power supply of the (threshing, cleaning, moving, etc.) machine units handling the crop is realized via belt drives. The distance and angular displacement of the axes involved in the drive can vary within wide limits. The misalignment and angular displacement of the pulleys can be the result of installation instability — due to the plate structure — and the deformation of the plate structure occurring during the operation as well. V-belt drives operate satisfactorily under such conditions as well, however these faults are unfavourable in terms of belt lifetime and result in the reduction of drive efficiency. A further aim of our research is to examine through experiments the lifetime and efficiency of V-belts used in agricultural machines as a function of drive adjustment errors. According to the results of the measurements of the geometrical adjustment errors of V-belt drives performed in the field, the pulleys of agricultural equipment are not always positioned in the medium plane of the drive. In our experiments these data served as independent variables. Figure 1 shows the arrangement of a <b>V-belt</b> <b>drive</b> in a grain harvester with the laser pulley alignment measuring instrument installed as an accessory. In the case of many machine types in 80 % of the tested drives three times the permissible error was measured, and because of off-road use, due to dynamic load these errors further increased {{as a result of the}} frame deformation. The results of both the belt bending testing and the geometrical adjustment testing of the drive offer great help in the design of belt drives. At the same time they can be the source of lifetime and efficiency forecasts...|$|E
50|$|Any <b>V-belt's</b> {{ability to}} <b>drive</b> pulleys depends on {{wrapping}} the belt around a sufficient {{angle of the}} pulley to provide grip. Where a single-V-belt {{is limited to a}} simple convex shape, it can adequately wrap at most three or possibly four pulleys, so can drive at most three accessories. Where more must be driven, such as for modern cars with power steering and air conditioning, multiple belts are required. As the polygroove belt can be bent into concave paths by external idlers, it can wrap any number of driven pulleys, limited only by the power capacity of the belt.|$|R
50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual <b>v-belts.</b> The upper, <b>driven</b> sheave is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper sheave is mounted drives both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|R
