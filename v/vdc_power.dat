The connectors in Zone-2 provide the connections to the Base Interface and Fabric Interface. All Fabric connections use point-to-point 100 Ω differential signals.

Power pickup was provided by two slipping brushes, like those on a conventional subway system. A subway can use the running rails as the ground, but the Transrapid had no contact with its rail, so it needed a second conductor. Brushes were positioned {{on both sides of}} the vehicle, to allow it to pick up from either side.

50|$|SSPTS was {{a shuttle}} upgrade that {{replaced}} the Assembly Power Converter Unit (APCU) {{with a new}} device called the Power Transfer Unit (PTU). The APCU {{had the capacity to}} convert shuttle 28 VDC main bus power to 124 VDC compatible with ISS's 120 <b>VDC</b> <b>power</b> system. This was used in the initial construction of the space station to augment the power available from the Russian Zvezda service module. The PTU adds to this the capability to convert the 120 VDC supplied by the ISS to the orbiter's 28 VDC main bus power. It is capable of transferring up to 8 kW of power from the space station to the orbiter. With this upgrade both the shuttle and the ISS were able to use each other's power systems when needed, though the ISS never again required the use of an orbiter's power systems.|$|E

Modern modules using 6-inch cells typically contain 60 cells and produce a nominal 30 V. For conversion into AC, panels may be connected in series to produce an array that is effectively a single large panel with a nominal rating of 300 to 600 <b>VDC.</b> The <b>power</b> then runs to an inverter, which converts it into standard AC voltage, typically 230 VAC / 50 Hz or 240 VAC / 60 Hz.|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{power demand}} in {{aircraft}} has grown significantly {{over the last}} century, and this trend continues with the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) and All Electric Aircraft (AEA) concepts. Higher voltages such as 270 VDC are required to deliver additional power to loads and to optimise aircraft mass. Increased voltages inflict more stress on the Electrical Wiring Interconnect System (EWIS) and increase the impact of series arc faults caused by wiring defects. Solid State Power Controllers (SSPCs) are used to provide fast protection in high voltage distribution systems. The aim of this work is the characterisation, modelling, simulation and detection of series arc faults in 28 VDC and 270 <b>VDC</b> electrical <b>power</b> distribution systems featuring SSPCs. The majority of passive detection schemes in the literature were designed based on empirical data rather than well characterised electric arc parameters, and thus nuisance trips are unavoidable. To address this series arc faults in 28 VDC and 270 <b>VDC</b> solid state <b>power</b> distribution systems were characterised using the SAE 5692 "Loose terminal" method [8], and {{it was found that}} 270 VDC arc faults cause a minimal 5. 6...|$|R
