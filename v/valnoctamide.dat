By inhibiting MEH, valproic acid and <b>valnoctamide</b> cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion.|$|E

50|$|Zonisamide (trade name Zonegran), another anti-convulsant, {{also may}} show promise in {{treating}} bipolar depression.

50|$|Butabarbital (trade name Butisol) is a {{prescription}} barbiturate sleep aid. Butabarbital has a particularly fast onset of effects and short duration of action {{compared to other}} barbiturates, which makes it useful for certain applications such as treating severe insomnia and relieving anxiety before surgical procedures; however it is also relatively dangerous particularly when combined with alcohol, and so is now rarely used, although it is still prescribed in some Eastern European and South American countries. Its intermediate duration of action gives butabarbital an abuse potential slightly lower than secobarbital. Butabarbital can be hydrolyzed to <b>Valnoctamide.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{valpromide}} isomer <b>valnoctamide</b> (VCD, 200 mg three times daily for 8 days), an over-the-counter tranquillizer, on the elimination kinetics of a single oral dose of carbamazepine- 10, 11 -epoxide (CBZ-E, 100 mg) was investigated in healthy subjects. During VCD treatment, the half-life of CBZ-E was prolonged significantly compared with control (19. 7 +/- 6. 7 h vs 6. 9 +/- 2. 0 h, means +/- s. d., P less than 0. 01), and its oral clearance decreased four-fold (from 109. 6 +/- 30. 7 to 28. 8 +/- 11. 1 ml h- 1 kg- 1, P less than 0. 01). These findings indicate that VCM, like valpromide, strongly inhibits epoxide hydrolase in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Valpromide (VPD) and <b>valnoctamide</b> (VCD) are amid. {{derivatives}} of {{valproic acid}} (VPA), {{one of the}} major antlepileptic drugs (AEDs). In rodent models, both VPD and VCD are more potent as anticonvul-santa than VPA. However, in humans, VPD serves as a prodrug to VPA, whereas VCD acts as a drug on its own, which is not blo-transformed to Its corresponding acid-valnoctlc acid (VCA). The present study Investigates the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of VPD and VCD In rats by monftorlng the levels of these two amide isomers in the brain, liver, plasma, and urine of rats. The disposition of VPD and VCD was analyzed In a comparative manner with that of VPA. The following PK parameters were obtained for VPD and VCD, respectively-. clearance, 6. 1 and 3 mI/mm/kg; volume of distribution (V 1), 0. 63 and 0. 58 liter/kg; heft-life (t 11), 42 and 94 mm; and mean residence time (MRT), 102 and 196 mm.

40|$|SummaryThe Eleventh Eilat Conference on New Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) -EILAT XI, {{took place}} in Eilat, Israel from the 6 th to 10 th of May 2012. About 100 basic scientists, {{clinical}} pharmacologists and neurologists from 20 countries attended the conference, whose main themes included “Indications overlapping with epilepsy” and “Securing the successful development of an investigational antiepileptic drug in the current environment”. Consistent with previous formats of this conference, {{a large part of}} the program was devoted to a review of AEDs in development, as well as updates on AEDs introduced since 1994. Like the EILAT X report, the current manuscript focuses only on the preclinical and clinical pharmacology of AEDs that are currently in development. These include brivaracetam, 2 -deoxy-glucose, ganaxolone, ICA- 105665, imepitoin, NAX 801 - 2, perampanel and other AMPA receptor antagonists, tonabersat, <b>valnoctamide</b> and its homologue sec-propylbutylacetamide (SPD), VX- 765 and YK 3089. Since the previous Eilat conference, retigabine (ezogabine) has been marketed and four newer AEDs in development (NAX 810 - 2, SPD, tonabersat and VX- 765) are included in this manuscript...|$|E
40|$|Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) {{are widely}} {{utilized}} {{in the management}} of neuropathic pain. The AED valproic acid (VPA) holds out particular promise as it is engaging a variety of different anticonvulsant mechanisms simultaneously. However, the clinical use of VPA is limited by two rare but potentially life-threatening side effects: teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity. We synthesized VPA’s corresponding amide: valpromide (VPD), two of VPA’s isomers and their corresponding amides; valnoctic acid (VCA), <b>valnoctamide</b> (VCD), diisopropyl acetic acid (DIA), diisopropylacetamide (DID) and VPD”s congener N-methyl-VPD (MVPD). VCD, DID and VPD are non-teratogenic, potentially non-hepatotoxic, and exhibit better anticonvuslant potency than VPA. In addition, we have synthesized several tetramethylcyclopropyl analogues of VPA amides that are non-teratogenic, and non-hepatotoxic, that exhibit good antiepileptic efficacy. In this study we have assessed the antiallodynic activity of these compounds in comparison to VPA and gabapentin (GBP) using the rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain. VCA and MVPD were inactive. However, VPD (20 - 100 mg/kg), VCD (20 - 100 mg/kg) and DID (20 - 90 mg/kg), produced dose-related reversal of tactile allodynia with ED 50 values of 61, 52 and 58 mg/kg, respectively. All the amides were more potent than VPA (ED 50 = 269 mg/kg). Th...|$|E

The antiallodynic effect of VPA, VPD, VCD and DID was obtained at plasma concentrations of 125, 24, 18 and 7 [*]mg[*]l− 1, respectively, with a good pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic correlation and a minimal lag response. VCD and DID were found to have minimal motor and sedative side effects at analgesic doses, and were equipotent to GBP, currently the leading drug in neuropathic pain treatment. Consequently, VCD and DID have potential to become new drugs for the treatment of neuropathic pain...|$|E
