40|$|Considering that I used {{to study}} at a Secondary Medical school, this area {{concerning}} parts {{of the human body}} is not really unfamiliar, that is why I chose it. Backbone (spinal) defects are as old as humanity in itself. Seperated into defects from birth and those aquired later on in life. Originally it was more often a birth defect. Individuals with bigger handicaps were excluded from society and succumbed to a miserable existence in the end. With the development of science and National Health services there are fewer people with crooked bones; a consequence of a <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>defiency.</b> These defects not only concern humans, but animals too. They discoverd human diseases (where backbone defects belong) also went along with animals. Breeding of animals, to increase (for example dogs and cats) better qualities, usually turns in to degenerative changes of backbone and hips. What is missing is called "healthy blood". Now there are more acquired defects which are a result non healthy living (bad eating, eating too much) and not enough exercise. With developing computer technology, sitting for a long time causes back problems. Because adults work too hard and are very busy,they do not have time for physical activities, which help the body relax and support the back, In my work I am devising tests that strengthen the body and help you can recognize different kinds of defects; resulting in rehabilitation through exercise. This helps handicaped people deal with the problem and in some cases elimates the problem completely...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides. In these diseases {{a shift from}} immune tolerance to autoimmunity has occurred. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> an immunomodulatory secosteroid hormone, {{may play a role}} in this shift to autoimmune response. This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> level to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles were found for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews were used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells are affected in such a way that infections and auto-immunity may be prevented. Based on current literature, multiple changes in the immune system of the illnesses occur that can be explained by <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency. Studies on <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> in SLE and SSc indicate that deficiency may be more prevalent than in healthy controls.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{connection}} between vitamin D-insufficiency, sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome has been examined. Vitamin D-insufficiency is common in germany regardless of age but has an even higher prevalence in the elderly. Sarcopenia describes the age-associated and functional relevant loss of muscle mass -following some definitions also muscle strength- whereas the frailty-syndrome is a multidimensional syndrome leading to negative outcomes such as heightened mortality. The hypothesis was that vitamin D-insufficiency favors the incidence of sarcopenia as well as frailty and that sarcopenia is {{a key factor in}} the development of the frailty-syndrome. Vice versa it could be imagined that frailty with limited mobility could lead to vitamin d-insuffiency due to reduced time spent outside and limited sun exposure. 360 community-dwelling participants of BASE-II aged 61 to 84 took part in the examinations. Serum level of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> was determined via direct chemoluminescence immunoassay and muscle mass for diagnosing sarcopenia was measured using a DEXA-scan. Frailty was assessed with the frailty-index after Fried et al. and the five frailty criteria weight loss, exhaustion, physical activity, gait speed and weakness were determined via anamnesis, questionnaires, geriatric assessment and grip strength measurement. The expected high prevalence of vitamin d-insufficiency was confirmed in the BASE-II-sample (69, 7 %). The prevalence of sarcopenia (19, 5 % women, 15, 5 % men) lies in the middle compared to other studies whereas the prevalence of frailty (1, 1 %) was considerably lower compared to other studies presumably due to a lower mean age. The further analyses showed no correlation between vitamin d-level, sarcopenia and frailty. The variance of values of the skeletal mucle mass-index used for measuring sarcopenia could only very little be explained by age and physical activity as possible factors of influence. Furthermore the influence of skeletal muscle mass and age on frailty showed to be less than ten percent. These findings diminish the hope that a single factor like <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> will serve as a predictor for sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome which may offer options for prevention and treatment. Beyond that sarcopenia may not be the key factor in the pathogenesis of frailty as commonly considered. It can be assumed that sarcopenia and notably frailty are highly multifactorial conditioned and therefore the identification and emphasis of separate pathophysiological relevant factors may be a difficult task...|$|R
30|$|Long-term stable osseointegrated {{implants}} are {{the primary}} goal in dental implantology. Although dental implants have proven clinical reliable in the long term, the failure of implants {{at a very early}} stage of osseointegration has been described [1, 2]. The pursuit to identify the mechanisms leading to early implant failure is ongoing to date and include the following: tobacco usage, diabetes, wear particle release and foreign body reaction, local bone necrosis due to heat generation during bone preparation or implant placement [2 – 9]. Systematic reviews demonstrated that an antibiotic regimen before dental implant placement subtly reduces the early implant infection and consequently implant failure [10, 11]. In orthopedics, the risk to develop a periprosthetic joint infection has been associated with a low vitamin D level [12]. A relationship between bone metabolism, vitamin D, and early implant failure in human has not been proven to date. Vitamin D induces bone formation around implants in rodents [13 – 17]. Besides the classical function, findings of the last decades indicate vitamin D as an important immune regulator targeting both, the innate and adaptive immune response, since all cells of the immune system express <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> receptor (VDR) [18 – 20].|$|R

The article will put forward some interesting points to show that sugars, fats and <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> levels equally {{play an important role}} in causing hypertension. KEYWORDS: Risk Factors, Vitamin D, Salt, Sugar, Fats. INTRODUCTION Hypertension (HTN) or increase in blood pressure has been considered as one of the leading factor in causing worldwide disability-adjusted life years [1]. There are many etiological factors involved behind HTN and it occurs due to a combination of both genetic and environment factors [2]. According to one study conducted by Kearney et al., more than 1 billion adults worldwide (approximately 25 %) has hypertension. Other estimates suggest this number will climb to 29 % by 2025 [3]. The major risk factors which we have been hearing since decades for causing hypertension are high salt diet, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, age, race, consuming tobacco, sedentary lifestyle, stress, drinking too much alcohol etc. [4]. However, there are far too more factors which should also be held responsible for causing hypertension. This article will put forward the new risk factors which are equally responsible for causing hypertension. ASSOCIATION OF SUGAR & HYPERTENSION In one of his recent article, Dr. James DiNicolantonio and his colleagues suggested that the main culprit behind hypertension is sugar and not salt. They have showed that sugar has a potential of causing fluid and sodium overload [5]. According to a meta-analysis of Randomised Control Trials (RCT), it was observed that that a diet with high sugar quantity as compared with a low-sugar diet, could cause an increase in blood pressure [6] Moreover, sugar can lead to leptin resistance, which may also contribute to its BP raising effects [7]. Dietary sugar may also increase aldosterone by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which stimulates angiotensin-II and aldosterone production from adrenal glands [8]. This growing body of data suggests that an overconsumption of refined sugars can lead to salt-sensitive HTN. ASSOCIATION OF FATS & HYPERTENSION Dietary fat is known to cause weight gain and subsequently, overconsumption through its high caloric density and low satiety properties which can lead to obesity and other metabolic disorders [9]. Obesity is a known risk factor for causing HTN. In a recent study, conducted by Dixon W. Wilde et al, it was observed that there was an increase in plasma fatty acids levels which may lead to hypertension via a process involving the elevation of Ca 2 + current density and by a change of channel kinetics in the vascular smooth muscle membrane [10]. In an another study conducted by Dr. Clint Gray et al, concluded that when rats were given a diet of high fat (HF) and high salt (HS) while being bearing foetuses, their offspring’s when born, had blood pressure pretty much higher than those whose mothers were fed with HS diets [11]. Hence, even fats should be considered as one of the new emerging risk factors for causing hypertension. ASSOCIATION OF LOW VITAMIN D LEVELS & HYPERTENSION Vitamin D plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure and other cardiovascular functions [12]. Koota et al., showed systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and arterial average pressure had increased among people suffering from lack of vitamin D and suggested that Vitamin D deficiency is accompanied by Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System activity (RAAS) [13]. One similar study showed that people with higher levels of vitamin D had lower blood pressures and a lower risk of developing hypertension [14]. A review in 2013 looked at many studies involving people with hypertension. They found that for each 10 ng/ml increase in someone’s vitamin D levels, they had a 12 % lower risk of developing hypertension. The people with the highest vitamin D levels had a 30 % lower risk of developing hypertension compared to the people with the lowest levels [15]. Hence, low levels of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> could also be an emerging risk factor for HTN. CONCLUSION The article puts forward some interesting points to show that sugars, fats and <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> levels equally {{play an important role in}} causing hypertension. Physicians should be careful and should inform their hypertensive patients about the ill-effects of having meals with high sugars, fats and low <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> levels.

The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of vitamin D levels on innate immunity. Methods: Participants for this prospective, longitudinal study were recruited amongst otherwise healthy staff of a large hospital in Victoria, Australia. Those fulfilling the inclusion criteria, including a vitamin D level of 100 nmol/L post supplementation (n= 11), TLR 2 expression on PBMCs increased significantly, with no change noted in TLR 4 or CD 86 expression. Stimulation of vitamin D deficient samples with TLR ligands produced a number of proinflammatory cytokines, which were significantly reduced upon vitamin D normalisation. In patients whose levels returned to a deficient level at 3 months despite ongoing low-level supplementation, an increase in the pro-inflamamtory state returned. This suggests that vitamin D may play an important role in ensuring an appropriate baseline pro-inflammatory state. Conclusions: This ex-vivo pilot study adds clinical evidence supporting a possibly important role for vitamin D in innate immunity.

The use of latent class methods provides important information about the clustering of health behaviours which can be used to target population segments requiring behaviour change interventions considering multiple risk factors. Given the dominant negative association of smoking with the birth outcomes investigated, latent class groupings of other health behaviours may not confer additional risk information for these outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Although {{bariatric surgery}} {{is the most}} {{effective}} weight loss therapy, its skeletal consequences are unclear. This study examined the effects of bariatric surgery and dietary intervention on weight, gut hormones, adiponectin, appetite control and bone loss over 24 months post-intervention. At baseline there were 18 diet, 12 gastric banding (GB) and 20 gastric sleeve (GS) subjects with mean (±SD) age 53 (12) years and BMI 39 (6). A quarter of patients had low bone mineral density (BMD) with t-scores within the osteopenic range. At 12 months, mean (±SD) (kg) weight loss was greatest in the GS group [diet - 5. 4 (7), GB - 12 (6) and GS - 33 (13), p< 0. 0001]. Bone loss (%) was also greater in the GS group; [total hip, - 0. 86 (1. 6) in diet, - 1. 6 (1. 5) in GB and - 6. 1 (3) in GS, p< 0. 0001]. For all subjects, maximal weight loss occurred in the first 6 months but for GS, total hip bone loss continued reaching 9 (3) % for 12 patients with 24 months data, p< 0. 001. These patients also experienced an ongoing decline in lean body mass of 13 (4) %. The 12 month mean postprandial PYY % (+ 90 min) response differed between groups: diet 58 (102), GB 70 (74), GS 150 (106), p< 0. 0008. Adiponectin change (%) varied between groups: diet 4 (22), GB 21 (19), GS 75 (62), p= 0. 0022 with no significant glp- 1 change. Consistent with the bone loss, bone turnover markers only increased in GS with osteocalcin by 110 (89) % and urinary n-telopeptide by 89 (83) %, p< 0. 001. Calcium intake, <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and PTH were normal throughout the study. When considering the whole group at 12 months, TH BMD loss correlated significantly with weight loss, postprandial PYY and adiponectin. In multivariate analysis weight loss and PYY response explained 56 % of TH BMD loss (p< 0. 0001). In summary, GS was the most efficient weight loss modality; however, it was complicated by a negative effect on body composition. The ongoing bone loss in GS was not explained by weight loss alone and was associated with postprandial PYY and adiponectin changes. These findings have significant implications for people undergoing bariatric surgery and longer term studies of bone health are needed...|$|R
40|$|In the {{submitted}} {{work was}} examined {{to what extent}} the vitamin D status has an influence on the regulation of blood pressure or on reducing an increased blood pressure and whether there are differences between serial UV irradiation and oral substitution of colecalciferol. In a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical study 64 participants with mild essential hypertension were irradiated either with a sun-similar (3. 5 % UV (B) -fraction) or nearly pure UV (A) -containing (99, 5 % UV (A) -fraction) UV-spectrum twice weekly for a total of 10 weeks. The UV (B) irradiated group additionally received placebo tablets, the UV (A) irradiated group tablets containing 10, 000 IU of colecalciferol twice weekly. Before the start, after 10 weeks of intervention and 5 weeks later without further intervention a 24 -hour blood pressure measurement was performed, also the blood levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3, calcitriol, parathyroid hormone and calcium were measured. In both groups there was a highly significant increase of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3, and a (temporary) suppression of parathyroid hormone while calcitriol and serum calcium remained constant. Since 10, 000 I. E. colecalciferol approximately equal one MEDII, the dosages were equivalent in both groups. Nevertheless, only in the UV(B) -group a decrease of blood pressure was shown {{at the end of the}} intervention period after ten weeks and five weeks after the end of the intervention, which was significant for diastolic blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure a trend in favor of the UV (B) -group was shown. Despite the evidence that several organs (such as vascular smooth muscle or the parathyroid) and cells (as in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (renin)) contain local <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> receptors, when considering blood pressure reduction UV exposure appears to have even more benefits. Physiologically, vitamin D activation occurs in the skin. The skin also expresses vitamin D receptors as well as the complete enzyme equipment and conversion capacity to produce calcitriol, the hormonally effective metabolite. Blood pressure regulation may already be affected in the resistance vessels in the subcutaneous layer. In addition, UV radiation may provide a vitamin D-independent vasorelaxing effect, for example, via the antioxidant system. This may support other vitamin D-mediated anti-hypertensive mechanisms such as reduction of the secretion of renin or PTH. Studies by other authors, who described a reduction in blood pressure by vitamin D substitution used active vitamin D preparations, such as calcitriol or 1 -alpha-hydroxylase. The conclusion of this investigation is that the vitamin D-mediated anti-hypertensive effects of UV (B) -exposure are superior to those of basal vitamin D substitution. A comparable effect only seems to occur when using active vitamin D derivatives. However, their application is limited by the (physiological) side effects such as risk of hypercalcaemia and calciuria...|$|R

In this paper, the phase diagrams of TPGS and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) {{in the presence of}} either water or ethanol were constructed. The effect of water and ethanol on the cloud point temperature of TPGS–PEG 400 mixtures was investigated. In general, the cloud point temperature was reduced by the presence of either water or ethanol in the formulation. However, water was more effective in lowering the cloud point temperature than ethanol. Similarly, the phase diagram of TPGS–PEG 1450 was constructed. The cloud point temperature was observed to decrease with increasing TPGS concentration. It was found that TPGS and PEG 1450 could form a single phase when TPGS concentration was above 75 %, based on differential scanning calorimetry, and FT‐Raman analysis indicated that a vibration at 1330 cm – 1 disappeared in the melted single phase. In addition, a systematic melting point depression was observed for the mixtures of TPGS–PEG 1450. In the presence of Ibuprofen, a model compound, the cloud point temperature was also reduced. Finally, the extended Flory–Huggins theory for polymer solution was used to analyze the entropic and enthalpic contributions of water and ethanol to the free energy of mixing. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 100 : 4907 – 4921, 201...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} two hundred and seventy day-old Arbor Acre strain of broiler chicks were used for this research. Five treatment: T 1 - {{positive}} control (10 birds/m 2), T 2 - negative control, T 3, T 4 and T 5 had 20 birds/m 2. T 1 and T 2 had no supplementation with <b>vitamin</b> E (<b>d</b> 1 -α-tocopheryl acetate). T 3, T 4 and T 5 had 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg vitamin E supplementations respectively. Feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and weight gain and serum enzymes (Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)) were determined. There were no {{significant changes in the}} weight gain and final weight of the birds fed the different dietary treatments. The feed intake increased significantly in birds fed T 2 (1. 91 kg) and compared to their counterpart on vitamin E supplementation (from 1. 58 to 1. 60 kg). However, FCR of birds on diets T 1 (2. 50), T 4 (2. 77) and T 5 (2. 50) was similar (P> 0. 05). The total protein and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) values were neither affected by increased stocking density nor with or without vitamin E supplementation. However, increased stocking density without vitamin E supplementation (T 2) (0. 97 U. I/l) resulted in a significant reduction in the albumin values. Although ALT values increased significantly with increase in vitamin E supplementation, the birds on dietary T 1 (8. 00 U. I/l) had similar level of ALT with their counterpart on T 4 (7. 50 U.

40|$|Levels and {{turnover}} of vitamin E (α-T) were studied in guinea pigs placed {{for three weeks}} on a diet containing a scorbutic level of vitamin C and either a low level (LE group) or a high level (HE group) of hexadeuterium-labelled <b>vitamin</b> E (<b>d</b> 6 -RRR-α-T acetate). The levels of vitamin C in the ten tissues analyzed declined very rapidly at rates that were the same in both the LE and HE groups, indicating {{that the level of}} dietary vitamin E had no effect upon tissue vitamin C levels. On the vitamin C deficient diet, the total α-T (d 0 - + d 6 -α-T) declined significantly over 21 days in the HE group in two tissues with high P- 450 enzyme activity and in one tissue with a high partial pressure of oxygen, whereas on a vitamin C-sufficient diet with the same concentration of vitamin E the levels of total α-T remained steady in the same tissues. In the LE "scorbutic" group, the total α-T declined only in heart and kidney, whereas in the vitamin C-sufficient LE group there was a decline of total α-T in all tissues analyzed except brain. The results show that in guinea pigs, at least, vitamin C is indispensable for proper uptake of vitamin E from the gut and absorption into tissues. Changes of vitamin E levels also were studied in six anatomical regions of the brain of rats subjected to controlled ischemia/reperfusion. Analysis showed that ischemia/reperfusion caused statistically significant losses of vitamin E in all regions, except the pons-medulla, and the extent of loss correlated well with the previously determined deterioration of the blood-brain barrier in the corresponding regions.

40|$|Vitamin D {{and calcium}} are metabolically interrelated and highly {{correlated}} dietary factors. Experimental {{studies have shown}} their anticarcinogenic effects due to their participation in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in normal and malignant breast cells. Given the emerging interest in their potential roles in the etiology of breast cancer, we review the current epidemiologic literature on dietary and/or supplemental intakes of vitamin D, endogenous circulating levels of vitamin D, and dietary and/or supple-mental intakes of calcium in relation to breast cancer risk. To place these studies in context, we also provide {{a brief review of}} other supporting epidemiologic evidence. Despite incon-sistent results from the epidemiologic studies, several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D and calcium may be involved in the development of breast cancer. Specifically, (a) there is some epidemiologic evidence for inverse associations between vitamin D and calcium intakes and breast cancer; (b) serum, plasma, and/or blood levels of vitamin D metabolites have been inversely associated with breast cancer risk in some studies; (c) high sunlight exposure, presumably reflecting vitamin D synthesis in the skin, has been associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer; (<b>d)</b> <b>vitamin</b> D and calcium intakes have been inversely related to breast density, an intermediate end point for breast cancer; (e) calcium has been associated with a reduced risk of benign proliferative epithelial disorders of the breast, putative precursors of breast cancer; and (f) certain polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor might modify breast cancer susceptibility. To further confirm the potential protective effects of calcium and vitamin D on breast cancer, well-designed cohort studies and clinical trials are warranted.

40|$|Background: Lipid peroxidation {{is thought}} {{to play a role}} in the {{evolution}} of liver damage, based on evidence in experimental models, However, evidence that lipid peroxidation occurs in patients with liver disease remains to be provided. We addressed the hypothesis by measuring levels of 8 -epi Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha a bioactive prostaglandin isomer produced by free radical catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid, in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: In 42 patients with hepatic cirrhosis 8 -epi Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha, factor VII activity, endotoxemia, carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol were measured. In 10 patients 8 -epi Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha was also measured before and 30 days after 300 mg b. i. <b>d.</b> <b>vitamin</b> E administration. Results: Cirrhotic patients had significantly higher 8 -epi Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha, excretion than controls [median (range) : 199. 2 (60. 0 - 812) vs 85. 9 (55. 6 - 160. 0) pg/mg creatinine, p< 0. 0001]. Patients with urinary 8 -epi Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha, above the range in controls were more likely to have moderate or severe than mild liver failure (p < 0. 004), They also had lower factor VII activity (62 +/- 19 vs 74 +/- 15 %, p < 0. 02) than patients with normal levels of the isoprostane, Urinary excretion of 8 -epi Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha correlated directly with endotoxemia (Rho = 0. 56, p < 0. 0002) and inversely with factor VII (Rho = - 0. 39, p < 0. 02). Cirrhotic patients given vitamin E showed a significant decrease of urinary 8 -epi Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha [median (range) : 342. 5 (170 - 812) vs 292. 5 (142 - 562) pg/mg creatinine, p < 0. 04].

A total of 300 unvaccinated against ND Arbor Acre day-old chicks {{were used for the}} study for 8 wk. Birds were brooded together on day 1 of age, and 30 chicks were selected randomly for evaluating the maternally derived antibody titre against ND. At 2 days of age, the remaining 270 chicks were divided based on weight equalization into 9 treatment groups and replicated thrice. The 9 treatments consisted of a factorial arrangement of 4 supplemental vitamins (A, C, E and combination of A, C, E) and 2 periods of administration (3 days pre- and post-ND vaccinations) with a control. The birds were managed intensively throughout the experimental period, ND vaccines were administered on the 5 th (i/o) and 24 th (Lasota) day of age, respectively. Supplemental combined vitamins A, C and E at 0. 15, 16. 67 and 3. 03 mg/kg, respectively, resulted in higher (P < 0. 05) final body weight of 1785. 00 g/bird and better feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 2. 89.

The congestion area and ulcer area before treatment and 3, 7 d after treatment were detected. FCM was used to detect the peripheral blood T cell subsets (CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 4 +/CD 8 +). The full automatic biochemical analyzer was used to detect the values of IgG, IgA, and IgM. Results: With the extending of treatment time, the congestion area and ulcer area were significantly reduced when compared with the before treatment, and the reduced degree in the observation group was significantly superior to that in the control group. After treatment, CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 4 +/CD 8 + were significantly elevated, while CD 8 + was significantly reduced when compared with the before treatment, and those in the observation group were significantly superior to those in the control group. After treatment, the values of IgG, IgA, and IgM were not significantly changed when compared with the before treatment, and the comparison between the two groups was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Compound indigo naturalis paster in combined with Zhibo Dihuang pill in the treatment of ROU can effectively regulate the balance state of T cell subsets, improve the immunological function, shrink the congestion area and ulcer area, and enhance the therapeutic effect; therefore, it deserves to be widely recommended in the clinic...|$|R
