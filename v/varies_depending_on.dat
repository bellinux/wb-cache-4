5|$|This bird is monogamous, forming {{long lasting}} pair bonds, with pairs of grey-necked wood rails staying {{together}} throughout the year. Its breeding season usually occurs between March and August, although this <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> geography. In Costa Rica, the breeding season extends until September. In Mexico, {{on the other}} hand, the breeding season is known to start as early as January. In captivity, this wood rail is territorial.|$|E
5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E

The pleased god conferred goddess-hood on the cow and decreed that all people would worship her and her children – cows. He also gave her a world called Goloka, while her daughters would reside on earth among humans.|$|E
5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur, and usually precede the onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E
5|$|Some changes {{introduced}} into Devil May Cry 4 are {{the presence of}} two playable characters, Dante and Nero, and a slight modification to the shop system.

5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> {{location}} and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important}} part of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} follows at 3 to 5 days, and {{is marked by}} {{complications}} of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks.

5|$|Pope John XXIII issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal Encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops {{in a particular area}} or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the circumstances and is not necessarily ex cathedra. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E

5|$|The Leslie was {{originally}} designed to mimic the complex tones and constantly shifting sources of sound emanating from {{a large group of}} ranks in a pipe organ. The effect <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the speed of the rotors, which can be toggled between fast (tremolo) and slow (chorale) using a console half-moon or pedal switch, with the most distinctive effect occurring as the speaker rotation speed changes. The most popular Leslies were the 122, which accepted a balanced signal suitable for console organs, and the 147, which accepted an unbalanced signal and could be used for spinet organs with a suitable adapter. The Pro-Line series of Leslies which were made to be portable for gigging bands using solid-state amps were popular during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout {{at some point in their}} lifetimes. The risk, however, <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{provides}} good locality of reference, {{which causes}} it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, {{it can provide}} very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step <b>varies</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> its position within the probe sequence.|$|E
