The onset of these pathologic events is before viremia and independent of leukocyte infection, indicating a host-mediated effect possibly through a cytokine storm. Here, we show that high serum levels of interferon- ¿ (IFN-¿) were found during this phase of CSF, detectable as early as 2 days postinfection and reaching maximum levels 3 ¿ 5 days postinfection (250 ¿ 1300 U/mL).

A progressive depletion of natural IFN-producing cells/plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), the likely in vivo source of IFN-¿, was also induced by the viral infection. An important finding was that the onset of severe lymphopenia was concomitant with the IFN-¿ responses, and all animals with serum IFN-¿ had depleted B and T lymphocytes. A statistically significant correlation between lymphocyte depletion and serum IFN-¿ indicates a relationship between the two events, which is supported by the known hematologic effects of high IFN-¿ doses in viv...|$|E

40|$|Hantaviruses infect human endothelial {{cells and}} cause two {{vascular}} permeability-based diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Hantavirus infection {{alone does not}} permeabilize endothelial cell monolayers. However, pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit the function of αvβ 3 integrins on endothelial cells, and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> and vascular permeability deficits are consequences of dysfunctional β 3 integrins that normally regulate permeabilizing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) responses. Here we show that pathogenic Hantaan, Andes, and New York- 1 hantaviruses dramatically enhance the permeability of endothelial cells in response to VEGF, while the nonpathogenic hantaviruses Prospect Hill and Tula {{have no effect on}} endothelial cell permeability. Pathogenic hantaviruses directed endothelial cell permeability 2 to 3 days postinfection, coincident with pathogenic hantavirus inhibition of αvβ 3 integrin functions, and hantavirus-directed permeability was inhibited by antibodies to VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR 2). These studies demonstrate that pathogenic hantaviruses, similar to αvβ 3 integrin-deficient cells, specifically enhance VEGF-directed permeabilizing responses. Using the hantavirus permeability assay we further demonstrate that the endothelial-cell-specific growth factor angiopoietin 1 (Ang- 1) and the platelet-derived lipid mediator sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) inhibit hantavirus directed endothelial cell permeability at physiologic concentrations. These results demonstrate the utility of a hantavirus permeability assay and rationalize the testing of Ang- 1, S 1 P, and antibodies to VEGFR 2 as potential hantavirus therapeutics. The central importance of β 3 integrins and VEGF responses in vascular leak and <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> further suggest that altering β 3 or VEGF responses may be a common feature of additional <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diseases.</b> As a result, our findings provide a potential mechanism for vascular leakage after infection by pathogenic hantaviruses and the means to inhibit hantavirus-directed endothelial cell permeability that may be applicable to additional vascular leak syndromes...|$|R

It has been proposed, but not documented, that both plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs) may {{participate in the}} cytokine storm encountered in these infections. In order to evaluate the contribution of DCs in hemorrhagic virus pathogenesis, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis during infection by Bluetongue virus (BTV), a double-stranded RNA virus that induces hemorrhagic fever in sheep and initially infects cDCs. Both pDCs and cDCs accumulated in regional lymph nodes and spleen during BTV infection. The gene response profiles were performed {{at the onset of}} the disease and markedly differed with the DC subtypes and their lymphoid organ location. An integrative knowledge-based analysis revealed that blood pDCs displayed a gene signature related to activation of systemic inflammation and permeability of vasculature. In contrast, the gene profile of pDCs and cDCs in lymph nodes was oriented to inhibition of inflammation, whereas spleen cDCs did not show a clear functional orientation. These analyses indicate that tissue location and DC subtype affect the functional gene expression program induced by BTV and suggest the involvement of blood pDCs in the inflammation and plasma leakage/hemorrhage during BTV infection in the real natural host of the virus. These findings open the avenue to target DCs for therapeutic interventions in <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Some {{individuals}} {{infected with}} dengue virus develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), a <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> {{characterized by a}} transient period of localized plasma leakage. To determine the importance of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in this syndrome, we compared plasma levels of VEGF-A and the soluble forms of its receptors in patients with DHF to patients with dengue fever (DF), a milder form of dengue virus infection without plasma leakage. We observed {{a rise in the}} plasma levels of free, but not total VEGF-A in DHF patients at the time of plasma leakage. This was associated with a decline in the soluble form of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR 2) and VEGF-soluble VEGFR 2 complexes, but not the soluble form of VEGFR 1. The severity of plasma leakage in patients inversely correlated with plasma levels of soluble VEGFR 2. In vitro, dengue virus suppressed soluble VEGFR 2 production by endothelial cells but up-regulated surface VEGFR 2 expression and promoted response to VEGF stimulation. In vivo, plasma viral load correlated with the degree of decline in plasma soluble VEGFR 2. These results suggest that VEGF regulates vascular permeability and its activity is controlled by binding to soluble VEGFR 2. Dengue virus-induced changes in surface and soluble VEGFR 2 expression may be an important mechanism of plasma leakage in DHF...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endothelial {{activation}} and dysfunction play {{a central}} role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> fevers. Hantaviral <b>disease</b> is a <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> fever and is characterized by capillary dysfunction, although the underlying mechanisms for hantaviral disease are not fully elucidated. METHODS: The temporal course of endothelial activation and repair were analyzed during Puumala hantavirus infection and associated with disease outcome and a marker for hypoxia, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP- 1). The following endothelial activation markers were studied: endothelial glycocalyx degradation (syndecan- 1) and leukocyte adhesion molecules (soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and endothelial selectin). Cytokines associated with vascular repair were also analyzed (vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, angiopoietin, and stromal cell-derived factor 1). RESULTS: Most of the markers we studied were highest during the earliest phase of hantaviral disease and associated with clinical and laboratory surrogate markers for disease outcome. In particular, the marker for glycocalyx degradation, syndecan- 1, was significantly associated with levels of thrombocytes, albumin, IGFBP- 1, decreased blood pressure, and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Hantaviral disease outcome was associated with endothelial dysfunction. Consequently, the endothelium warrants further investigation when designing future medical interventions...|$|R

Due to several factors inherent to filoviruses, they are considered a potential bioweapon that could be disseminated via an aerosol route. Previous studies demonstrated that MARV virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the glycoprotein (GP), matrix protein VP 40 and nucleoprotein (NP) generated using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system could protect macaques from subcutaneous (SQ) challenge with multiple species of marburgviruses. In the current study, the protective efficacy of the MARV VLPs in conjunction with two different adjuvants: QS- 21, a saponin derivative, and poly I:C against homologous aerosol challenge was assessed in cynomolgus macaques. Antibody responses against the GP antigen were equivalent in all groups receiving MARV VLPs irrespective of the adjuvant; adjuvant only-vaccinated macaques did not demonstrate appreciable antibody responses. All macaques were subsequently challenged with lethal doses of MARV via aerosol or SQ as a positive control. All MARV VLP-vaccinated macaques survived either aerosol or SQ challenge while animals administered adjuvant only exhibited clinical signs and lesions consistent with MARV disease and were euthanized after meeting the predetermined criteria. Therefore, MARV VLPs induce IgG antibodies recognizing MARV GP and VP 40 and protect cynomolgus macaques from an otherwise lethal aerosol exposure with MARV...|$|R

Therefore a survey of apparently healthy pigs was undertaken to show the extent they habour the antibodies and antigen of ASFV and later determine the genetic diversity of the virus ASF in Kamuli, Mukono and Masaka districts of Uganda using serological, molecular and genotyping techniques. In total 1, 192 blood and sera samples were collected and analyzed. All the pigs tested except one (1 / 1192) were negative for (ASFV) and none for antibodies indicating that ASFV causes a paracute / acute infection in Ugandan pigs with rare detection of virus or antibodies in apparently healthy pigs. Therefore chronically infected pigs are unlikely to be important in the epidemiology of ASF. The positive pig in Kamuli district was infected with genotype IX, the most common circulating ASFV genotype in Uganda. With one positive pig for ASFV, {{it was not possible to}} authoritatively associate predictors of infection with disease in tested pig farms.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain {{information}} on rabbit meat consumption habits and rabbit production in Xocotlan, a rural community in Mexico. In the first part of the study, 20 families were requested to describe the rabbit production situation in the community, before 1989 and during 1995. Results indicated that before 1989, the percent of rabbit breeders was 70 % of the population while during 1995 a decline to 45 % was noticed. This fact can be explained by the outbreak of the <b>Viral</b> <b>Hemorrhagic</b> <b>Disease</b> in 1989. The percentage of the breeders that raised one to five does before 1989 was 64 % and decreased to 55 % in 1995. Seventy two percent of the breeders before 1989 assigned their production to self-consumption while in 1995 this percentage increased to 89 %. Moreover, the breeders that ate rabbit meat one to two times per month before 1989 was 79 % while in 1995 this percent reduced to 67 %. In the second part of the study, a rabbit production program was performed with nine families, five from Xocotlan and four from Purificacion. The results showed that one family from Xocotlan got a litter size at birth of 9. 5 ± 1. 7 kits, while two families did not get any results due to abnormal behaviour of the does. In general, the breeders from Xocotlan obtained higher performance than those from Purificacion.

40|$|Abstract 	Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), {{formerly}} known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a re-emerging zoonotic disease that has caused periodic outbreaks since the first reported outbreak in 1976. In 2014, in West Africa, the largest outbreak of ebolavirus in history emerged, affecting close to 30, 000 people; more than 10, 000 of these individuals died. This virus, which causes fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates, has the highest mortality rate (2590 %) among the <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> fever <b>diseases.</b> Ebolavirus is transmitted through the blood and body fluids of infected animals and humans, {{as well as through}} contaminated materials. The virus is often spread in the hospital setting, and it is classified as a biosafety level 4 agent. Accordingly, diagnostic procedures and infected patient care should be performed at the highest safety levels. The potential therapies and vaccines against EVD have continued developing or been used in emergency situations during last outbreak. Some of these include the cAd 3 and rVSV-Ebola vaccines and new treatment modalities, such as passive immunization, brincidofovir, and ZMapp. Although these trials have shown different levels of success, there are no standardized treatments or vaccines that have been approved for humans. Such prevention {{is the only way to}} reduce human infection and the spread of outbreaks and is primarily based on personal protection measures and raising awareness of the risk factors.

40|$|Dengue is a mosquito-borne <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> {{that is a}} {{major threat}} to human health in {{tropical}} and subtropical re-gions. Here we report crystal structures of a peptide covalently bound to dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV- 3) protease as well as the serine-protease inhibitor aprotinin bound to the same enzyme. These structures reveal, for the first time, a catalytically ac-tive, closed conformation of the DENV protease. In the presence of the peptide, the DENV- 3 protease forms the closed confor-mation in which the hydrophilic -hairpin region of NS 2 B wraps around the NS 3 protease core, in a manner analogous to the structure ofWest Nile virus (WNV) protease. Our results confirm that flavivirus proteases form the closed conformation during proteolysis, as previously proposed forWNV. The current DENV- 3 protease structures reveal the detailed interactions at the P 4 = to P 3 sites of the substrate. The new structural information explains the sequence preference, particularly for long basic residues in the nonprime side, as well as the difference in substrate specificity between theWNV and DENV proteases at the prime side. Structural analysis of the DENV- 3 protease-peptide complex revealed a pocket that is formed by residues fromNS 2 B and NS 3; this pocket also exists in theWNVNS 2 B/NS 3 protease structure and could be targeted for potential antivirus development. The structural information presented in the current study is invaluable for the design of specific inhibitors of DENV protease.

40|$|Infection {{with yellow}} fever virus (YFV), an explosively replicating flavivirus, results in <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> {{characterized}} by cardiovascular shock and multi-organ failure. Unvaccinated populations experience 20 to 50 % fatality. Few {{studies have examined the}} pathophysiological changes that occur in humans during YFV infection due to the sporadic nature and remote locations of outbreaks. Rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to YFV infection, providing a robust animal model to investigate host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we characterized disease progression as well as alterations in immune system homeostasis, cytokine production and gene expression in rhesus macaques infected with the virulent YFV strain DakH 1279 (YFV-DakH 1279). Following infection, YFV-DakH 1279 replicated to high titers resulting in viscerotropic disease with ∼ 72 % mortality. Data presented in this manuscript demonstrate {{for the first time that}} lethal YFV infection results in profound lymphopenia that precedes the hallmark changes in liver enzymes and that although tissue damage was noted in liver, kidneys, and lymphoid tissues, viral antigen was only detected in the liver. These observations suggest that additional tissue damage could be due to indirect effects of viral replication. Indeed, circulating levels of several cytokines peaked shortly before euthanasia. Our study also includes the first description of YFV-DakH 1279 -induced changes in gene expression within peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3 days post-infection prior to any clinical signs. These data show that infection with wild type YFV-DakH 1279 or live-attenuated vaccine strain YFV- 17 D, resulted in 765 and 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. DEGs detected after YFV- 17 D infection were mostly associated with innate immunity, whereas YFV-DakH 1279 infection resulted in dysregulation of genes associated with the development of immune response, ion metabolism, and apoptosis. Therefore, WT-YFV infection is associated with significant changes in gene expression that are detectable before the onset of clinical symptoms and may influence disease progression and outcome of infection...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Yellow fever (YF) is {{an acute}} <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>disease</b> {{transmitted}} by Aedes mosquitoes. The causative agent, the {{yellow fever virus}} (YFV), is found in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Although a vaccine is available since the 1930 s, YF still causes thousands of deaths and several outbreaks have recently occurred in Africa. Therefore, rapid and reliable diagnostic methods easy to perform in low-resources settings could {{have a major impact}} on early detection of outbreaks and implementation of appropriate response strategies such as vaccination and/or vector control. METHODOLOGY The aim of this study was to develop a YFV nucleic acid detection method applicable in outbreak investigations and surveillance studies in low-resource and field settings. The method should be simple, robust, rapid and reliable. Therefore, we adopted an isothermal approach and developed a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay which can be performed with a small portable instrument and easy-to-use lyophilized reagents. The assay was developed in three different formats (real-time with or without microfluidic semi-automated system and lateral-flow assay) to evaluate their application for different purposes. Analytical specificity and sensitivity were evaluated with a wide panel of viruses and serial dilutions of YFV RNA. Mosquito pools and spiked human plasma samples were also tested for assay validation. Finally, real-time RPA in portable format was tested under field conditions in Senegal. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE The assay was able to detect 20 different YFV strains and demonstrated no cross-reactions with closely related viruses. The RPA assay proved to be a robust, portable method with a low detection limit (< 21 genome equivalent copies per reaction) and rapid processing time (< 20 min). Results from real-time RPA field testing were comparable to results obtained in the laboratory, thus confirming our method is suitable for YFV detection in low-resource settings...|$|E

40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> fevers (VHFs) {{refer to}} a group of {{illnesses}} that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. In general, the term "viral hemorrhagic fever" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected). Characteristically, the overall vascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. These symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however, the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. While some types of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses, many of these viruses cause severe, life-threatening disease. The Special Pathogens Branch (SPB) primarily works with hemorrhagic fever viruses that are classified as biosafety level four (BSL- 4) pathogens. A list of these viruses appears in the SPB disease information index. The Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, also in the National Center for Infectious Diseases, works with the non-BSL- 4 viruses that cause two other hemorrhagic fevers, dengue hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever.

40|$|Crimean-Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} (CCHF) is a {{zoonotic}} viral disease that is asymptomatic in infected animals, but {{a serious threat}} to humans. Human infections begin with nonspecific febrile symptoms, but progress to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome with a high case fatality rate. Although the causative virus is often transmitted by ticks, animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission also occur. This disease is a particular threat to farmers and other agricultural workers, veterinarians, laboratory workers and hospital personnel. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever {{is one of the most}} widely distributed <b>viral</b> <b>hemorrhagic</b> fevers. This <b>disease</b> occurs in much of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, as well as parts of Europe. Changes in climatic conditions could expand the range of its tick vectors, and increase the incidence of disease. The CCHF virus is also a potential bioterrorist agent; it has been listed in the U. S. as a CDC/NIAID Category C priority pathogen. Etiology Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). This virus is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. It belongs to the CCHF serogroup. Although early serological studies revealed very few differences between strains of CCHFV, nucleic acid sequence analysis has demonstrated extensive genetic diversity, particularly between viruses from different geographic regions...|$|R
