Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school <b>voucher</b> <b>program</b> was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and would be available to all state residents by 2014.|$|E

Daniels was reelected to a second term, defeating former U.S. Representative and US Department of Agriculture undersecretary Jill Long Thompson, on November 4, 2008. During his tenure as governor, Daniels cut the state government workforce by 18%, cut and capped state property taxes, and balanced the state budget through budget austerity measures and increasing spending by less than the inflation rate. In his second term, Daniels saw protest by labor unions and Democrats {{in the state legislature}} over his policies regarding Indiana's school <b>voucher</b> <b>program</b> and the Indiana House of Representatives attempt to pass right to work legislation, leading to the 2011 Indiana legislative walkouts. During the legislature's last session under Daniels, he signed the right-to-work law; with Indiana becoming the 23rd state in the nation to do so.|$|E

30|$|For the {{purposes}} of this assessment, indications for how the use of different assistance modalities may influence the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance were sought. For the most part, stakeholder preferences for either cash or in-kind assistance were driven by their perception of intervention effectiveness in a given context. Cash transfers were widely perceived as the most effective modality, assuming currency values remain relatively stable. In-kind assistance was perceived as less effective than cash transfers because beneficiaries may need to sell some items received to purchase more needed items and resale is likely to occur below market value. Finally, <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> were perceived to be the least effective modality, not {{because of a lack of}} functional markets or any objections to the way <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> are intended to work but because of concerns that <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> are more susceptible to fraud or manipulation than other assistance modalities.|$|R

He sponsored the Education A-Plus bill in 1997 and again in 1999, which would have allowed parents to open tax-free savings accounts for their children's school expenses, such as tutoring, computers and books.

40|$|School <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> (a. k. a. {{opportunity}} scholarships) are scholarship programs - frequently government funded - {{that pay}} {{for students to}} attend private schools of their choice.

Although private schools have long offered various forms of financial assistance, many of these privately funded <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> are different from traditional scholarship efforts in two key respects: they are open to any applicant {{solely on the basis}} of family income level, and recipients are free to decide which schools their children should attend. The 78 privately funded <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> GAO reviewed shared numerous characteristics and faced common challenges, but the programs varied widely in the dollar amount of the vouchers awarded and the number of students receiving them. The average voucher amount in school year 2001 - 2002 ranged widely among programs, from $ 600 to $ 2, 000 per student, and program size ranged from as few as four students to over 3, 000 students. Beyond the information needed to determine eligibility and conduct financial oversight, most programs reported collecting little data about participating students, their families, or the schools they attended. Program officials said that <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> face two major challenges [...] sustaining programs for the long term and retaining students in the programs. Some programs have begun developing ways to address these challenges. Rigorous evaluations of privately funded <b>voucher</b> <b>programs</b> in New York, Dayton, and Washington, D. C., provided some evidence that African Americans students who used vouchers to attend private schools showed greater improvements in math and reading than students in the comparison group and have also found that the parents of voucher users of all racial and ethnic groups were consistently more satisfied with their children's education than parents of comparison group students. ...|$|R
