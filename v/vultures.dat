50|$|The {{red-headed}} <b>vulture</b> (Sarcogyps calvus), {{also known}} as the Asian king <b>vulture,</b> Indian black <b>vulture</b> or Pondicherry <b>vulture,</b> is an Old World <b>vulture</b> mainly found in the Indian subcontinent, with small disjunct populations in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|The white-backed <b>vulture</b> (Gyps africanus) is an Old World <b>vulture</b> in {{the family}} Accipitridae, which also {{includes}} eagles, kites, buzzards and hawks. It {{is closely related to}} the European griffon <b>vulture,</b> G. fulvus. Sometimes it is called African white-backed <b>vulture</b> to distinguish it from the Oriental white-backed <b>vulture</b> — nowadays usually called white-rumped <b>vulture</b> — to which it was formerly believed to be closely related.|$|R

50|$|Rüppell's <b>vulture</b> or Rüppell's griffon <b>vulture</b> (Gyps rueppelli) {{is a large}} <b>vulture</b> {{that occurs}} {{throughout}} the Sahel region of central Africa. The current population of 30,000 is decreasing due to loss of habitat, incidental poisoning, and other factors. Known also as Rüppell's griffon, Rueppell's griffon, Rüppell's griffin <b>vulture,</b> Rueppell's <b>vulture</b> and other variants, {{it is not to}} be confused with a different species, the griffon <b>vulture</b> (Gyps fulvus). Rüppell's <b>vulture</b> is named in honor of Eduard Rüppell, a 19th-century German explorer, collector, and zoologist. Rüppell's <b>vulture</b> is considered to be the highest-flying bird, with confirmed evidence of a flight at an altitude of 11300 m above sea level.|$|R
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> {{and has a}} shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture's</b> dark, glossy black plumage. Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head of the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> Its flight is also less steady {{than that of the}} greater yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> The lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> also prefers to live in savannas, as opposed to the preferred forest habitat of the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The fertile {{volcanic}} {{soil of the}} <b>Vulture</b> is suitable for the cultivation of grapes and olives. The DOC wine Aglianico del <b>Vulture</b> is produced in the region, as are Aglianico dolce, a dessert wine, Aglianico di Filiano, Malvasia del <b>Vulture</b> and Moscato del <b>Vulture.</b> The area of Monte <b>Vulture</b> has numerous springs, and several brands of mineral water are bottled there.|$|R
5|$|King <b>vultures,</b> which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed <b>vultures</b> to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example of mutual {{dependence}} between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey <b>vultures</b> and king <b>vultures,</b> due to their larger size.|$|E
5|$|New World <b>vultures</b> are not {{closely related}} to Old World <b>vultures,</b> but superficially {{resemble}} them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World <b>vultures,</b> they are scavengers. Unlike Old World <b>vultures,</b> which find carcasses by sight, New World <b>vultures</b> have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black <b>vultures</b> at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow <b>vultures</b> to approach it. The <b>vultures</b> swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the <b>vultures.</b> Black <b>vultures</b> have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|E
5000|$|In 1863, after Henry Wickenburg {{discovered}} the <b>Vulture</b> Mine, <b>Vulture</b> City a small mining town {{was established in}} the area. The town once had a population of 5,000 citizens After the mine closed the city was deserted and became a ghost town. The following are images with {{a brief description of the}} <b>Vulture</b> Mine and <b>Vulture</b> City, both located in the <b>Vulture</b> Mountains. Some of the structures are still present in what once was known as <b>Vulture</b> City located in the mountain.|$|R

5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World <b>vultures</b> remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World <b>vultures</b> evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World <b>vultures</b> are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World <b>vultures</b> or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World <b>vultures</b> from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World <b>vultures,</b> the king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E
5|$|The exact taxonomic {{placement}} of the Andean condor and the remaining six species of New World <b>vultures</b> remains unclear.

5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> in several ways. It {{is larger than}} the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture,</b> with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture's</b> browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed <b>vulture.</b> The greater yellow-headed <b>vulture</b> is also somewhat larger than the turkey <b>vulture.</b> It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey <b>vulture</b> but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|R

50|$|The {{average length}} of adult birds is about 96 - 115 cm with a {{wingspan}} of 2.26 - 2.6 m and a body weight of 7 - 11 kg. The two prominent bare skin patches {{at the base of}} the neck, also found in the white-backed <b>vulture,</b> are thought to be temperature sensors and used for detecting the presence of thermals. The species is among the largest raptors in Africa, next to the lappet-faced <b>vulture.</b> After the Himalayan griffon <b>vulture</b> and the cinereous <b>vulture,</b> the Cape <b>vulture</b> is the third largest Old World <b>vulture.</b>|$|R

5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the <b>vultures,</b> suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the <b>vultures,</b> affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E

5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other <b>vultures.</b> It may follow New World <b>vultures</b> {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes <b>vultures</b> forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller <b>vultures</b> cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black <b>vultures</b> (Coragyps atratus), king <b>vultures</b> (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes <b>vultures</b> for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
