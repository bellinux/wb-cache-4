Segmentation involves composing a memory address from two parts, a segment and an offset; the segment points to the beginning of a 64 KB group of addresses and the offset determines how far from this beginning address the desired address is. In segmented addressing, two registers are required for a complete memory address: one to hold the segment, the other to hold the offset. In order to translate back into a flat address, the segment <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>shifted</b> four bits left (equivalent to multiplication by 24 or 16) then added to the offset to form the full address, which allows breaking the 64k barrier through clever choice of addresses, though it makes programming considerably more complex.|$|E

In mineral media, isoelectric points {{were found to be}} 8. 45 ± 0. 15. This <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>shifted</b> from the solution isoelectric point by – 0. 35 ± 0. 15, due to the contribution of solvation energy to the energy of ionic adsorption.

The influence of oxalic acidity on mobility may be described in terms of two successive adsorption equilibria, the first one conducive to the neutralization of positive protonic charge, and the second one originating a charge reversal. It is shown that the apparent affinity for this latter mode is lower in one of the samples, suggesting that surface complexation constants may in fact be sensitive to the history of hydrous chromium(III) oxide particles. The three samples show similar dissolution behaviour but the specific rates differ, in one case by two orders of magnitude.

40|$|Uptake of {{glutamate}} {{from the}} synaptic cleft is mediated by high affinity transporters and {{is driven by}} Na+, K+, and H+ concentration gradients across the membrane. Here, we characterize the molecular mechanism of the intracellular pH change associated with glutamate transport by combining current recordings from excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC 1) –expressing HEK 293 cells with a rapid kinetic technique with a 100 -μs time resolution. Under conditions of steady state transport, the affinity of EAAC 1 for glutamate in both the forward and reverse modes {{is strongly dependent on}} the pH on the cis-side of the membrane, whereas the currents at saturating glutamate concentrations are hardly affected by the pH. Consistent with this, the kinetics of the pre–steady state currents, measured after saturating glutamate concentration jumps, are not a function of the pH. In addition, we determined the deuterium isotope effect on EAAC 1 kinetics, which is in agreement with proton cotransport but not OH− countertransport. The results can be quantitatively explained with an ordered binding model that includes a rapid proton binding step to the empty transporter followed by glutamate binding and translocation of the proton-glutamate-transporter complex.

The frequency properties of a sampled signal are exploited to obtain both frequency up-conversion and frequency down-conversion of {{quadrature phase shift keying}} (QPSK) data. An optical pulse source, generating 10 -ps-width pulses at a repetition rate of 7. 8 GHz used as a sampling signal, allows operation in the range of 0. 5 – 39. 5 GHz. The conversion gain of the all-optical sampling mixer is measured over the whole frequency range. It varies over this range from 20. 4 to 0 dB for frequency down-conversion and from 15. 5 to − 13. 4 dB for frequency up-conversion. QPSK data at symbol rates between 8 and 128 MSymb/s are frequency converted. The Error Vector Magnitude is used to evaluate the quality of the frequency conversion. Exploitable error vector magnitudes (EVMs) in the range of 14 % to 27. 4 % are reached for frequency up-conversion to the higher target frequency for all the symbol rates. For down-conversion, the EVM varies from 6. 7 % to 29. 2 % at the symbol rate of 64 MSymb/s for the whole frequency range.

40|$|Multi-coil {{electromagnetic}} induction (EMI) systems sense different depth levels and offer {{the potential to}} estimate the vertical subsurface electrical conductivity distribution with a high spatial resolution. However, due to the complicated and overlapping sensitivity functions of each coil configuration, it is not straightforward to characterize a layered subsurface. Moreover, EMI measurements are influenced by external conditions such as the operator, field set-up, cables or any other current conducting material close the system, such that the recorded <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>shifted,</b> which hinders a quantitative interpretation of the measured apparent electrical conductivities (ECa). Therefore, measured ECa need to be calibrated and inverted to obtain a reliable layered subsurface electrical model. The calibration is performed by a linear regression between predicted ECa, obtained from an electromagnetic (EM) forward model that numerically solves the Maxwell equations to predict ECa using inverted electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data recorded at a small transect as input, and collocated measured EMI-ECa. The coil specific regression parameters are then used to calibrate the large-scale EMI data. Next, the calibrated multi-coil EMI data are re-gridded to a common grid, such that a one dimensional (1 D) multi-layer conductivity inversion can be performed. To invert the quantitative ECa, we use a parallelized version of the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) optimization and minimize the misfit between the measured and modelled data obtained from the full-solution EM forward model using the L 1 -norm while assuming a horizontally layered earth. The obtained 1 D-models at each grid node are stitched {{together to form a}} 3 D subsurface volume. We applied this method to a data set obtained at an experimental field covering an area of 11400 m 2. The smoothly changing lateral and vertical electrical conductivity model was validated with grain size distribution maps and two previously measured 120 m long ERT transects. Overall, the subsurface model obtained with the quasi- 3 D EMI inversion and the independent ERT inversions showed similar subsurface structures. Differences in absolute electrical conductivity values within certain layers are probably due to the varying soil moisture content. These findings indicate that EMI can be successfully used to quantitatively characterize the lateral and vertical electrical conductivity structures at the field scale and beyond...|$|E
40|$|Beam {{hardening}} filters {{have long}} been employed in X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) to preferentially absorb soft and low-energy X-rays having no or little contribution to image formation, thus allowing the reduction of patient dose and beam hardening artefacts. In this work, we studied the influence of additional copper (Cu) and aluminium (Al) flat filters on patient dose and image quality and seek an optimum filter thickness for the GE LightSpeed VCT 64 -slice CT scanner using experimental phantom measurements. Different thicknesses of Cu and Al filters (0. 5 - 1. 6 mm Cu, 0. 5 - 4 mm Al) were installed on the scanner's collimator. A planar phantom consisting of 13 slabs of Cu having different thicknesses was designed and scanned {{to assess the impact}} of beam filtration on contrast in the intensity domain (CT detector's output). To assess image contrast and image noise, a cylindrical phantom consisting of a polyethylene cylinder having 16 holes filled with different concentrations of K 2 HPO 4 solution mimicking different tissue types was used. The GE performance and the standard head CT dose index (CTDI) phantoms were also used to assess image resolution characterized by the modulation transfer function (MTF) and patient dose defined by the weighted CTDI. A 100 mm pencil ionization chamber was used for CTDI measurement. Finally, an optimum filter thickness was determined from an objective figure of merit (FOM) metric. The results show that the contrast is somewhat compromised with filter thickness in both the planar and cylindrical phantoms. The contrast of the K 2 HPO 4 solutions in the cylindrical phantom was degraded by up to 10 % for a 0. 68 mm Cu filter and 6 % for a 4. 14 mm Al filter. It was shown that additional filters increase image noise which impaired the detectability of low density K 2 HPO 4 solutions. It was found that with a 0. 48 mm Cu filter the 50 % MTF <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>shifted</b> by about 0. 77 lp/cm compared to the case where the filter is not used. An added Cu filter with approximately 0. 5 mm thickness accounts for 50 % reduction in radiation-absorbed dose as measured by the weighted CTDI. The FOM results indicate that with an additional filter of 0. 5 mm Cu or minimum 4 mm Al, a good compromise between image quality and patient dose is achieved for CT images acquired at tube voltages of 120 and 140 kVp. The results seem to indicate that an optimum filter for high kVp acquisitions, routinely used in cardiovascular imaging, should be 0. 5 mm copper or 4 mm aluminium minimum.

Whilst numerous reports exist on polymers which respond to single stimulus such as temperature, light, pH, redox, etc., the examples of multiple stimuli responsive polymers are limited. This study deals with the preparation and characterisation of polymers comprising of calix[4]arene or dibenzo- 18 -crown- 6 -ether units, which have been joined by azo-bridges. The objectives and synthetic pathways towards monomer and polymer formation are evaluated and the best methods are highlighted as being versatile and promising for the synthesis {{of a wide range of}} main chain azopolymers. As a result of their intricate design, the polymers are capable of response to irradiation by means of reversible trans-to-cis photo-isomerization of the azo-linkages. The extent of the photo-switchability in various solvents is evaluated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and the structural changes upon isomerization are resolved with 1 H NMR analysis. The choice of the calix[4]arene and crown ether units as major chemical components enables interaction of the polymers with low molar mass guests (evidenced by titration experiments monitored by means of 1 H NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy). This supramolecular activity is shown to be influenced by the photo-stationary state of the polymers in the case of poly(azocalix[4]arene) s and thus a serial photo-tuning of the extent of the host-guest interaction is possible. For the poly(azodibenzo- 18 -crown- 6 -ether) s addition of guests leads to phase separation of the polymers from certain solutions. By incorporating tetraethyleneglycol monomethyl ether chains into the lower rim of the calixarene units, thermo-responsive behaviour could be induced onto the poly(azocalix[4]arene) framework. Lower critical solution (LCST) type transitions in water and upper critical solution (UCST) type transitions in alcohols were observed, which are strongly dependent on the degree of polymerization, concentration and choice of solvent. The latter was also demonstrated for the poly(azodibenzo- 18 -crown- 6 -ether) s. In both cases, the UCST type behaviour may be influenced by irradiation. The reversible trans-to-cis photo-isomerization decreases the demixing temperature of the solutions proportionally to the trans content of the samples. Thermal relaxation reverts the isomerization and the cloud point values from prior to irradiation are regained. For the tegylated poly(azocalix[4]arene) s the isomerization may also be induced in the phase separated state, leading to dissolution of the polymers, as the UCST <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>shifted.</b> This may be done locally in a thin 1 mm quartz cuvette, yielding areas of translucency in the polymer dispersion upon irradiation and a possible photo-writing application. The thermo-responsive properties of the crown ether polymers may also be influenced by the addition of barium ions, which act as dynamic intermolecular crosslinkers increasing the cloud point values. These polymers are also shown to be solvatochromic and pH-sensitive...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{its great}} dynamic the water {{content in the}} vadose zone plays an {{important}} role, especially in {{the interaction between the}} atmosphere and pedosphere, while determining evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Among a large number of measurement techniques sensitive to soil moisture, hydrogeophysical methods help to provide information about hydraulic characteristics of the soil. Here, measurements that provide information about the electrical conductivity are preferred since the measurements respond to the soil constituents that conduct electrical current such as soil texture and water content. Many studies used the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method successfully to identify hydrologically active zones because the obtained lateral and vertical resistivity (reciprocal of the conductivity) distribution discriminate the layering of the subsurface. However, this method is laborious from a time perspective and spatially limited since transects with stationary fixed electrodes have to be used to feed the current into the ground. Here, inductively coupled systems such as electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors offer a great potential to map the soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) over large areas in a non-invasive manner in relatively short times. Recently, multi-configuration systems became commercially available, that enable the simultaneous sensing over different depth ranges. However, due to the complicated and overlapping sensitivity functions of each coil configuration, it is not straightforward to obtain a layered electrical conductivity distribution indispensable for catchment investigations. Moreover, the measurements are influenced by external conditions such as the operator, field set-up, cables or any other current conducting material close to the system, such that the recorded <b>value</b> <b>is</b> <b>shifted,</b> which hinders a quantitative interpretation of the measured ECa. In the current work, we use an advanced calibration and novel multi-configuration EMI inversion procedure to obtain a layered subsurface model that indicates lateral and vertical changes in the soil constitutions and/or soil moisture distribution at the field scale and beyond. Using an all-terrain-vehicle, large-scale measurements were made with an EMI sensor that houses three different transmitter-receiver pairs with a certain coil offset oriented with vertical coplanar loops (VCP) or horizontal coplanar loops (HCP). Hence, six georeferenced data sets of approximately 55000 measurements were recorded with different sensing depths at the 11400 m 2 large Selhausen (Germany) test site. We calibrated the large-scale measurements using a 30 m short ERT transect and inverted the obtained quantitative EMI-ECa with the novel multi-configuration inversion that is based on a parallelized version of the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm. The results were stitched together to form a quasi- 3 D model presented in figure 1. Smoothly varying electrical conductivities and layer thicknesses coincide with results obtained in earlier studies. Low resolution grain size distribution maps showed a distinct gradient in soil texture with considerably high gravel content at the eastern part and increasing sand and loam content towards the west. The quasi- 3 D model reflects these findings by low conductivity values that are present at the eastern part and increasing electrical conductivity values towards the western direction. Moreover, two formerly measured 120 m long ERT transects confirmed the obtained structural subsurface patterns. Note that the measurements of a 120 m long ERT transect need about a day, whereas the EMI survey of the 190 x 60 m large test site was performed within three to four hours...|$|E

The DMC E 2 D - E 3 D <b>values</b> <b>are</b> - 5.13, 0.79, and - 0.47 eV for B 12, B 12 H 6, and B 12 F 6, respectively, whereas the corresponding B 3 LYP <b>values</b> <b>are</b> - 5.34, 0.41, and - 0.63 eV, respectively (see Figure 3). This means that the DMC <b>values</b> <b>are</b> <b>shifted</b> up by a value not larger than about 0.4 eV with respect to the B 3 LYP values. This, however, does not affect the conclusions that are drawn from Figure 3, since even if we shift up the curves by 0.4 eV, the quasi-planar B 12 H [...]...|$|R
40|$|Rare earth element (REE) {{concentrations}} and neodymium {{isotopic composition}} (eNd) are tracers for ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. Although models suggest that REE release from lithogenic sediment in river discharge may dominate all other REE inputs to the oceans, the occurrence, mechanisms {{and magnitude of}} such a source are still debated. Here we present the first simultaneous observations of dissolved (o 0. 45 mm), colloidal and particulate REE and eNd in the Amazon estuary. A sharp drop in dissolved REE in the low-salinity zone is driven by coagulation of colloidal matter. At mid-salinities, total dissolved REE levels slightly increase, while eNd <b>values</b> <b>are</b> <b>shifted</b> from the dissolved Nd river endmember (8. 9) to values typical of river suspended matter (10. 6). Combining a Nd isotope mass balance with apparent radium isotope ages of estuarine waters suggests a rapid (3 weeks) and globally significant Nd release by dissolution of lithogenic suspended sediments...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the context}} of supergravity-coupled supersymmetry, fields which are gauge and global singlets are usually {{considered}} anathema. Their vacuum expectation <b>values</b> <b>are</b> <b>shifted</b> by quadratically divergent tadpole diagrams which are cutoff at the Planck scale, destabilizing the classical potential and driving the singlet field to large values. We demonstrate a new and generic mechanism which stabilizes the singlet {{in the presence of}} an extended gauge symmetry. Such a symmetry will be broken down to the Standard Model by the supergravity interactions near the scale of spontaneous supersymmetry-breaking in the hidden-sector (∼ 10 10 − 11 GeV). The resulting singlet expectation <b>value</b> <b>is</b> stabilized and naturally of order the gravitino mass, providing therefore a weak-scale mass for the Higgs fields of the supersymmetric Standard Model (a µ-parameter). The resulting low-energy theory is the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model, with all new fields decoupling at the intermediate scale. One of the primary motivations for low-energy supersymmetry (SUSY) is the stabilization of the weak scale (mW) against quadratic divergences which appear a...|$|R
