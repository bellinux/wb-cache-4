40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} maternal deaths attributable to <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection</b> and rupture in the Netherlands, and to assess clinical features, risk factors {{and the frequency of}} substandard care in the cases identified. Design Confidential enquiry into the causes of maternal deaths. Setting Nationwide in the Netherlands. Population A total of 3, 108, 235 live births. Methods Data analysis of all cases of maternal death from <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection</b> and rupture in the period 1993 - 2008. A literature review was also performed. Main outcome measures Incidence, clinical features, risk factors and frequency of substandard care. Results A total of 23 maternal deaths attributable to <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection</b> and rupture were reported. In most cases the location was aortic (n = 13), followed by coronary (n = 4) and splenic (n = 3) arteries. Clinical features were various, but most women presented with sudden unexplainable pain. Risk factors were present in 14 cases (61 %), with hypertension being most frequently reported in ten cases (43 %). Substandard care was determined to have been received in 13 cases (56 %), inadequate assessment of complaints and a delay in diagnosis being the most frequent problems identified. Conclusions <b>Vascular</b> <b>dissection</b> and rupture in pregnancy, although rare, carry a high risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Because of the rarity of this condition and its variety in presentation, diagnosis is easily missed. A high index of suspicion when a woman presents with suggestive complaints, leading to an early diagnosis, may improve the prognosis for the woman and her child. © 2011 RCOG...|$|E

40|$|Dissecting aortic aneurysms, {{generally}} {{involving the}} thoracic aorta, {{have been shown}} to be caused by specific aliphatic amines in developing rats. Whether such lesions might occur spontaneously in control rats is not known. Therefore, in this study, 1, 016 four-day-old, untreated rats culled from ongoing scheduled breeding studies were subjected to gross and histopathological examination in order to create a background con-trol data base on the incidence of spontaneous aortic dissecting aneurysms. Two animals (0. 2 %) were found to have small dissecting aortic aneurysms, and an additional 2 (0. 2 %) had only hemorrhagic lesions. All of these lesions were limited to the region of the ductus arteriosus. An additional 18 findings were judged to be artifacts. These findings suggest that small <b>vascular</b> <b>dissections</b> may rarely occur in the aortic arch adjacent to the ductus arteriosus. Special attention should be paid in experimental studies to avoid confusing these small spontaneous lesions with treatment-induced lesions or artifacts...|$|R
30|$|Diagnosis of {{duplicated}} VA can {{be difficult}} due to its rarity and misinterpreted as the <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection.</b> In addition, a detailed knowledge of this variation is potentially important to prevent inadvertent challenges during endovascular procedure.

30|$|Since {{the advent}} of CT and MRI, angiographies are {{performed}} only rarely in TBI. CT angiography and MRI angiography have such high resolution so that even minor vascular injuries can be detected. The indications for conventional angiography may be summarized as follows: suspicion of a vascular lesion, traumatic vascular occlusion, traumatic aneurysm, <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection,</b> carotid sinus fistula, and exclusion of an aneurysm in subarachnoid hemorrhage (which may have precipitated the TBI).|$|E
30|$|Since {{the surgery}} {{was the right}} middle lobectomy, careful {{attention}} to this A 7 branch was required during interlobular formation. <b>Vascular</b> <b>dissection</b> should be performed carefully in the right lower lobectomy and segmentectomy in patients with this pulmonary arterial distribution.

30|$|An {{analysis}} of the literature reveals that medial transfer of the ipsilateral fibula has been performed mostly as a secondary procedure involving gradual transfer [6, 8, 9, 17] or, in a few cases, as a secondary immediate procedure [7]. These cases generally involve high-energy trauma and always entail large soft tissue and bony–tissue defects. During the healing period, tissue repair and fibrosis impair the normal regional anatomy and interfere with proper <b>vascular</b> microsurgical <b>dissection.</b> Delayed surgery would likely be more challenging {{because of the difficulty}} of neurovascular dissection in an area with adhesive and fibrotic tissue. Therefore, we believe that immediate fibula transfer is preferable, as a first therapeutic step, to delayed surgery in selected cases.|$|R

30|$|The use of {{vascular}} closure devices (VCDs) {{have become}} prominent in endovascular surgery. Their application has allowed for faster achievement of hemostasis at the access site, early recovery following intervention and early mobilization (Biancari et al. 2010). However, reported complications {{can vary from}} infection, <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection,</b> vascular occlusion and distal embolisation (Biancari et al. 2010). Celt ACD® (Vasorum Ltd. Dublin, Ireland) is a distinctive VCD that achieves hemostasis through the delivery of a stainless steel plug, anchored {{on both sides of}} the arterial wall by extendable wings. This case illustrates the surgical retrieval of the device following a complication of distal embolisation.|$|E
30|$|This level {{requires}} {{a more extensive}} <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection,</b> {{in order to get}} a correct exposure of infrahepatic and retrohepatic IVC. After early ligation of renal artery, liver’s posterior surface mobilization will be needed, exposing anterior and lateral surface of IVC. During this step, minor hepatic veins will be dissected, ligated and divided. Once again, total vascular control and circumferential IVC dissection are mandatory. Vascular clamps are placed in contralateral renal vein, below and above the thrombus, and then cavotomy and thrombectomy are performed safely. Nephrectomy is completed and closure of cavotomy is done with 4 - 0 Prolene running suture.|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} of coronary stents {{began in the}} 1980 s {{as a means to}} overcome the restenosis issues related to balloon angioplasty (Hoffmann and Mintz 2000; Kočka et al. 2015). This scheme is based on the introduction of scaffolding of the artery with balloon inflated metallic stents averting early constrictive remodelling, stabilizing <b>vascular</b> <b>dissections</b> and eliminating arteral recoil. Bare metal stents (BMSs) were introduced to alleviate problems seen with balloon angioplasty, e.g. acute vessel closure caused by dissection, elastic recoil, neointimal proliferation and a late occurrence of constrictive remodelling (Hara et al. 2006; O′ Brien et al. 2011; Iqbal et al. 2014; Simard et al. 2014). Generally, the permanent structures were able to maintain a widened lumen and deemed an improvement on balloon angioplasty; however, the occurrences of in-stent restenosis increased with time as a result of neointimal proliferation (Schatz et al. 1991). Although incidences of restenosis declined with BMS implants, vessel narrowing still occurred in 20 – 30 % of stented lesions (Serruys et al. 1994). Bare metal stents also pose a risk to surgical revasculariazation and impaired non-invasive imaging techniques, such as multi-slice computed tomography, used to image an implant in vivo (Agrawal et al. 1992; Serruys et al. 2009; Oberhauser et al. 2009; Nishio et al. 2012). Permanent metallic stents also have potential to jail side branches, prevent expansive positive remodelling and eliminate reactive vasomotion (Ormiston et al. 2008). The risk of complication is even more critical due to fatigue loading, experienced by a stented artery and caused by a compliance disparity between the metal implant and the arterial wall (Nishio et al. 2012). In order to overcome these limitations, research was directed at new types of stents.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{technological}} development of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) has promoted new improvements in diagnosis by means of imaging. In particular the introduction of multislice CT and MR angiography (MRA) has broadened the non-invasive diagnostic possibilities in the vascular study of thorax. The new technological developments of CT and MR enable functional studies as well. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} CT and MR are as accurate in finding the vascular anomalies as digital subtraction angiography, while they are more precise in recognising possible associated pathologies which modify therapeutic treatment (for example of the trachea, bronchi, oesophagus etc.). There are many vascular structures in the thorax which needs to be considered (aorta, pulmonary and coronary arteries, pulmonary veins, vena cava). The field of associated pathologies is also broad, and includes congenital vascular anomalies, <b>vascular</b> malformations, aorta <b>dissection,</b> <b>vascular</b> compression syndromes, atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusions, and pulmonary embolism. In pulmonary embolism some authors have demonstrated the utility of CT, in showing pulmonary segmental perfusion defects, and MRA, in identifying sub-segment pulmonary embolism.

40|$|Abdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} (AAA) {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality; however, the mechanisms that are involved in disease initiation and progression are incompletely understood. Extracellular matrix proteins play an integral role in modulating vascular homeostasis in health and disease. Here, we determined that the expression of the matricellular protein CCN 3 is strongly reduced in rodent AAA models, including angiotensin II-induced AAA and elastase perfusion-stimulated AAA. CCN 3 levels were also reduced in human AAA biopsies compared with those in controls. In murine models of induced AAA, germline deletion of Ccn 3 resulted in severe phenotypes characterized by elastin fragmentation, vessel dilation, <b>vascular</b> inflammation, <b>dissection,</b> heightened ROS generation, and smooth muscle cell loss. Conversely, overexpression of CCN 3 mitigated both elastase- and angiotensin II-induced AAA formation in mice. BM transplantation experiments suggested that the AAA phenotype of CCN 3 -deficient mice is intrinsic to the vasculature, as AAA was not exacerbated in WT animals that received CCN 3 -deficient BM and WT BM did not reduce AAA severity in CCN 3 -deficient mice. Genetic and pharmacological approaches implicated the ERK 1 / 2 pathway as a critical regulator of CCN 3 -dependent AAA development. Together, these results demonstrate that CCN 3 is a nodal regulator in AAA biology and identify CCN 3 as a potential therapeutic target for vascular disease...|$|R

40|$|Intraoperative {{ultrasonography}} (LUS) {{has been}} introduced in order to overcome {{the limits of the}} preoperative imaging modalities (notably, ultrasonography and computed tomography), both in pancreatic cancer diagnosis and staging. The authors' experience encompasses 32 cases, selected according to the following criteria: lesions that could not be detected both preoperatively and at surgical exploration; lesions detected but not properly characterized, requiring differential diagnosis between cancer and pancreatitis; tumoral lesions with a perspective of radical surgery, in which the preoperative judgment of resectability had to be verified. In the only case of the first group, I. US allowed the identification of a small cancer in a jaundiced patient. In the 11 cases of the second group, I. US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsý showed three cancers; however, among the other 8 lesions classified as pancreatitis there was one false negative diagnosis (a tumoral mass with liver metastases was demonstrated by computed tomography 6 mo later). Regarding the intraoperative staging of the proven cancers (20 cases of the third group; 4 cases of the first and second groups), I.

40|$|Background. The “difficult” {{preparation}} of iliac {{vessels in the}} kidney transplant recipient caused by a perivascular fibrosis with satellite lymphadenopathy is sometimes burdened by post-transplant complications (lymphocele, seroma and hematoma). Both iliac vascular adhesions and satellite lymphoadenopaty are often due to reiterate femoral cannulation aimed to hemodialysis. Patients and Methods: The case report concerns a 60 years old female uremic patient, on dialysis for about 4 years with perivascular fibrosis and pelvic lymphadenopathy caused by bilateral femoral artery catheterization. In the course of kidney transplant, {{preparation of}} the iliac vessels was performed by ultrasonic scalpel. In the case we handled there was no incidence of immediate, medium and long term post operative complications, with a considerable reduction of the operative time in the <b>vascular</b> <b>dissection</b> performed without ligation. Often the long dialytic period, the same nephropathy, reiterative femoral catheterization determine perivascular fibrosis and/or consensual lymphadenopathy. In these cases, in light of initial experience, the use of ultrasonic scalpel enables easy dissection by the coagulative synthesis not only of vascular compartment {{but also of the}} lymphatic duct whose leakage, particularly in these cases, creates a favourable condition to hematoma and / or lymphocele formation. These complications, although rarely jeopardize patient’s life, however, may affect the outcome of transplantation in terms of morbidity and survival of the organ. The use of ultrasonic scalpel ensures total control of vascular and lymphatic compartment coagulation, alongside a reduction in the time of surgical dissection...|$|E
