25|$|The Texas {{arrived at}} Hampton Roads at 11:00 A.M. local time on December 25, 1899. The 151 coffins were {{offloaded}} by U.S. Navy personnel {{and transferred to}} funeral barges. Bluejackets accompanied each funeral barge until it reached the railroad pier. The bluejackets transferred the coffins from the barges to the waiting train while a Marine honor guard stood watch. A unit of six bluejackets and six Marines provided an honor guard aboard the train. Jeremiah Shea, fireman who was aboard the Maine on its fateful night, {{was one of the}} six sailors. Accompanying the sailors and marines were Father Chidwick and a lieutenant from the Texas. The funeral train consisted of four baggage cars and a <b>vestibule</b> <b>car</b> with the seats removed. Transferral of the dead from the Texas to the wharf took much longer than anticipated, although only an hour was needed to load the funeral train. Due to the delays, the train did not depart Hampton Roads until 10:00 P.M. local time on December 26. Expected to arrive at 8:00 A.M. on December 27, it did not do so until 11:00 A.M. Captain Sigsbee did not take the funeral train to Washington, but rather rode a steamboat up the Potomac River to reach the city faster.|$|E

5000|$|In 1885, Kersands {{began his}} own {{minstrel}} troupe, named Kersands' Minstrels. Charles Hicks was the manager, {{but he left}} to form his own group after {{little more than a}} year. Kersands' Minstrels was well known for its marching band, and the group led a Mardi Gras parade in 1886. Kersands offered $1000 to any rival who could outmarch them. He also continued to play engagements with other companies, including Richard and Pringle's Georgia Minstrels in 1890 as one of [...] "The <b>Vestibule</b> <b>Car</b> Porters and Drum Majors".|$|E

5000|$|In 1887, George M. Pullman {{introduced}} his patented <b>vestibule</b> <b>cars.</b> Older railroad cars had open platforms at their ends, which were used {{both for joining}} and leaving the train, but {{could also be used}} to step from one car to the next. This practice was dangerous, and so Pullman decided to enclose the platform to produce the vestibule. For passing between cars, there was a passageway {{in the form of a}} steel-framed rectangular diaphragm mounted on a buffing plate above the centre coupler. The vestibule prevented passengers from falling out, and protected passengers from the weather when passing between cars. In the event of an accident, the design also helped prevent cars from overriding each other, reducing the risk of telescoping. Pullman's <b>vestibule</b> <b>cars</b> were first used in 1887. Among the first to use them was the Pennsylvania Railroad on the Pennsylvania Limited service to Chicago.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vestibuled</b> <b>cars</b> {{allowed the}} {{development}} of luxury trains during {{the golden age of}} rail travel, trains like the Union Pacific's Overland Limited (1890), the Pennsylvania Railroad's Pennsylvania Limited (later renamed the Pennsylvania Special, then the Broadway Limited), and the New York Central's 20th Century Limited (1902). The Southern's Crescent was introduced in 1891 as the Washington and Southwestern Vestibuled Limited and widely known as The Vestibule.|$|R

50|$|Dining cars first {{appeared}} in the late 1870s and into the 1880s. Until this time, the common practice was to stop for meals at restaurants along the way (which led to the rise of Fred Harvey's chain of Harvey House restaurants in America). At first, the dining car was simply a place to serve meals that were picked up en route, but they soon evolved to include galleys in which the meals were prepared.

5000|$|The dream {{takes place}} in a strange land, and Phillips explores the land for a while before encountering railway tracks. On the tracks he finds [...] "a yellow, <b>vestibuled</b> <b>car</b> {{numbered}} 1852--of a plain, double-trucked type common from 1900 to 1910." [...] This car is ready to start and he climbs aboard, investigating it and searching for a lightswitch so that he can see better. He hears a noise behind him, and after turning to look, sees two men coming towards him (he assumes them to be the motorman and the conductor). The first man lifts his head to the sky, sniffs, and howls, while the second drops to all fours and runs toward the car and Phillips. Phillips immediately runs out of the car, continuing to flee until he is too tired to run any farther.|$|R

50|$|In 1899 Stratford Works {{produced}} four {{restaurant car}} sets consisting of three <b>cars</b> <b>vestibuled</b> together {{but without any}} corridor connections.

5000|$|These {{saloon cars}} form the fifth batch of power cars {{supplied}} and were delivered in 1899 in readiness for {{the completion of}} the final section of the line between Laxey Station and Ramsey Plaza. They all remain in service. The four <b>vestibuled</b> <b>cars</b> known as the Winter Saloons are the backbone of the fleet of the Manx Electric Railway on the Isle of Man; they are all still in regular service but car 22 was completely rebuilt following a fire at Derby Castle Dep√¥t in 1992 and is now widely considered to be a replica car. They have appeared in a variety of liveries but suit the 1930s [...] "house" [...] style the best in many people's opinion and it is this guise that they are best known for carrying although they tend to cary several variations of this scheme. Car No. 22 was at one point re-painted in the plain red and cream livery of the island's buses in 1999 in line with management whim, but this ultimately proved unpopular and she now carries the usual livery. She {{was also one of the}} cars selected for re-paint in 1957 upon nationalisation, carrying an experimental green and white livery for some time. Cars 19 and 20 currently carry the 1950s [...] "austere" [...] livery, with 21 remaining in a hybrid colour scheme of recent years.|$|R
50|$|CCF built six {{motor cars}} and twelve trailers. As {{designed}} the motor cars seated 88 while the trailers, which included restrooms, seated 84. <b>Vestibules</b> connected the <b>cars.</b> The standard formation {{consisted of a}} motor car and two trailers. The interiors were green pastel with maroon upholstery. Exteriors were standard Canadian National: green with orange ends. The doors and pantographs were painted red. The cars used 2400 V DC via overhead collection.|$|R
50|$|The M8s {{have new}} roomier, high-back seats with {{individual}} headrests and curved arm rests for more comfort. For improved safety, {{especially in the}} <b>vestibules,</b> the <b>car</b> have larger windows and better lighting. An additional safety feature is the installation of intercom systems that customers can use to contact the train crew in case of emergency. Other features included curved luggage racks, coat hooks, electrical outlets to charge personal devices, and LED displays that show that next stop and automated announcements. The cars also have external public address speakers, and electronic destination signs. Higher reliability is possible with single leaf doors, which also lessen the susceptibility to snow intrusion. Also, the M8s have sealed alternating current motors that are less susceptible to weather.|$|R
50|$|The eight S (Scenic) {{carriages}} {{operate on}} KiwiRail Scenic's Capital Connection between Wellington and Palmerston North, each seating 60 (except the servery car, S 3200, which seats 31) in both alcove and airline-style arrangements. These {{were the first}} Mark 2 rebuilds, and they retain the original window configuration and curved Corten-steel <b>vestibule</b> ends. Seven <b>cars,</b> accompanied by refurbished baggage/generator carriage AG 130, were provided in 1998. An eighth car was added in 1999.|$|R
50|$|The railway <b>car</b> <b>vestibule</b> as {{a concept}} had been tried in various {{primitive}} forms during {{the latter part of}} the 19th century, but the first viable form was invented by H. H. Sessions and his staff at the Pullman Car Works in Chicago. Sessions' patent was challenged by others and reduced in litigation to the spring mechanism of his vestibule design. Further litigation by Pullman was successful in modifying the earlier rulings.|$|R
50|$|Smoking is {{generally}} not permitted in the accommodation or washroom areas of the trains but is allowed in the restaurant/cafe area and in the <b>vestibules</b> between the <b>cars.</b> On modern trains such as CRH or Beijing Suburban railway smoking is completely banned, with some smoke detectors connected to the brakes to stop the train, causing errant smokers facing hefty fines and penalties. On the Guangzhou-Kowloon cross-border train smoking is only permitted in the cafe car.|$|R
50|$|To {{maximize}} passenger accommodation, {{almost all}} electrical equipment is mounted {{either on the}} roof (pantograph) or under the car floors (starting resistors, compressors, etc.) All underfloor equipment is enclosed in cabinets with removable spring-latched access panels {{to protect it from}} blowing dust and snow. Some of the auxiliary equipment (including some high-voltage equipment such as the electric meter) is placed in cabinets inside <b>car</b> <b>vestibules.</b> Control equipment is concentrated in the engineer's cab. Numerous changes were made during the production run (see below), which caused variations in equipment layout.|$|R
5000|$|In 1938, {{an order}} of all-new World's Fair cars was placed with the St. Louis Car Company. These cars broke from IRT [...] "tradition" [...] in {{that they did not}} have <b>vestibules</b> at each <b>car</b> end. In addition, because the IRT was {{bankrupt}} at the time, the cars were built as single ended cars, with train controls for the motorman on one side and door controls for the conductor on the other. These cars spent their last days on the elevated IRT Third Avenue Line in the Bronx.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1930, reduced stops {{allowed the}} {{schedule}} {{to be cut}} to six hours and the train {{became known as the}} Rotorua Limited. As part of its upgrade in status from Express to Limited, it became the first passenger train in New Zealand to use the new 50-foot carriages with steel panelling and enclosed <b>vestibules.</b> Two observation <b>cars</b> with lounge chairs were trialled on the service at this time, but they did not prove successful due to the economic climate created by the Great Depression and were converted into ordinary carriages.|$|R

Ticket holders are assigned to a carriage, on conventional trains it is usually hard seat carriages only, and not permitted in soft seat or sleeper carriages. On High-Speed trains, fewer standing tickets are available and limited to entry <b>vestibules</b> and cafe <b>cars.</b> At stations or from on-board vendors, small folding seats are often sold to allow these passengers {{to sit in the}} aisles.|$|R

500|$|Each {{trainset}} {{consisted of}} two power cars (which included seating), two coaches and a bar/grill. The trains were powered {{by a pair of}} [...] Turbomeca turbines. The cars rode on Creusot-Loire trucks. The bar/grill, located {{at the center of the}} trainset, had table seating for 24. The <b>vestibules</b> between the <b>cars</b> were partitioned by sliding doors: one at each end of the car, and a double set between the cars themselves. A passenger moving between cars thus had to pull open three sets of doors. The trains were not intended for use with high-level platforms, and there were no traps covering the steps down to platform level.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of <b>vestibules,</b> passage between <b>cars</b> when a train was underway was both dangerous - stepping over a shifting plate between swaying cars with nothing on either side but chain guard rails - and unpleasant, due to being exposed to the weather, as well as soot, red-hot cinders and fly ash raining down from the exhaust of the steam locomotive hauling the train. As passengers were mostly confined to a single car during the trip, trains had regular meal stops built into their schedules, and sleeping cars were uncommon. The introduction of the vestibuled train {{in the late nineteenth century}} led to dining cars, lounge cars, and other specialized cars.|$|R

Still, her light dress which gleamed white in the moonlight fluttered about her and now and then flowed against her companion. The simple tale of stress and effort borne and made was one that went well with the snorting of the big locomotives toiling up the climbing track and the rhythmic roar of wheels flung back by primeval forest or towering wall of rock.

50|$|The {{vestibule}} on {{a railroad}} passenger car is an enclosed {{area at the}} end of the carbody, usually separated from the main part of the interior by a door, which is power-operated on most modern equipment. Entrance to and exit from the car is through the side doors, which lead into the <b>vestibule.</b> When passenger <b>cars</b> are coupled, their vestibules are joined by mating faceplate and diaphragm assemblies to create a weather-tight seal for the safety and comfort of passengers who are stepping from car to car. In British usage the term refers to the part of the carriage where the passenger doors are located; this can be at the ends of the carriage (on long-distance stock) or at the 1/4 and 3/4 of length positions (typical on modern suburban stock).|$|R
