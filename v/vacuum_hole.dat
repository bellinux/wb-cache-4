50|$|Tonio is {{introduced}} to Ash, Brock, and Dawn. Baron soon flirts with Alice stating {{that she is}} to be his wife. Brock is deeply shocked {{as well as the}} rest of them. Alice rejects and runs to Tonio claiming that she likes him. Tonio blushes and tries not to deny anything. Not too long after, Darkrai appears in the garden. Baron orders Lickilicky to attack the Dark Pokémon, which misses while Darkrai fires a Dark Void at his enemy. Baron's Lickilicky dodges the attack and the orb of dark impales Ash, instantly knocking him out to sleep and subsequently, trapping him in a nightmare. The nightmare shows Palkia moving up to Ash and then goes to attack him. This delivers Ash to a part of the garden. After learning the dream is Darkrai's doing and Darkrai appears in front of him, Ash reaches for a Poké Ball and tosses it, but it vanishes into thin air. Then, Darkrai disappears to reveal Pikachu, who is about to get devoured by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>hole.</b> Ash dives into the hole to rescue Pikachu. Having failed, he and his Pikachu drop into a neverending fall. He is then awakened by Pikachu's Thunderbolt at the Pokémon Center. At night, Tonio tries to find more information in which he succeeds. He reads that Darkrai had opened his heart to Alice's grandmother years ago and remains in the garden since then, with Godey witnessing {{a little bit on the}} side as she plays the leaf whistle. Meanwhile, Baron meets three TV people who are actually Team Rocket who decide to film Baron as he takes on Darkrai.|$|E
40|$|Hole Vacuum {{theory is}} based on {{discontinuous}} spacetime that contains vacuum holes. Vacuum holes can explain gravitation, some laws of quantum mechanics and allow teleportation of matter. All massive bodies emit a flux of holes which curve the spacetime; if we increase the concentration of holes, it leads to length contraction and time dilation because the holes {{do not have the}} properties of extension and duration. In the limited case when space consists of holes only, the distance between every two points is equal to zero and time stops - outside of the Universe, the extension and duration properties do not exist. For this reason, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>hole</b> is the only particle in physics capable of describing gravitation using its own properties only. All microscopic particles must 'jump' continually and 'vibrate' due to the appearance of holes (impassable microscopic 'walls' in space), and it is the cause of the quantum behavior. Vacuum holes can explain the entanglement, non-locality, wave properties of matter, tunneling, uncertainty principle and so on. Particles do not have trajectories because spacetime is discontinuous and has impassable microscopic 'walls' due to the simple mechanical motion is impossible at small scale distances; it is impossible to 'trace' a straight line in the discontinuous spacetime because it contains the impassable holes. Spacetime 'boils' continually due to the appearance of the vacuum holes. For teleportation to be possible, we must send a body outside of the Universe by enveloping it with a closed surface consisting of vacuum holes. Since a material body cannot exist outside of the Universe, it reappears instantaneously in a random point of the Universe. Since a body disappears in one volume and reappears in another random volume without traversing the physical space between them, such a transportation method can be called teleportation (or Hole Teleportation). It is shown that Hole Teleportation does not violate causality and special relativity due to its random nature and other properties. Although Hole Teleportation has a random nature, it can be used for colonization of extrasolar planets by the help of the method called 'random jumps': after a large number of random teleportation jumps, there is a probability that the spaceship may appear near a habitable planet. We can create vacuum holes experimentally using the method proposed by Descartes: we must remove a body from the vessel without permitting another body to occupy this volume...|$|E

The behavior of moving-puncture coordinates in spacetimes containing matter, however, is less well understood.

Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse provides a stringent test of the singularity-avoiding properties of moving-puncture coordinates, since the singularity can form more quickly than it would for matter with pressure. Our results include analytical expressions for the matter density, lapse function, and mean curvature at early times, as well as interesting limits for later times. We also carry out numerical simulations to obtain the full solution and these show that, {{even in the absence of}} pressure, moving-puncture coordinates are able to avoid the singularity.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to present the {{capabilities}} of a very innovative concept: a distributed spatial imager for astrophysics, and the potential technical solutions. The instrument uses a binary Fresnel zone plate, based on the diffraction focusing principle. This implies long focal lengths, hence a formation flying approach on the basis of some tens of kilometers. The major interest of this particular approach to diffractive focusing is that is has the same resolution as a classical lens or mirror of equivalent size, but there is no optical material involved in the focusing process: just <b>vacuum,</b> <b>holes</b> punched into a thin opaque membrane, and a very light supporting structure. Another interesting feature, specific to the particular grid-like pattern of the primary focusing zone plate, is the high dynamic range achieved in the images. These two elements make it possible to launch a very large Fresnel array allowing resolutions and dynamic ranges never reached before, leading to new science objectives. Of course a lot of technical challenges have to be overcome. This is the reason why critical domains have been identified, then addressed by R&T activities and, moreover, the performance limits explored with astrophysicists, in order to define the science needs that could be fulfilled with such capabilities. This paper presents some technical responses, and how a lot of domains in astrophysics can take advantage of such missions. 1...|$|R
