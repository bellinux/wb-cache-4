50|$|Cartridge valves are in {{fact the}} inner part of a check valve; they are off the shelf {{components}} with a standardized envelope, making them easy to populate a proprietary <b>valve</b> <b>block.</b> They are available in many configurations; on/off, proportional, pressure relief, etc. They generally screw into a <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> and are electrically controlled to provide logic and automated functions.|$|E

50|$|The valves {{required}} {{for oil and}} gas separators are oil discharge control valve, water-discharge control valve (three-phase operation), drain <b>valves,</b> <b>block</b> <b>valves,</b> pressure relief valves, and Emergency Shutdown valves (ESD). ESD valves typically stay in open position for months or years awaiting a command signal to operate. Little attention is paid to these valves outside of scheduled turnarounds. The pressures of continuous production often stretch these intervals even longer. This leads to build up or corrosion on these valves that prevents them from moving. For safety critical applications, it must be ensured that the valves operate upon demand.|$|R
50|$|Auxiliary valves {{in complex}} {{hydraulic}} systems may have auxiliary <b>valve</b> <b>blocks</b> to handle various duties unseen to the operator, such as accumulator charging, cooling fan operation, air conditioning power, etc. They are usually custom valves {{designed for the}} particular machine, and may consist of a metal block with ports and channels drilled. Cartridge valves are threaded into the ports and may be electrically controlled by switches or a microprocessor to route fluid power as needed.|$|R

They are frequently manufactured from blocks of steel containing multiple valves rather than being assembled from individual flanged components.

50|$|The effects a {{variable}} flow system {{had on the}} selection of control valves, was not initially realized. A control valve was selected by using the same Kv calculation and the bypass on a 3-port <b>valve</b> <b>blocked,</b> giving a 2-port valve. Unfortunately it wasn’t that simple. This is because our Kv calculationKv = Flow Rate (m3/h) / Δ P (Bar)was based upon a constant pressure and a constant Kvs, delivering a constant flow. However, as areas of the variable flow system closed down the differential pressure increased, stepping up the delivery flow and causing overflow in the open circuits.|$|R

50|$|The main <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> {{is usually}} a stack of off the shelf {{directional}} control valves chosen by flow capacity and performance.

50|$|Medical gas {{cylinders}} in the UK {{and some other}} countries have a fusible plug of Wood's metal in the <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> between the valve seat and the cylinder. This plug melts at a comparatively low temperature (70 °C) and allows {{the contents of the}} cylinder to escape to the surroundings before the cylinder is significantly weakened by the heat, lessening the risk of explosion.|$|E

Block and bleed needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment.|$|R

Later that year the Kiekhaefer Mercury company designed a new inline 6-cylinder, 60 cubic inch, [...] engine named [...] "Mark 75". Like its 2- and 4-cylinder brethren, the Mark 75 featured internal reed valves. The reed <b>valve</b> <b>blocks</b> served as intermediate main bearings. Because the valves occupied space already necessary for the main bearings instead of mounting to {{an extension of the}} crankcase, crankcase volume was minimized, resulting in a higher crankcase compression ratio, and more power in proportion to displacement than the competition.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} valve {{location}} problem, {{one of the}} basic problems in design of long oil pipelines. Whenever a pipeline is depressurized, the shutoff <b>valves</b> <b>block</b> the oil flow and seal the damaged part of the pipeline. Thus, the quantity of oil possibly contaminating the area around the pipeline is determined by the volume of the damaged section of the pipeline between two consecutive valves. Then, ecologic damage can be quantified by the amount of leaked oil and the environmental characteristics of the accident area. Given a pipe network together with environmental characteristics of the area, and given a number of valves to be installed, the task is to find a valve location minimizing the maximal possible environmental damage. In this paper we present a complete framework for fast computing of an optimal valve location. ...|$|R

The dry sump system has been re-designed so the engine sits 35 mm lower than in the FPA car.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{contents}} {{are under pressure}} and are sometimes hazardous materials, handling bottled gases are regulated. Regulations may include chaining bottles to prevent falling and damaging the valve, proper ventilation to prevent injury or death in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards If a compressed gas cylinder tips over, causing the <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> to be sheared off, the rapid release of high-pressure gas may cause the cylinder to be violently accelerated, potentially causing property damage, injury, or death. To prevent this, cylinders are normally secured to a fixed object or transport cart with a strap or chain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Stop valves are {{commonly}} used as fluid flow control equipments in many engineering applications. A numerical study of a three-dimensional, complex geometry, stop-check valve was performed for model validation and improved understanding of valve flow features. This paper has provided a numerical investigation of the fluid flow inside a stop valve, including the modeling and the simulation of the stop valves. According to the simulation result of original valve structure, two cone <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> shape with different gradient are presented to bring some optimization to the stop-valve. CFD simulations were conducted for different structure of the valve to verify {{the performance of the}} valve after redesign the internal flow structure. The simulation results show that the pressure drop vortex strength, maximum velocity and velocity nonuniformity of valve outlet had been reduced obviously. Furthermore, the results of the three-dimensional optimization analysis of valve shape can be used in the design of low noise and high efficiency valve for industry...|$|E
40|$|GOAL We {{present the}} {{development}} of a boneanchored port for the painless long-term hemodialytic treatment of patients with renal failure. This port is implanted behind the ear. METHODS The port was developed based on knowledge obtained from long-term experience with implantable hearing devices, which are firmly anchored to the bone behind the ear. This concept of bone anchoring was adapted to the requirements for a vascular access during hemodialysis. The investigational device is comprised of a base plate that is firmly fixed with bone screws to the bone behind the ear (temporal bone). A catheter leads from the base plate <b>valve</b> <b>block</b> through the internal jugular vein and into the right atrium. The valves are opened using a special disposable adapter, without any need to puncture the blood vessels. Between hemodialysis sessions the port is protected with a disposable cover.
