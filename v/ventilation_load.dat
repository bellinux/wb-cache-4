Research on how the <b>ventilation</b> <b>load</b> responds to climate change is of great significance, especially in coastline subtropical regions like Hong Kong. This paper investigated the impacts of climate change on buildings' <b>ventilation</b> <b>load</b> and building energy use in Hong Kong with the hourly meteorological data from 1950 to 2007. Results have been well validated by the simulation of a typical local hotel building during this period. The results show that climate warming increases both sensible and latent parts of the cooling <b>ventilation</b> <b>load.</b> The latent part, which occupies ~ 80 % of the total <b>ventilation</b> <b>load,</b> increases at a higher rate, about twice of that of the sensible one. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} the urban heat island (UHI) effect causes a much higher growth rate of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>load</b> at night, which is about three times compared with that in the daytime. The latent part of the cooling <b>ventilation</b> <b>load</b> at night, which is found to be the most sensitive component to the climate change, plays a most significant role in the energy consumption increase. The possible measures were thus suggested to avoid negative changes of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>load.</b> Besides, reducing the UHI effect by better urban planning also significantly benefits the local buildings with a long air-conditioning operation time.

The MBV of wood is triple that of concrete and brick, double that of gypsum and about 20  % higher than cellular concrete [5].

However, compliance to the regulations does not necessarily ensure occupants’ satisfaction or represent the real operational conditions of the building services. One important consideration {{for the use of the}} typical year weather time series in energy consumption predictions and simulations is the representativeness of the location where the source data have been collected.

40|$|As {{compared}} with the mixing system, indoor air temperature stratification in the under-floor air distribution (UFAD) system offers an opportunity for cooling load reduction in the occupied zone. This stratification is a major feature that offers the energy saving potential, {{but it has not}} been thoroughly taken into account in most energy simulation programs. In this article, a numerical procedure, based on coupling two types of modeling, i. e., CFD (computational fluid dynamic) simulation and dynamic cooling load simulation, is proposed to predict annual energy consumption. The dimensionless temperature coefficient is first defined in the UFAD system and obtained from CFD simulation, based on the boundary conditions from a cooling load program ACCURACY. According to this coefficient, temperature stratification input to ACCURACY is then revised to calculate the updated supply and exhaust air temperatures for final annual energy prediction. To demonstrate the method, a small office room is investigated using Hong Kong weather data. With the constant air volume (CAV) supply in the UFAD system, it is found that the dimensionless temperature coefficient is almost a constant, when the locations of heat sources are fixed.

Few {{attempts have been made to}} quantify this energy behavior, even though vast amounts of end-use data containing useful information lay fallow. This paper describes analysis techniques developed to extract behavioral information from collected residential end-use data. Analysis of the averages, standard deviations and frequency distributions of hourly data can yield important behavioral information. Pattern analysis can be used to group similar daily energy patterns together for a particular end-use or set of end-uses. Resulting pattern groups can then be examined statistically using multinomial logit modeling to find their likelihood of occurrence for a given set of daily conditions. These techniques were tested successfully using end-use data for families living in four heavily instrumented residences. Energy behaviors were analyzed for individual families during each heating season of the study. These behaviors (indoor temperature, <b>ventilation</b> <b>load,</b> water heating, large appliance energy, and miscellaneous outlet energy) capture how occupants directly control the residence. The pattern analysis and multinomial logit model were able to match the occupant behavior correctly 40 to 70 % of the time.

Simple changes to capture more detail during pattern analysis can increase accuracy for the more variable behavior patterns.

There has been a twofold to fourfold increase in outside air requirements for many commercial building applications, compared to the 1981 version of the standard. To mitigate or nullify these additional weather loads, outdoor air preconditioning technologies are being promoted in combination with conventional HVAC operations downstream as a means to deliver the required fresh air and control humidity indoors. Preconditioning is the term applied for taking outside air to the indoor air setpoint (dry bulb temperature and relative humidity). The large humidity loads from outside air can now be readily recognized and quantified at cooling design point conditions using the extreme humidity ratios/dew points presented in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals Chapter 26 "Climatic Design Information".

40|$|The role of {{humidity}} in {{indoor air}} quality has become of increasing concern in recent years. High indoor humidities can result in microbial growth on building surfaces, resulting in poor {{indoor air quality}}, as well as damage to the building and its contents. In addition to the IAQ impacts, high indoor humidity can cause occupant discomfort. The public review draft of ASHRAE Standard 62 - 1989 R included requirements for installation of dehumidification controls in buildings with mechanical cooling located in humid climates. The draft standard included a definition of humid climate: where, during the warmest six consecutive months of a typical year, the wetbulb temperature is 19 ?C (67 ?F) or higher for 3500 hours or more, or 23 ?C (73 ?F) or higher for 1750 hours or more. This definition is that used in the 1993 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals to define the humid climate region. The only areas in the continental United States which meet these criteria {{are close to the}} Gulf coast, all of Florida, and along the Atlantic coast as far north as southern North Carolina While it is clear that buildings in this humid climate region need to be carefully designed with regard to humidity control, {{it is also clear that}} buildings in other areas have an equal need for humidity control. The work described in this paper examines a number of potential indicators of "humid climate" and correlates them with the prevalence of indoor humidity problems in three building types. The FSEC 2. 3 energy simulation computer program (Kerestecioglu et al. 1989) was used to simulate the three building types, using weather from 10 cities in the southeastern U. S. The FSEC software was selected because it is capable of accurately modeling moisture transfer within the building space and the dehumidification performance of cooling coils at part-load conditions, and predicting resulting humidity levels. The buildings modeled were a retail store (similar to a K-Mart or Wal-Mart), a large office building, and a fast food restaurant. Existing building models were employed for this study with ventilation rates in accordance with ASHRAE Standard 62 - 1989. The HVAC systems used were typical for these building types, without any special humidity control measures. The selected indicators of humidity problems are the number of hours per year with space humidity above 60 % RH and the number of occupied hours with space humidity above 60 % RH. TMY 2 weather data (NREL 1995) for 10 cities was used for the annual building energy simulations. TMY 2 data was also used to calculate a number of potential humid climate parameters for the same 10 cities. These included: the number of hours and the wetbulb-degree hours above 3 different wetbulb temperatures, the number of hours and grain-hours above 4 different humidity ratios, and the sensible, latent and total <b>Ventilation</b> <b>Load</b> Index (VLI).

Conical structures which shift the ice failure mode from crushing to bending could reduce the total iceload. Moreover, its symmetric geometry naturally achieves the requirement of ice-vaning and {{reduces the risk of}} possible large ice loads induced by the failure of ice-vaning that might be encountered by other shapes of floaters. The thesis is based on the model test results of a group of conical structures in different ice conditions. All the tests were conducted in the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) in Germany. The thesis comprises two parts. In the first part, the ice basin test results of the SEVAN FPU-Ice Buoy were analyzed. Based on the test data, the structure’s responses and load transferring characteristics were examined using the computer software Diadem. And the hydrodynamic and hydro-static characteristics were calculated by using Hydro-D. Then this dynamic system was analyzed in the surge direction. Based on the calculation results, explanations concerning the dominant pitch response coinciding with the pitch natural frequency were given in a descriptive way. Furthermore, alow-frequency ice accumulation volume was visually observed. This was thought to be the cause of the dominant low frequency surge displacement. The relationships between different structural responses with different ice load components were also identified. It was pointed out that the surge displacement was mainly influenced by the ice sliding load while pitch displacement was mainly influenced by the ice rotating load. According to the analysis of this system in surge direction, it was further found that the mooring force was mainly to counter balance the ice sliding load while the ice rotating load was mainly counter balanced by the inertia force and mooring force. Furthermore, based on a discussion about level ice-conical structure interaction processes, a numerical model concerning the level ice and moored structure interaction was developed using MATLAB {{in the first part of}} this thesis. The calculation results were compared with the test data. It is found that this numerical model gives good predictions of the surge and heave displacements. And it was also found that the ice accumulation load (a part of ice sliding load) and <b>ventilation</b> <b>load</b> (a part of ice rotatingload) are two major contributors to the total ice load. In the second part, the analysis was based on the test data of five conical structures designed by AkerSolutions. Both moored and fixed structures with different geometries were tested in different ice conditions (level ice, managed ice, and ice ridges) with different ice speeds (0. 1 m/s, 0. 5 m/s and 1 m/sNTNU, Trondheim, Norwayiiat full-scale). Extensive comparisons of the test results in different ice conditions with different ice speeds are discussed in Part II of my thesis. In conclusion, the thesis discusses the ice-conical structure interaction processes, loading characteristics, and response characteristics, based on which a numerical model was developed. Furthermore the influences of the geometry of the structure, different ice conditions, and different ice speed were also discussed based on experiment data and theoretical analysis</p...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{economizer}} control, economizer damper failure, {{and excess}} outdoor-air contribute to these performance degradations. In {{order to promote}} optimal rooftop air-conditioner (RTU) performance and reduce operating costs, an automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) tool has been designed for RTUs with integrated economizers. Based on previously proposed methods, the proposed method advances the economizer fault detection and diagnosis components by using statistical classifiers {{in order to provide}} more robust, probabilistic fault outputs. A set of air-side virtual sensors has also been added to the method in order to expand the applicable range of conditions fault detection and diagnostics can be applied. ^ The operational performance of the outdoor-air damper was characterized using a series of laboratory tests in order to model the expected outdoor-air fraction at different damper actuator control signals and ambient conditions. Two temperature correction models were developed in order to minimize the sensor error caused by stratification. The first correction was to the outdoor-air temperature sensor. This sensor was influenced by return-air that was recirculated back into the outdoor-air stream, an effect of economizer hood design. The second temperature correction modeled was for the single-point mixed-air temperature. At the mixed-air temperature sensor location, significant thermal stratification and non-uniform flow is present due to ineffective mixing in the RTU mixing box. Finally, the temperature rise across the indoor fan was modeled, along with the expected mass-air flow rate and power consumption of the indoor fan. ^ Using these models of normal performance, deviations from normal are detected using a fault detection classifier. Using a Bayesian classifier a comparison of expected and actual performance is made when the RTU operates at steady-state. Outdoor-air damper position faults and temperature sensor faults, including faults in the outdoor-air, return-air, mixed-air, or supply-air temperature measurements, are considered by the AFDD tool. After a fault has been detected, an active economizer diagnostic procedure is performed by sweeping the outdoor-air damper from the fully-closed to fully-open position. When the damper is at these positions, redundant system measurements can be compared and a set a fault diagnosis residuals can be calculated. These residuals yield unique responses to different faults when they are present in the system. Using this as a guide, faults are isolated using a statistical fault diagnosis classifier. ^ Experimentally collected data were used to test the effectiveness of the AFDD method under different normal and faulty conditions. The false alarm rate of the fault detection method was approximately 1. 0 %. The misdiagnoses rate of the diagnosis classifier for normal data was approximately 4. 9 %. When taken together, the overall false alarm rate of the AFDD tool was approximately 0. 05 %. This low false alarm rate {{can be attributed to the}} accuracy of the temperature sensor correction and outdoor-air fraction models that can be attained when using experimentally obtained training data for an individual RTU. This also shows of the advantage of embedding diagnostics into the equipment over a tool that is applied retroactively. The diagnosis tool was also able to correctly identify greater than 90 % of the different faults studied. The most significant faults studied, stuck outdoor-air damper faults, were correctly diagnosed in 93. 2 % of the fault cases. ^ As a first step towards determining optimal FDD thresholds, several performance tests were conducted in the laboratory in order to observe the affects of a stuck damper fault on system performance. Tests with warm, humid outdoor-air temperatures were considered. Different damper positions were tested and their impact on the outdoor-air fraction entering the system were examined. The damper faults were shown to increase system capacity and efficiency due to the higher evaporation temperature caused by the higher fraction of warm outdoor-air at the evaporator air inlet. However, a negative impact on required RTU run-time was also determined, yielding increases in required energy consumption in order to meet equivalent conditioned space loads. The cause of this increased run-time was the increased <b>ventilation</b> <b>load</b> component introduced by the opened damper. These conditions lead to a reduction in available cooling capacity to meet the space load. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|A great {{majority}} of modern buildings are equipped with Energy Management and Control Systems (EMCS) which monitor and collect operating data from different components of heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Models derived and tuned by using the collected data {{can be incorporated into}} the EMCS for online prediction of the system performance. To that end, HVAC component models with self-tuning parameters were developed and validated in this paper. The model parameters were tuned online by using a genetic algorithm which minimizes the error between measured and estimated performance data. The developed models included: a zone temperature model, return air enthalpy/humidity and CO 2 concentration models, a cooling and heating coil model, and a fan model. The study also includes tools for estimating the thermal and <b>ventilation</b> <b>loads.</b> The models were validated against real data gathered from an existing HVAC system. The validation results show that the component models augmented with an online parameter tuner, significantly improved the accuracy of predicted outputs. The use of such models offers several advantages such as designing better real-time control, optimization of overall system performance, and online fault detection...|$|R
40|$|Vertical-bore, {{geothermal}} heat pumps (GHPs) have been providing {{heating and cooling}} to four new elementary schools located in Lincoln, Nebraska since 1995. According to representatives of the local utility and school district, the systems are providing a comfortable, complaint-free environment with utility costs that are nearly half of that of other schools in the district. Performance data collected from on-site energy management systems and district billing and utility records for all fifty schools in the Lincoln district indicate that only five consume less energy than the best performing GHP school; however these five cool less than 10 % of their total floor area, while the GHP schools cool 100 % of their floor area. When compared to other new schools (with similar <b>ventilation</b> <b>loads),</b> the GHP schools used approximately 26 % less source energy per square foot of floor area. Variations in annual energy performance are evident among the four GHP schools, however, together they still consume less source energy than 70 % of all schools in the district. These variations are most likely due to operational differences rather than installed equipment, building orientation, or environmental (bore field) conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} airtight buildings, {{the architect}} has considerable freedom {{to decide how}} much the external environment will influence the internal heating, cooling, and <b>ventilation</b> <b>loads.</b> The services engineer provides the plant and equipment required {{to deal with these}} loads. This division of labor could lead to undesirable consequences in the case of dynamic insulation, a form of air permeable construction where bulk air flow through the building envelope may be used to either enhance or restrict the conductive heat and mass diffusion fluxes. Small changes in temperature (indoor and out) and wind speed and direction will influence the behavior of a dynamically insulated envelope since the internal and external environments are much more intimately coupled. Buildings employing dynamic insulation thus require good environmental design principles to be applied. The objective {{of this paper is to}} lay down rigorous principles that will form the basis of guidelines to architects and building services engineers on how to take account of the ever changing external environment when designing durable and comfortable buildings employing dynamic insulation.
