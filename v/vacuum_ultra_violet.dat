40|$|The {{advent of}} “flexible” {{electronics}} on plastic substrates with low melting points requires {{the development of}} thin film deposition techniques that operate at low temperatures. This is easily achieved with vacuum or solution - processed molecular or polymeric semiconductors, but oxide materials remain a significant challenge. Here we show that zinc oxide (ZnO) can be prep ared using only room - temperature processes, using the molecular thin film precursor zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), follow ed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>ultra</b> - <b>violet</b> light treatment to elicit degradation of the organic components and transformation of the deposited film to oxide mate rial.

The morphology of the film was relatively unchanged during the reaction, but detailed analysis of its composition using both scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) revealed that a 40 nm thick layer containing ZnO results from the 100 nm thick precursor after complete reaction.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} the reflectivity spectrum of orthorhombic sulphur crystals in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> spectral range, extending to photon energies of 14 eV [...] The construction and design of the spectrometer and of the associated apparatus is described in some detail; experimental techniques {{as well as several}} problems encountered in <b>vacuum</b> <b>ultra</b> <b>violet</b> measurements are discussed. An essentially new type of reflectometer has been developed for the present work, which gives accurate and reliable results at near normal incidence. Reflectivity results were obtained for a range of crystals with natural (111) faces that had been subjected to widely different surface treatments. It is concluded that the reflectivity spectra are largely independent of surface treatment and represent the intrinsic optical properties of orthorhombic sulphur. Reflectivity spectra have been determined for Germanium specimens to check the reliability of the instrument and experimental technique. The Kramers-Kronig relation has been used to analyse the reflectivity data and values of the optical constants n and k have been derived for photon energies up to 14 eV [...] A discussion is given of the general nature of the Kramers-Kronig analysis, and a suitable procedure for processing the sulphur data chosen. The internal consistency of the calculations has been confirmed by the use of sum rules. Where possible, the computed data have been compared to experimental results. The absorption coefficient in particular shows good correlation with experimental single crystal and thin film work. An interesting feature of the absorption is the "window" at 8 eV. which may enable thin films of sulphur to be used as band pass filters in this region. The relation that exists between certain functions of the optical constants and band structure is indicated. The generated values of the complex part of the dielectric constant, E 2, are analysed and the results tentatively interpreted in terms of band structure. The difficulties of such an interpretation are brought out, but the information obtained is in substantial agreement with a qualitative scheme proposed by Gibbons. The results will be of some importance when more detailed theoretical calculations become available...|$|E

Systematic studies were performed applying series of gridded and repeated measurements to take contamination effects, effects due to film modification by the VUV radiation, and drift of the measurement system into account.

40|$|The {{research}} {{carried out}} on this grant was motivated by the high power emission from the CIV doublet at 155 nm in the DIII-D divertor and to study {{the characteristics of the}} radiative divertor. The radiative divertor is designed to reduce the heat load to the target plates of the divertor by reducing the energy in the divertor plasma using upstream scrape-off-layer (SOL) radiation. In some cases, particularly in Partially Detached Divertor (PDD) operations, this emission accounts for more than 50 % of the total radiation from the divertor. In PDD operation, produced by neutral gas injection, the particle flow to the target plate and the divertor temperature are significantly reduced. A father motivation was to study the CIV emission distribution in the lower, open divertor and the upper baffled divertor. Two <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Ultra</b> <b>Violet</b> Tangential viewing Television cameras (VUV TTV) were constructed and installed in the upper, baffled and the lower, open divertor.
