It seemed that the higher viscosity the base fluid could result in lower increment in viscosity. Mahbubul et al.

40|$|Elasticity {{of demand}} {{is a measure}} of market {{response}} to a change in price. Three definitions of elasticity of demand are commonly found in the literature: (1) [var epsilon]p = point elasticity, defined for a given point on the demand function and relies on the derivative of the function at that point; (2) [var epsilon]a = arc elasticity, defined for the midpoint of an arc connecting two points, irrespective of the shape of the demand function; (3) [var epsilon] = relative change elasticity, defined for two given points as minus the ratio of the <b>relative</b> volume <b>increment</b> to the <b>relative</b> price <b>increment.</b> Of the three, [var epsilon]p is the most widely cited and has the merit that marginal revenue is zero at [var epsilon]p = 1. It is also convenient when curves with [var epsilon]p = constant can be fitted to price-demand data. In practice, apart from the fact that [var epsilon]p is often difficult to determine, management is mainly concerned with discrete increments and not marginal changes, and in this respect [var epsilon]a is regarded as more useful. However, the relative change elasticity [var epsilon] is preferable in all practical applications, both because <b>relative</b> <b>increments</b> refer to a given base period (instead of a midpoint, {{as in the case of}} [var epsilon]a), and because of the simplicity of using it in the analysis of company performance. ...|$|R

Several parameters dominating the interference flowfield are studied after defining the <b>relative</b> <b>increment</b> of normal {{force and the}} jet amplification factor as the evaluation criterion of jet control performance. The computational results show that most features of the interaction flowfield between the transverse jet and the ramp {{are similar to those}} between a jet and a flat plate, except that the flow structures are more complicated and the low-pressure region behind the jet is less extensive. The <b>relative</b> force <b>increment</b> and the jet amplification factor both increase with the distance between the jet and the ramp shortening till quintuple jet diameters. Inconspicuous difference is observed between the jet-before-ramp and jet-on-ramp cases. The variation of the injection angle changes the extent of the separation region, the plateau pressure, and the peak pressure near the jet. In the present computational conditions, 120 ° is indicated relatively optimal among all the injection angles studied. For cold gas simulations, although little influence of the jet temperature on the pressure distribution near the jet is observed under the computation model and the flow parameters studied, reducing jet temperature somehow benefits the improvement of the normal force and the jet efficiency.

There was highly significant correlation between <b>relative</b> <b>increment</b> and temperature (p= 2. 324 e- 13) and significant correlation between <b>relative</b> <b>increment</b> and precipitation (p= 0. 0439).

40|$|Background: Anticoagulant and {{antiplatelet}} therapies {{are being}} used interchangeably or in combination. While international normalized ratio is assessed to determine anticoagulant’s contraindication/need, whole blood viscosity is not assessed to determine the need for antiplatelet. Aims: The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate whether whole blood viscosity value is associated with levels of international normalized ratio and platelet count. Materials and Methods: De-identified archived clinical pathology data for the year 2008 were audited. All cases of international normalized ratio, which were concomitantly tested for haematocrit and total proteins, were extracted (n= 7, 387). Whole blood viscosity levels were extrapolated. Whether differences are associated with normal vs. high international normalized ratio and thrombocytopenia vs. thrombocytosis were evaluated. Results: Multivariate analysis show that whole blood viscosity levels statistically significantly differs between international normalized ratio and platelet counts (p< 0. 001). Platelet count is statistically significantly lower in low blood viscosity when compared with hyperviscosity and normoviscosity (p< 0. 001). Conversely, international normalized ratio is statistically significantly higher in low blood <b>viscosity</b> <b>relative</b> to hyperviscosity (p< 0. 001) and normoviscosity (p< 0. 002).
