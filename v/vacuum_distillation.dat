5|$|Because of {{its high}} neutron cross-section, boron-10 {{is often used to}} control fission in nuclear {{reactors}} as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.|$|E
5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E

The fiber is fabricated by phase inversion and sintering, and then modified with fluoroalkylsilanes to render it hydrophobic. The influence of the sintering temperature and feeding temperature in membrane distillation (MD) {{on the characteristics of}} the fiber and MD performance are investigated. The <b>vacuum</b> membrane <b>distillation</b> uses 3. 5 wt % NaCl aqueous solution at 70 °C at 0. 03 bar. The permeate flux of 60 Lm− 2 h− 1 is the highest, compared with reported data and is higher than that for polymeric hollow fiber membranes...|$|R

5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E

40|$|The batch {{distillation}} of crude wood oil by direct liquefaction was studied; azeotropic distillations and some characterization were also performed. It {{was found that}} 26 - 33 percent of the crude wood oil could be distilled by simple batch <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillations</b> with pressures from 50 - 300 mm Hg. With the use of ethylene glycol and glycerol 29 - 85 percent more oil was distilled {{partly due to the}} azeotrope formed which allows the oil to boil at a reduced pressure. The water liberated and the polymerization which took place during the distillations were studied. It was found that fluid catalytic cracking bottoms eliminates polymerization when it is co-distilled with the crude wood oil. A novel scheme for the separation of the phenolic fraction by azeotropic distillation is presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} of MeP and formaldehyde takes place over a fixed bed of catalyst. This catalyst, caesium oxide on silica, achieves good selectivity to MMA from MeP. The {{formation of a}} small amount of heavy, relatively involatile compounds poisons the catalyst. The coke is easily removed and catalyst activity and selectivity restored by controlled, in-situ regeneration. The reactor product stream is separated in a primary distillation so that a crude MMA product stream, free from water, MeP and formaldehyde, is produced. Unreacted MeP and water are recycled via the formaldehyde dehydration process. Pure MMA (>99.9%) is produced from the crude MMA in a series of <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillations</b> and separations. In all cases, the separated streams are returned to the process; there is only one (small) heavy ester purge stream. This is readily disposed of in a thermal oxidizer with heat recovered for use in the process.|$|R

25|$|The {{first step}} in {{upgrading}} is <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> to separate the lighter fractions. After that, de-asphalting is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. Cracking is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, desulfurization {{must be done to}} get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{hydrogen}} peroxide was long {{believed to be}} unstable, as early attempts to separate it from the water, which is present during synthesis, all failed. This instability was due to traces of impurities (transition-metal salts), which catalyze the decomposition of the {{hydrogen peroxide}}. Pure hydrogen peroxide was first obtained in 1894—almost 80 years after its discovery—by Richard Wolffenstein, who produced it by <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have very}} high boiling points. To boil such compounds, {{it is often}} better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling {{and the rest of}} the distillation process can commence. This technique is referred to as <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> and it is commonly found in the laboratory in the form of the rotary evaporator.|$|E
50|$|Spinning cone columns {{are used}} in a form of low {{temperature}} <b>vacuum</b> steam <b>distillation</b> to gently extract volatile chemicals from liquid foodstuffs while minimising {{the effect on the}} taste of the product. For instance, the columns can be used to remove some of the alcohol from wine, 'off' smells from cream, and to capture aroma compounds that would otherwise be lost in coffee processing.|$|R

40|$|In the article, a new air-blowing <b>vacuum</b> {{membrane}} <b>distillation</b> (AVMD) {{process is}} proposed, and it forms the air-liquid flows in the membrane by forcedly blowing airs {{to the hot}} feed liquids circularly flowing in the hollow fiber membrane, and forms the AVMD system to enhance the turbulent degree of the liquids. The intense disturbance of air bubbles and the strong cutting power at the surface of membrane can reduce {{the depth of the}} boundary layer of liquids, the temperature and the concentration polarization of the membrane surface, and enhance the speed of heat and mass transfer to enhance the membrane distillation flux and control the membrane pollution. By the process that the optimized AVMD process is used in the coking wastewater treatment process of certain enterprise, the influence of the pretreatment technique of the wastewater on the removal effect of COD is studied in the article, and the influences of the <b>vacuum</b> membrane <b>distillation</b> (VMD) and the AVMD process on the wastewater concentrating treatment effect and efficiency are also respectively researched in the article...|$|R
25|$|Another simple method, tested {{during the}} MSRE program, is high {{temperature}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation.</b> The lower boiling point fluorides like uranium tetrafluoride and the LiF and BeF carrier salt {{can be removed}} by distillation. Under vacuum the temperature can be lower than the ambient pressure boiling point. So a temperature of about 1000°C is sufficient to recover most of the FLiBe carrier salt. However, while possible in principle, separation of thorium fluoride from the even higher boiling point lanthanide fluorides would require very high temperatures and new materials.|$|E
25|$|Usually this crude {{glycerol}} {{has to be}} purified, typically {{by performing}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation.</b> This is rather energy intensive. The refined glycerol (98%+ purity) can then be utilised directly, or converted into other products. The following announcements were made in 2007: A joint venture of Ashland Inc. and Cargill announced plans to make propylene glycol in Europe from glycerol and Dow Chemical announced similar plans for North America. Dow also {{plans to build a}} plant in China to make epichlorhydrin from glycerol. Epichlorhydrin is a raw material for epoxy resins.|$|E
25|$|At {{pressures}} {{less than}} atmospheric pressure, {{the composition of the}} ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures, and at pressures less than 70torr (9.333kPa), there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture. While <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> of ethanol is not presently economical, pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research. In this technique, a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6% azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.|$|E
40|$|The carbon suboxide {{used in this}} {{investigation}} was prepared by the diacetyl tartaric anhydride method (1), and was kindly supplied by Dr. W. E. Vaughn of this laboratory. The material was purified by four <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillations</b> and may have contained a trace of acetic acid as impurity which, however, {{would not have been}} disturbing in the region investigated. The carbon suboxide gas was contained in a quartz absorption cell 15 cm. in length, provided with plane windows and a side arm containing an excess of the material in liquid form. By controlling the temperature of the latter the gas pressure in the cell could be regulated. The absorption cell itself was kept at room temperature, which was about 21 °C. The carbon suboxide apparently kept well if sealed in perfectly clean quartz vessels, especially if maintained at low temperatures, but after long exposure to ultra-violet radiation a white deposit collected on the windows of the cell. This was probably a polymerized form of the suboxide and it quickly changed over to a reddish orange form if gently heated...|$|R

50|$|The typical <b>vacuum</b> multi-effect {{membrane}} <b>distillation</b> (e.g. the memsys brand V-MEMD) module {{consists of}} a steam raiser, evaporation-condensation stages, and a condenser. Each stage recovers the heat of condensation, providing a multiple-effect design. Distillate is produced in each evaporation-condensation stage and in the condenser.|$|R
25|$|Like <b>vacuum</b> <b>{{distillation}},</b> {{steam distillation}} {{is a method}} for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive. The temperature of the steam is easier to control than {{the surface of a}} heating element, and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{distillation}} is <b>vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> {{below the}} pressure of 0.01 torr. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above high vacuum, where fluids are in the free molecular flow regime, i.e. the mean free path of molecules {{is comparable to the}} size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.|$|E
25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced {{is only a few}} hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via isotopic enrichment. Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and is the most common isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>distillation</b> of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a good chance to recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as hydriding it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine power cycle gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a secondary loop coolant system that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine power cycle. ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E

50|$|The most {{efficient}} separation routine for terbium salt from the rare-earth salt solution is ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions {{present in the}} resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. As with other rare earths, terbium metal is produced by reducing the anhydrous chloride or fluoride with calcium metal.
