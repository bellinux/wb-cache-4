Energy consumption of the control systems is part of the operating cost of a process plant. However, attempting to minimise energy consumption by restricting energy flow to the final control element may compromise the purpose of the control loop. Degrading the performance of the con-trolloops reduces product quality, reduces plant output, or wastes process fluids far more valuable than the instrument air.

40|$|In the {{perspective}} of developing an integrated system able to include loop performance assessment and early diagnosis of anomalies, an experimental characterization of more common problems encountered in industrial valves {{has been carried out}} on a pilot scale plant. The primary scope was to investigate the possibility of detecting different types of valve anomalies from the analysis of routine data, by taking into account additional variables made available by intelligent instrumentation and field bus communication systems. Experimental results show that different problems (as: stiction, change in valve dynamics, air leakage and periodic disturbances), cannot be easily detected by referring to classical loop variables. On the contrary, their presence can be promptly identified by means of Travel Deviation and Drive Signal values, made available by the <b>valve</b> <b>positioner.</b> A key role is plaid by the availability of the valve stem position...|$|E
40|$|There is some {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} on whether or not large plant gains are a problem when it comes to input-output controllability. In this paper, control-lability requirements are derived for two kinds of input errors, namely restriced (low) input resolution (e. g. caused by a sticky valve) and input disturbances. In both cases, the controllability is limited if the plant gain is large at high frequen-cies. Limited input resolution causes limit cycle behavior (oscillations) similar to that found with relay feedback. The magnitude of the output variations depends on the plant gain at high frequency, but is independent of the controller tuning. Pro-vided frequent input (valve) movements are acceptable, one may reduce the output magnitude by forcing the system to oscillate at a higher frequency, for example by introducing a faster local feedback (e. g. a <b>valve</b> <b>positioner)</b> or by pulse modulating the input signal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To add back on release: Current-to-pressure (I/P) {{converters}} are pneumatic devices {{which provide}} precise control of pressure in various industries – for example these devices {{are often used}} in <b>valve</b> <b>positioner</b> systems (typically found in {{the oil and gas}} industry) and tensioning systems (typically used in the packaging industry). With an increasing demand for such devices to operate in harsh environments all by delivering acceptable performance means that Current-to-pressure converters need to be carefully designed such that environmental factors have no or minimal effects on its performance. This work presents an investigation of the principles of operation of an existing I/P converter through mathematical modelling. A simulation model has been created and which allows prediction of performance of the I/P converter. This tool has been used to identify areas of poor performances through theoretical analysis and consequently led to optimisation of certain areas of the I/P converter through a design change to deliver improved performances, for instance the average percentage shift in gain at 1 mA input signal (over the temperature range of - 40 °C to 85 °C) on the new I/P converter is 2. 13...|$|E

40|$|Since about 1994 several {{manufacturers}} have been introducing {{a new generation}} of <b>valve</b> <b>positioners.</b> They are called digital positioners because they have integrated micro controllers (some manufacturers also call them "intelligent" positioners). They offer a range of features that could be of special interest for LHC: simple installation (Fieldbus reduces cabling and therefore costs) automatic start-up and calibration (self-adaptation to valve) means fast and therefore cheap maintenance communication capability (e. g. Hart, Profibus, etc.) remote configuration preventive maintenance planning using diagnostic data reduced air consumption. The use of this new generation of positioners could improve the overall reliability of the LHC cryogenic system as well as provide significant manpower savings. An analysis of the present and future cryogenic systems shows that the total number of control valves and their widespread distribution in the tunnel (and therefore the length of the access routes) will all be significantly different for LHC than they are for LEP. In LEP, all control valves are close to the access points. In LHC, the control valves will be distributed evenly along the whole tunnel. LHC will make use of about an order of magnitude more control valves in the tunnel than LEP...|$|R
40|$|Valve {{stiction}} {{is indicated}} {{as one of}} the main problems affecting control loop performance and then product quality. Therefore, it is important to detect this phenomenon as early as possible, distinguish it from other causes, and suggest the correct action to the operator in order to fix it. It is also very desirable to give an estimate of stiction amount, {{in order to be able}} to follow its evolution in time to allow the scheduling of valve maintenance or different operations, if necessary. This paper, in two parts, is a review of the state of the art about the phenomenon of stiction from its basic characterization to smart diagnosis, including modeling, detection techniques, quantification, compensation and a description of commercial software packages. In particular, Part I of the study analyzes the most significant works appearing in the recent literature, pointing out analogies and differences among various techniques, showing more appealing features and possible points of weakness. The review also includes an illustration of the main features of performance monitoring systems proposed by major software houses. Finally, the paper gives indications on future research trends and potential advantages for loop diagnosis when additional measurements are available, as in newly designed plants with <b>valve</b> <b>positioners</b> and smart instrumentation. In Part II, performance of some well-established methods for stiction quantification are compared by applications to different industrial datasets...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the {{industrial}} process control industry Safety Instrumented Systems are becoming high profile. Most companies have accepted that the performance-based standards such as ANSI/ISA 84. 01, IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 {{are here to}} stay and that conformance is not optional. A growing number of instrumentation manufacturers have recognized the steadily increasing interest that this market has shown in bringing their plants into conformance with the standards. They have responded by introducing a wide range of products that are “suitable for use ” in Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS). These products include sensors, transmitters, valves and valve positioners and a wide range of logic solvers. Most users have little concern about being able to select a proper sensor, transmitter or <b>valve</b> <b>positioner</b> {{but when it comes to}} choosing from the vast array of logic solvers, they often do not know how to make a proper decision. The problem is clear when you consider the range of choices for Logic Solvers that range from the relatively simple alarm trip architectures up through the wide variety of safety PLCs offered by about twenty different manufacturers. These PLC architectures cover the scale from simple one-out-of-one (1 oo 1) architectures up through triple and quadruple redundant systems with differing degrees of self-diagnostics. With all of these choices, how is a control engineer supposed to pick the “best ” system for his project and / or plant standard? If he errors on the side of conservatism, he may cost his company tens of thousands of wasted dollars by selecting a more sophisticated system than is warranted by the application. And, even worse, a simplistic system may not be in conformance with the standards and could place human life at unnecessary risk. The problem is exacerbated when all factors of lifecycle costs are considered...|$|E

Preliminary results on the magnetostriction of textured polycrystalline materials are presented here. For instance, polycrystalline Tb 0. 60 Dy 0. 40, plane-rolled (one direction of applied stress) to induce crystallographic texture, has shown magnetostrictions at 77 K of 3000 ppm for an applied field of 4. 5 kOe and an applied load of 23 MPa, or 48 % that of a single crystal under similar conditions. Comparisons are presented between the magnetostrictive response of plane- and form-rolled (two orthogonal directions of applied stress) polycrystalline Tb 0. 60 Dy 0. 40 at 10 and 77 K. It is reported that at 10 K plane-rolled Tb 0. 60 Dy 0. 40 exhibits 1600 ppm magnetostriction at an applied field of 4. 4 kOe with a minimal applied load of 0. 28 MPa. An observed restoration of the initial unstrained state may be a useful feature of polycrystalline materials for engineering service. Finally it is reported that thermal expansion measurements provide a measure of crystallographic texture for comparison with the magnetostriction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Poor {{performance}} of a control loop is usually caused by poor controller tuning, presence of distur-bances, control loop interactions and/or loop nonlinearities. The presence of nonlinearities in control loops {{is one of the}} main reasons for poor {{performance of}} a linear controller designed based on linear control theory. In a control loop, nonlinearities may appear either in the control instruments such as <b>valves</b> and <b>positioners</b> or in the process. Among the control valve nonlinearities stiction, deadband, deadzone, hysteresis and saturation are most common. A nonlinear system often produces a non-Gaussian and nonlinear time series. The test of Gaus-sianity or nonlinearity of a control loop variable serves as a useful diagnostic aid towards diagnosing the causes of poor {{performance of a}} control loop. Two indices, the Non-Gaussianity Index (NGI) and the Non-Linearity Index (NLI), developed in [1] are used to detect the possible presence of nonlinearity in the loop. These indices together with specific patterns in the process output (pv) vs. the controller output (op) plot can be conveniently used to diagnose the causes of poor control loop performance thus ensuring smooth operation of the plant. The method has been successfully applied to many industrial data sets. One of the interesting case studies is presented in this paper. The results of the analysis were confirmed and the results after the troubleshooting was performed are also presented...|$|R
5000|$|As the {{pneumatic}} operation of valves, compared to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the valve actuator or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a pneumatic nozzle and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to sense the valve actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual valve regulating element position against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the <b>valve</b> body. A <b>positioner</b> also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type valve actuators.|$|R
