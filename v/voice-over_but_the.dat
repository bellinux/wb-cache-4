40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out how the tv-program I Zlatans fotspår (English: In Zlatan's footprints) broadcasted on Swedish public service {{television}} represent the participating young players and the Swedish football player Zlatan Ibrahimović. Our question formulation reads as follows: –        How is the participating youths being represented in the tv-program I Zlatans fotspår? –        How is the football player Zlatan Ibrahimović being represented in the tv-program I Zlatans fotspår?   Our thesis is qualitative and in order to find out how the participants are being represented we used a discourse analysis. We have focused on the theories discourse, identity, representation, stereotypes, discrimination and the perspective social constructionism. We chose to analyze some of the interviews with the young players and with Zlatan Ibrahimović. We also analyzed the voice-over that figured in the program. Worth mentioned is that we had an idea that there would be some discrimination and stereotyping in the program.   The result of our analysis shows that the voice-over uses some discriminating and stereotyping descriptions of the young players. The descriptions made by the voice-over are on the whole very inconsequent, some focus on the players’ qualities on the football pitch whilst others are about their personal qualities. In the interviews with the players these kind of values aren’t shown that explicit as in the <b>voice-over.</b> <b>But</b> <b>the</b> interviewer’s questions are sometimes formulated in a way that creates a distance towards the players. Moreover, there are just longer interviews with five of the nine players.   The result also shows that Zlatan Ibrahimović is being described and represented as the big star, a national hero that the young players look up to and want to be like. He has gone through the journey that awaits many of the young players and he managed to finish at the very top. Although Zlatan is being represented like this he still thinks that he has a lot left to learn and that he is far from being the complete football player...|$|E

5000|$|The Seattle Times John Hartl {{called the}} archive footage [...] "fuzzy, scratchy and poorly chosen". He praised Waltz's <b>voice-over</b> <b>but</b> criticized <b>the</b> {{remaining}} voice actors. Hartl advised the viewers {{to see the}} 1960 film Exodus first. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the voice-overs from well known Hollywood actors was [...] "unnecessarily distracting" [...] but opined that history buffs would find it fascinating. Nicole Herrington wrote for The New York Times that the voice acting was jarring when archival clips of the prime ministers in their own voices were included. Herrington criticized the film for not providing a balanced political view and said [...] "It’s an omission that feels like a missed opportunity." [...] In his review published in the Slant Magazine, Wes Greene criticized the film for being overly patriotic and its loud [...] "emotion-cuing" [...] music. He added that if the [...] "distracting slew" [...] of voice-overs from well known actors had not been included, the documentary would have looked like a History Channel special. Now called it an [...] "unabashedly pro-Zionist documentary" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "strictly for hardcore Zionists who haven't noticed that the Middle East is deeply contested terrain."National Post David Berry wrote that it was [...] "both tone-deaf and inert" [...] and called the voice acting a [...] "serious misstep".

50|$|Audiovisual {{translation}} studies (AVT) {{is concerned with}} translation {{that takes place in}} audio and/or visual settings, such as the cinema, television, video games and also some live events such as opera performances. The common denominator for studies in this field is that translation is carried out on multiple semiotic systems, as the translated texts (so-called polysemiotic texts) have messages that are conveyed through more than one semiotic channel, i.e. not just through the written or spoken word, but also via sound and/or images. The main translation modes under study are subtitling, dubbing and <b>voice-over,</b> <b>but</b> also surtitling for the opera and theatre.|$|R

50|$|Film noir is {{especially}} {{associated with the}} voice-over technique. The golden age of first-person narration was in the 1940s. The term Film noir was coined by the French film critics, Nino Frank the first among them in 1946. More often than not, the plot of a Film Noir evolved around a cynical, hard-hearted, disillusioned male character accompanied with a narrative voiceover. Film noir typically used male <b>voice-over</b> narration <b>but</b> {{there are a few}} rare female voice-overs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} under three titles: [...] "I'm Easy", [...] "I'm Easy (Cooler Version)", and [...] "Easy". The title varies {{depending upon the}} region of release {{or whether it was}} the single or part of the album Angel Dust. As a single, in most countries apart from the United States, Australia and Japan, releases had the title [...] "I'm Easy". In the aforementioned countries, the title was simply [...] "Easy" [...] with the German special edition using [...] "I'm Easy (Cooler Version)". There are at least two different mixes in circulation, all of which originate from the same studio recording of the song. The first mix has a voice-over by Mike Patton during the first few seconds of the song: [...] "Turn the lights out, baby. This one's for the ladies in the house". It also has fewer guitar overdubs, a slightly different bass line before the guitar solo, and more reverb on the entire track. The second version, sometimes listed as the [...] "Cooler Version" [...] as titled on the German special edition of the single, lacks this <b>voice-over</b> <b>but</b> features a background string-synth arrangement throughout the song as well as the [...] "missing" [...] guitar parts not found in the other mix.|$|R

He then moved to New York City and worked as an actor (including musical theatre, daytime television, and commercial & character <b>voice-over</b> gigs), <b>but</b> eventually returned to singing the standards of Harold Arlen, Dorothy Fields, Jimmy McHugh and many other musicians he grew up listening to.|$|R
5000|$|His third film as director, Double Indemnity (1944) {{was a major}} hit. A film noir, {{nominated}} for Best Director and Screenplay, it was co-written with mystery novelist Raymond Chandler, although the two men did not get along. Double Indemnity not only set conventions for the noir genre (such as [...] "venetian blind" [...] lighting and <b>voice-over</b> narration), <b>but</b> was also a landmark {{in the battle against}} Hollywood censorship. The original James M. Cain novel Double Indemnity featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was highly popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the Hays Code, because adultery was central to its plot. Double Indemnity is credited by some as the first true film noir, combining the stylistic elements of Citizen Kane with the narrative elements of The Maltese Falcon (1941).|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} the voice of R. Crumb's {{underground}} comic character Fritz the Cat in both the animated film {{of the same name}} and its sequel, The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat. In 1977, he voiced the Easter Bunny in the Rankin/Bass made-for-television, stop-motion animated feature The Easter Bunny Is Comin' To Town, and in 1980, he provided the voice for the title character in the direct-to-video feature film I Go Pogo (also done in stop-motion). His most recent acting roles were an appearance in the PBS science education show 3-2-1 Contact in 1984 and a part in an episode of Kate & Allie in 1989. Then he retired from television acting and devoted his entire career to <b>voice-over</b> work, <b>but</b> in 2006 he made appearances in two retrospectives of The Electric Company: one was a PBS pledge drive special, the other was The Best of the Electric Company: Vol. 2.|$|R
5000|$|Scratch vocals {{are also}} {{often used in}} the {{production}} of feature-length animated films to bring storyboards to life as [...] "animatics," [...] in which storyboard frames are synced to the relevant dialogue, together with a rough soundtrack generated on a synthesizer. Scratch vocals may be obtained from professional voice actors (who {{may or may not be}} well-established in <b>the</b> <b>voice-over</b> community <b>but</b> are generally unknown to the general public) or from anyone around the studio willing to chip in a line or two (as well as friends or family members). For lead roles, scratch vocals are nearly always replaced in the final cut by vocal tracks recorded by bankable stars or experienced character actors. However, in the rush to meet deadlines, if the scratch vocals for a minor role are good enough, the director may skip auditions and simply use the scratch vocalist in the role. This is how many animation studio employees (and their friends and family members) end up with minor credits as cast members on their studio's products.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about my recent works and some {{questions}} intimately related to them, with {{particular attention to}} my thesis project; the single channel video, I usually live abroad. This work plays with voice-over {{in order to discuss}} its traditional authoritative and absolute meaning. Further, the work reveals the impossibility of establishing an organic unity of meaning, proliferating the possible interpretation of the fragments that constitute the work. I will use the concept of “postmodern allegory” as defined by Jeremy Tambling to interpret my recent works that refer to the historic breakdown of ideologies whose fixed values and meanings seem incapable of interpreting contemporary reality. How can voice-over be used beyond the realms of authority and objectivity that are usually associated with this component of cinematic language? Instead of considering voice-over as belonging to a separate space from that of the images, I propose that it creates an interstitial space for a negotiation between the spoken text and the images. What is at stake for me is not the authority of <b>the</b> <b>voice-over</b> <b>but</b> its possibility to question objectivity through a subjective point of view able to provoke individual reactions among viewers. A second concern is what the potentialities are of the relationship between images and subtitles? The dominant use of subtitles is translation. I propose that there are other more creative uses of texts juxtaposed with images. Subtitles are for example a way to express unspoken thoughts or a possibility to subvert the centrality of the image in movies and videos, they can also create a dialogue instead of a translation in their relationship with the voice. This thesis also refers to a conception of allegory, developed by Walter Benjamin and Paul de Man, that is essential in exploring the deceptive nature of the language I use and the meanings I can communicate with it. I am specifically considering postmodern allegories as something distant from traditional allegories. Allegory is a device to express, through the use of fragments, a world in which it is impossible to establish any definitive meaning. Differently than a metaphor, an allegory doesn't state that A=B and it doesn't establish a consecutive pattern in which we associate something specific with one other specific thing, but often it creates a successive pattern open to several interpretations that fracture instead of unifying any further meaning. My recent works aim to feed this pattern...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after forming, {{the band}} {{recorded}} a four song EP which received local airplay with songs including: [...] "I Wanna Be A Yank" [...] and a cover {{version of the}} Monkees hit [...] "Stepping Stone".

In 1979 they recorded another four song EP [...] "The Black EP" [...] which was in a more New Wave direction adding keyboards. After 1981 they were billed as [...] "John Paul Young and The Cardboard Brains" [...] with a sound that was keyboard focused with {{little in common with}} their earlier work except for a limited edition live album in 1982 which was originally recorded as part of a live-to-air simulcast for radio station CFNY.

John Paul Young went into film and <b>voice-over</b> work <b>but</b> has since gone into seclusion.
