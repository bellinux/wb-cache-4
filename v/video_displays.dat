5|$|On October 30, to {{celebrate}} {{the opening of the}} first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of Avatar to a number of press. The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on , 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest <b>video</b> <b>displays,</b> and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It {{is said to be the}} largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.|$|E
5|$|All {{repair work}} on the New Orleans Arena was {{finished}} by March 2006, and a new scoreboard and <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> were added during the process. In June 2006, Shinn stated he {{was pleased with the}} ongoing recovery process in New Orleans and again reaffirmed his desire to permanently return for the 2007–08 season. However, the Hornets also announced that they {{were in the process of}} negotiating with Oklahoma City to play the 2007–08 season at the Ford Center as a contingency plan. The Hornets opened the 200607 season at New Orleans with a win over the Boston Celtics. They improved their final record from the previous season by one game, and again finished tenth in the Western Conference, three games out of the playoffs. Their attendance declined slightly compared to the previous season, and they finished 15th overall in attendance.|$|E
5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E

5000|$|One 16-bit HuC6270A <b>video</b> <b>display</b> {{controller}} (VDC). Like the TMS99xx {{family of}} <b>video</b> <b>display</b> processors, it has port-based I/O.|$|R
50|$|To {{keep the}} price of the {{computer}} and the component count down, a novel technique was used to implement the <b>video</b> <b>display.</b> Instead of an expensive <b>video</b> <b>display</b> controller chip with dedicated memory, the Super-80 used discrete TTL logic to implement the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> and 512 bytes of system RAM was shared between the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> and the CPU. Fifty times per second, the CPU was turned off for around 10 ms by asserting the Z80 BUSREQ (DMA) pin. The <b>video</b> <b>display</b> circuitry would then read from the shared RAM while it refreshed the image on the screen. In addition to a 50% degradation in processor performance, this meant that {{it was not possible to}} perform any accurate timing in software, since the programmer had no control over when the next <b>video</b> <b>display</b> refresh cycle would occur. The <b>video</b> <b>display</b> could be switched off under software control for greater processing speed, or when accurate software timing was required. The most common situation in which that occurred was when the built-in cassette interface was being used. The location of the 512 bytes of video memory was normally at the top of the available RAM, but could be changed by writing to an I/O port.|$|R
5|$|The sensor {{transmitters}} would relay {{their data}} to the second element of the system, an orbiting EC-121R aircraft of the Air Force's 553rd Reconnaissance Wing, based at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base. The EC-121s would then relay the collected information via a radio link at 2200 to 2300 MHz to Nakhon Phanom. At Task Force Alpha, {{the last of the}} three components in the system, the intelligence data (from a variety of sources, not just the sensors) would be entered, collated, retrieved, and stored by two IBM 360/40 (later two 360/65) computers. Technicians at the center controlled the system from a variety of <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> that were also linked to the computers.|$|E

5000|$|The VDU Expansion Board (VDUEB) was an {{enhanced}} <b>video</b> <b>display</b> {{board for the}} Super-80 developed by Microcomputer Engineering (MCE). The VDUEB gave the Super-80 an 80×25 <b>video</b> <b>display</b> with limited graphics capabilities. It {{was based on a}} 6845 CRTC I.C. and had its own 2kB of video RAM and 2kB of character generator RAM. Installation of the VDUEB board was a one-way process, as it required major modifications to the Super-80 printed circuit board including cutting of tracks and soldering in many wire links between various parts of the board. The VDUEB was then connected via three I.C. sockets formerly occupied by the original <b>video</b> <b>display</b> circuitry. Removal of the original DMA based <b>video</b> <b>display</b> effectively doubled the performance of the computer, since the CPU was no longer being disabled 50 times per second for <b>video</b> <b>display</b> refreshes. The board gave the Super-80 similar <b>video</b> <b>display</b> capabilities to the Applied Technology Microbee computer, released about six months after the Super-80. This led to many Microbee games being ported to the VDUEB equipped Super-80. The VDUEB proved to be a popular modification, with a users' group forming for owners of VDUEB equipped computers - The [...] "Super-80 VDUEB Users' Club".|$|R
50|$|Dawgzilla is {{the name}} of the high {{definition}} LED <b>video</b> <b>display</b> board and sound system located behind the north end zone of Joe Aillet Stadium. The video board was designed, manufactured, and installed by Daktronics during the summer of 2009. The HD-X <b>video</b> <b>display</b> measures 25 feet high by 45 feet wide with a 16-millimeter pixel pitch. Two ribbon boards placed directly above and below the main <b>video</b> <b>display</b> each measure 4 feet high by 45 feet wide with 23-millimeter pixel pitches. The total <b>video</b> <b>display</b> area measures 1,485 square feet, which made Dawgzilla the largest video board in the Western Athletic Conference after its construction in 2009. Also installed atop the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> is a custom Sportsound sound system. The video board is mounted on a brick foundation constructed by Lincoln Builders and is flanked by artistic metal displays. The Dawgzilla project cost $2 million and was financed through a partnership with Learfield Sports and Community Trust Bank.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, the Iowa Board of Regents {{approved}} an $8 million upgrade of Kinnick Stadium's {{video and}} sound systems. These upgrades include {{the installation of}} new HD <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> in both {{the north and south}} endzones, as well as a new HD ribbon display above the north endzone. The upgrades were completed by the start of the 2013 football season.|$|E

All mainline aircraft are fitted with individual <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> in all classes. WiFi is installed on all narrowbody aircraft and will be fitted on widebody aircraft starting Fall 2016. The majority of the widebody aircraft (Boeing 767, Boeing 777, Boeing 787, Airbus A330) operate from Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, game {{designers}} {{often put}} hidden, recurring images or references in their games, which {{became known as}} Easter eggs. For example, Williams' designers hid cows in the <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> of the games, and Pat Lawlor would place a red button in the artwork of games he developed. The methods used to find the hidden items usually involved pressing the flipper buttons in a certain order or during specific events.|$|E
50|$|Page {{orientation}} {{is also used}} to describe the dimensions of a <b>video</b> <b>display.</b> The most common <b>video</b> <b>display</b> {{orientation is}} landscape mode, especially the 4:3 ratio, which is 4 units wide and 3 units tall, and the more recent 16:9 widescreen landscape display mode.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the season, a new $2.9 million, 30 ft, 74 ft high-definition(HD) Daktronics LED <b>video</b> <b>display</b> was {{installed}} in the south end-zone of Jordan-Hare Stadium. Auburn was the first SEC school to install an HD <b>video</b> <b>display</b> and the second in the NCAA (after Texas' Godzillatron).|$|R

25|$|Chandler's {{interest}} in technology {{was not limited}} to printing machines. In the 1970s, he installed video display terminals to receive electronic feeds from the wire services. In the 1980s, he replaced the <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> with computers. In 1993, a new information systems department was added to The Bulletin organization. In 1996, The Bulletin established its presence on the internet by activating the bendbulletin.com domain. This gave the newspaper its own website, and provided its staff with e-mail connectivity.|$|E
25|$|A few {{kilometres}} from Paestum {{there was}} a temple complex {{at the mouth of}} the Sele river (Foce del Sele in Italian) dedicated to Hera. The temple is now all but destroyed, and little remains of several other buildings. About 70 of the sixth-century BC Archaic metope relief panels on the temple and another building at the site were recovered, however. These fall into two groups, the earlier of which shows the story of the life of Heracles in 38 surviving reliefs; the later group, of about 510 BC, shows pairs of running women. The earlier cycle forms the centrepiece of the Paestum museum, set in place around walls of the original height. At the site there is a museo narrante with <b>video</b> <b>displays,</b> but no original artefacts.|$|E
25|$|The ICE trains {{adhere to}} a high {{standard}} of technology: all cars are fully air-conditioned and nearly every seat features a headphone jack which enables the passenger to listen to several on-board music and voice programmes {{as well as several}} radio stations. Some seats in the 1st class section (in some trains also in 2nd class) are equipped with <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> showing movies and pre-recorded infotainment programmes. Each train is equipped with special cars that feature in-train repeaters for improved mobile phone reception as well as designated quiet zones where the use of mobile phones is discouraged. The newer ICE 3 trains also have larger digital displays in all coaches, displaying, among other things, Deutsche Bahn advertising, the predicted arrival time at the next destination and the current speed of the train.|$|E

25|$|Holoxica has successfuly {{demonstrated}} {{several generations}} of holographic <b>video</b> <b>displays.</b> The technical approach advocates a simplified approach by starting with basic building blocks and scaling towards higher resolution and performance. The first-generation holographic display demonstrator, built in 2010, had up to nine voxels and could show simple numeric information, icons, symbology etc. This technology {{can be used to}} build segmented 3D displays, similar to the early segmented LCDs found in calculators and clocks. The second-generation display was announced in 2013. This is a planar Head-Up Display (HUD) with hundreds of thousands voxels and freeform images floating in mid-air that can change in real time. Interactivity is added with a Kinect motion sensor that allows you to 'touch' icons in free space and 'draw' in mid-air. The third generation display builds upon the previous generations to create a volumetric display. The images are bright and visible under indoor lighting conditions, and the approach is scalable, leveraging existing manufacturing techniques and components.|$|E

500|$|Although {{a promotional}} music video {{had not been}} {{produced}} for the original release, the band used footage from a 5 June 1983 live performance filmed for the concert film [...] to promote the song. Directed by Gavin Taylor, the <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> Bono's use of a white flag during performances of the song. The video highlights the intensity and emotion felt by many audience members during U2's concerts, while the rainy, torch-lit setting in Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheatre further adds to the atmosphere. [...] In 2004, Rolling Stone cited the performance as one [...] "50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll" [...] and noted that [...] "the sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created {{by a combination of}} wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit and—shown in heavy rotation on MTV—broke the band nationwide." ...|$|E
500|$|The clip portrays {{sexual assaults}} mostly against women, {{and how they}} cope after the incident. The {{black-and-white}} video opens with a warning message: [...] "The following contains graphic content that may be emotionally unsettling but reflects {{the reality of what}} is happening daily on college campuses." [...] It then shows a girl walking through an empty corridor, followed by young people in various activities in a college campus: reading (portrayed by actress Nikki Reed), a trans man adjusting his chest binder in the bathroom, attending a party (one of the partygoers being portrayed by actress Kiersey Clemons). However they are all sexually assaulted, with one of the scenes showing a couple of young girls being drugged and raped at the party. The heartbroken girls and the trans man cry, while alternate images show them expressing their emotions by inscribing words on themselves. Ultimately they find solace and hope in friendship, and leave the college with their friends, as the words inscribed on their bodies change to positive messages. Near its ending, the music <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> the message: [...] "One in five college women will be sexually assaulted this year unless something changes", following which the message points the audience to the Facebook page for The Hunting Ground and Itsonus.org, the White House support website for people who have endured a sexual crime. A portion of the earnings from the song's digital sales will be donated to organizations supporting victims of sexual assault.|$|E
500|$|To {{accommodate}} the video production, {{the equivalent of}} a television studio control room—costing US$3.5million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used fivebroadcast camera systems, 12Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12directors, 19video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So if it turns out they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E
