40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} puzzling of the Dutch vestigial genitives is the partitive genitive with {{indefinite}} pronouns and numerals, as in (1) and (3). What is most noteworthy is its stubborn resilience {{in the face}} of deflexion, even though other partitive genitives have long given way to alternative s-less constructions, such as close appositions, and even though such an alternative is occasionally attested for the partitive genitive at issue as well, as shown in (2) and (4) (Van der Horst 2008 : 1624 - 1625). This has led numerous researchers to assume a new, grammatical function for this –s suffix, yielding a vivid – if mostly theoretical – discussion (Abney 1987, Broekhuis & Strang 1996, Kester 1996, Van Marle 1996, Hoeksema 1998, Booij 2010 : 223 - 228, Broekhuis 2013). On the basis of a more systematic analysis of corpus data, we call into question the purely grammatical nature of this suffix. (1) iets leuk-s something fun-GEN ‘something fun’ (2) iets leuk something fun ‘something fun’ (3) veel interessant-s much interesting-GEN ‘a lot of interesting things’ (4) veel interessant much interesting ‘a lot of interesting things’ We try to uncover the function of the –s suffix by looking for contexts in which {{the presence or absence of}} the genitive –s can be predicted. More concretely, we use logistic regression to unearth the variables which determine the alternation between the variants with and without –s suffix. We assess both (socio/region) lectal variables and grammatical variables, such as regional <b>variety,</b> <b>register,</b> the type of quantifier and adjective, the length of the adjective, etc., as well as possible interaction effects. We also include a random factor Phrase, to take into account the different phrases (measured in types) in our dataset. The results of our analysis strongly suggest that the function of the -s suffix is multifactorial in nature, and cannot reside solely in the grammar. Our fine-grained analysis allows us to give more precise underpinnings for the assumed regional split in the function of the –s suffix than the extant literature is able to provide. Contrary to what is often claimed, the s-less variant occurs in both regions, but in the North, –s omission can be largely brought back to a number of well-delimited special cases, in which the influence of ‘adjacent’ constructions plays a role (i. e. superficially resembling, but etymologically unrelated constructions). In the South however, the s-less variant does not seem to be limited to any specific grammatical context. Instead, the –s appears to demarcate the boundary between informal and formal language use.

30|$|For Spanish maize cultivars, we {{combined}} {{the data of}} nine editions of the “European Common Catalogue” of varieties of agricultural crops published in the Official Journal of the European Union (from April 2003 to December 2011) with the norms published in the Spanish Official Journal (“Boletín Oficial del Estado”) registering or withdrawing maize varieties at the Spanish Register of Seeds from January 1997 to December 2011 c (Appendix). Although frequently the <b>varieties</b> <b>registered</b> or withdrawn from the two catalogues coincide, {{this is not always}} the case and the difference is especially relevant for many GM varieties that are only registered in the Spanish Catalogue during a certain period of time. For instance, although the first Mon 810 GM <b>varieties</b> were <b>registered</b> in the Spanish Catalogue in 2002, they did not appear in the Common Catalogue until September 2004. It is also {{important to note that the}} <b>varieties</b> <b>registered</b> in the Common Catalogue can be used throughout Europe. So, in principle, Spanish farmers can use any maize cultivar registered in another EU country. However, this practice is rare as most farmers use the <b>varieties</b> <b>registered</b> in their country because they are more readily available and better adapted to the local conditions.|$|R

The firmness of the tomatoes {{was measured using}} Effegi type Bishop FT 327 firmness tester. Measurements were carried out for three consecutive days after plucking them from plants. Ever since tomatoes were harvested, the firmness was found to decrease daily. Throughout the three-day period of shelf life, all three <b>varieties</b> <b>registered</b> a higher firmness value for sun-shaded side than the corresponding firmness value for the sun-exposed side. Among the three tomato varieties, Maheshi at all times registered the highest firmness value while T- 146 <b>variety</b> <b>registered</b> the lowest.

30|$|Farmers’ seed {{choice is}} not only {{based on the number}} of commercially offered cultivars but also on the {{diversity}} of cultivars in the national catalogue of varieties. In June 2002, the European Union decided on a common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species on the basis of the national catalogues. As Switzerland joined the directive on a common catalogue of varieties through an agreement with the EU in 2002, the four countries have access to a large number of <b>registered</b> <b>varieties.</b> In 2011, there were more than 4500 <b>varieties</b> <b>registered</b> in Europe, all tradable with the exception of GM varieties. However, the country-specific cultural value of seeds, e.g. their appearance on the national catalogues of recommended varieties, remain crucial for EU seed cultivars.

40|$|A {{sample of}} 480 bread wheat {{varieties}} originating from 15 European geographical areas and released from 1840 to 2000 were analysed {{with a set}} of 39 microsatellite markers. The total number of alleles ranged from 4 to 40, with an average of 16. 4 alleles per locus. When seven successive periods of release were considered, the total number of alleles was quite stable until the 1960 s, from which time it regularly decreased. Clustering analysis on Nei's distance matrix between these seven temporal groups showed a clear separation between groups of <b>varieties</b> <b>registered</b> before and after 1970. Analysis of qualitative variation over time in allelic composition of the accessions indicated that, on average, the more recent the European varieties, the more similar they were to each other. However, European accessions appear to be more differentiated as a function of their geographical origin than of their registration period. On average, western European countries (France, The Netherlands, Great Britain, Belgium) displayed a lower number of alleles than southeastern European countries (former Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary) and than the Mediterranean area (Italy, Spain and Portugal), which had a higher number. A hierarchical tree on Nei's distance matrix between the 15 geographical groups of accessions exhibited clear opposition between the geographical areas north and south of the arc formed by the Alps and the Carpathian mountains. These results suggest that diversity in European wheat accessions is not randomly distributed but can be explained both by temporal and geographical variation trends linked to breeding practices and agriculture policies in different countries...|$|R
40|$|Chile is {{the origin}} of the Solanum tuberosum group Chilotanum {{corresponding}} to lowland tetraploid landraces. The most complete morphological description of the Chilean germplasm was published in 2008 in the Catalogue of Varieties of Native Potatoes from Chile, which describes 211 varieties. Two institutions of the Chilean government, INIA and SAG (Agricultural and Livestock Service of Chile), keep collections of 332 and 257 accessions, respectively; the <b>varieties</b> <b>registered</b> in the catalogue are included in the SAG collection. Thus, an important gap occurs between the number of varieties listed in the National Catalogue of Chile and the number of traditional varieties found in the Chilean collections of potatoes. In this work, two national collections of Chilean native germplasms (INIA-Remehue and SAG) were analysed via four microsatellite markers with the aims of (1) discriminating different genotypes in order to more accurately catalogue the current number of native Chilean varieties, (2) evaluating the diversity of genotypes potentially known with the same nomenclature by farmers, and (3) comparing allelic diversity of native germplasm with 44 commercial varieties.
