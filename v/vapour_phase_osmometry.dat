40|$|Abstract Background Use of {{essential}} oils for controlling Candida albicans growth has gained significance {{due to the}} resistance acquired by pathogens towards a number of widely-used drugs. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the antifungal activity of selected essential oils against Candida albicans in liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> and to determine the chemical composition and mechanism of action of most potent essential oil. Methods Minimum Inhibitory concentration (MIC) of different essential oils in liquid phase, assayed through agar plate dilution, broth dilution & 96 -well micro plate dilution method and <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> activity evaluated through disc volatilization method. Reduction of C. albicans cells with vapour exposure was estimated by kill time assay. Morphological alteration in treated/untreated C. albicans cells was observed by the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) /Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and chemical analysis of the strongest antifungal agent/essential oil has been done by GC, GC-MS. Results Lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) essential oil exhibited the strongest antifungal effect followed by mentha (Mentha piperita) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) essential oil. The MIC of lemon grass essential oil in liquid phase (288 mg/l) was significantly higher than that in the <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> (32. 7 mg/l) and a 4 h exposure was sufficient to cause 100 % loss in viability of C. albicans cells. SEM/AFM of C. albicans cells treated with lemon grass essential oil at MIC level in liquid and <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> showed prominent shrinkage and partial degradation, respectively, confirming higher efficacy of <b>vapour</b> <b>phase.</b> GC-MS analysis revealed that lemon grass essential oil was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (78. 2 %); α-citral or geranial (36. 2 %) and β-citral or neral (26. 5 %), monoterpene hydrocarbons (7. 9 %) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (3. 8 %). Conclusion Lemon grass essential oil is highly effective in <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> against C. albicans, leading to deleterious morphological changes in cellular structures and cell surface alterations. </p...|$|R

50|$|Vapor <b>phase</b> <b>osmometry</b> (VPO), {{also known}} as vapor-pressure osmometry, is an {{experimental}} technique for the determination of a polymer's number average molecular weight, Mn. It works {{by taking advantage of}} the decrease in vapor pressure that occurs when solutes are added to pure solvent. This technique can be used for polymers with a molecular weight of up to 20,000 though accuracy is best for those below 10,000. Although membrane osmometry is also based on the measurement of colligative properties, it has a lower bound of 25,000 for sample molecular weight that can be measured owing to problems with membrane permeation.|$|R

From the spectroscopy studies, increased conjugation length of the polymer chains with decreasing temperature or <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> polymerization is evident.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} is to compare quality of <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> {{reflowed}} solder joints soldered on different printed circuit board (PCB) surface finishes. <b>Vapour</b> <b>phase</b> reflow soldering guarantees the highest reliability, quality of processing and process safety. The big advantage of heat transfer in <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> soldering (VPS) is the extremely efficient transfer of latent heat through the condensing vapour of a chemically inert liquid. The heat transfer process is about ten times faster than hot air and about eight times faster than infra red heat. The condensation mediums used are perfluorocarbon, perflouropolyeter, flouriertes phenandren or perflouramin liquids, which are clear and colourless, have no odour, no taste, are non-flammable, non-corrosive and non-ozone depleting. For lead free soldering a boiling point of 230 °C of these liquids is recommended. The temperature of any saturated vapour cannot exceed the temperature of the boiling liquid, therefore the temperature of the PCBs and components can never be higher than that of the vapour in the machine. As the liquid boils, a layer of saturated vapour forms above the fluid creating a 100 % inert atmosphere – it allows use of less aggressive flux than in other forms of reflow. The reflow in inert gas atmosphere defines an own unique standard. As there is no danger of overheating, {{there is no need to}} set temperature profiles. <b>Vapour</b> <b>phase</b> provides probably the best possible solder reflow conditions with only minimal temperature differences across the PCB. <b>Vapour</b> <b>phase</b> is independent of size, shape or geometry with the maximum surface area exposed and every component part seeing precisely the same temperature. Comparison of quality of the solder joints is based on measurement of the solder joints nonlinearity of the currentvoltage (C-V) characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{potential}} applications of organic non-linear optical materials {{in the areas of}} optical processing and communication, the investigation of the crystal growth of new organic NLO materials has been an active field for the last 20 years. For such uses it is necessary to produce single crystals of high quality and perfection, free of strain and defects. When crystals are grown from the solution and the melt, solvent and the decomposition component in the melt can introduce impurities and imperfection to the as-grown crystals. For crystals grown from <b>vapour</b> <b>phase,</b> {{in the absence of the}} solvent, this cannot occur and the method promises to yield single crystals of higher quality. Despite this attraction, little attention has been paid to the <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> growth of organic NLO crystals. It was with this in mind that the following investigation was carried out. Using Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (p-MHB), a potential organic NLO material, a comparison investigation was made of its crystal growth from both the <b>vapour</b> <b>phase</b> and solution; this included an examination of morphological assessment, structural perfection, surface morphology and growth kinetics of the as-grown crystals and the mass transport properties in the growth ampoule.
