5|$|Sinatra {{was close}} friends with Jilly Rizzo, {{songwriter}} Jimmy Van Heusen, golfer Ken <b>Venturi,</b> comedian Pat Henry and baseball manager Leo Durocher. In his spare time, Sinatra enjoyed listening to classical music, and would attend concerts when he could. He swam {{daily in the}} Pacific Ocean, finding it to be therapeutic and giving him much-needed solitude. He would often play golf with <b>Venturi</b> at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived, and liked painting, reading, and building model railways.|$|E

It takes into account the edition of two of <b>Venturi’s</b> unpublished texts written in 1939 and 1941 - 42, now available as Communism and Socialism. History of an Idea (2014). This essays situates <b>Venturi’s</b> interpretation of Russian revolutionary socialism on the background of his political and intellectual evolution, an evolution now much better understood, yet tormented and full of complex reticence...|$|R

5|$|Greenwald {{debuted in}} WCW as the evil Miss Madness, one of Randy Savage's valets along with Gorgeous George and Madusa. Savage asked Greenwald and Madusa to train his then-girlfriend Gorgeous George in real life, {{highlights}} {{of which were}} shown on WCW television. As part of the storyline, this villainous alliance, called Team Madness, would interfere in matches {{for the benefit of}} Savage. Behind the scenes, Greenwald and Madusa trained the other women of WCW at the WCW Power Plant. Eventually, Savage betrayed Miss Madness by firing her from Team Madness along with Madusa after a championship loss. She then became Mona, a fan favorite, who wrestled in a blue cocktail dress and barefoot. She embarked on mini-feuds with Madusa, Little Jeannie, and Asya. Independent female wrestlers, such as Dee Dee <b>Venturi</b> and Brandi Alexander, were also brought in to wrestle Mona. WCW released Greenwald, however, in August 2000 in a cost-cutting move.|$|E
5|$|The Buenos Aires ePrix was {{confirmed}} {{as part of}} Formula E's 2016–17 series schedule in September 2016 by the FIA World Motor Sport Council. It was the third of twelve scheduled single-seater electric car races of the 2016–17 season, the third running of the event, and was held on 18 February 2017 at the Puerto Madero Street Circuit in Puerto Madero. It was announced in November 2016 that the race {{would be the last}} to be held at the Puterto Madero Street Circuit; the change was prompted because of the Puterto Madero area undergoing redevelopment. The event was contested by ten teams of two drivers each. The teams were e.Dams-Renault, Audi Sport ABT, Virgin, Dragon, Mahindra, <b>Venturi,</b> Andretti, Techeetah, NextEV and Jaguar.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a dangerous place during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the <b>Venturi</b> effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E

50|$|However, none of <b>Venturi's</b> contemporaries {{at the end}} of {{the eighteenth}} and {{beginning}} of the nineteenth centuries considered his original work worthy of citation or attention, with the exception of Ernst Florens Friedrich Chladni (1756-1827), a German physicist and musician, who is widely cited as the father of acoustics.After investigating the behavior of vibrating strings and plates, and examining the way in which sound appeared to be perceived, Chladni acknowledged <b>Venturi's</b> work, agreeing with him that the ability to determine the location, and direction of sound depended upon detected differences in a sound between both ears, including amplitude and frequency, subsequently denoted by the term 'interaural differences'.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (<b>Venturi)</b> for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked to be in trouble with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} new season, some teams opted to keep the same line-up as {{they had in the}} {{previous}} season; however, some teams changed drivers. One of the main changes involved the début appearance of Jaguar in the sport with the 2008–09 A1 Grand Prix champion Adam Carroll and the 2012 GP3 Series title winner Mitch Evans competing for the team. Team Aguri was purchased by Chinese sports development and management firm SECA during the previous season and was renamed Techeetah with Jean-Éric Vergne and Ma Qinghua announced as the team's drivers. Defending FIA GT World Cup champion Maro Engel was hired by <b>Venturi</b> to replace World Endurance Championship driver Mike Conway, while Virgin employed three-time consecutive World Touring Car champion José María López to partner Formula E race winner Sam Bird. The final change involved two-time Macau Grand Prix winner and reigning European Formula Three champion Felix Rosenqvist entering the series with Mahindra and partnering Nick Heidfeld. Defending drivers' champion Sébastien Buemi stayed at e.Dams-Renault after his title-winning campaign, with the Swiss driver again being joined by Nico Prost.|$|E
5|$|Six {{times in}} Colts history there were interim head coaches. In 1972, Don McCafferty was fired five games into the season. John Sandusky was named as the interim head {{coach for the}} rest of the season, during which he led the Colts to a 4–5 record, but he was not made the {{permanent}} coach the next year. In 1974, head coach Howard Schnellenberger started off the season 0–3 and was fired. Joe Thomas assumed the duties of head coach and finished the season at 2–12. In 1991, the Colts started off 0–5 and Ron Meyer was fired as head coach. Rick <b>Venturi</b> was named as the interim for the final 11 games. In 2005 Tony Dungy was forced to miss one game due to personal issues. Jim Caldwell was named as the one game interim. In 2012 offensive coordinator Bruce Arians was named as the interim head coach indefinitely after Chuck Pagano was diagnosed with leukemia four weeks into the 2012 NFL season. Arians led the Colts to a 9–3 record – the record being credited to Pagano – and made the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a race in Hong Kong was first raised in 2013 with a design team visiting the city and was {{intended}} {{to be included in the}} 2014–15 season schedule but negotiations and approval from local authorities and motorsport's international governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), went longer than anticipated. In October 2015 the Hong Kong ePrix was announced by the CEO and founder of Formula E Alejandro Agag in a press conference at the Central Harbour Front Event Space but pended further review from the FIA. The event was later confirmed as part of Formula E's 2016-17 series schedule in September 2016 by the FIA World Motor Sport Council. It was the first of 12 scheduled single-seater electric car races of the season, and was held on 9 October 2016 at the Hong Kong Central Harbourfront Circuit. The event was contested by ten teams of two drivers each. The teams were e.Dams-Renault, Audi Sport ABT, Virgin, Dragon, Mahindra, <b>Venturi,</b> Andretti, Techeetah, NextEV and Jaguar.|$|E

The Esherick House seems devoid of ornament, while the <b>Venturi</b> House has a large, purely ornamental arch on its facade. The Esherick House is essentially symmetric, but the <b>Venturi</b> House contradicts its basic symmetry with asymmetric windows.|$|E

50|$|Postmodern {{architecture}} also {{emerged as}} an attempt to enrich Modern architecture. It was especially fashionable in the 1980s, when Modernism had fallen from favour, being associated with the welfare state. Many shopping malls and office complexes for example Broadgate used this style. Notable practitioners were James Stirling and Terry Farrell, although Farrell returned to modernism in the 1990s. A significant example of postmodernism is Robert <b>Venturi's</b> Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery.|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} the article is a {{deliberate}} play on architect Robert <b>Venturi's</b> classic of post-modern architectural theory, Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} types of metering element in use. Flow benches ordinarily {{use one of}} three types: orifice plate, <b>venturi</b> meter and pitot/static tube, all of which deliver similar accuracy.

The term [...] "commercial vernacular", popularized {{in the late}} 1960s by the publication of Robert <b>Venturi's</b> [...] "Learning from Las Vegas", refers to 20th-century American suburban tract and commercial architecture. There is also {{the concept of an}} [...] "industrial vernacular" [...] with its emphasis on the aesthetics of shops, garages and factories. Some have linked vernacular with [...] "off-the-shelf" [...] aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design.|$|R
