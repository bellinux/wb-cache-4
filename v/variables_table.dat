This algorithm was designed to eliminate a bias present in classical decision tree approaches that favors continuous variables and variables with many categories over discrete variables with fewer categories (Strobl et al. 2007). It additionally eliminates bias introduced by the resampling scheme of classical random forests and affords an option that corrects importance score bias associated with correlated predictors in decision tree forests (Strobl et al. 2009).|$|E

40|$|Anthelmintic {{resistance}} is widespread among cyathostomins infecting horses. The {{ability to identify}} the level of an individual horse’s immunity to cyathostomins might facilitate the development of novel approaches to worm control in this host. Horses on nine properties in south east Queensland were recruited for a study {{to test the hypothesis}} that certain individuals consistently contribute disproportionately to pasture contamination with these parasites. Faecal samples from approximately 56 horses were collected monthly for 12 months. As the FEC data were heavily skewed to the right and contained a high proportion of zero counts (48. 5 %), a zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to assess the associations between explanatory variables and FEC. Various explanatory <b>variables</b> (<b>Table</b> 1) were fitted separately in a univariable model in both the negative binomial and logistic parts of the model. Selected variables were progressively included in a multivariable model and retained in the final model when the likelihood ratio test returned a p-value < 0. 05. 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Huber/White estimate of variance to account for clustering by horse.

30|$|As already mentioned, {{in order}} to test for the role of the 2002 reform on this {{difference}} we have estimated our model with a dummy variable that takes value 1 from 2002 onwards and the interaction of this dummy variable with the Social Security incentives and pension wealth as regressors 12. The evidence from the signs and t-ratios of these <b>variables</b> (<b>Table</b> 6, models B and C) points out that the reform changed both the pattern of response to the wealth variable, and also, in general the response to the incentive variables. In particular, it reduced its impact on the timing of retirement. This implies that we need a larger value of SSA (or PV) from 2002 onwards to reach the same impact on the hazard. The effects are estimated for the period beginning in 2002. Results are provided in Table 8. This result could be explained {{as a consequence of the}} fact that one of the changes carried out under the reform improved the treatment for those that had more than 30  years of contribution, increasing for them the amount of the pension to be received at each age. The fact that most workers (64  %) already had at least 30 contributory years (in particular, nearly one third had more than 34  years of contribution), may explain the finding that the reform reduced the incidence of the incentive structure. Additionally, the replacement rate becomes statistically significant for this period, so that a more myopic approach seems to hold. Therefore, the observed reduction in the hazard rate seems to stem from the new regulation, which has reduced its incidence, the reduction in the incentive variables as reflected in Table 2 and also from other factors that are captured by the dummy variable.|$|E

The number of sets of values of the macros Y, C, S, V, M (= M’ + M"), X and N is accordingly 81 (= 3 x 3 x 3 x 3). This part of the exercise is designed to obtain the first approximation to a rate of increase (r) which might be adopted for a National Plan having regard to the realities of the Irish situation. Since many of the figures in the tables are going to appear incredible it is necessary to point out at the start that, with one exception, namely the part M" of imports, they are the results of simple arithmetic applied to the accounting identities I(2). The only element in the exercise which involves economic theory is the assumption that the import ratio m grows pari passu with rate of growth of the economy - percent for percent - for the reasons given in Part I. This assumption of course, exacerbates the import excess situation, regarded as the principal criterion of feasibility of any plan.

This research used “randomized pretest-posttest control group design. The populations involved in this study were the students of MA Mu’alimin, Yogyakarta. The samples of this research were 15 students for each group. The unit analysis in this research was the blood taken from vena cubiti. In this research, there were dependent variables which involved the levels of IL 6, IL 4, IL 2, cortisol, Beta Endorphin, and IgG. The training programme was conducted in 7 weeks, 3 times per week, submaximal intensity, and 6 sets per session. This programme was conducted in the afternoon. The inspection of the laboratory variable used the ELISA method. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistic using SPSS for windows. This research also used statistical multivariate analysis abd discriminant analysis. The result showed that the data of samples’ characteristics after normality test was p> 0, 05, normal, and homogeneous (p> 0, 05). The result of moderate <b>variables</b> (<b>Table</b> 5. 2) included in normal span. The dependent variables after the normality test got p> 0, 05, normal, and after the levene test got p> 0, 05, homogeneous. The result of Manova Test was p: 0, 000 which implied that there were differences among the groups (Wilk Lambda p< 0, 05). At the matrix discriminant structure, it can be explained that the correlation between independent variables and the discriminant function formed with beta endorphin (0, 501) had the strongest relation to the discriminant function, followed by interleukin 6 (0, 367) while the other variables had less significant relation. Discriminator variables representing the function contributed to every discriminator of modulation immunity were beta endorphin, interleukin 6 and interleukin 4. Hence, beta endorphin had the strongest contribution to the increase of body immunity compared with other variables. Conclusion: Based on the result discussed above and the descriptive research reported by Suparto (2001) showed that breathing exercises could increase physical fitness and impenetrability of proven body manifestly. Breathing exercise increased beta endorphin, immunoglobulin G and interleukin 6, while interleukin 2 and interleukin 4 did not increase. Cartisol did not decrease significantly but there was an indication of the decrease of the level of cortisol.

40|$|Developmental {{theories}} {{suggest that}} adolescent romantic relationships are preceded by popularity in same-gender groups (Dunphy, 1963) {{and the establishment}} of mixed-gender friendship networks (Connolly & Johnson, 1996). This study investigates how peer context, in particular having friends and being perceived as popular by peers, affects adolescent’s chances of dating. Moreover, we examine whether the gender of the perceiver (i. e. same-gender or cross-gender ratings on various characteristics) matters in the association between popularity and dating. Building on the notions of previous research by Dunphy (1963) and Connolly et al. (2004), the aim of this study was threefold. First, we examined how having same-gender and cross-gender friendships relates differently to dating. Secondly, we focused on how popularity perceived by same-gender and cross-gender peers affects the chances of dating. Third, we were interested in the way characteristics that have been related to popularity (Dijkstra et al., 2009) might explain the expected associations between popularity and dating. To this end, we focused on risk behavior, aggression, athletic abilities, physical attractiveness, and prosocial behavior. To test our hypotheses we used a subsample from a longitudinal Dutch study TRAILS (Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey). We selected 590 adolescents (56 % girls) who had information on both peer nominations (T 2, M age = 13. 6) and dating history (T 3, M age = 16. 3). Moreover, we selected only those respondents who started (or did not start at all) dating after the peer nominations were assessed {{in order to maintain the}} correct temporal ordering of our concepts. The outcome variable “dating” indicated if a respondent started a dating between T 2 and T 3. Predicting variables were constructed from peer nominations on various characteristics, including friendship and popularity. Pupils could make unlimited number of nominations from their classmates, and their selections were not gender-restricted. The number of nominations received from same-gender and cross-gender peers was divided by the total number of participating same-gender and cross-gender classmates respectively, resulting in proportion scores ranging from 0 to 1. A series of generalized linear models (logistic regressions with a “logit” link function) were tested in order to investigate whether friendships and popularity predicted dating, and how this association changed with the addition of other covariates related to popularity. First, we tested the main effects of same/cross-gender friendships (Model 1), then main effect of total popularity (not separated by gender, Model 2), the effects of same-/cross-gender popularity (Model 3), and finally, the effects of other related characteristics (Model 4). All models included control <b>variables.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 shows support for the hypothesis that cross-gender friendships increase chances of dating. However, we also found that, net of cross-gender friendships, cross-gender popularity predicted dating, whereas same-gender popularity did not. The effect of cross-gender popularity was largely driven by perceived physical attractiveness and prosocial behavior (providing someone with practical help such as homework or fixing a bicycle tire); however, the later had a negative effect. These results suggest that it is important to separate same-gender and cross-gender popularity, they have different effects and are related to different sources of gendered popularity...|$|E
