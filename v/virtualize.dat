2500|$|FreeHand MX {{continues}} to run under Windows 7 using compatibility mode and under Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) within Rosetta, a PowerPC code emulator, and requires a registration patch supplied by Adobe.

Someone using a later version of Mac OS X than 10.6 might be able to use VMware Fusion, VirtualBox or Parallels to <b>virtualize</b> Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server and run Freehand using this emulator.

2500|$|For instance, {{printers}} {{were represented}} as a [...] "file" [...] at a known location when data was copied to the file, it printed out. Other systems, to provide a similar functionality, tended to <b>virtualize</b> devices at a lower level that is, both devices and files would be instances of some lower level concept. Virtualizing the system at the file level allowed users to manipulate the entire system using their existing file management utilities and concepts, dramatically simplifying operation. As {{an extension of the}} same paradigm, Unix allows programmers to manipulate files using a series of small programs, using the concept of pipes, which allowed users to complete operations in stages, feeding a file through a chain of single-purpose tools. Although the end result was the same, using smaller programs in this way dramatically increased flexibility as well as ease of development and use, allowing the user to modify their workflow by adding or removing a program from the chain.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a product}} {{positioned}} for desktop use, Virtual PC provides official {{support for a}} different set of operating systems than its server-oriented counterpart, Microsoft Virtual Server and the more advanced Hyper-V. While the latter products support a range of server operating systems, Virtual PC 2007 supports only one variety as host and another as guest; its successor, Windows Virtual PC, supports none. And, whereas Virtual Server and Hyper-V have officially supported select Linux guests since 2006 and 2008, respectively, , no Microsoft release of Virtual PC has officially supported Linux. Nonetheless, a number of Linux distributions do run successfully in Virtual PC 2007, and can be used with the Virtual Machine Additions from Virtual Server (see below). Lastly, while 64-bit host support was introduced with Virtual PC 2007, [...] release has been able to <b>virtualize</b> a 64-bit guest; Microsoft has thus far reserved this functionality for Hyper-V, which runs only on 64-bit (x64) editions of Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows 8/8.1 Pro and Enterprise, and Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education.|$|E
40|$|In <b>virtualized</b> environments, {{physical}} resources are partitioned into virtual resources {{so that they}} can be shared among individual virtual machines. This sharing of <b>virtualized</b> resources can reduce waste by increasing used capacity thereby reducing the need for as many physical machines.

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic {{provisioning}} is {{a useful}} technique for handling the <b>virtualized</b> multi-tier applications in cloud environment. Understanding the performance of <b>virtualized</b> multi-tier applications is crucial for efficient cloud infrastructure management. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic provisioning technique for a cluster-based <b>virtualized</b> multi-tier application that employ a flexible hybrid queueing model {{to determine the number}} of virtual machines at each tier in a <b>virtualized</b> application. We present a cloud data center based on virtual machine to optimize resources provisioning. Using simulation experiments of three-tier application, we adopt an optimization model to minimize the total number of virtual machines while satisfying the customer average response time constraint and the request arrival rate constraint. Our experiments show that cloud data center resources can be allocated accurately with these techniques, and the extra cost can be effectively reduced.
