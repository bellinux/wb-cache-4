5|$|Life is {{a memoir}} by the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, written with the {{assistance}} of journalist James Fox. Published in October 2010, in hardback, audio and e-book formats, the book chronicles Richards' love of music, charting influences from his mother and maternal grandfather, through his discovery of blues music, the founding of the Rolling Stones, his often turbulent relationship with Mick Jagger, his involvement with drugs, and his relationships with women including Anita Pallenberg and his wife Patti Hansen. Richards also released Vintage <b>Vinos,</b> a compilation of his work with the X-Pensive Winos, at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} archaeological sites on the island are the Cave of the Guanches, where the oldest remains in the archipelago have been found, dating to the 6th century BC, and the Caves of Don Gaspar, where the finding of plant debris in the form of carbonized seeds indicates that the Guanches practiced agriculture on the island. Both deposits are in the town of Icod de los <b>Vinos.</b>|$|E
25|$|A network {{consisting}} of two fast, toll-free motorways (TF1 and TF5) encircles nearly the entire island, linking all the main towns and resorts with the metropolitan area. The exception is in the West, from Adeje to Icod de los <b>Vinos,</b> which is traversed by a smaller winding mountain road. However, plans are in progress to complete the motorway, which caused a heavy debate between the environmentalists and the local businessmen.|$|E

Among the many existing volcanic tubes on the island stands out the Cueva del Viento, located in the northern town of Icod de los <b>Vinos,</b> which is the largest volcanic tunnel in the European Union and {{one of the largest in}} the world, although for a long time was even considered the largest in the world.|$|E
25|$|In addition, two new {{peripheral}} {{hospitals in}} the North and South areas of the island are being constructed, located in the municipalities of Icod de los <b>Vinos</b> and Arona respectively. The Hospital del Sur de Tenerife (Tenerife South Hospital) opened in 2015. These centers will function, according to their classification, as second level hospitals, with services of hospitalization, advanced diagnosis, ambulances and emergencies, and rehabilitation, etc. There are also a total of 39 centers of primary care and specialized clinics which complete the sanitary infrastructure of Tenerife.|$|E
25|$|Spain has a {{relatively}} large number of distinct wine-producing regions, more than half having the classification Denominación de Origen (DO), one of them Ribera del Duero was named Wine Region of the Year 2012 by the prestigious Wine Enthusiast Magazine, {{with the majority of}} the remainder classified as <b>Vinos</b> de la Tierra (VdlT). There are two regions nominated as Denominación de Origen Calificada (DOCa) - Rioja and Priorat - the flagship regions of Spanish winemaking. While most make both red and white wine, some wine regions are more dominated by one style than the other.|$|E

25|$|If {{measured}} {{from the ocean}} floor, it is at 7,500m (24,600ft) the highest volcano in the world base-to-peak outside of the Hawaiian Islands. Teide's elevation makes Tenerife the tenth highest island in the world. Teide is an active volcano: its most recent eruption occurred in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent on the northwestern Santiago rift. The United Nations Committee for Disaster Mitigation designated Teide a Decade Volcano because of its history of destructive eruptions and its proximity to several large towns, of which the closest are Garachico, Icod de los <b>Vinos</b> and Puerto de la Cruz. Teide, Pico Viejo and Montaña Blanca form the Central Volcanic Complex of Tenerife.|$|E
500|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{publication}} of Life, Richards released Vintage <b>Vinos,</b> a compilation album featuring tracks from three albums by his band, the X-Pensive Winos, as well as some previously unreleased material. The BBC television arts programme The Culture Show broadcast a special on 28 October 2010, consisting of a 60-minute interview with Keith Richards, conducted by Andrew Graham Dixon. The programme covered [...] "his childhood in Dartford, his passion for music and the decade that catapulted the Rolling Stones from back-room blues boys to one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands in the world". It included contributions from co-writer James Fox, Dick Taylor, former Stones PA Georgia Bergman and Bobby Keys and covered the same territory as the book. The programme was repeated on 12 November 2010.|$|E
60|$|Local {{tradition}} connects this ice-cave {{with the}} famous burial-cavern near Ycod, on the northern coast; this would give a tunnel 8 miles long and 11,040 feet high. Many declare that the meltings ebb and flow with the sea-tide, and others recount that lead and lines of many fathoms failed to touch bottom. We are told about the normal dog which fell in and {{found its way to}} the shore through the cave of Ycod de los <b>Vinos.</b> In the latter a M. Auber spent four hours without making much way; in parts he came upon scatters of Guanche bones. Mr. Robert Edwards, of Santa Cruz, recounted another native tradition--that before the eruption of A.D. 1705 there was a run of water but no cave. Mr. Addison was let down into it, and found three branches or lanes, the longest measuring 60-70 feet. What the neveros call el hombre de nieve (the snow-man) proved to be a honeycombed mass of lava revetted with ice-drippings. He judged the cave to be a crater of emission; and did not see the smoke or steam issuing from it as reported by the ice-collectors.|$|E

60|$|The best Tenerife brands were {{produced}} {{on the northern}} slopes from Sauzal and La Victoria to Garachico and Ycod de los <b>Vinos.</b> The latter, famed for its malmsey, has lost its vines and kept its name. The cultivation extended some 1,500 feet above the sea, and the plant was treated after the fashion of Madeira and Carniola (S. Austria). The latadas, or trellises, varied in height, some being so low that the peasant had to creep under them. All, however, had the same defect: the fruit got the shade and the leaves the sun, unless trimmed away by the cultivator, who was unwilling to remove these lungs in too great quantities. The French style, the pruned plant supported by a stake, was used only for the old and worn-out, and none dreamt of the galvanised wires along which Mr. Leacock, of Funchal, trains his vines. In Grand Canary I have seen the grape-plant thrown over swathes of black stone, like those which, bare of fruit, stretch for miles across the fertile wastes of the Syrian Haurán. By heat and evaporation the grapes become raisins; and, as in Dalmatia, one pipe required as much fruit as sufficed {{for three or four}} of ordinary.|$|E
