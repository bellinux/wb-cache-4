RedPhone {{integrated with the}} system dialer to make calls, but used ZRTP {{to set up an}} end-to-end encrypted VoIP channel for the actual call. RedPhone was designed specifically for mobile devices, using audio codecs and buffer algorithms tuned to the characteristics of mobile networks, and used push notifications to preserve the user's device's battery life while still remaining responsive. RedPhone was merged into TextSecure on November 2, 2015. TextSecure was then renamed as Signal for Android. RedPhone's source code was available under the GPLv3 license.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we aim {{to analyse}} the {{relationship}} between various characteristics of a communication system with data and <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> requests. Queuing theory and Markov chain analysis are effectively used for this purpose. Such a study is useful for understanding how the proposed mathematical models behave which represents a system with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> in homogenous wireless networks. We also propose to optimise the system characteristics {{in an attempt to}} provide better Quality of Service (QoS) for systems with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The proposed models have two dimensions; one for <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> and one for data calls. A channel is assigned for two input traffic <b>call,</b> namely, <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The incoming <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> are queued when the channel is busy. Since <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are delay-sensitive, priority is given to <b>voice</b> <b>calls.</b> Also, since there is only one channel, data calls are only serviced if there are no <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> in the system. For such systems, it is important to analyse the impact of buffering the <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> as well as data calls for various mean rates of call requests, and mean service times. The analytical models presented are generic which is applicable for various systems with similar characteristics. Numerical results are also provided. The results show that the proposed models can be used for optimisation of the performance of a given network...|$|R

500|$|Kane Hodder {{took over}} the role in The New Blood, and played Jason {{in the next four}} films. He {{previously}} worked alongside director John Carl Buechler on a film called Prison. Based on his experience working with Hodder, Buechler petitioned Frank Mancuso Jr. to hire him, but Mancuso was apprehensive about Hodder's limited size. Knowing he planned to use full body prosthetics, Buechler scheduled a test screening, the first in Friday the 13th history for the character, and Mancuso immediately gave Hodder approval upon seeing him. It is Buechler's contention that Hodder gave Jason his first true personality, based on the emotions, specifically the rage, that Hodder would emit while acting the part. According to Hodder, he wanted to [...] "get in touch with Jason's thirst for revenge" [...] and try to better understand his motivation to kill. After viewing the previous films, Hodder decided that he would approach Jason as a more [...] "quick and agile" [...] individual than he had been portrayed in the previous sequels. John Carl Buechler felt that Kane had [...] "natural affinity for the role"—so much that Kane's appearance, when wearing the mask, would often terrify the cast, the crew, and in one incident a lone stranger that he came across on his walk back to his trailer. Initially Frank Mancuso Jr. and Barbara Sachs planned to use a Canadian stuntperson for Jason Takes Manhattan. Hodder acted as his own <b>voice,</b> <b>calling</b> and requesting that he be allowed to reprise the role; the ultimate decision was left to director Rob Hedden, who intended to use Hodder, because he felt Hodder knew the lore of the series. With Sean Cunningham's return as producer for Jason Goes to Hell, Hodder felt his chances of reprising the role were even better: Hodder had worked as Cunningham's stunt coordinator for years. Regardless, Adam Marcus, the director for Jason Goes to Hell, always intended to hire Hodder for the role. Jason X would mark Hodder's last performance as Jason, to date. Todd Farmer, who wrote the screenplay for Jason X, knew Hodder would play Jason from the beginning. Jim Isaac was a fan of Hodder's work on the previous films, so hiring him was an easy decision.|$|E
