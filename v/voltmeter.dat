5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital <b>Voltmeter</b> so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E
25|$|A <b>voltmeter</b> is an {{instrument}} used for measuring {{electrical potential difference}} between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale {{in proportion to the}} voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter. The digital <b>voltmeter</b> was invented in 1953 by Andrew Kay, founder of Kaypro.|$|E

25|$|With these {{electrode}} designs, the <b>voltmeter</b> is detecting {{potential differences}} of ±1400 millivolts. The electrodes are further designed to rapidly equilibrate with test solutions to facilitate ease of use. The equilibration times are typically {{less than one}} second, although equilibration times increase as the electrodes age.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} uses of scopes is troubleshooting malfunctioning electronic equipment. One {{of the advantages of}} a scope is that it can graphically show signals: where a <b>voltmeter</b> may show a totally unexpected voltage, a scope may reveal that the circuit is oscillating. In other cases the precise shape or timing of a pulse is important.|$|E
50|$|Measuring {{instruments}} such as ammeters and <b>voltmeters</b> need to {{be checked}} periodically against known standards.|$|R

25|$|Vacuum Tube <b>Voltmeters</b> or valve <b>voltmeters</b> (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage {{measurements}} in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a cathode follower input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and field effect transistor <b>voltmeters</b> (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|R
25|$|Edison {{devised a}} circuit where his {{modified}} light bulb effectively replaced the resistor in a DC <b>voltmeter.</b> Edison {{was awarded a}} patent for this invention in 1884. Since there was no apparent practical use for such a device at the time, the patent application was most likely simply a precaution in case someone else did find a use for the so-called Edison effect.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{electrometer}} is {{a highly}} sensitive electronic <b>voltmeter</b> whose input impedance is so high that the current flowing into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of input resistance for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for nanovoltmeters. Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special design considerations must be applied to avoid leakage current such as driven shields and special insulation materials.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to calculators, MITS made {{a line of}} test equipment kits. These included an IC tester, a waveform generator, a digital <b>voltmeter,</b> and several other instruments. To {{keep up with the}} demand, MITS moved into a larger building at 6328 Linn NE in Albuquerque in 1973. They installed a wave soldering machine and an assembly line at the new location. In 1972, Texas Instruments developed its own calculator chip and started selling complete calculators at less than half the price of other commercial models. MITS and many other companies were devastated by this, and Roberts struggled to reduce his quarter-million-dollar debt.|$|E

25|$|A {{thermocouple}} produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise {{measurements of}} this signal require an amplifier with low {{input offset voltage}} and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the <b>voltmeter</b> itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), the measuring instrument should have high input impedance to prevent an offset in the measured voltage. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.|$|E
25|$|Equipment used {{to detect}} stray voltage varies, but common devices are {{electrical}} tester pens or electric field detectors, with follow-up testing using a low-impedance <b>voltmeter.</b> Electrical tester pens are hand-held devices which detect a potential difference between the user's hand and the object being tested. They generally indicate on contact with an energized object, if the potential difference is above the sensitivity threshold of the device. Reliability of the test can be affected if the user is at an elevated potential him/herself, or if the user is not making firm contact with a bare hand on the reference terminal of the tester.|$|E

2500|$|Verification of {{a voltage}} reading is {{performed}} using a low-impedance <b>voltmeter,</b> which usually has a shunt resistor load bridging the <b>voltmeter</b> terminals. [...] Since very little current can flow from a coupled surface through the small shunt or meter resistance, capacitively coupled voltages will collapse to zero, indicating a harmless [...] "false alarm". [...] By contrast, if an object being tested is in contact with a current source, or coupled by a very large capacitance (possible but unlikely in this context), the voltage will drop only slightly as dictated by Ohm's Law. In this latter case, real power is being delivered, indicating a potentially hazardous situation.|$|E
