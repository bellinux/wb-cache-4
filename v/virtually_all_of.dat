5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage to the historic Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the true}} authorship of the work, its actual date, and its purpose, {{have long been}} matters for {{controversy}} amongst historians and scholars, ever since Hermann Dessau in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include {{the nature of the}} sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. <b>Virtually</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these are now considered to be fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936, {{he removed}} Nicolae Titulescu {{from the office}} of Foreign Minister, {{replacing}} him with Victor Antonescu. This caused an uproar, with most of Romania's diplomatic corps voicing their dissatisfaction. Over the following months, <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Titulescu's supporters were themselves recalled (including, among others, Constantin Vișoianu, the ambassador to Poland, Constantin Antoniade, Romania's representative to the League of Nations, Dimitrie Ghyka, the ambassador to Belgium, and Caius Brediceanu, the ambassador to Austria) while Titulescu's adversaries, such as Antoine Bibesco, were returned to office. Bibesco subsequently campaigned in France and the United Kingdom, in an attempt to reassure Romania's main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania's priorities. Tătărescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged.|$|E

Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. <b>Virtually</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter.

There are also simpler and more mundane questions about what drives the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E

In between Hudson Falls and Northumberland, US4 overlapped NY32B, which began in Glens Falls and followed US4's former routing east to Hudson Falls. From Northumberland to Schuylerville and from Bemis Heights to Waterford, US4 was part of NY32. The segment from Schuylerville to Bemis Heights was designated NY32A. Lastly, the part of US4 south of Northern Drive (then-NY40) in Troy was concurrent to NY40. By 1932, NY40 was rerouted through Troy to follow a more easterly alignment through the city. The realignment moved the northern end of the overlap southward to the junction of US4 and Winter Street in North Greenbush.|$|E

Construction of the GNP and the CCE began in July 1902 and proceeded quickly so that the UERL was able to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the GNP's and 75 per cent of the CCE's tunnels had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, {{which he}} entered {{before he was}} six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his {{occasional}} long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op.35) and all the minor keys (Op.39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by {{a new generation of}} French musicians.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Washington in October 1861, the {{regiment}} spent the following winter in camp at Hall's Hill, near Arlington in Virginia. It {{became part of}} the Army of the Potomac, with which it would be associated for its entire term of service. The regiment saw its first action during the Siege of Yorktown in April 1862. It was involved in the Peninsular Campaign, particularly the Battle of Gaines' Mill during which it suffered its worst casualties (numerically) of the war. Their worst casualties in terms of percentages took place during the Battle of Gettysburg (60 percent). The 22nd Massachusetts was present for <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the major battles in which the Army of the Potomac fought, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg and Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign. The 22nd was especially proficient in skirmish drill and was frequently deployed in that capacity throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Desertion had {{continued}} to be a problem for the 24th Infantry, a de facto segregated unit. Statistics compiled by the Eighth Army found the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 25th Infantry throughout August, compared to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. The regiment had already been criticized for its poor performance at the Battle of Sangju several weeks earlier. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, and found its poor performance was starting to bring other units of the division down as well. Kean considered the regiment a weak link in the chain, and after its poor performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, he suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops used as replacements for other units in the field. <b>Virtually</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment.|$|E
