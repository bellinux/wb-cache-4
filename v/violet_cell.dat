The membrane fraction obtained had a density of 1. 25 g/cm 3, was rich in phospholipase A and lysophospholipase, and contained only 10 % of the total membrane activity of succinate dehydrogenase and d-lactate dehydrogenase. The outer membrane protein profile after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed at least six major proteins. The predominating protein showed a molecular weight of 35, 000. The lipopolysaccharide component was characterized by gas chromatography.

40|$|PURPOSE: Up to now, {{there have}} been no {{established}} predictive markers for response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER 1 /erbB 1) inhibitors alone and in combination with chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. To identify markers that predict response to EGFR-based chemotherapy regimens, we analyzed the response of human colorectal cancer cell lines to the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib (Iressa, AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE), as a single agent and in combination with oxaliplatin and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cell viability was assessed using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide and crystal <b>violet</b> <b>cell</b> viability assays and analyzed by ANOVA. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caspase 3 cleavage. EGFR protein phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: Cell lines displaying high constitutive EGFR phosphorylation (a surrogate marker for EGFR activity) were more sensitive to gefitinib. Furthermore, in cell lines exhibiting low constitutive EGFR phosphorylation, an antagonistic interaction between gefitinib and oxaliplatin was observed, whereas in cell lines with high basal EGFR phosphorylation, the interaction was synergistic. In addition, oxaliplatin treatment increased EGFR phosphorylation in those cell lines in which oxaliplatin and gefitinib were synergistic but down-regulated EGFR phosphorylation in those lines in which oxaliplatin and gefitinib were antagonistic. In contrast to oxaliplatin, 5 -FU treatment increased EGFR phosphorylation in all cell lines and this correlated with synergistic decreases in cell viability when 5 -FU was combined with gefitinib. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that phospho-EGFR levels determine the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to gefitinib alone and that chemotherapy-mediated changes in phospho-EGFR levels determine the nature of interaction between gefitinib and chemotherapy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{structure}} of the implant {{plays a crucial role}} in the success of implantation. Therefore, the surfaces of dental implants have been under continuous development over the past few decades. In zirconia implants, generating surface roughness by sandblasting may induce surface damage and phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic phase. To avoid these negative effects, sandblasting prior to sintering is one strategy to generate a rough zirconia surface. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of surface roughening zirconia base material, TZP, by sandblasting prior to sintering process under defined parameters. The new {{surface structure}} was then examined in vitro on the basis of cellular adhesion (after 60 min with crystal <b>violet),</b> <b>cell</b> coverage (after 72 h with crystal violet), proliferation and metabolic activity (24 - 48 h with BrdU assay and after 48 h with XTT assay, respectively) of human SAOS- 2 osteoblasts. Using a Perthometer, the roughened zirconia variants exhibited negligible changes in surface roughness before and after sintering, and they maintained their original mechanical properties by avoiding post-treatment of the surfaces. Initial cell adhesion was positively enhanced by a roughened surface compared to a machined surface. The metabolic activity and proliferation in the log-growth phase were not affected. Surface coverage by cells was slightly decreased on rough zirconia surfaces compared to the machined reference; however, surface coverage on all zirconia surfaces was comparable to that of titanium, indicating good biocompatibility. Therefore, the method used to roughen the zirconia surface in this experiment is suitable for zirconia implants, which is an alternative implant material. Sandblasting before sintering zirconia implants is an appropriate method to create surface roughness without compromising the mechanical strength...|$|E

Small amounts of malachite green and its reduced, decolorized product were detected in the lipid fraction of M. avium strain A 5 cells grown in the presence of malachite green, suggesting that a minor component of resistance could be due to sequestering the dyes in the extensive mycobacterial cell surface lipid. The membrane fraction of M. avium strain A 5 had at least a fivefold-higher specific decolorization rate than did the crude extract, suggesting that the decolorization activity is membrane associated. The malachite green-decolorizing activity of the membrane fraction of M. avium strain A 5 was abolished by either boiling or proteinase exposure, suggesting that the decolorizing activity was due to a protein.

In this study, we characterized a panel of human EGFR wild-type and mutant NSCLC cells for their sensitivity to gefitinib alone and in combination with cisplatin or Taxol. Cell viability was assessed using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide and crystal <b>violet</b> <b>cell</b> viability assays. Cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry. EGFR expression was measured by flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. EGFR/Her 2 /Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (Erk 1 / 2) phosphorylation were measured by Western blotting. Two of nine EGFR wild type and one of two EGFR mutant NSCLC cells were sensitive to gefitinib, and this was associated with a decrease in phospho (p) -Akt and pErk 1 / 2 following gefitinib exposure. There was no correlation between constitutive EGFR expression or activity and sensitivity to gefitinib nor was there a correlation between Her 2 /Akt and Erk 1 / 2 activity and gefitinib sensitivity. However, in cells displaying a synergistic interaction between gefitinib and chemotherapy (cisplatin or Taxol), a dose-dependent increase in pEGFR was observed following chemotherapy exposure. In contrast, in cells where no change or a decrease in pEGFR following drug treatment was observed, we found an antagonistic or (at best) an additive interaction between the two compounds. Furthermore, the nature of this interaction was not dependent on the presence of a mutant EGFR. These novel findings suggest that modulation of EGFR activity following drug treatment determines response to gefitinib in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC cells. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The neuroinflammatory process plays {{a central}} role in the {{initiation}} and progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and involves the activation of brain microglial cells. During the neuroinflammatory process, microglial cells release proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). In the present study, extracts from 66 different desert plants were tested for their effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced production of NO by primary microglial cells. The extract of Achillea fragrantissima (Af), which is a desert plant that has been used for many years in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases, was the most efficient extract, and was further studied for additional anti-neuroinflammatory effects in these cells. Methods In the present study, the ethanolic extract prepared from Af was tested for its anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated primary cultures of brain microglial cells. The levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) secreted by the cells were determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. NO levels secreted by the activate cells were measured using Griess reagent, ROS levels were measured by 2 ' 7 '-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), MMP- 9 activity was measured using gel zymography, and the protein levels of the proinflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured by Western blot analysis. Cell viability was assessed using Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the media conditioned by the cells or by the crystal <b>violet</b> <b>cell</b> staining. Results We have found that out of the 66 desert plants tested, the extract of Af was the most efficient extract and inhibited ~ 70 % of the NO produced by the LPS-activated microglial cells, without affecting cell viability. In addition, this extract inhibited the LPS - elicited expression of the proinflammatory mediators IL- 1 β, TNFα, MMP- 9, COX- 2 and iNOS in these cells. Conclusions Thus, phytochemicals present in the Af extract could be beneficial in preventing/treating neurodegenerative diseases in which neuroinflammation is part of the pathophysiology. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: A better {{understanding}} of the underlying mechanisms of DNA repair after low-and high-LET radiations represents a research priority aimed at improving the outcome of clinical radiotherapy. To date however, our knowledge regarding the importance of DNA DSB repair proteins and mechanisms in the response of human cells to high-LET radiation, is far from being complete. Methods: We investigated the radiosensitizing effect after interfering with the DNA repair capacity in a human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF 10 A) by lentiviral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) of the Ku 70 protein, a key-element of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Following irradiation of control and Ku-deficient cell lines with either 6 MV X-rays or p(66) +Be(40) neutrons, cellular radiosensitivity testing was performed using a crystal <b>violet</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation assay. Chromosomal radiosensitivity was evaluated using the micronucleus (MN) assay. Results: RNAi of Ku 70 caused downregulation of both the Ku 70 and the Ku 80 proteins. This downregulation sensitized cells to both X-rays and neutrons. Comparable dose modifying factors (DMFs) for X-rays and neutrons of 1. 62 and 1. 52 respectively were obtained with the cell proliferation assay, which points to the similar involvement of the Ku heterodimer in the cellular response to both types of radiation beams. After using the MN assay to evaluate chromosomal radiosensitivity, the obtained DMFs for X-ray doses of 2 and 4 Gy were 2. 95 and 2. 66 respectively. After neutron irradiation, the DMFs for doses of 1 and 2 Gy were 3. 36 and 2. 82 respectively. The fact that DMFs are in the same range for X-rays and neutrons confirms a similar importance of the NHEJ pathway and the Ku heterodimer for repairing DNA damage induced by both X-rays and p(66) +Be(40) neutrons. Conclusions: Interfering with the NHEJ pathway enhanced the radiosensitivity of human MCF 10 A cells to low-LET Xrays and high-LET neutrons, pointing to the importance of the Ku heterodimer for repairing damage induced by both types of radiation. Further research using other high-LET radiation sources is however needed to unravel the involvement of DNA double strand break repair pathways and proteins in the cellular response of human cells to high-LET radiation...|$|E

In contrast, C 60 (OH) n caused delayed, ROS-independent cell death with characteristics of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation and loss of cell membrane asymmetry {{in the absence of}} increased permeability. Accordingly, antioxidant N-acetylcysteine protected the cell lines from nano-C 60, but not C 60 (OH) n toxicity, while pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk blocked C 60 (OH) ninduce...|$|R
40|$|The {{abdominal}} {{nerve cord}} of Periplaneta americana was studied utilizing light and electron microscopes. In the nerve cells, delicate granules, {{similar to those}} probably responsible for cytoplasmic basophilia, are evenly distributed in "dark" cells and clumped in "light" cells. Neuroglial cells are stained metachromatically by cresyl <b>violet.</b> The neuroglial <b>cells</b> have many processes which ramify extensively and are enmeshed to form overlapping layers. These imbricated processes ensheath the nerve cells; the inner layer of the sheath penetrates into the neuron and {{is responsible for the}} appearance of the trophospongium of Holmgren. Nerve fibers are embedded within glial cells and surrounded by extensions of the plasma membrane similar to mesaxons. Depending on their size, two or several nerve fibers may share a single glial cell. Nerve fibers near their terminations on other nerve fibers contain particles and numerous, large mitochondria. The ganglion is ensheathed by a thick feltwork of connective tissue and perilemmal cells. The abdominal connective has a thinner connective tissue sheath which is without perilemmal cells. The nerve fibers and sheaths in the connective become thinner as they pass through ganglia...|$|R
40|$|Estimations of the {{bacterial}} {{content of}} air {{can be more}} easily made now than a decade ago, with colony formation the method of choice for enumeration of airborne bacteria. However, plate counts are subject to error because bacteria exposed to the air may remain viable yet lose the ability to form colonies, i. e., they become viable but nonculturable. If airborne bacteria exhibit this phenomenon, colony formation data will significantly underestimate the bacterial populations in air samples. The objective of {{the study reported here}} was to determine the effect of aerosolization on viability and colony-forming ability of Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella planticola, and Cytophaga allerginae. A collision nebulizer was used to spray bacterial suspensions into an aerosol chamber, after which duplicate samples were collected in all-glass impingers over a 4 -h period. Humidity was maintained at ca. 20 to 25 %, and temperature was maintained at 20 to 22 degrees C for each of two replicate trials per microorganism. Viability was determined by using a modified direct viable count method, employing nalidixic acid or aztreonam and p-iodonitrotetrazolium <b>violet</b> (INT). <b>Cells</b> were stained with acridine orange and observed by epifluorescence microscopy to enumerate total and viable cells. Viable cells were defined as those elongating in the presence of antibiotic and/or reducing INT. CFU were determined by plating on tryptic soy agar and R 2 A agar. It was found that culture techniques did not provide an adequate description of the bacterial burdens of indoor air (i. e., less than 10 % of the aerosolized bacteria were capable of forming visible colonies). It is concluded that total cell count procedures provide a better approximation of the number of bacterial cells in air and that procedures other than plate counting are needed to enumerate bacteria in aerosol samples, especially if the public health quality of indoor air is to be estimated...|$|R
