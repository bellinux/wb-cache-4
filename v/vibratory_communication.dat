In addition, the annular muscle surrounding the ear canal can constrict the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{different aspects}} of the reproductive biology, mating behavior, and <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> of the pentatomid Edessa meditabunda (Fabr.). This species shows lower copulation frequency and reproductive potential with longer sexual maturation period compared to other species of pentatomids. Females with multiple mating show increased fecundity when compared with single-mated females and both increased fecundity and reduced longevity when compared with virgin females. Courtship and mating behavior and vibratory signals are typical and similar to what was observed in other species of pentatomids, except that males started the courtship. These results constitute the first paper on biology, behavior, and <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> among species of the subfamily Edessinae...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> in {{arthropods}} is {{a widespread}} phenomenon. Arthropods living on plants {{have been reported to}} use only dispersive bending waves in the context of prey–predator, competition, social and sexual interactions. Differences in signal structure have also been postulated to work as species recognition mechanisms and speciation agents. Using two identical laser Doppler vibrometers and a wavelet analysis, we quantified the wave propagation modes in rush stems (Juncus effusus) over the whole range of frequencies used by arthropods. A non-dimensionalized analysis shows that mechanical waves propagate not only as dispersive bending waves, but also as non-dispersive waves. Our analysis implies that an arthropod can communicate through non-dispersive bending waves by either producing signals of high frequencies or by choosing large stems, two widely different options tapping into the physiological and the behavioural repertoires, respectively. Non-dispersive waves, unreported so far in insect <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> in plants, present serious advantages over dispersive bending waves in terms of signal integrity and may well be much more widely used than anticipated, in particular for species recognition...|$|E
40|$|Alarm {{signalling}} is {{of paramount}} importance to communication in all social insects. In termites, vibroacoustic and chemical alarm signalling are bound to operate synergistically but have never been studied simultaneously in a single species. Here, we inspected the functional significance of both communication channels in Constrictotermes cyphergaster (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae), confirming the hypothesis that these are not exclusive, but rather complementary processes. In natural situations, the alarm predominantly attracts soldiers, which actively search for the source of a disturbance. Laboratory testing revealed that the frontal gland of soldiers produces a rich mixture of terpenoid compounds including an alarm pheromone. Extensive testing led to identification of the alarm pheromone being composed of abundant monoterpene hydrocarbons (1 S) -α-pinene and myrcene, along with a minor component, (E) -β-ocimene. The vibratory alarm signalling consists of vibratory movements evidenced as bursts; a series of beats produced predominantly by soldiers. Exposing termite groups to various mixtures containing the alarm pheromone (crushed soldier heads, frontal gland extracts, mixture of all monoterpenes, and the alarm pheromone mixture made of standards) resulted in significantly higher activity in the tested groups and also increased intensity of the <b>vibratory</b> alarm <b>communication,</b> with the responses clearly dose-dependent. Lower doses of the pheromone provoked higher numbers of vibratory signals compared to higher doses. Higher doses induced long-term running of all termites without stops necessary to perform vibratory behaviour. Surprisingly, even crushed worker heads led to low (but significant) increases in the alarm responses, suggesting that other unknown compound in the worker's head is perceived and answered by termites. Our results demonstrate the existence of different alarm levels in termites, with lower levels being communicated through vibratory signals, and higher levels causing general alarm or retreat being communicated through the alarm pheromone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{vibratory}} {{signals of}} four species of Asopinae (Pentatomidae) from European Russia are described {{for the first}} time. The signals emitted by adult bugs are classified into three types: male rivalry signals, male calling signals, and solitary low-amplitude signals with still unknown function. The latter are similar in different species and show no species-specific features. Oscillograms and sonograms of vibratory signals are given for all the species studied. DOI: 10. 1134 /S 001387380801003 X <b>Vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> is known {{in a number of}} representatives of the order Heteroptera. The main organs involved in this communication in the studied pentatomid bugs are the tergal tymbals (Gogala, 1985), emitting low-frequency vibratory signals with a fun-damental frequency of 100 to 120 Hz and distinct fre-quency modulation. In addition, vibratory signals can also be produced by stridulation (for example, of tibial and sternal spinules, resulting in signals of a highe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> during {{reproductive}} behaviour is less well described in predatory (Asopinae) than in phytophagous (Pentatominae) stink bugs. Different {{steps in the}} mating behaviour of the predatory stink bug Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas) (Hemiptera: PentatomidaeAsopinae) are {{described in the present}} study, together with vibratory signals emitted on artificial and natural substrate during courtship and copulation. Vibratory signals in Podisus nigrispinus have a decisive role in copulation success and are produced in both sexes by abdominal vibration and tremulation. In P. nigrispinus, one species-specific female and two male songs, which do not show the calling function typically found in phytophagous stink bugs, are produced by abdominal vibration and are emitted during {{reproductive behaviour}}. Additionally, P. nigrispinus produces tremulatory signals that have no species or sex specificity. Tremulatory signals emitted spontaneously on a plant as a sequence of readily repeated pulses are similar to the calling songs of the Pentatominae stink bug. These signals may carry information on the presence of a matehowever, in other behavioural contexts, they may have a different function, such as advertisement or even alarm signals. Plants transmit vibratory signals produced by both mechanisms as a low-pass filter, increasing the amount of low-frequency components. The {{results of the present study}} raise important questions about the interaction between chemical and vibratory signals in the mating behaviour of predatory stink bugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{environment}} can impose strong {{limitations on the}} efficacy of signal transmission. In particular, for <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication,</b> the signaling environment is often extremely heterogeneous at small scales. Nevertheless, natural selection is expected to select for signals well-suited for effective transmission. Here, we test for substrate-dependent signal efficacy in the wolf spider Schizocosa stridulans Stratton 1991. We first explore the transmission characteristics of this important signaling modality by playing recorded substrate-borne signals through three different substrates (leaf litter, pine litter, and red clay) and measuring the propagated signal. We found that the substrate-borne signal of S. stridulans attenuates the least on leaf litter, the substrate upon which the species is naturally found. Next, by assessing mating success with artificially muted and non-muted males across different signaling substrates (leaf litter, pine litter, and sand), we explored the relationship between substrate-borne signaling and signaling substrate for mating success. We found that muted males were unsuccessful in obtaining copulations regardless of substrate, while mating success was dependent on the signaling substrate for non-muted males. For non-muted males, more males copulated on leaf litter than any other substrate. Taken together, these results confirm the importance of substrate- borne signaling in S. stridulans and suggest a match between signal properties and signal efficacy – leaf litter transmits the signal most effectively and males are most successful in obtaining copulations on leaf litter...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Movement is {{the basis}} of animal ecology, and {{understanding}} the causes and consequences of animal movement is a major goal of ecological research. Movement decisions involve an integrated process of sensory input and behavioral output. While environmental cues are important cues, social cues also likely influence movement decisions. For terrestrial insects, social cues in the form of substrate or plant-borne vibrations are extremely important. Here we investigate how <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> or cues influence the movement behavior of two different terrestrial insect species: thornbug treehoppers (Umbonia crassicornis) and periodical cicadas (genus Magicicada). Thornbug males home in on a receptive female by use of duetting, during which a walking male and a stationary female signal in alternation. By describing the search paths of males we were able to identify key components of female responses, as changed by the plant, which influence male searching behavior. In periodical cicadas, millions of nymphs leave their borrows within a few days of each other to start their above ground life as adults. At present soil temperature is the only cue that has been investigated to explain emergence synchrony, but we collected data from the field for two broods (brood I and II) and emergence synchrony was best predicted be soil temperature plus the presence of social cues...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{limit the}} range of insect substrate-borne <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> by their {{architecture}} and mechanical properties that change transmitted signal time, amplitude and frequency characteristics. Stinkbugs gain higher signal-to-noise ratio and increase communication distance by emitting narrowband low frequency vibratory signals that are tuned with transmission properties of plants. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate hitherto overlooked consequences of duetting with mutually overlapped narrowband vibratory signals. The overlapped vibrations of the model stinkbug species Eushistus heros, produced naturally or induced artificially on different plants, have been analysed. They represent female and male strategies to preserve information within a complex masked signal. The brown stinkbugs E. heros communicate with species and gender specific vibratory signals that constitute characteristic duets in the calling, courtship and rivalry phases of mating behaviour. The calling female pulse overlaps the male vibratory response when the latency of the latter is shorter than the duration of the female triggering signal or when the male response does not inhibit the following female pulse. Overlapping of signals induces interference that changes their amplitude pattern to a sequence of regularly repeated pulses in which their duration and the difference between frequencies of overlapped vibrations are related inversely. Interference does not occur in overlapped narrow band female calling pulses and broadband male courtship pulse trains. In a duet with overlapped signals females and males change time parameters and increase the frequency difference between signals by changing the frequency level and frequency modulation pattern of their calls...|$|E
40|$|In Ensifera, {{the lack}} of well-supported {{phylogeny}} and the focus on acoustic communication of the terminal taxa hinders understanding of the evolutionary history of their signalling behaviour and the related sensory structures. For Rhaphidophoridae, the most relic of ensiferans following morphology-based phylogenies, the signalling modes are still unknown. Together with {{a detailed description of}} their mating process, we provide evidence on vibratory signalling for the sympatric European species Troglophilus neglectus and T. cavicola. Despite their temporal shift in reproduction, the species' behaviours differ significantly. Signalling by abdominal vibration constitutes an obligatory part of courtship in T. neglectus, while it is absent in T. cavicola. Whole-body vibration is expressed after copulation in both species. While courtship signalling appears to stimulate females for mating, the function of post-copulation signals remains unclear. Mating and signalling of both species were found to take place in most cases on bark, and less frequently on other available substrates, like moss and rock. The signals' frequency spectra were substrate dependent, but with the dominant peak always expressed below 120 Hz. On rock, the intensity of T. neglectus courtship signals was below the species' physiological detection range, presumably constraining the evolution of such signalling in caves. The species' behavioural divergence appears to reflect their divergent mating habitats, in and outside caves. We propose that short-range tremulation signalling in courtship, such as is expressed by T. neglectus, represents the primitive mode and context of mechanical signalling in Ensifera. The absence of high-frequency components in the signals {{may be related to the}} absence of the crista acoustica homologue (CAH) in the vibratory tibial organ of Rhaphidophoridae. This indirectly supports the hypothesis proposing that the CAH, as an evolutionary precursor of the ear, evolved in Ensifera along the (more) complex <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication,</b> also associated with signals of higher carrier frequency...|$|E
40|$|Spiders {{provide a}} {{fascinating}} {{opportunity for the}} study of animal communication. Web-building spiders build their own signalling environments - the web is the medium that transmits vibrations from prey, predators and potential mates. However, we know little about how information is conveyed through different types of webs, or how spiders distinguish between different types of vibrations. In this thesis, I studied elements of <b>vibratory</b> <b>communication</b> in two species of spiders with contrasting web architecture: the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, which builds a tangle-web, and the hobo spider, Eratigena agrestis, which builds a funnel-web. In chapter 2, I document formerly undescribed life history traits of E. agrestis, and conclude that life history traits are robust to differential predator and competitor densities across two study sites in British Columbia. In chapter 3, I present hitherto lacking quantitative descriptions of courtship behaviours in L. hesperus, revealing that web reduction by males correlates with reduced female aggression, and that it may improve mating success of courting males. In chapter 4, I describe how vibration frequencies are transmitted through the webs of L. hesperus and E. agrestis. I found little difference in propagation efficiency between longitudinal and transverse vibrations and that in both species vibration transmission is more variable within webs than between webs, suggesting that specific frequencies play a minor role in signalling. In chapter 5, I tested whether male courtship produces vibratory signals that differ from prey cues. I analysed vibrations produced by courting males and by two types of prey (flies and crickets) on the webs of L. hesperus and E. agrestis, and also played back male and prey vibrations through the webs of L. hesperus. Male vibrations differ more from those of prey in L. hesperus than in E. agrestis. This finding supports the hypothesis that L. hesperus males, faced with aggressive females, produce vibrations that prevent them from being mistaken for prey. The low-amplitude vibrations caused by abdominal tremulations of L. hesperus males may be linked with lowered female aggression...|$|E
