50|$|Background <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> the respondent's gender, age, {{household}} composition, vocational education, and the education, age {{and occupation}} of R's parents, R's current educational or employment situation, type of employment contract, economic activity and occupational status, region and province of residence, type of municipality.|$|E
50|$|Individual characteristics, {{including}} demographic, psychosocial, {{and structural}} variables, can affect perceptions (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers) of health-related behaviors. Demographic <b>variables</b> <b>include</b> age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education, among others. Psychosocial <b>variables</b> <b>include</b> personality, social class, and peer and reference group pressure, among others. Structural <b>variables</b> <b>include</b> knowledge about a given disease and prior {{contact with the}} disease, among other factors. The health belief model suggests that modifying variables affect health-related behaviors indirectly by affecting perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers.|$|R

For the outpatient analysis, the dependent <b>variable</b> <b>included</b> four categories (no care, informal care, designated facility care, and non-designated facility care), {{while for the}} inpatient analysis, the dependent <b>variable</b> <b>included</b> two categories (designated facility care and non-designated facility care).|$|R

Using the PIP marker, pilots can achieve good accuracy at ranges of up to several kilometers, whether the target is ground-based or airborne. <b>Variables</b> <b>included</b> in the calculation are aircraft velocity, target velocity, target elevation, distance to target, forces on the projectile (drag, gravity), and others.|$|E

Although the QRA method {{is based on}} quantile regression, not least squares, it still suffers from the same problems: the exogenous variables should not be correlated strongly {{and the number of}} <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> in the model has to be relatively small in order for the method to be computationally efficient.|$|E
5000|$|Another set of {{marketing}} mix variables {{were developed by}} Albert Frey (Frey, A. 1961) who classified the marketing variables into two categories: the offering, and process variables. The [...] "offering" [...] consists of the product, service, packaging, brand, and price. The [...] "process" [...] or [...] "method" [...] <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> advertising, promotion, sales promotion, personal selling, publicity, distribution channels, marketing research, strategy formation, and new product development.|$|E

50|$|This type of {{regression}} {{often leads}} to overfitting (i.e. misleadingly suggesting relationships between independent and dependent variables in the data, {{which can lead to}} hasty generalizations). The {{reason for this is that}} the more independent <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> in a regression, the greater the probability that one or more will be found to be statistically significant while in fact having no causal effect on the dependent variable - that is, the more likely the results are to be afflicted with Type I error.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, many {{different}} disk formats were used, {{depending on the}} hardware platform. <b>Variables</b> <b>included</b> the size of media (nominal 8-inch, -inch, -inch and others), encoding of data on the media (FM, MFM, M²FM, GCR), the number of disk tracks, one or two sides, the number of sectors in each track, and hard- or soft-sectoring. Even media that was physically interchangeable between two systems {{might not have been}} usable owing to particulars of the arrangement of data on the disk.|$|E
50|$|Interactions among <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> {{consistency}} effects, such as receiving Evaluative {{credit for}} performing a bad behavior toward a bad object person, and congruency effects, such as receiving evaluative credit for nice behaviors toward weak objects or bad behaviors toward powerful objects. Third-order interactions included a balance effect in which actors received {{a boost in}} evaluation if two or none of the elements in the action were negative, otherwise a decrement. Across all nine prediction equations, {{more than half of}} the 64 possible predictors (first-order variables plus second- Dand third-order interactions) contributed to outcomes.|$|E

External <b>variables</b> <b>include</b> window displays such as posters and signage, or product exposure {{that can be seen}} by the consumer from outside of the store. Internal <b>variables</b> <b>include</b> flooring, decoration and design. These attributes of a retail environment can either encourage or discourage a consumer from approaching the store.|$|R

This {{study consisted of}} sixty-sixty male college students who were asked to record a counter-attitudinal statement concerning a serious issue. <b>Variables</b> <b>included</b> multiple levels of commitment. These levels included making an anonymous audio recording, a non-anonymous video recording, and a non-anonymous video recording with no chance to withdraw their statement. Half {{of the participants were}} asked to make the recording, while the other half was asked to make the counter statement.|$|E
5000|$|Logistic {{regression}} {{approaches to}} DIF detection involve running a separate analysis for each item. The independent <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> {{in the analysis}} are group membership, an ability matching variable typically a total score, and an interaction term between the two. The dependent variable of interest is the probability or likelihood of getting a correct response or endorsing an item. Because the outcome of interest is {{expressed in terms of}} probabilities, maximum likelihood estimation is the appropriate procedure. This set of variables can then be expressed by the following regression equation: ...|$|E
50|$|John Ogbu’s {{primary goal}} in his {{research}} was to explain “academic performance of racial and ethnic minorities with reference to broader societal structures and historical processes ” John Ogbu used case studies, {{the most famous of}} which examined the affluent neighborhood of Shaker Heights, Ohio, to research variables that represented oppositional culture. These <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> several explanations of academic disengagement based on African Americans’ self-perception of their work load, their own and white people’s academic efforts, and their own explanations for their disengagement. From this case study and other research, Ogbu formulated his theory of oppositional culture.|$|E

50|$|A draw of γ {{from its}} prior {{distribution}} {{is a list}} of the <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> in the regression. Conditional on this set of selected variables, we take a draw from the prior distribution of the regression coefficients (if γi = 1 then βi ≠ 0 and if γi = 0 then βi = 0). βγ denotes the subset of β for which γi = 1. In the next step, we calculate a posterior probability distribution for both inclusion and coefficients by applying a standard statistical procedure. All steps of the described algorithm are repeated thousands of times using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. As a result, we obtain a posterior distribution of γ (variable inclusion in the model), β (regression coefficient values) and the corresponding prediction of y.|$|E
5000|$|The contact {{hypothesis}} {{has proven}} to be highly effective in alleviating prejudice directed toward homosexuals. Applying the contact hypothesis to heterosexuals and homosexuals, Herek (1987) found that college students who had pleasant interactions with a homosexual tend to generalize from that experience and accept homosexuals as a group. Herek and Glunt's (1993) national study of interpersonal contact and heterosexuals' attitudes toward gay men found that increased contact [...] "predicted attitudes toward gay men better than did any other demographic or social psychological variable" [...] (p. 239); such <b>variables</b> <b>included</b> gender, race, age, education, geographic residence, marital status, number of children, religion and political ideology. Herek and Capitanio (1996) found that contact experiences with two or three homosexuals are associated with more favorable attitudes than are contact experiences with only one individual.|$|E

The results indicate {{that there were no}} meaningful relationship between default probability and three independent <b>variables</b> <b>including</b> capital adequacy, asset quality and sensitivity of market risk.
