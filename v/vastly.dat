5|$|Constrain {{worldwide}} {{nuclear proliferation}} by <b>vastly</b> limiting a country's {{ability to make}} nuclear advancements that only testing can ensure.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>vastly</b> outnumbered Confederates had inflicted {{casualties}} and slowed the Union advance on Saltville, they were incapable of halting it. Finding their own path to Saltville's defenses blocked, Breckinridge {{and his men}} retreated further south, while a Union company advanced. Saltville fell to a night attack on December 2021 and the salt works were destroyed by the Union forces.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its design}} focus on player choice, Deus Ex has been {{compared}} with System Shock, a game that inspired its design. Together, these factors give the game a great degree of replayability, as the player will have <b>vastly</b> different experiences, depending on which methods he or she uses to accomplish objectives.|$|E
5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is <b>vastly</b> improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E
5|$|In case of {{economic}} shocks, policy makers typically {{try to improve}} competitiveness by depreciating the currency, {{as in the case}} of Iceland, which suffered the largest financial crisis in 2008–2011 in economic history but has since <b>vastly</b> improved its position. Eurozone countries cannot devalue their currency.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{experimental}} precision {{combined with}} <b>vastly</b> improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields. In 1936 Alexander Oparin (1894–1980) demonstrated a possible {{mechanism for the}} synthesis of organic matter from inorganic molecules. In the 1960s {{it was determined that}} the Earth's earliest life-forms treated as plants, the cyanobacteria known as stromatolites, dated back some 3.5 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the Park Road {{entrance}} bridge are two fenced-in Dog Parks where friendly dogs (and their owners) can cavort with each other off-leash. Brand new, <b>vastly</b> expanded parks for small and large dogs were opened in Apr 2011.|$|E
5|$|On January 29, 1931, Pathé, {{with its}} {{contract}} players, well-regarded newsreel operation, and Culver Studios {{along with its}} associated backlot, located more or less {{next door to the}} <b>vastly</b> larger MGM lot was merged into RKO proper as Kennedy sold off the last of his stock in the company he had been instrumental in creating.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1942, the (Japanese) Imperial Navy had {{the better}} ships {{and the better}} tactics. After November15, 1942, its leaders lost heart and it lacked the {{strategic}} depth to face the burgeoning U.S. Navy and its <b>vastly</b> improving weapons and tactics. The Japanese never got better while, after November 1942, the U.S. Navy never stopped getting better.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{implementation}} of various legislation {{over the following}} decade allowed many counties to <b>vastly</b> improve roads under their jurisdiction. By the time the Department of Highways (DHO) assumed the road from Highway3 in Tillsonburg to Highway2 in Ingersoll on March12, 1930 as King's Highway19, it was once again a gravel road.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{disaster for}} the Romanian expeditionary force on the Eastern Front came at Stalingrad, where, during the Soviet counter-offensive of November 1942, the thinly spread forces of the Third Army (deployed north of Stalingrad) and of the Fourth Army (deployed south of Stalingrad) were attacked by <b>vastly</b> superior Soviet forces and suffered combined losses of some 158,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|This dictum, which {{established}} that corporations enjoyed personhood under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts. It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, {{though it was}} challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth Amendment cases involving corporations <b>vastly</b> outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.|$|E
5|$|Using human {{manufacturing}} processes, wheeled {{systems of}} varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, {{and issues of}} power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the <b>vastly</b> different processes of embryonic development are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even <b>vastly</b> different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|A <b>vastly</b> {{different}} application {{can be seen}} in {{the study}} of cognitive flexibility and video games. Examining the trait under the guise of “,” Dutch researchers observed that players of first-person shooter games (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield) exhibited greater “mental flexibility” on a series of measures than did non-gamers. The researchers posit that, while video game play may be controversial due to frequently graphic content, harnessing the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, who face cognitive decline) and is therefore socially relevant.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed and Germany's lighter {{tanks were}} {{replaced}} by the Panzer III, Panzer IV and heavier tanks, such as the Panther, the T-26 was gradually replaced through attrition by the <b>vastly</b> superior T-34. The remaining T-26s participated in battles with the Germans and their allies during the Battle of Moscow from 1941–42, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus from 1942–1943. Some tank units of the Leningrad Front used their T-26 tanks until 1944.|$|E
5|$|At the airport, Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests. Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be together because they have <b>vastly</b> different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, astronomers {{believed}} Sakurai's Object to be a slow nova. Later spectroscopic analysis suggested that the star was not a nova, but had instead undergone a very late thermal pulse similar to that of V605 Aquilae, causing it to <b>vastly</b> expand. V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and models predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next few decades, will follow a similar life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8/275, Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, supported by Johnston and Ernie Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often went in <b>vastly</b> different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29 before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning.|$|E
5|$|By 1953 Quatermass is {{the head}} of the British Experimental Rocket Group, which has a {{programme}} to launch a manned rocket into space from a base in Tarooma, Australia. Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the rocket <b>vastly</b> overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in London. Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has been taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 24 April, B Company had fought off seven assaults before {{they were able to}} rejoin the {{remainder}} of their battalion on what became known as Gloster Hill. By this time the battalion was <b>vastly</b> outnumbered, low on ammunition and cut off from United Nations lines. Large himself was shot in the left shoulder and, along with most of the remaining Glosters, was forced to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Draper {{shot the}} film {{in the style of}} a mockumentary—a parody in {{documentary}} format—that depicts the daily activities of the characters. Nat composed and performed the music, yet one song had been written by Alex. Principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in New York City, and the interior scenes were <b>vastly</b> filmed in the family's Manhattan apartment. Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing <b>vastly</b> different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|Gaara {{was created}} a foil to the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, {{as the two}} were born through similar circumstances, but develop <b>vastly</b> {{different}} personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs and name underwent {{major changes in the}} making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to give Gaara a design that is easier to draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira Ishida while Liam O'Brien replaces him in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} take Caen through {{successive}} flanking manoeuvres, Montgomery decided the next attack would be a frontal assault. Although Caen's strategic importance had <b>vastly</b> diminished since D-Day, he sought control of Bourguébus and the commanding high ground to the south. On 5 July the orders for Operation Charnwood were issued; {{it was to be}} launched at 04:20, {{an hour and a half}} before dawn on 8 July.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Azaña and Indalecio Prieto {{started to}} unify the left and to combat its extreme elements. They staged large, popular rallies of {{what would become the}} Popular Front. Lerroux's Radical {{government}} collapsed after two major scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, instead calling elections. The elections of 1936 were won by the Popular Front, with <b>vastly</b> smaller resources than the political right who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. The right began to plan how to best overthrow the Republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy <b>vastly</b> outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
5|$|In {{gray iron}} the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and also renders the {{material}} brittle {{due to the}} sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material. A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and <b>vastly</b> increasing the toughness and strength of the material.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland <b>vastly</b> diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger {{than at any other time}} in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Titan used Jaguar's 10 PB of Lustre storage with a {{transfer}} speed of 240 GB/s, but in April 2013, the storage was upgraded to 40 PB with {{a transfer}} rate of 1.4 TB/s. GPUs {{were selected for}} their <b>vastly</b> higher parallel processing efficiency over CPUs. Although the GPUs have a slower clock speed than the CPUs, each GPU contains 2,688 CUDA cores at 732 MHz, resulting in a faster overall system. Consequently, the CPUs' cores are used to allocate tasks to the GPUs rather than directly processing the data as in conventional supercomputers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the Guest family also served in the First World War. Ivor Guest, Ernest's eldest brother, was a {{lieutenant}} in the Witwatersrand Rifles in the South-West Africa Campaign. After the regiment was disbanded {{at the end of}} the campaign, he was commissioned as a machine gun officer in the Second Cape Corps for service in East Africa; he was killed in action on 6 November 1917 at the Battle of Mahiwa while checking the advance of a <b>vastly</b> superior enemy force. His gun crew had become casualties and he was handling the gun himself when he was killed.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} <b>vastly</b> {{improved the}} understanding of the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice, {{with support}} from E. H. Carr who was then {{assistant}} editor of The Times, promoted the idea of employers deducting income tax from wages and passing it to Government directly rather than waiting for employees to do {{so at the end}} of the financial year. He introduced this idea to Paul Chambers, then on the board of the Inland Revenue. The idea, which became the PAYE system, would be tested in 1940–1941 and introduced permanently in 1944. The system <b>vastly</b> simplified and increased tax collection during the latter stages of World War II, when Britain was in desperate need of funds.|$|E
5|$|Some Ediacaran strata {{with the}} texture {{characteristics}} of microbial mats contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils {{are almost always}} found in beds that contain these microbial mats. Although microbial mats were once widespread, the evolution of grazing organisms in the Cambrian <b>vastly</b> reduced their numbers. These communities are now limited to inhospitable refugia, such as the stromatolites found in Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve in Shark Bay, Western Australia where the salt levels can be twice those of the surrounding sea.|$|E
5|$|The 1896 Democratic {{convention}} {{opened at}} the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896. Much activity took place {{in advance of the}} formal opening as the silver and (<b>vastly</b> outnumbered) gold forces prepared their strategies. Silver forces were supported by the Democratic National Bimetallic Committee, the umbrella group formed in 1895 to support silver Democrats in their insurgency against Cleveland. Gold Democrats looked to the President for leadership, but Cleveland, trusting few in his party, did not involve himself further in the gold efforts, but spent the week of the convention fishing off the New Jersey coast.|$|E
5|$|The Andersons {{sold their}} {{intellectual}} and {{profit participation rights}} to Thunderbirds and their other productions in the 1970s. As a result, they had no developmental control over subsequent adaptations of their works. Thunderbirds was first remade for TV in the early 1980s as Thunderbirds 2086. In this anime re-imagining, set 20 years after the original, the <b>vastly</b> expanded IR is based within an arcology and operates 17 Thunderbird machines. It was inspired by Thunderhawks, an updated story concept by Gerry Anderson and Reg Hill that later served {{as the basis for}} Anderson's Supermacromation series Terrahawks.|$|E
