5000|$|In 1934, Karl Kleist {{characterized}} constructional apraxia as {{a disturbance}} [...] "in formative {{activities such as}} assembling, building and drawing, in which the spatial form of the product proves to be unsuccessful, without there being an apraxia for single movements." [...] In the years following, the definition of constructional apraxia diverged. There were those who {{felt it was a}}n executive processing order and those who felt it was a <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorder.</b> Due to discrepancies in definitions, constructional apraxia became a blanket term to describe any kind of constructional impairment. Modern researchers question whether the term [...] "apraxia" [...] is appropriate to describe this condition.|$|E
40|$|Scientific Background: Primary {{degenerative}} dementia {{can show}} different {{features in the}} early stages and can start with asymmetric or symmetric focal degeneration. Posterior cortical atrophy is a rare progressive dementia syndrome which can be evaluated, using neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging techniques, along with clinical features. Definitive diagnosis is made histopathologically. Objective: To discuss the clinical features of a case with posterior cortical atrophy, characterized by progressive <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorder,</b> and the differential diagnosis, under the light of related literature. Results: Neurocognitive assessment revealed a serious visuospatial and constructional disturbance as well as facial recognition defects, dressing apraxia and agraphia, and a mild memory and verbal fluency impairment. Cranial MRI demonstrated bilateral parieto-occipital atrophy, and the SPECT investigation showed decreased perfusion in the right temporoparieto occipital region compared to the left hemisphere. Routine and other laboratory investigations were normal. Conclusion: The patient was started on memantine with a daily dose of 20 mg, twice a day. After four months, he became temporarily able to drive and park his tractor, but, the symptoms progressed later. (Archives of Neuropsychiatry 2009; 46 : 192 - 6...|$|E
40|$|Williams-Beuren {{syndrome}} (WBS), a neurodevelopmental {{genetic disorder}} whose manifestations include visuospatial impairment, provides a unique model to link genetically determined loss of neural cell populations {{at different levels}} of the nervous system with neural circuits and visual behavior. Given that several of the genes deleted in WBS are also involved in eye development and the differentiation of retinal layers, we examined the retinal phenotype in WBS patients and its functional relation to global motion perception. We discovered a low-level visual phenotype characterized by decreased retinal thickness, abnormal optic disk concavity, and impaired visual responses in WBS patients compared with age-matched controls by using electrophysiology, confocal and coherence in vivo imaging with cellular resolution, and psychophysics. These mechanisms of impairment are related to the magnocellular pathway, which is involved in the detection of temporal changes in the visual scene. Low-level magnocellular performance did not predict high-level deficits in the integration of motion and 3 D information at higher levels, thereby demonstrating independent mechanisms of dysfunction in WBS that will require remediation strategies different from those used in other <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorders.</b> These findings challenge neurodevelopmental theories that explain cortical deficits based on low-level magnocellular impairment, such as regarding dyslexia...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Multimodal {{perception}} {{raises the}} issue of sensory integration. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess whether the visuo-haptic subjective vertical could be predicted from the visual and haptic unimodal performances, according to a Bayesian model, which optimizes the reliability of the multimodal estimate. The limits of the model were assessed by evaluating the impact of aging, cerebral damage and spatial deficits. METHOD: Young and older healthy participants, as well as patients with a right hemisphere lesion, suffering from spatial neglect or not, had to align a rod with the gravitational vertical in the visual, haptic and visuo-haptic modalities. RESULTS: Visuo-haptic subjective vertical was correctly predicted by the model in healthy participants, as well as in patients in spite of different performances. An anticlockwise deviation of the subjective vertical was observed in the neglect group whatever the experimental conditions. By contrast, no deviation was observed in both non-neglect and healthy groups, for the visual and the visuo-haptic modalities. Nevertheless, the haptic subjective vertical was deviated, anticlockwise in the non-neglect patients and older healthy adults, and clockwise in the young healthy adults. Moreover, the variance was the smallest in the bimodal condition. CONCLUSION: The integration of visual and haptic signals appeared to obey a Bayesian model optimizing the reliability of the multimodal estimate. This holds true despite of aging, brain damage or <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorders.</b> Regarding the perception of the vertical, multisensory integration does not seem thus to depend only on right posterior cortical areas...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with right}} or more rarely left parietotemporal lesions after stroke may have {{profound}} <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorders</b> that impair {{activities of daily}} living (ADL) and long-term outcome. Clinical studies indicate improvements with systematic training of perception. Studies of perceptual learning in healthy persons suggest rapid improvements in perceptual learning of spatial line orientation with partial transfer to nontrained line orientations. Objective. The authors investigated a novel feedback-based perceptual training procedure for the rehabilitation of patients after stroke. Methods. In an uncontrolled trial, 13 participants showing profound deficits in line orientation and related visuospatial tasks within 12 to 28 weeks of onset performed repetitive feedback-based, computerized training of visual line orientation over 4 weeks of treatment. Visual line-orientation discrimination and visuospatial and visuoconstructive tasks were assessed before and after training. Results. The authors found (a) rapid improvements in trained but also in nontrained spatial orientation tests in all 13 participants, partially up to a normal level; (b) stability of the obtained improvements at 2 -month follow-up; (c) interocular transfer of training effects to the nontrained eye in 2 participants suggesting a central, postchiasmatic locus for this perceptual improvement; and (d) graded transfer of improvements to related spatial tasks, such as horizontal writing, analog clock reading, and visuoconstructive capacities but no transfer to unrelated measures of visual performance. Conclusions. These results suggest the potential for treatment-induced improvements in visuospatial deficits by feedback-based, perceptual orientation training as a component of rehabilitation after stroke...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis explored the structural and functional organization of visuospatial attention. This was done through advanced voxel-wise lesion symptom mapping methods used to decompose neuroanatomy of <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorders.</b> The first study contrasted the neural substrates of different neglect symptoms, specifically the contributions of common and dissociable grey and white matter changes linked to allocentric and egocentric neglect. Two following studies decomposed the neuroanatomy of frequently co-occurring spatial attention syndromes by examining (1) the lesion patterns associated with visual and tactile extinction vs. those related to visual field defects and neglect, and (2) the lesion pattern linked to simultanagnosia, extracting out lesions associated with unilateral visuospatial deficits. These studies demonstrated that the different patterns of grey matter lesions in individual patients, and the laterality of white matter disconnections, determine {{the degree to which}} visual processing and spatial attention are disrupted and thus the nature of the observed cognitive symptoms. The final study examined the neuroanatomy of subacute relative to chronic neglect and whether persistent neglect symptoms could be predicted based on clinical computed tomography scans acquired at stroke diagnosis. The findings provided evidence that although wide spread lesions are associated with acute symptoms, only some of these are critical for predicting whether neglect will become a chronic disorder. The pro’s and con’s of different approaches to lesion-symptom mapping are discussed, along with the theoretical implications for understanding the nature of human visual attention...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{working memory}} {{problems}} are frequently reported following brain damage within both {{left and right}} hemispheres but with the severity often being grater in individuals with right hemisphere lesions. Clinically, deficits in spatial working memory have also been noted in patients with <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorders</b> such as unilateral neglect. Here, we examined neural substrates of short-term memory for spatial locations based on the Corsi Block tapping task and {{the relationship with the}} visuospatial deficits of neglect and extinction in a group of chronic neuropsychological patients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to distinguish shared and dissociate functional components. The neural substrates of spatial short-term memory deficits and the components identified by PCA were examined using whole brain voxel-based morphometry and tract-wise lesion deficits analyses. We found that bilateral lesions within occipital cortex (middle occipital gyrus) and right posterior parietal cortex, along with disconnection of the right parieto-temporal segment of arcuate fasciculus, were associated with low spatial memory span. A single component revealed by PCA accounted for over half of the variance and was linked to damage to right posterior brain regions (temporo-parietal junction, the inferior parietal lobule and middle temporal gyrus extending into middle occipital gyrus). We also found link to disconnections within several association pathways including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. These results indicate that different visuospatial deficits converge into a single component mapped within posterior parietal areas and fronto-parietal white matter pathways. Furthermore, the data presented here fit with the role of posterior parietal cortex/temporo-parietal junction in maintaining a map of salient locations in space, with Corsi Block performance being impaired when the spatial map is damaged...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuum}} of time, as empirically measured by varia-tions in speed of response, {{has become a}} feature of the clinical evaluation of children. The ability to respond within a certain time frame is {{recognized as one of the}} criteria for competency in mental processing. In children, speed of processing improves with increasing age, as do other devel-opmental functions, among which are intelligence and work-ing memory. 1 – 3 Moreover, Fry and Hale argued that these three processes follow a similar developmental time course and impact differently with age on each other. 4 Thus, if a child has an abnormal developmental course, slowness or deficits in speed of response may be part of the clinical picture. Slowness is a characteristic of the developmental syn-drome attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 5 and its putative substrate is the right hemisphere. 6 – 8 Another disorder thought to have right hemisphere dysfunction is the developmental right hemisphere syndrome. The develop-mental right hemisphere syndrome, which overlaps with non-verbal learning disabilities, is characterized by ADHD, <b>visuospatial</b> <b>disorders,</b> learning disabilities in arithmetic but intact reading and writing skills, mood and interpersonal disorders, impaired paralinguistic communication, and aprosodia. 9 – 12 Slowness has yet to be systematically exam-ined in children with developmental right hemisphere syn-drome, although it was reported as a major reason for clinical referral. 9 The aim of the present study was to systematically examine slowness in children with developmental right hemisphere syndrome in comparison with children with ADHD. Even though both syndromes are presumed to have their neurologic underpinnings within the right hemisphere, it is our clinical impression that the slowness, seen in both groups of children, is not identical but more profound in chil-dren with developmental right hemisphere syndrome...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundBipolar {{disorder}} (BD) {{and temporal}} lobe epilepsy (TLE) overlap in domains including epidemiology, treatment response, shared neurotransmitter involvement and temporal lobe pathology. Comparison of cognitive function in both disorders may indicate temporal lobe mediated processes relevant to BD. This systematic review examines neuropsychological test profiles in euthymic bipolar disorder type I (BD-I) and pre-surgical TLE and compares experimental designs used. MethodsA search of PubMed, PsychINFO, and Scopus using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was conducted. Inclusion criteria were comparison group or pre- to post-surgical patients; reported neuropsychological tests; participants aged 18 – 60 [*]years. Fifty six studies met criteria: 27 BD-I; 29 TLE. ResultsDeficits in BD-I compared to healthy controls (HC) were in executive function, attention span and verbal memory. Deficits in TLE compared to HC were in executive function and memory. In the pre- to post-surgical comparisons, verbal memory in left temporal lobe (LTL) and, less consistently, visuospatial memory in right temporal lobe (RTL) epilepsy declined following surgery. BD-I studies used comprehensive test batteries in well-defined euthymic patients compared to matched HC groups. TLE studies used convenience samples pre- to post-surgery, comparing LTL and RTL subgroups, few included comparisons to HC (5 studies). TLE studies typically examined {{a narrow range}} of known temporal lobe-mediated neuropsychological functions, particularly verbal and <b>visuospatial</b> memory. ConclusionBoth <b>disorders</b> exhibit deficits in executive function and verbal memory suggestive of both frontal and temporal lobe involvement. However, deficits in TLE are measured pre- to post-surgery and not controlled at baseline pre-surgery. Further research involving a head-to-head comparison of the two disorders on {{a broad range of}} neuropsychological tests is needed to clarify {{the nature and extent of}} cognitive deficits and potential overlaps...|$|R
