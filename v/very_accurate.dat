5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be <b>very</b> <b>accurate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, <b>very</b> <b>accurate</b> for their time.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is <b>very</b> <b>accurate.</b> He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E

5|$|Poling took severe {{punishment}} from <b>very</b> <b>accurate</b> bombing. Since Ventnor {{radar station}} had been knocked out already, this attack demonstrated that {{an attack on}} Fighter Command's command, communication and control system was possible. Emergency equipment had been installed on the site {{in case of a}} breakdown, but the information and reading of the radar was significantly less reliable. In fact, Poling was so badly damaged it was out of action for the rest of August. Fortunately, the CH chain had a mobile radar station at the Isle of Wight to fill in for it. Another was due to be set up near Poling anyway, so the chain remained unaffected. The damage done to Kenley and Poling were no more than inconveniences to Park and Dowding. Only one WAAF member, Avis Parsons, was studying the plots at Poling up until the attack. She was awarded the Military Medal for her actions on 5 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|The first Ju 88s {{took off}} at 23:00 and began {{heading toward the}} Dutch coast where they dived to sea level and stayed at {{approximately}} 50 metres while they flew out to sea. Crews were forbidden to engage enemy aircraft over the North Sea {{in order to preserve}} surprise until the last possible moment. The rain and squall assisted crews in judging the location and distance of the water. However, with crews prone to human error, it was decided to use the <b>very</b> <b>accurate</b> FuG 101 radar altimeter and the Ju 88s blind-flying instruments. The strain on the crews was enormous, as a careful vigil was kept on them until the British coast was reached and the pilot began his ascent to the height of the returning bomber stream. As they did so, the Ju 88s released Düppel to obscure the radar of Mosquito fighters. The pilots were then free to begin their attacks.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six hours}} of its {{classification}} as Tropical Low 13U, the system developed a central dense overcast, which is an organized area of convection around the center. At 18:00UTC on February16, the BoM upgraded the low to a Category1 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, naming it Lam. At that time, the BoM anticipated the cyclone would intensify to peak 10 minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) within 72 hours, which proved <b>very</b> <b>accurate.</b> Also at 18:00UTC on February16, the JTWC began classifying the system as Tropical Cyclone 12P. Early on February17, an eye feature began forming within the convection. That day, Lam moved quicker to the west-northwest and slowed its rate of strengthening as it approached the Wessel Islands. Early on February18, the eye became better defined, moving over Cape Wessel. At 06:00UTC that day, the BoM upgraded Lam to a Category3 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10 minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), equivalent to a minimal hurricane.|$|E

5|$|HST uses {{gyroscopes}} {{to detect}} and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. Normally, three gyroscopes are required for operation; observations are still possible with two, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring <b>very</b> <b>accurate</b> pointing are more difficult. There are further contingency plans for observations with just one gyro, but if all gyros fail, continued scientific observations will not be possible. In 2005, {{it was decided to}} switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable. One more gyro failed in 2007. By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyros were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three gyros were still working. Engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid. The new gyro models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen and they should be much more reliable.|$|E
5|$|On March5, 2003, meteorologists {{from the}} University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium issued an {{extended}} range forecast for the typhoon season, noting {{the likelihood of}} near average tropical cyclone activity {{as a result of}} projected neutral sea surface temperatures. The forecast indicated the potential for 26.2tropical storms, compared to the 10– and 30-year average of 27.8 and 26.3storms, respectively. The following month, the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast. A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near-average season in their final August forecast update, which predicted 27tropical storms. The group was <b>very</b> <b>accurate</b> in their forecasts, with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} the Australians sent out patrols and as they probed forward through the dense bamboo it became {{apparent}} to them that the Japanese had established themselves in strength along a ridge line that stretched off to a position called Peak Hill. In response to the Australian patrols, the Japanese raked the jungle with machine gun fire to which the Australians responded by calling in an artillery and mortar bombardment. As the sun began to set, the Japanese launched a quick attack on the lead Australian company, forcing them back. In order to regain the initiative, the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion launched a night attack, which, although supported by <b>very</b> <b>accurate</b> artillery fire from the 2/12th Field Regiment, proved unsuccessful. As {{a result of the}} failed attack, in the morning the Australians found themselves in a position overlooked by the Japanese. Throughout the day, both sides exchanged sniper fire and the Australians had to re-route their supply lines after they came under fire from the high ground. A company from the 2/24th was released from their portage tasks and were brought up to bolster the 2/23rd, taking up a position to the south in close proximity. During the night, however, the Japanese began to encircle the Australian position. In response, the company from the 2/24th moved to link up with the 2/23rd. Just short of the position, their advance was checked when they came under heavy fire; the Australians eventually managed to send out a patrol which outflanked the Japanese positions and linked up with the 2/23rd.|$|E
