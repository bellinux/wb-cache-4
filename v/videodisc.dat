5|$|Alien {{has been}} {{released}} in many home video formats and packages over the years. The first of these was a seventeen-minute Super-8 version for home projectionists. It was also released on both VHS and Betamax for rental, which grossed it an additional $40,300,000 in the United States alone. Several VHS releases were subsequently issued both separately and as boxed sets. LaserDisc and <b>Videodisc</b> versions followed, including deleted scenes and director commentary as bonus features. A VHS box set containing Alien and its sequels Aliens and Alien 3 was released in facehugger-shaped boxes, and included some of the deleted scenes from the Laserdisc editions. When Alien Resurrection premiered in theaters, another set {{of the first three}} films was released including a Making of Alien Resurrection tape. A few months later the set was re-released with the full version of Alien Resurrection taking the place of the making-of video. Alien was released on DVD in 1999, both separately and, as The Alien Legacy, packaged with Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. This set, which was also released in a VHS version, included a commentary track by Ridley Scott. The first three films of the series have also been packaged as the Alien Triple Pack.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and <b>VideoDisc</b> in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The outer package was retitled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra in the Well of Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Raiders (along with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade) was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008.

This proposal requests funding {{to make two}} interactive <b>videodiscs</b> that will teach dispute resolution skills to young adults, creating a new mode of instructor preparation, class presentation, practice, and review in this important field. The first disc will teach five basic skills: initiating a process to stop escalation of a conflict situation and begin a discussion; listening actively and fully; expressing feelings and interests; negotiating issues in complex situations; and brainstorming innovative solutions. These skills are demonstrated and tested with videos of conflicts frequently encountered by young adults. The second disc will focus on applying the basic skills in culture-, race- and gender-based conflicts on campuses. We will need $ 138, 730 to finish research and planning, to make and thoroughly field test and evaluate both <b>videodiscs,</b> and to develop manuals.

25|$|The {{film was}} first {{released}} on VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc in 1981 by Magnetic Video, and on RCA CED <b>videodisc</b> in 1982. The transfer to video {{was not considered}} high quality; in particular, the already-cropped theatrical version was again cropped to a 4:3 aspect ratio for television (see pan and scan). The lack of availability has prompted considerable bootlegging of the film, first on VHS and later on DVD, derived from copies of the early 1980s releases. The early eighties also saw the film released on VHS and Betamax in Germany and the Netherlands, these versions were not the same transfer as the USA release, as they {{were based on the}} native 4:3 aspect ratio from the original 16mm negative, thus presenting the film as less cropped than the US releases.|$|E

A Laserdisc from MCA <b>Videodisc</b> was released the same year. It was re-released on VHS, Laserdisc, and Betamax in 1985 from MCA Home Video, and again in 1990 from MCA/Universal Home Video. It was also released in a 2-Pack VHS box set with Animal House. The film's original length was restored to 148 minutes for the [...] "Collector's Edition" [...] DVD and a Special Edition VHS and Laserdisc release in 1998.
