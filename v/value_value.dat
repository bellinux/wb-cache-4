50|$|In economics, {{particularly}} political economy, {{the distinction}} between paper wealth and real wealth {{is part of a}} larger debate on different notions of value; paper wealth corresponds to exchange <b>value</b> (<b>value</b> that can be realized in exchanging a good for something else) and real wealth corresponds to use <b>value</b> (<b>value</b> that can be realized in using a good oneself). This is a traditional distinction, dating from Aristotle in antiquity to David Ricardo in the classical economics of the 19th century, but the distinction is no longer drawn in mainstream economics, particularly neoclassical economics, and the debate resolved in favor of exchange value - market price is seen as a sufficient notion of value; see Exchange value: Other theories of exchange value for discussion.|$|E

The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to examine the role of {{employer}} branding in talent attraction and talent retention in South Africa. This study seeks to explain and investigate the existing trends in employer branding in a South African context. It focuses mainly on the “best companies to work for” in South Africa and also looks at graduates who are unemployed in South Africa. This study tries to discover the way in which organisations in South African can attract potential talent and retain existing talent using a number of Employer Branding factors. Concerning the people working in the “best companies to work for”, this study looked at demographics such as gender, race, age, employment status and also total number of years people had been working for current employers. And for graduates, this study looked at demographics, such as gender, race, age, employment status and also total number of years being unemployed. The research was done using an online survey designed on Qualtrics, and the link was sent to employees working in the “best companies to work for” and also to graduates who are unemployed, 99 responses were received from permanent employees and 98 from graduates. The main findings of the study is that there are a number of <b>values</b> driving employer branding in general for both groups and these factors are identified in order of importance, for example, the first one is Economic <b>value,</b> second is Diversity <b>value,</b> third is Developmental <b>value,</b> followed by Reputation <b>value,</b> Social <b>Value,</b> CSR <b>value</b> and last, Communication media <b>value.</b> I split the groups into two, meaningthe findings also showed <b>values</b> driving graduates, particularly for Talent attraction and these <b>values</b> are Diversity <b>value,</b> CSR <b>value,</b> Developmental <b>value,</b> Economic <b>value,</b> Reputation <b>value,</b> Communication <b>value</b> and last, Social <b>value.</b> On the other side, the findings showed <b>values</b> driving Talent retention in order of priority like Economic <b>value,</b> Reputation <b>value,</b> Diversity <b>Value,</b> Developmental <b>value,</b> Social <b>value,</b> Communication <b>value</b> and last CSR <b>value...</b>|$|R
