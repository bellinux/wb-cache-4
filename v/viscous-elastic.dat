A {{problem on}} {{propagation}} of waves in deformable shells with flowing liquid is very urgent {{in connection with}} wide use of liquid transportation systems in living organisms and technology. It is necessary to consider shell motion equations for influence of moving liquid in cavity on the dynamics of a shell by solving such kind problems. Nowadays a totality of such problems is a widely developed field of hydrodynamics. However, a number of peculiarities connected with taking into account <b>viscous-elastic</b> properties of the liquid and inhomogeneity of the shell material generates considerable mathematical difficulties connected with integration of boundary value problems with variable coefficients. In the paper we consider wave flow of the liquid enclosed in deformable tube. The used mathematical model is described by the equation of motion of incompressible viscous elastic liquid combined with equation of continuity and dynamics equation for a tube inhomogeneous in length. It is accepted that the tube is cylindric, semiinfinite and rigidly fastened to the environment. At the infinity the tube is homogeneous. As a final result, the problem is reduced to the solution of Volterra type integral equation that is solved by sequential approximations method. Pulsating pressure is given {{at the end of}} the tube to determine the desired hydrodynamic functions.

40|$|We examine {{transient}} axial creeping {{flow in the}} annular {{gap between}} a rigid cylinder and a concentric elastic tube. The gap is initially filled with a thin fluid layer. The study focuses on <b>viscous-elastic</b> time-scales for which the rate of solid deformation is of the same order-of-magnitude as the velocity of the fluid. We employ an elastic shell model and the lubrication approximation to obtain a forced nonlinear diffusion equation governing the <b>viscous-elastic</b> interaction. In {{the case of an}} advancing liquid front into a configuration with a negligible film layer (compared with the radial deformation of the elastic tube), the governing equation degenerates into a forced porous medium equation, for which several closed-form solutions are presented. In the case where the initial film layer is non-negligible, self-similarity is used to devise propagation laws for a pressure driven liquid front. When advancing external forces are applied on the tube, the formation of dipole structures is shown to dominate the initial stages of the induced flow and deformation regimes. These are variants of the dipole solution of the porous medium equation. Finally, since the rate of pressure propagation decreases with the height of the liquid film, we show that isolated moving deformation patterns can be created and superimposed to generate a moving wave-like deformation field.
