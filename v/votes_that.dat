By the next day, {{because of the}} {{irregularities}} and <b>votes</b> <b>that</b> would be thrown out, the projected winner was Baxter, by only 3,000 votes. The General Assembly met on January6 for a special joint session to declare Baxter, who by their count had received the most votes, the legal winner of the election. After a short address he was sworn in by Chief Justice John McClure. He then assumed the duties of Governor of the State of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} {{so early in the}} primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate <b>votes</b> <b>that</b> day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E

According to Snyderman and Rothman, this contrasts greatly with the coverage of these views as represented in the media, where the reader is led to draw the conclusion that [...] "only a few maverick 'experts' {{support the view that}} genetic variation plays a significant role in individual or group difference, while the vast majority of experts believe that such differences are purely the result of environmental factors." ...|$|R

25|$|Aside {{from his}} authoritarian tendencies, Lescot had another flaw: his {{relationship}} with Trujillo. While serving as Haitian ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Lescot fell under the sway of Trujillo's influence and wealth. In fact, it was Trujillo's money that reportedly bought most of the legislative <b>votes</b> <b>that</b> brought Lescot to power. Their clandestine association persisted until 1943, when the two leaders parted ways for unknown reasons. Trujillo later made public all his correspondence with the Haitian leader. The move undermined Lescot's already dubious popular support.|$|E

The percentage of <b>votes</b> <b>that</b> supported Veltroni's second term in office was a record in local elections in Rome.

25|$|Rather than {{voting for}} one {{candidate}} by marking an “x” on their ballots, electors would rank their {{choices for the}} candidates running in their constituency by placing numbers next to {{the names of the}} candidates on the ballot.

If not, the candidate with the least number of votes was dropped and the second choices were allocated among the remaining candidates. This procedure would be repeated until a candidate received a majority of votes.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Mahathir was {{returned}} to office.

The Team B candidate for Deputy President, Musa Hitam, had also been defeated by Ghafar Baba of Team A, while two of the three Vice-Presidents were Team A candidates. The Supreme Council comprised 16 Team A candidates and 9 Team B candidates.|$|E
25|$|He {{dismissed}} Miller's {{claims of}} possible vote fraud as based on speculation, “Miller’s affidavits {{do not provide}} any facts of wrongful conduct at polling stations and not even circumstantial evidence of wrongdoing,” he said. The Miller campaign responded to the ruling by stating that <b>votes</b> <b>that</b> {{did not meet the}} standard established by the state legislature were not valid, and that that equal protection and fundamental fairness required a hand count of all the votes and an investigation of fraud allegations. The judge allowed a brief stay so that Miller could appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|John Anderson won 6.6% of {{the popular}} vote but failed to win any state outright.
