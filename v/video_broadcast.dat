25|$|Mary Bennett and David Percy {{have claimed}} in Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers, that, {{with all the}} known and unknown hazards, NASA would not risk {{broadcasting}} an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television. The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact did incur {{a great deal of}} public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the Apollo 1 fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees. There was in fact no <b>video</b> <b>broadcast</b> during either the landing or takeoff because of technological limitations.|$|E
25|$|Shure {{introduced}} the FP31 mixer in 1983. The FP31 was smaller and lighter than similar {{products of the}} time—small enough to hold {{in the palm of}} the hand and weighing just 2.2 pounds. This positioned it to complement the one-piece Sony Betacam video camera, which had been widely adopted by remote <b>video</b> <b>broadcast</b> crews. The FP31 could operate up to eight hours on two standard 9-volt batteries, and included two separate microphone/line outputs for two-camera video shoots. Its master section featured an adjustable threshold limiter to prevent overload distortion, and there was a separate microphone/line switch with low-cut filter on each channel. By 1984, just a year after its introduction, the FP31 was being used by ABC, CBS, NBC, Turner Broadcasting System, and was later succeeded by the Shure FP33.|$|E

Quickly she developed into a prominent {{member of the group}} and developed a formidable stage presence. Manson was approached by her band's record label with the idea of launching her as a solo artist, and recorded an album with her band under the Angelfish name. After seeing Manson in an Angelfish <b>video</b> <b>broadcast</b> only once on MTV's 120 Minutes, Garbage invited Manson to audition and record vocals on a couple of unfinished songs; she eventually co-wrote and co-produced an entire album with the band. The resulting self-titled debut, Garbage, was a critically acclaimed, worldwide hit, and was followed by four studio albums, including the multiple Grammy Award-nominated Version 2.0, and a greatest hits album. Garbage toured worldwide and sold 12 million records over ten years.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush {{had become}} {{increasingly}} unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent.

Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live <b>video</b> <b>broadcast.</b> He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed {{in an interview that he}} voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office.|$|E

These efforts were widely derided by commentators as a farce and a charade, as they failed to satisfy concerns over the breach of [...] "one country, two systems" [...] and its practical and constitutional implications.|$|E

Karzai said terrorism is rebounding in his country, with militants infiltrating the borders to wage attacks on civilians. He stated, [...] "This does not have its seeds alone in Afghanistan. Military action in the country will, therefore, not deliver the shared goal of eliminating terrorism." [...] He demanded assistance {{from the international community}} to destroy terrorist sanctuaries inside and outside Afghanistan. [...] "You have to look beyond Afghanistan to the sources of terrorism," [...] he told the UN General Assembly, and [...] "destroy terrorist sanctuaries beyond" [...] the country, dismantle the elaborate networks in the region that recruit, indoctrinate, train, finance, arm, and deploy terrorists. These activities are also robbing thousands of Afghan children of their right to education, and prevent health workers from doing their jobs in Afghanistan. In addition, he promised to eliminate opium-poppy cultivation in his country, which is possibly helping fuel the ongoing Taliban insurgency. He has repeatedly demanded that NATO forces take more care to avoid civilian casualties when conducting military operations in residential areas. In a September 2006 <b>video</b> <b>broadcast,</b> Karzai stated that if the money wasted on the Iraq War had been actually spent on rebuilding Afghanistan, his country would [...] "be in heaven in less than one year".|$|E
