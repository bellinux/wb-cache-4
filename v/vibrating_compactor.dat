40|$|In {{the course}} of work a new <b>vibrating</b> <b>compactor</b> with single-direction {{inertial}} forces according to the authors’ innovative license is applied. Examination of possible dependence on substantiation of the new vibrating device parameters is shown. The new single-direction vibrating device for road crushed rock compaction allows decreasing vibration to the machine frame and increasing its working capacity. The new vibrating device’s efficiency to 11, 7 % increases the existing ones...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the problem of}} designing, manufacturing and testing of some protective systems made from composite materials which can simultaneously perform the next requirements: noise absorption for middle and high range frequencies, noise insulation for low frequencies, vibration damping {{in order to avoid}} noise transmission by structure and finally, modularity and adaptability for using to different types of public works equipment, also for other technological equipment {{with a high level of}} noise, vibration and mechanical shocks. Decreasing of sound and vibration global level inside and/or outside the public works equipment’s cabin as well as the reduction the noise pollution or the pollution due to the vibration and mechanical shocks on construction site is an actual matter, especially for the countries –last became members of EU; these countries must harmonize theirs national legislations regarding the environment pollution and the labor protection with the EU Directives. The article {{presents the}} experimental data of four composite structures with noise absorption and insulation features and three case studies of global level noise reduction inside the cabin for a <b>vibrating</b> <b>compactor,</b> a crawler excavator and a frontal loader...|$|E

To expedite the program, engineering expertise from surveying to embankment were brought in from Taiwan as well. More than 150 pieces of equipment were used, including three Wabco 555 self-elevating scrapers, 10 Caterpillar bulldozers, 10 HINO dumping trucks, loaders, graders, water tanks, <b>vibrating</b> <b>compactors</b> and roller compactors, etc.|$|R
