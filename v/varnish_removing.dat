50|$|The {{painting}} measures 122 cm by 183 cm. A discoloured <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed</b> in 2000, but {{the painting}} shows grey stains {{to the lower}} left and upper right corners, perhaps indicating mould in the underlying paint structure.|$|R
2500|$|The {{panels are}} in good {{condition}} and have not suffered significant damage. They were cleaned in 1981 when layers of discoloured and ruined <b>varnishes</b> were <b>removed.</b> Technical examination shows that Rogier {{made a number of}} changes to the final poses.|$|R
50|$|For {{much of its}} existence, the {{painting}} was coated with a dark varnish, which gave the incorrect impression that it depicted a night scene, leading to the name by which it is now commonly known. This <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed</b> only in the 1940s.|$|R
2500|$|After the new {{support was}} added much old <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed,</b> and limited {{retouching}} performed.

30|$|As {{described}} for the UVR imaging, UV fluorescence comes {{just from the}} surface of the paint layer and it isn’t influenced by layers underneath. Though in this case, the varnish does play a major role since it generally exhibits strong fluorescence and could overwhelm the actual fluorescence of the pigments. Consequently, MSI documentation is recommended when the <b>varnish</b> is <b>removed</b> from the artwork. These decision categories are defined for the UV fluorescence: none (meaning no sizeable fluorescence is observed, i.e. RGB[*]<[*] 30), white, blue, red, orange, yellow.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, as {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of pentimenti after conservation and cleaning, the Courtauld Institute changed its opinion on its version of Manet’s Le déjeuner sur l'herbe from that of it being a copy to that of it being a preparatory painting that predates the version in the Louvre. Pentimenti were visible once the old <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed,</b> including alterations to the curve of the back of the female nude and one of the male figure's cap, suggesting that the Courtauld picture is a preparatory work.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} was first thoroughly studied with UV rays and binocular microscope. UV and infrared images were taken, {{as well as}} X-rays. The examination showed {{that most of the}} damage was on the grass, ground and trunk. The old repaints covered broader areas than was necessary to restore the inflicted areas. The <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed</b> with a cotton tampon wetted in a special solution; other additional material was cleaned out using a very sharp scalpel under a microscope.

Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} {{restored}} in 1878 when the <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed</b> {{from the roof}} timbers and the ceiling and walls were painted by T.R. Hibbert of Belper. A screen was erected and the gas lighting extended. The floor of the church was lowered by 5 in and the aisles were paved with encaustic tiles. This work was carried out {{under the supervision of}} the architect Mr. Robinson of Derby. At the same time the organ, which had formerly stood on the north side, was split either side of the chancel. The work was paid for by local industrialist G.H. Strutt whose liberality enabled the church to be converted into a free and open church.|$|R
500|$|Further {{conservation}} {{was undertaken}} between 1983 and 1989 using a stereo microscope. Restorers <b>removed</b> <b>varnish</b> that had turned brown {{as well as}} layers of old fillers– one of which contained the pigment viridian, not available until 1859. They stripped paint additions from the mountain peaks, Leo's robe and {{in the area around}} Francis's tonsure. The removal of overpainting revealed an X that had been scratched into the original paint on the upper right stones at some unknown time. According to Butler, the removal of pigment exposed underlying paint in [...] "amazingly good condition".|$|R
40|$|A central {{problem in}} archaeological {{research}} has been the chronometric dating of petroglyphs (rock engravings). Recent improvements {{in the understanding of}} the chemistry of rock varnish (or patina) that develops on rock surfaces in arid regions has resulted {{in the development of a}} calibrated dating technique, cation-ratio (CR) dating. This is based on calibrating chemical changes in minor and major trace elements in the varnish over time. PIXE is used to determine the bulk chemical constituents of small samples of <b>varnish</b> mechanically <b>removed</b> from within petroglyphs.

50|$|The Taking of Christ {{remained}} in the Dublin Jesuits' possession for about 60 years, until it was spotted and recognised, in the early 1990s, by Sergio Benedetti, Senior Conservator of the National Gallery of Ireland, who had been asked by Father Noel Barber, S.J., to examine a number of paintings in the Leeson Street Jesuit Community (of which Barber was superior) {{for the purposes of}} restoration. As layers of dirt and discoloured <b>varnish</b> were <b>removed,</b> the high technical quality of the painting was revealed, and it was tentatively identified as Caravaggio’s lost painting. Much of the credit for verifying the authenticity of this painting belongs to Francesca Cappelletti and Laura Testa, two graduate students at the University of Rome. During a long period of research, they found the first recorded mention of The Taking of Christ, in an ancient and decaying account book documenting the original commission and payments to Caravaggio, in the archives of the Mattei family, kept in the cellar of a palazzo {{in the small town of}} Recanati.|$|R
40|$|Introduction and objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze theinfiltration of the sealers AH Plus®, Sealapex®, Sealer 26 ® and Endofill®,using {{clearing}} teeth technique. Material and methods: Fifty single-rooted teeth had its crowns removed and canals prepared by the Oregon modified technique. After the chemical-mechanical preparation, the root canals were filled with gutta-percha and four different sealers:group I: AH Plus®; group II: Sealapex®; group III: Sealer 26 ® and group IV: Endofill®. The others two groups of five teeth each served as positive and negative control groups. After filling, teeth remained for 60 days in saline solution 0. 9 %, simulating oral conditions. Following this stage,teeth were covered by three layers of nail polish, immersed in nankin ink and stored in a stove under 37 ºC for 48 hours. After this period of time, the samples were washed in current water for 24 hours, the nail <b>varnishes</b> were <b>removed</b> with bistoury blade and the clearing technique was applied to evaluate the results. Results and conclusion: The results showed insignificant differences between the materials tested and so a similar behavior in the apical marginal infiltration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} a 4 % {{titanium}} tetrafluoride (TiF 4) varnish on enamel demineralization was evaluated. Twelve volunteers participated in this double-blind, randomized crossover study. Six enamel specimens were positioned in intraoral appliances throughout four treatment stages: 4 % TiF 4 varnish (experimental varnish), 5 % sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish (Duraphat ®), placebo varnish, and negative control (deionized water). After 24 h, the <b>varnishes</b> were <b>removed</b> and plaques were allowed to accumulate. A 20 % sucrose solution was dripped onto enamel blocks (10 x/day). Enamel alterations were analyzed by surface microhardness (SMH), percentage of surface loss (%SML), cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Student’s paired t-test was used for SMH analysis and repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for %SML and CSMH (∆Z) analyses (p-value= 0. 05). The TiF 4 varnish group had lower %SML than the placebo and control groups (p= 0. 044 and p= 0. 003, respectively), thus showing its capacity to inhibit surface demineralization. TiF 4 and NaF varnishes demonstrated a protective effect against mineral loss on the enamel subsurface. Both were statistically different from the control group when CSMH was analyzed (p= 0. 000). A titanium dioxide film was observed on enamel surfaces of the TiF 4 group SEM images. EDS confirmed the presence of titanium in all TiF 4 samples. The 4 % TiF 4 varnish is a promising compound capable of reacting with enamel to protect it against surface and subsurface demineralization...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (1) to assess the amount of {{fluoride}} (F) released from varnishes containing calcium glycerophosphate (CaGP) and (2) to assess the effect of the experimental varnishes on in vitro demineralization. Six test groups using 5 varnishes: base varnish (no active ingredients); Duraphat® (2. 26 % NaF); Duofluorid® (5. 63 % NaF/CaF 2); experimental varnish 1 (1 % CaGP/ 5. 63 % NaF/CaF 2); experimental varnish 2 (5 % CaGP/ 5. 63 % NaF/CaF 2); and no varnish were set up. In stage 1, 60 acrylic blocks were randomly distributed into 6 groups (n = 10). Then 300 µg of each varnish was applied to each block. The blocks were immersed in deionized water, which was changed after 1, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Fluoride concentration in the water was analyzed using a fluoride electrode. In stage 2, 60 bovine enamel samples were distributed into 6 groups (n = 10), and treated with 300 µg of the respective varnish. After 6 h the <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed</b> and the samples were subjected to a 7 -day in vitro pH cycle (6 h demineralization/ 18 h remineralization per day). The demineralization was measured using surface hardness. The results showed that both experimental varnishes released more fluoride than Duofluorid® and Duraphat® (p < 0. 05), but Duraphat® showed the best preventive effect by decreasing enamel hardness loss (p < 0. 05). Therefore, we conclude that even though (1) the experimental varnishes containing CaGP released greater amounts of F, (2) they did not increase in the preventive effect against enamel demineralization...|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{restoration}} {{work was}} undertaken {{on both the}} exterior and interior. Louvered shutters which were not original were removed due to their poor condition and {{have not yet been}} replaced. The exterior door surrounds on the front and west facades were duplicated to replace rotted woodwork. The circa 1903 front door was replaced. Following the outlines on the paneled reveals of the front entranceway, a transom and solid wood door of original scale were installed. A redundant door on the rear facade of the original section, which had replaced a window at an unknown date, was replaced with a round-headed window without altering the opening. The brick of the upper third of each fireplace chimney was re-pointed. In the interior, layers of paint and <b>varnish</b> were <b>removed</b> from the floor boards. The trim in the center and upper hall, the west parlor and both bedrooms was repainted to match original paint colors. Following outlines on the walls and portions remaining under window sills, missing chair rails in the rooms of the original section were replaced. A partition erected at an unknown date in the west bedroom dividing it into two small rooms was removed as was a similar partition in the first floor east parlor. While replacing rotted floor joists in the kitchen wing, a sagging wall which divided the space into two small kitchen and dining areas was removed and not replaced.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} fluoride (F) varnishes supplemented or not with sodium trimetaphosphate (TMP) on enamel erosive wear followed or not by abrasion in situ. MethodsTen volunteers were selected and randomly divided into four groups, according to the varnishes tested: placebo (no F or TMP), 5 % NaF (positive control), 2. 5 % NaF and 2. 5 % NaF/ 5 % TMP. Enamel blocks (n= 4) were mounted in palatal devices and received an application of each test varnish, following a double-blind, crossover protocol. After 6 h, <b>varnishes</b> were completely <b>removed</b> and the blocks were subjected to erosive challenges by ex vivo immersion in citric acid (5 min, 4 ×/dia, 5 days). Following, half of the blocks were subjected to abrasion by brushing with a placebo dentifrice slurry for 15 s. Enamel wear (μm), surface hardness (SHf) and cross-sectional hardness (ΔKHN) were assessed after each experimental period. Results were analyzed by ANOVA, Student–Newman–Keuls's test and Pearson correlation coefficient (p< 0. 05). ResultsThe fluoride varnish supplemented with TMP promoted significantly lower wear and ΔKHN {{when compared to the}} other groups after erosive challenges, followed or not by abrasion (p< 0. 05). As for (SHf) the fluoride varnish supplemented with TMP promoted similar results to the 5 % NaF product, being significantly higher than the remaining groups after erosive and erosive+abrasive challenges (p< 0. 05).

40|$|As the {{prevalence}} of dental caries decreases, the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} initial mineral loss resulting in white spot lesions have been getting more and more important. Since dental CT provides computed tomography images of a tooth with radiation exposure similar to panoramic radiography, it will become possible in the near future to evaluate the enamel mineral density using CT {{in the same way as}} measurement of the bone mineral density. Such computed tomography images enable dentists to perform longitudinal, three-dimensional, and precise evaluation of the enamel mineral density before a demineralized lesion becomes detectable by any other traditional means. Despite their advantage, there are not enough reports on evalu- ation of the enamel mineral density using CT. This study evaluated the serial changes in mineral density in the earliest stage of enamel demineralization. Eight bovine enamel specimens were coated with nail varnish. On each specimen, 4 square windows measuring 1 mm 2 were created. The specimens were incubated in lactic acid solution at 38 ?C. During incubation, the windows were covered by nail varnish one by one at 30, 60, and 90 minutes, respectively. At 120 minutes, the specimens were removed from the solution. After the nail <b>varnish</b> was <b>removed,</b> X-ray microradiography was performed using SKYSCAN 1172 at settings of 100 kV and 100 µA. The mean Hounsfield unit values (HUV) of enamel in a non-window area and those in the window areas were calculated every 180 µm over a depth of 0 - 900 µm and analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Data were affected by the incubation time and depth from the enamel surface, and there was not interaction between the two factors. Considering the incubation time, HUV of the whole measured enamel (0 - 900 µm) in the non-window group was significantly higher than that of the other incubated groups. Considering the depth, HUV was decreased at 721 - 900 µm compared with that at 0 - 180 µm in the 30 -minute-incubated group, and the decrease spread to 361 - 900 µm in the 60 - and 90 - minutes-incubated groups. HUV was additionally calculated at increments of 18 µm and compared within the 60 -minute-incubated group, and changes in the mineral density at the boundary of the earliest demineralized lesion could be observed. This study demonstrated detailed mineral density changes in the earliest period of demineralization...|$|R

The effort to preserve artifacts is not to alter them but to maintain them as much as possible in the state in which the Smithsonian acquired them. Also, when the aircraft was recently lowered to the floor of the museum's Milestone's gallery, the tires were removed and replaced with 'forklift' style tires. This was done to preserve the Spirit's original tires which, due to age and lessening of vulcanization, are unable to sustain the aircraft's weight without disintegration.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a {{remedial}} conservation {{report of the}} painting Maria og Elisabeth med barna i et landskap, with its English title translated by the author to: Virgin and child with St Elizabeth and infant St John the Baptist, in a landscape from the Asker Museum collection. It combines all of the necessities of a conservation report by describing the paintings condition, and identifying its original and secondary materials prior to its 2013 / 2014 conservation treatment. It also includes information regarding further preservation actions {{that can be done}} to improve its longevity in its current environment. Investigations undertaken on the painting were both non-invasive and invasive. They combined visual investigations, photo-analytical methods of analysis and XRF investigations, together with optical microscopy examinations and SEM-EDX analysis. For the 2013 / 2014 treatment, its structural requirements were far more addressed than its visual integration and cleaning treatment needs, as they were considered far more subjective. It has gone through a delining, including a removal of its previous mounting and its previous stretcher was switched out. A strip-lining has taken its place by giving the painting the support its required along the edges and so it could be properly stretched to a new auxillary support in a traditional manner. Only a selective cleaning took place by <b>removing</b> <b>varnish</b> layers on all of the figures and a large overpainting found in the sky of the motif. Visual reintegration also included an attachment of a paspatout on the paintings lower and upper halves to lessen personal opinion onto such large regions of bare secondary canvas. Preventive measures such as the addition of a backing board and four corks were supplemented in order to aid in the painting s longevity. These were added to the painting in hopes of providing better support during handling and reducing the likelihood of condensation of forming on its backside as it is hung on an outer wall. Ethical considerations and deliberations were implemented with regards to all investigations and when concerned with 2013 / 2014 treatment options. Correspondingly, justification has been stated whenever original samples were extracted. It was treated with regards on being displayed in a historic house, implementing the importance of its last used phase into the 2013 / 2014 treatment while simultaneously accessing the possibility of representing a copy of a lost artwork by Raphael Sanzio. Discussion with the museum was a main concern to ensure that conservation work applied to the paintings was not proceeded upon without the Museums own personal opinions, seeing that they understand Otto Valstad the best. Overall, its 2013 / 2014 treatment was proceeded upon so that it still has the possibility of being further studied with regards to its secondary materials. The investigations and treatment were properly documented and their still remains a substantial amount of secondary material that may or may not have been added by Otto Valstads himself...|$|R
