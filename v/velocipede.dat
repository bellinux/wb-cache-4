5|$|This {{machine was}} on exhibit in the 1960s at Bellm's Cars of Yesterday in Sarasota, Florida. An 1894 Roper <b>velocipede</b> was lent from the R. J. Boudeman family {{collection}} to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's 2001 expansion, Guggenheim Las Vegas, where The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition {{was the only}} show there until the expansion closed in 2003. It was the fourth venue for the motorcycle design show which had first opened at the Guggenheim New York in 1998, where the Michaux-Perreaux <b>velocipede</b> {{had been the first}} machine viewers saw upon entering the rotunda of the museum. Later, the Boudeman Roper <b>velocipede</b> was on view at the 2011 Deeley Motorcycle Exhibition in Vancouver. An 1894 Roper was offered for auction in January 2012, with a claimed high bid of $425,000.|$|E

5|$|The 1867–1869 Roper <b>velocipede,</b> or {{one like}} it, was later {{given to the}} Smithsonian by John H. Bacon, and is {{currently}} in the America on the Move exhibit in the National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C. It is the oldest self-propelled road vehicle in the Smithsonian, and the second oldest in America, after the Dudgeon steamer.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the study of bike {{dynamics}} is nearly as old as the bicycle itself. It includes contributions from famous scientists such as Rankine, Appell, and Whipple. In the early 19th century Karl von Drais, credited with inventing the two-wheeled vehicle variously called the laufmaschine, <b>velocipede,</b> draisine, and dandy horse, showed that a rider could balance his device by steering the front wheel. In 1869, Rankine published an article in The Engineer repeating von Drais's assertion that balance is maintained by steering {{in the direction of a}} lean.|$|E
5|$|The Selfe family {{landed at}} Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One {{of the reasons}} they emigrated to the colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small house that had previously been the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a <b>velocipede</b> in the country.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{bicycles}} recorded, known variously as <b>velocipedes,</b> dandy horses, or hobby horses, {{were constructed}} from wood, starting in 1817.|$|R

25|$|The Michaux-Perreaux steam <b>velocipede</b> was a steam powered <b>velocipede</b> made in France {{sometime}} from 1867 to 1871, {{when a small}} Louis-Guillaume Perreaux commercial {{steam engine}} was attached to a Pierre Michaux manufactured iron framed pedal bicycle. It {{is one of three}} motorcycles claimed to be the first motorcycle, along with the Roper steam <b>velocipede</b> of 1867 or 1868, and the internal combustion engine Daimler Reitwagen of 1885. Perreaux continued development of his steam cycle, and exhibited a tricycle version by 1884. The only Michaux-Perreaux steam <b>velocipede</b> made, on loan from the Musée de l'Île-de-France, Sceaux, was the first machine viewers saw upon entering the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum rotunda in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in New York in 1998.|$|E
25|$|If a two-wheeled {{vehicle with}} steam {{propulsion}} {{is considered a}} motorcycle, then the first motorcycles built {{seem to be the}} French Michaux-Perreaux steam <b>velocipede</b> which patent application was filled in December 1868, constructed around {{the same time as the}} American Roper steam <b>velocipede,</b> built by Sylvester H. Roper Roxbury, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Enrico Bernardi's 1882 one-cylinder {{petrol-engined}} tricycle, the Motrice Pia, {{is considered}} by a few sources as the first gasoline internal combustion motorcycle, {{and in fact the}} first ever internal combustion vehicle. The Motrice Pia is not mentioned in any mainstream sources. While there is some discussion in mainstream sources of the merits of Michaux-Perreaux steam <b>velocipede</b> or Roper steam <b>velocipede</b> versus the Reitwagen, there is no debate that considers the merits of the Motrice Pia.|$|E

5000|$|Buda {{began by}} {{manufacturing}} railroad maintenance of way tools and equipment, switches, switch stands and signal devices. By {{the end of}} the century, Buda was producing a line of hand cars and <b>velocipedes,</b> and eventually moved into the motorcar business also. <b>Velocipedes</b> were equipped with single-cylinder, air-cooled engines and motorcars were equipped with 2-cylinder opposed [...] "pancake" [...] air-cooled engines. The motorcar production was later either sold or licensed to Fairbanks-Morse, which continued production. Truck, tractor, bus, and marine engines continued in production by Buda who eventually was taken over by Allis-Chalmers.|$|R
2500|$|... 2. 1km {{race for}} <b>velocipedes</b> of 1 metre for a silver gilt medal. Winner James Moore in 2min 35sec, speed 23.2km/h. Five contestants. This medal is in Ely museum.|$|R
25|$|Kobayashi has {{discovered}} {{at least five}} <b>vélocipède</b> races in France which predate St Cloud, so the blue plaque on the railings proclaiming Moore as winner of the first <b>vélocipède</b> race organised in France is incorrect {{on more than one}} count. True these races did not get the publicity that the Michaux organisation was able to attract for St-Cloud but it is curious why it should be James Moore's name on the plaque rather than Edward-Charles Bon, winner of the earlier 2.30 race or even Poloni , winner of the Grande Course that day.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} year {{suggested for}} the Michaux-Perreaux steam <b>velocipede</b> is 1867, {{which could be}} either the same year, or earlier than the Roper <b>velocipede,</b> which some authorities also date as early as 1867, while others such as motorcycling historians Charles M. Falco and David Burgess-Wise, and Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr date the Roper later, to 1868, and the AMA Hall of Fame member and author Mick Walker have it as 1869. Walker also dates the Michaux-Perraux at 1869, declaring a tie. Louis-Guillaume Perreaux patented his steam <b>velocipede</b> on December 26, 1869, while Roper did not seek patents on any of his steam vehicles, and Daimler took out a patent for his Reitwagen on 29 August 1885. Classic Bike editor Hugo Wilson says because the Perreaux-Michaux has patents to verify its date, it has a stronger claim on being first than the Roper, even if they both probably appeared in about the same year.|$|E
25|$|The {{family moved}} to Paris when James was four years old. The reason for the move is not known. One account says that Moore's father was French, {{the rest of the}} family of Irish and Scottish background, but there is no confirmation. The family {{eventually}} lived at 2 cité Godot-de-Mauroy. James made friends with the Michaux family of blacksmiths who lived opposite them at numbers 5 and 7. The Michaux family, either Pierre or his son Ernest is credited with being first to add cranks and pedals to a <b>vélocipède.</b> Moore owned a Michaux <b>vélocipède</b> around 1865.|$|E
5000|$|Daniel Rudge (1840 [...] - [...] 26 June 1880) was a British {{engineer}} who built high-end bicycles and <b>velocipedes.</b> Rudge invented the adjustable ball bearing bicycle hub (British Patent No 526) in 1878.|$|R
2500|$|... 1. At 2.30pm, 1km {{race for}} <b>velocipedes</b> {{of less than}} 1m [...] diameter, for a silver medal. Seven amateurs were involved, the winner was Edward-Charles Bon in 2min 40sec at a speed of 22.5km/h.|$|R
5000|$|Enthusiasm {{extended}} to other countries. The New York Times spoke of [...] "quantities of <b>velocipedes</b> flying like shuttles hither and thither". But while British interest had less frenzy {{than in the}} United States, it lasted longer.|$|R
25|$|The Svea <b>Velocipede</b> with {{vertical}} {{pedal arrangement}} and locking hubs {{was introduced in}} 1892 by the Swedish engineers Fredrik Ljungström and Birger Ljungström. It attracted attention at the World Fair and was produced in a few thousand units.|$|E
25|$|The lack of oats to feed horses {{may have}} {{inspired}} the German inventor Karl Drais to research {{new ways of}} horseless transportation, {{which led to the}} invention of the draisine or <b>velocipede.</b> This was the ancestor of the modern bicycle and a step toward mechanized personal transport.|$|E
25|$|It was in 1865 that Moore {{became the}} owner of his first bicycle, having {{purchased}} in that year a heavy wooden <b>velocipede</b> or boneshaker from the famous pioneer cycle-manufacturing firm which had then been founded by Ernest Michaux. He rode the vehicle with the greatest enthusiasm.|$|E
50|$|Johnson made {{at least}} 320 <b>velocipedes</b> {{in the early part}} of 1819. He also opened riding schools in the Strand and Soho. In May 1819 he {{introduced}} a dropped-frame version for ladies to accommodate their long skirts.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the early}} <b>velocipedes</b> there were designs with one, two, three, four, and even five wheels. Some two-wheeled designs had pedals {{mounted on the}} front wheel, while three- and four-wheeled designs {{sometimes}} used treadles and levers to drive the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|L'Industrie Vélocipédique (Bicycle Industry) was a French {{periodical}} {{that was}} published bi-monthly from 1882. It covered cycling (<b>velocipeding)</b> and described itself as The organ of manufacturers, mechanics, depositers, agents, renters, amateurs, etc.It was published from offices at 33 rue Jean Jacques Rousseau, Paris.|$|R
25|$|The {{origins of}} the {{motorized}} bicycle or motorbike {{can be traced back}} to the latter part of the 19th century when experimenters began attaching steam engines to stock tricycles and quadracycles. The first true motorized bicycle is generally considered to be the French Michaux-Perreaux steam <b>velocipede</b> of 1868. The Michaux-Perreaux was followed by the American Roper steam <b>velocipede</b> of 1869, built by Sylvester H. Roper of Roxbury, Massachusetts. Roper demonstrated his machine at fairs and circuses in the eastern United States in 1867, and built a total of 10 examples. These early attempts at propelling a bicycle by means other than the human body were not successful, either practically or commercially. It was not until the 1890s, with the advent of the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine (ICE), that the motorized bicycle could be considered a practical machine.|$|E
25|$|The {{motorcycle}} is a single-track, two-wheeled {{motor vehicle}} powered by an engine. Although the first gasoline/petrol motorcycle powered by an {{internal combustion engine}} was built in 1885 by a German named Gottlieb Daimler, his {{may not have been}} the first motorcycle. Ironically, Daimler's motorcycle used a four-stroke internal combustion engine that wasn't of his own creation, instead having to rely upon an engine built by Nicolaus August Otto which he simply mounted onto the frame of a bicycle. Furthermore, if the definition of a motorcycle is inclusive of a steam engine and not exclusive to an internal combustion engine, then the world's first motorcycle may either have been American; a coal-powered, two-cylinder, steam-driven motorcycle known as the Roper steam <b>velocipede</b> invented by Sylvester Howard Roper in 1867; or perhaps a French one, independently invented by a competing claim by French blacksmith Pierre Michaux and engineer Louis-Guillaume Perreaux, who invented the Michaux-Perreaux steam <b>velocipede</b> in 1868.|$|E
25|$|He had {{attained}} {{a unique position}} as a crack <b>velocipede</b> rider. Indeed one to compare with what the great Arthur Zimmerman became {{a quarter of a}} century later. He raced in France and England, and it is a peculiar fact that he was acclaimed as the 'Flying Frenchie' on your side of the Channel and l'Anglais volant on the other. Between 1868 and 1877, the year of his retirement, he proved almost unbeatable in both countries.|$|E
50|$|In January 1865, {{coach builder}} James Duncan and coach painter James Fraser formed Duncan & Fraser in Adelaide. In 1869 Duncan & Fraser began {{manufacturing}} <b>velocipedes.</b> Having initially operated out of premises at 37 Franklin Street, in January 1870 it moved to 42 Franklin Street.|$|R
60|$|When citybound {{frequent}} connection {{by train}} or tram from their respective intermediate station or terminal. When countrybound <b>velocipedes,</b> a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14 h).|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} {{dispute over the}} invention, in 1865 Lallement emigrated to America, where, with the {{financial}} backing of James Carroll of Ansonia, Connecticut, he recorded the first U.S. patent on a bicycle, in 1866. Meanwhile, by 1865, the Michaux family was manufacturing 400 <b>velocipedes</b> annually; their bicycles were {{on display at the}} first international bicycle exhibition in 1867, and by 1869, the Michaux factory, with a daily production of 200, began selling in the United States. Their wood and iron construction earned these <b>velocipedes</b> the sobriquet Boneshakers. The first boneshaker race was in 1868, in Paris' Parc de Saint Cloud; the winner was James Moore, a friend of the Michaux family. Moore also won the 123 km Paris-Rouen race in 1869, finishing in 10 hours and 40 minutes.|$|R
