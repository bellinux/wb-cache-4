40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) are {{characterized}} by multiple arterio-venous connections draining into a markedly enlarged median draining vein. This ectatic vein is not the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen, but its embryonic precursor, the median prosencephalic <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Markowski. During normal development, the posterior portion of the median prosencephalic vein persists as the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen, while its anterior portion regresses in parallel {{with the formation of}} the internal cerebral veins (ICV). It has been traditionally thought that, in children with a VGAM, the deep venous system does not connect to and, a fortiori, does not drain into the ectatic median prosencephalic vein/vein of Galen. This report describes a case of successfully treated VGAM in which the drainage of an ICV into the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen was only demonstrated by follow-up MR imaging and venography. The potential implications of this finding for the management of VGAMs are discussed. <b>Vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAMs) are in-tracranial vascular lesions typical of the pediatric popula-tion.

5|$|The <b>veins</b> <b>of</b> the brain, {{both the}} {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the <b>veins</b> <b>of</b> the brain and the venous sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition {{does not lead to}} hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: The <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen was located by colour Doppler ultrasound in 102 pregnancies complicated by severe pregnancy-induced hypertension. The blood velocity waveform was recorded by pulsed Doppler within 2 days of delivery and the presence pulsations related to pregnancy outcome, including emergency operative intervention and neonatal distress.

RESULTS: Pulsation {{were present in the}} <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen in 68 cases and in the umbilical vein in 21. Both were significantly related to adverse outcome. Pulsations in the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen were seen in all seven perinatal deaths.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini {{is often}} {{identified}} with the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein {{despite the fact that}} according to the international interdisciplinary anatomical nomenclature they are distinguished from one another. The objective of the research was to improve the results of treatment of patients with lower limb primary chronic venous disease disease studying the variation in anatomy and pathology <b>of</b> the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini and the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein with subsequent development of differential surgical tactics. Materials and methods. 502 patients with primary chronic venous disease on 605 legs were examined and treated. Each patient underwent preoperative ultrasonographic triplex scanning of the lower limb venous system. Results. Varicose dilatation <b>of</b> the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini was observed in 3. 8 % of patients (95 % CI 2. 4 - 5. 6 %), and the pathology of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein was detected in 1. 7 % of patients (95 % CI 0. 8 - 3. 0 %). When the arch of the small saphenous vein was present the following variations in the pathology <b>of</b> the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini were observed: 1) the spread of reflux from the great saphenous vein to the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini; 2) reflux from the terminal valve of the small saphenous vein intensified the antegrade flow of blood within the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini resulting in reflux in the great saphenous vein distal {{to the point where the}} <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini drained into the great saphenous <b>vein.</b> The causes <b>of</b> failure of the valves in the trunk of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein included: 1) reflux from the ostium of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein; 2) perforating vein reflux; 3) reflux from the terminal valve of the small saphenous vein. Conclusions.  The pathology <b>of</b> the <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Giacomini and the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein is not homogeneous; therefore, surgical tactics in every patient has to be hemodynamically justified and differentiated depending on the pathways of pathological reflux spreading. ...|$|R
5|$|All the <b>veins</b> <b>of</b> {{the wing}} {{are subject to}} {{secondary}} forking and to union by cross-veins. In some orders of insects the cross-veins are so numerous that the whole venational pattern becomes a close network of branching veins and cross-veins. Ordinarily, however, there is a definite number of cross-veins having specific locations. The more constant cross-veins are the humeral cross-vein (h) between costa and subcosta, the radial cross-vein (r) between R and the first fork of Rs, the sectorial cross-vein (s) between the two forks of R8, the median cross-vein (m–m) between M2 and M3, and the mediocubital cross-vein (m-cu) between media and cubitus.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The <b>veins</b> <b>of</b> the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as are the three principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are important elements of the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base distal to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an oblique line (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during flexion of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to the distal arm of the third axillary and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. The distal plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the <b>veins</b> <b>of</b> this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAM) and <b>Vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen aneurysmal dilations (VGAD) are {{the most}} {{frequent}} arteriovenous malformations in infants and fetuses. VGAM consist of a tangled mass of dilated vessels supplied by an enlarged artery. The malformation increases greatly in size with age, although the mechanism of the increase is unknown. Dilation of the great cerebral <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen is a secondary result of the force of arterial blood either directly from an artery via an arteriovenous fistula or by way <b>of</b> a tributary <b>vein</b> that receives the blood directly from an artery. There is usually a venous anomaly downstream from the draining vein that, together with the high blood flow into the great cerebral <b>vein</b> <b>of</b> Galen causes its dilation. The right sided cardiac chambers and pulmonary arteries also develop mild to severe dilation.|$|R
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the <b>veins</b> <b>of</b> the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the <b>veins</b> <b>of</b> the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E

The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh.
