Moreover, results showed also a better robustness of the proposed method since good performance can be obtained with the same detection threshold whatever the speed or the measure campaign whereas it needs to be redeﬁned for each case with the classical indicator.

40|$|Synchronous {{generators}} play a {{vital role}} in power systems. One of the major mechanical faults in synchronous generators is related to bearings. The popular vibration analysis method has been utilized to detect bearing faults for years. However, bearing health monitoring based on vibration analysis is expensive. One of the reasons is because vibration analysis requires costly vibration sensors and the extra costs associated with its proper installation and maintenance. This limitation prevents continuous bearing condition monitoring, which gives better performance for rolling element bearing fault detection, compared to the periodic monitoring method that is a typical practice for bearing maintenance in industry. Therefore, a cost effective alternative is necessary. In this study, a sensorless bearing fault detection method for synchronous generators is proposed based on the analysis of electrical signatures, and its bearing fault detection capability is demonstrated. Experiments with staged bearing faults are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection method. First, a generator test bed with an in- situ bearing damage device is designed and built. Next, multiple bearing damage experiments are carried out in two vastly different operating conditions in order to obtain statistically significant results. During each experiment, artificially induced bearing current causes accelerated damage to the front bearing of the generator. This in-situ bearing damage process entirely eliminates the necessity of disassembly and reassembly of the experimental setup that causes armature spectral distortions. The electrical fault indicator is computed based on stator voltage signatures without the knowledge of machine and bearing specific parameters. Experimental results are compared using the electrical indicator and a <b>vibration</b> <b>indicator</b> that is calculated based on measured vibration data. The results indicate that the electrical indicator can be used to analyze health degradation of rolling element bearings in synchronous generators in most instances. Though the <b>vibration</b> <b>indicator</b> enables early bearing fault detection, it is found that the electrical fault indicator is also capable of detecting bearing faults well before catastrophic bearing failure...|$|E

In this work the gear overall stiffness was evaluated statically as function of the gear angular position by means of FE models of the mating wheels and gear structure, taking into account the deformation of the teeth under load and the presence of a tooth crack of different length and at different locations. The so calculated stiffness was then employed to simulate the gear transmission dynamic behaviour in steady conditions with a lumped non-linear model in a Matlab/Simulink environment.

40|$|Continuous {{condition}} {{assessment of}} induction motors {{is very important}} due to its potential to reduce down-time and manpower needed in industry. Rolling element bearing faults result in more than 40 % of all induction motor failures. Vibration analysis has been utilized to detect bearing faults for years. However, vibration sensors and expert vibration interpretation are expensive. This limitation prevents widespread monitoring of continuous bearing conditions in induction motors, which provides better performance compared to periodic monitoring, a typical practice for motor bearing maintenance in industry. A strong motivation exists for finding a costeffective approach {{for the detection of}} bearing faults. Motor terminal signals have attracted much attention. However, not many papers in the literature address this issue as it relates to bearing faults, because of the difficulties in effective detection. In this research, an incipient bearing fault detection method for induction motors is proposed based on the analysis of motor terminal voltages and currents. The basic idea of this method is to detect changes in amplitude modulation between the spatial harmonics caused by bearing faults and the supply fundamental frequency. This amplitude modulation relationship can be isolated using the phase coupling property. An Amplitude Modulation Detector (AMD), developed from higher order spectrum estimation, correctly captures the phase coupling and isolates these modulation relationships. In this research, in-situ bearing damage experiments are conducted so that the accelerated life span of the bearing can be recorded and investigated. Experimental results shown in this dissertation are based on different power supplies, load levels, VSI control schemes, and motor operating conditions. Taking the mechanical <b>vibration</b> <b>indicator</b> as a reference for fault detection, the proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in detecting incipient bearing faults in induction motors. If motors are operating at near steady state conditions, then experimental results show that the bearing fault detection rate of the proposed approach is 100 %, while no false alarms are recorded...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{vibration}} based machine {{condition monitoring}} and consists of two parts: bearing fault diagnosis and gear wear monitoring. In the first part, a signal processing method to diagnose localised bearing faults {{in the presence of}} periodic impulsive noise has been developed and tested on signals measured from two rigs. The method developed for bearing diagnosis aims at selecting suitable frequency bands that exclude those impulsive noises and retain the feature of impulsiveness of bearing fault signals. This is realised by using a parameter considering the energy and energy distribution of envelope signals in the frequency domain, and its efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with the Fast Kurtogram and Protrugram. The second part presents a newly developed <b>vibration</b> <b>indicator</b> for the monitoring of gear wear. Even though gear vibrations are closely related with tooth wear, a vibration based wear monitoring method has not been well established. In this work, an averaged logarithmic ratio (ALR) is calculated from time synchronous averaged gear signals to evaluate the effects of tooth wear on gear transmissions. The indicator ALR, calculated with a fixed reference, {{can be used as a}} wear severity index, while an alternative version of the indicator, mALR, is calculated with a moving reference and can be used to show the evolution of gear transmission features. In addition, these indicators can also be used as a general parameter for gearbox condition monitoring. Based on the proposed vibration indicators, a framework is established to integrate vibration and wear particle analysis for gear condition monitoring. In the framework, the proposed vibration indicators are first used for fault detection and classification. The faults are then categorised into two groups, structure- and wear-related faults, which dictates how the analysis methods are applied and ensures that wear particle analysis is only used when strictly required. The feasibility and efficiency of this framework are demonstrated by application to three laboratory gear tests, with promising results...|$|E
40|$|Grunnvarme som ein kilde til lagring og uttak av varme kan redusere utslepp av CO 2 til atmosfæren betrakteleg og samtidig føre til økonomiske gevinster. Utfordringa ligg i å senke kostnadar til installasjon og drift av grunnvarme-systemer, auke det bærekraftige uttaket av energi frå kvart borhol og utvikle teknologi for å ta i bruk grunnvarme på nye områder. Det er difor utvikla eit forskningsprosjekt ved Mære landbruksskole i Nord-Trøndelag dereit dynamisk system skal utviklast og testast for å benytte seg av solvarme frå eit veksthus om sommaren, energibrønner og eit korttids varmelager. Som ein del av forskningsprosjektet på Mære er det i masteroppgåva fokusert på å undersøke geologiske parametre nødvendig for dimensjonering av brønnparken. I tillegg har innstallering av to ulike typer kollektorslanger i ein testbrønn, ein vanleg og ein turbo kollektor, gjortdet muleg å undersøke ulikheitar mellom desse i samme brønn. Turbo kollektoren er dyrare enn ein {{standard}} kollektor, men riller på innsiden skal gje større varmeoverføring og mindre trykktap. Ein differensial trykkmålar innstallert på termisk responstest hengaren kombinertmed vibrasjonsmålarar festa direkte på kollektoren gjorde det muleg å undersøke trykktapog vibrasjonar for kollektorane ved ulike strømningshastigheiter. Turbulent strømning gjer betre varmeoverføring men krev ein høgare strømningshastigheit og dermed større trykktap,og difor er det interessant å undersøke overgongen mellom laminær og turbulent strømning. Det vart påvist lite grunnvannstrømning i området, men sprekker i og rundt området avbrønnparken tyder på at det kan skape utfordringar ved boring. Utfallet av ein termisk responstest under ein langvaring kuldeperiode viste at det ikkje er gunstig å gjennomføre tester i kuldeperioder utan å kontrollere med temperaturloggarar plassert i brønnen undertesten. Resultatet frå felttesten viste ein termisk konduktivitet på 4. 0 W/(m · K), menslaboratorieforsøk med kjerneprøver tatt i området viste verdier på 3. 0 W/(m · K). Den termiskekonduktiviten var 25 % høgare målt parallelt med foalisjonen enn normalt på, mestsannsynleg på grunn av kvartsårer. Boreholsmotstanden var lik for begge kollektorer, ogkalkulert som 0, 07 (K · m) /W. Simulering viser at ein brønnpark med desse eigenskapaneer stabil over lang tid. I tillegg viser simulering at det ikkje er tilrådeleg økonomisk å kunbruke generiske verdier ved dimensjonering av anlegg, men supplere med laboratorieforsøkeller termisk responstester. Ved Reynolds tal over 10 000 har dei to kollektorane sametrykktap. Derimot viser lågare Reynolds-tal noko overraskande at standard kollektoren harlågare trykktap enn turbo kollektoren, noko som betyr at den har lågare friksjonfaktor ogat pumpa bruker mindre energi. Tala for turbo kollektoren er unormalt høge, og det det erdifor ikkje muleg å konkludere med kva for kollektor som viser dei beste eigenskapane. Vibrasjonsanalysaviser ikkje noko eintydig overgong mellom laminær og turbulent strømning. Det er anbefalt å gjennomføre fleire tester på trykktap i felt med Reynolds tall under 10000 for å verifisere eller avkrefte resultatane som viser at standard kollektoren har lågare trykktap enn turbo kollektoren. Vidare vil det vere av interesse å visualisere strømningar iein gjennomsiktig slange med same eigenskapar som turbo kollektoren. Vibrasjonsmålingarbør gjennomførast på nytt basert på erfaringar frå denne oppgåva. Using {{the ground}} as a heat source or sink may significantly reduce CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere {{while at the same}} time leading to economic gain. However, the technology must be made more competitive by cost reduction, sustainable use and expansion of technology for new applications. Thus, a project at Mære Landbruksskole in Nord-Trøndelag, Norway,has been initiated to develop and test a dynamic system for using heat from the sun through a greenhouse during summer, energy wells and short-term storage of heat. As a part of the research-project at Mære, this master’s thesis focuses on investigating the geological parameters necessary to design the borehole thermal energy storage (BTES). The installation of two different borehole heat exchangers in a test-well, a standard and a turbo collector, made it possible to examine the differences between these in the same well. The turbo collector is more expensive than the standard collector, but micro fins on the inside gives a better heat transfer and lower pressure drop. A differential pressure transmitter installed on the test equipment in combination with a <b>vibration</b> <b>indicator</b> set directly on the collector, allowed an investigation of the pressure drop and vibrations for the collectors at different flow velocities. Turbulent flow gives a higher heat transfer but requires a higher flow velocity and thus a higher pressure drop. It is therefore of great interest to investigate the transition between laminar and turbulent flow. The presence of groundwater flow was not found to be significant, but fractures in and around the field site might create challenges in drilling operations. The duration of a thermal response test in a cold period showed that it is not favorable to carry out field tests in cold periods without controlling the measurements by placing temperature loggers in the well during the test. Results from the field test revealed a thermal conductivity of 4. 0 W/(m · K), while laboratory tests using core samples showed values of 3. 0 W/(m · K). Thethermal conductivity was 25 % higher for measurements parallel to the foliation comparedwith normal oriented, most likely because of quartz ores. The borehole thermal resistancewas similar for both collectors, and calculated as 0. 07 (K · m) /W. Simulations show that a BTES with these properties is stable over time. Simulations also show that it is notadvisable for economic reasons to only use generic value when dimensioning a system of thissize, but necessary to supply with laboratory tests or thermal response tests. At Reynoldsnumbers above 10 000, both collectors have the same pressure drop. Quite surprisingly,lower Reynolds numbers show that the standard collector have a lower pressure drop thanthat of the turbo collector, thus having a lower friction factor and less need for energy from the pump. The values for the turbo collector are abnormally high, and no conclusion as to which collector is a better choice can be reached. The vibration analysis does not portray a definite transition between laminar and turbulent flow. Further experiments regarding pressure drop should be performed with Reynolds numberless than 10 000 to verify or undermine the results which show a lower pressure drop for the standard collector than the turbo collector. A visualization of flow through a transparent pipe with similar features as the turbo collector would be of great interest. It is also recommended to perform new vibration measurements with the experiments from this thesis in mind. </p...|$|E

In yhis study, vibration was measured about 900 minutes on 9 trains {{in one of the}} active lines of tehran metro with the aim of comparing the mentioned standards in evaluating whole body vibation.. Material and Method: In this research, in addition to evaluation of different kinds of <b>vibration</b> <b>indicators,</b> the differences of ISO 26331 - 1 and BS 6841 Standards have also been investigated. The amounts of r. m. s., vibration dose and daily vibration dose were measured in x, y and z axes for drivers seat and x axis for drivers back rest separately according to the instruction of the two standards.. Result: The mean calculated values of r. m. s and vibration dose on a basis of 135 6841 standard were lower than those values calculated according to ISO 2631 standard.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the fault}} {{diagnosis}} of a machine, frequencies of its <b>vibration</b> are important <b>indicators</b> to show conditions of the machine. There are two main categories of methods to estimate frequency. One {{is based on the}} fast Fourier transform, and the other is on the signal subspace decomposition. Using FFT directly to estimate frequency may introduce larger estimation error, several approaches are proposed to correct or decrease the error, which comprise phase difference, energy centrobaric, interpolation and search method. The signal subspace decomposition method (SSDM) consists of Pisarenko harmonic decomposition, multiple signal classification. In order to assess the performance of these methods, the Cramer-Rao bound is used to compare with the error variance of difference frequency estimation methods, and simulations are based on Monte Carlo experiments for various record sizes and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR’s). The results show that there is a turning point about 25 dB for FFT based methods, above which FFT based methods are less sensitive to the noise, and SSDM achieves higher precision estimation at higher SNR and for the short time series, but produces poor accuracy at lower SNR’s...|$|R

40|$|Recently, a new {{indicator}} of vestibular otolithic function has been reported: it {{is a series}} of negative-positive myogenic potentials recorded by surface electrodes on the skin beneath the eyes in response to bone-conducted vibration (BCV) delivered to the forehead at the hairline in the midline (Fz). The potential is called the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) and the first component of this (n 10) is a small (~ 8 μV), short latency (~ 10 ms), negative potential. In healthy subjects, who are looking up, the n 10 responses to Fz bone-conducted vibration are symmetrical beneath the two eyes. In the present investigation, in 17 patients with unilateral surgical vestibular loss, marked asymmetries were observed between the n 10 beneath the two eyes: n 10 is small or absent beneath the eye on the side opposite the operated ear, confirming previous evidence that n 10 is a crossed vestibulo-ocular response unlike p 13 of bone-conducted vibration cervical VEMPs (cVEMPs) is a ipsilateral vestibular response and also it is absent in this type of subjects.

40|$|Most {{machinery}} failures {{are attributed}} to wear of components. Experimental investigation of wear is highly demanding, especially for internal combustion (IC) engines, due to the complex reciprocating mechanism. This thesis presents a simulation based approach to investigate the wear related faults in IC engine bearings, through the integration of two approaches i. e. wear and vibration based analysis, for timely fault detection and prediction of remaining lifetime of the bearings. An engine dynamics model is established to provide the connecting rod bearing with actual service environment. The inherent engine inertia and the combustion force determine the magnitude of load on the bearing. To balance this load, a hybrid force model is developed to cover a range of lubrication regimes and provide real time information on bearing dynamics. The simulated information is robust to predict wear depths and generate corresponding vibration signals {{for a range of}} operating conditions. For wear calculation, a variable wear coefficient is simulated as a function of asperity contact area during transition from the mixed to boundary lubrication regime, thus signifying the severity of impending wear with growing contact. The effect of speed, external load and bearing clearance on vibration signals and wear severity is studied and validated through experiments. Envelope analysis successfully revealed the wear critical locations and wear severity for all operating conditions tested. From simulated data, appropriate vibration and wear based indicators are identified for correlation analysis. A relation is developed which can enable the prediction of bearing wear situation directly based on the selected <b>vibration</b> based <b>indicator</b> (I-Kaz coefficient) without having to actually inspect the bearing for wear. A framework for predicting the remaining lifetime of the bearings through instantaneous wear rates obtained from simulation is also presented. The application of the developed method is demonstrated on a Toyota 3 SFE engine, but the application is equally valid for any similar engine, provided the engine parameters are updated. Being vested with the combined benefits of wear and vibration based analysis techniques; the developed simulation is capable to detect bearing faults with good accuracy, with minimal dependence on real engine testing, for validation purpose only...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{emerges from the}} need for {{reduction}} of noise and vibrations in almost all industrial fields {{and the need for}} an accurate and reliable low-cost numerical model capable of predicting the vibro-acoustic response of structures containing viscoelastic materials. Indeed, the use of steel/viscoelastic/steel sandwich panels has motivated the development of accurate prediction methods for their <b>vibration</b> and acoustic <b>indicators.</b> Moreover, such theories may support the development of new damping materials while prioritizing strategies for low cost and weight and maintaining component rigidity and feasibility. A new sandwich finite element is presented for the specific case of unsymmetrical three-layered damped sandwich beam with internal viscoelastic damping. The model is based on a discrete displacement approach and accounts for the curvature effect. The element uses C[superscript 0] continuous linear and cubic polynomials to interpolate the in-plane and transverse displacement fields, respectively. The rotational influence of the transversal shearing in the core on the skins' behaviours ensures displacement consistency over the interfaces between the viscoelastic core and the elastic skins, resulting in accurate representations of the physics. To take the frequency dependence into account, viscoelastic models such as ADF, GHM and MSE models are implemented. The element is extended to the vibration of unsymmetrical damped sandwich plates. Two efficient finite element sandwich plates are developed; refined rectangular and triangular elements having four and three-corner nodes, respectively. Each node of both elements contains seven degrees of freedom. To allow for analysis with arbitrary orientation in three-dimensional space, two drilling degrees of freedom are added. A formulation with nine degrees of freedom per node is thus employed. The present sandwich element is easy to interface with classical elements. The element is fully validated through both experimental tests and classical 3 D FE modeling to prove its accuracy and computational efficiency. The tests consist of various configurations of sandwich panels in a coupled and uncoupled plate-cavity system. A parametric study is finally presented to highlight the effects of skin and core properties on the vibration and radiation of such structures under both airborne and structure-borne excitations. Finally, to illustrate practical use of the element, NVH simulations were conducted on laminated steel panels with added sound packages and compared to steel panels...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) This {{research}} {{proposed to}} develop a mathematical model for the prediction of aeolian vibration levels on overhead transmission lines {{in order to be}} able to ensure that damping systems are designed optimally in future. In order to enhance the understanding of aeolian and wake-induced vibration further, it also proposed to implement and apply the fluid flow simulation technique of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to both single conductors and conductor bundles. The Introduction of the CFD tool to the field of transmission line vibration, will ensure that bundles could be optimally designed for future applications. Wind-induced vibrations are known to cause expensive damage to the conductors and related hardware through fatigue or clashing of the bundled conductors. The primary cause of conductor aeolian vibration is the alternate shedding of wind-induced eddies from the top and bottom sides of the conductor, whereas wake-induced oscillations is peculiar to bundled conductors and arises from effects of the shielding of leeward conductors in bundles by windward ones. In order to study the phenomenon of aeolian vibration, research was undertaken utilising a full scale transmission line test station close to Kroonstad in the Orange Free State. Commercially available computer based packages were used for the development and simulation of both the mathematical model and fluid flow. During the flow simulations, an actual Zebra conductor and Zebra bundle configuration were utilised. For the development of the mathematical model, the pratical results, as measured at the Kroonstad transmission line test station during Phase I, were utilised. From the tests performed during Phase I, it was concluded that the damping solutions, currently used by Eskom as tested during Phase I, are all effective in controlling the aeolian vibration. The Stockbridge damper proved to be avery effective damper. Two models for the prediction of aeolian vibration levels were derived. Results showed that the vibration levels could be estimated to the correct order of magnitude and in many cases the precise values. The accuracy of the model was further improved by the inclusion of the Strouhal number as a function of windspeed. It has been decided by the author 10 develop and design a low cost <b>vibration</b> activity <b>indicator</b> for aeolian <b>vibration</b> measurements. The T-R-I-V-A-I has shown that it is a repeatable, reliable device, Ideally suited for line vibration detection. A new device, the W-I-V-I, has also been designed and implemented by the author for the detection and quantification of wake-induced vibration. During the simulation of the flows around a conductor in the steady state, it was established that the flow around as smooth cylinder and a Zebra conductor, is very similar, however, it was established that the rough outer surface of the Zebra conductor acts as a vortex generator. It has been found that a stability relationship exists between the degree of symmetry of the pressure cell, directly in front of the leeward conductor and the wake-induced vibration. Results for the unsteady flow situation showed the initiation and dispersion of the vortices as they are generated alongside the conductor. It is recommended that the developed model's accuracy be further enhanced. It should be established if. there are families of curves and data that belong together and that contribute to the amount of scatter in the parameters measured such as vibration amplitude, Strouhal number, etc. The applicability of CFD to the transmission line field should be enhanced, with the view of increasing bundle performance, both from an electrical and mechanical point of view...|$|R
