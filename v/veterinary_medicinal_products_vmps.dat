The majority of veterinary pharmaceutical residues enter the environment via application of manure of treated animals onto agricultural areas where they can adversely affect terrestrial plants. Especially, antibiotics are known to cause phytotoxic effects by influencing different plant physiological activities [1].|$|E
30|$|<b>Veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMPs)</b> are {{excreted}} by {{the treated}} {{animals in the}} form of unchanged parent substances and metabolized compounds. The excrements from stabled animals in Europe and North America are collected and stored mainly as liquid or solid manure before they are used as fertilizers on arable land and grassland. Biocides, which are used for the disinfection of stables, end up in the stored animal excrements. Via manure application in agriculture, veterinary medicines and biocides are released into the environment and consequently affect soil and water quality.|$|E
30|$|There is {{increasing}} research activity regarding {{the transformation of}} single substances under laboratory conditions. Current guidance, e.g., the “guideline on determining the fate of veterinary medicinal products in manure” [19], takes transformation of VMPs and biocides in manure into account. However, there is no standardized experimental test protocol available to examine the transformation of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMPs)</b> and biocides in liquid manure. The EMA guideline on transformation in manure [19] only contains basic regulatory requirements. To allow for a consistent assessment of studies within regulatory frameworks, a harmonized internationally accepted and validated test method is needed. The present review paper brings the initial situation assessment which might serve {{as a basis for}} further exploitation toward the formulation of the guideline.|$|E
40|$|The {{spread of}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMP)</b> and {{biocides}} onto agriculturally used areas represents {{a very important}} path of entry into the environment for these product groups. For this reason, current guidance (e. g. "Guideline on determining the fate of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in manure" (EMA/CVMP/ERA/ 430327 / 2009) (EMA, 2011) stipulates experimental studies on transformation of VMPs and biocides in manure. Though, the documents only contain basic regulatory requirements, whereas an experimental test guideline is still missing, both on EU and OECD level. To allow for a consistent assessment of studies within the registration process, a harmonized internationally accepted and validated test method is needed. A draft test guideline was developed within a previous R&D-Project "Development of test guidance for transformation of veterinary pharmaceuticals and biocides in liquid manure" (FKZ 3710 67 422) (Hennecke et al., 2015). The experimental method was examined and revised by an intra-laboratory comparisons {{as well as an}} international inter-laboratory comparison (pre-validation ring test). In the present project, an international ring test has been performed and evaluated testing a <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (florfenicol) in pig manure and a biocide (imidacloprid) in cattle manure. Moreover, two international workshops were organized; one at the beginning in connection with proceeding project (FKZ 3710 67 422) and one {{at the end of the}} project to discuss and evaluate the ring test. Based on the experimental results of the ring test as well as discussions and conclusions of both workshops, a revised draft test guideline was prepared...|$|R
40|$|For <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMP)</b> manure {{application}} onto agriculturally used soils is their main path {{of entry into}} the environment. Consequently, this path is considered {{as part of the}} environment risk assessment within the VMP marketing authorization process. Biocides which are used for stable disinfection treatments might also enter the environment via liquid manure. So far, only regulatory guidance (Guideline on determining the fate of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in manure (EMA/CVMP/ERA/ 430327 / 2009 (revised in 2011)) addresses this issue. However, an experimental guidance is still missing as it is available in form of OECD test guidelines for testing fate in soils and water-/sediment systems. It was the aim of the project to develop a method to determine the transformation of substances in liquid manure. In a first step, the heterogeneity of manure of different type and origin was tested. Furthermore, a procedure was tested which is capable to take samples homogeneously from a manure storage tank. Obviously, representative sampling is possible in case mixing devices which are routinely applied by the farmers are used prior to sampling. In order to get an overview on the variability of liquid manure of different type and origin (pig-/cattle manure; manure sampled in summer and winter, from different regions and livestock breeding) 30 manures were sampled and characterized. Furthermore, temperature (including a temperature profile) in manure tanks was reported in order to select a realistic test temperature. Six manures were selected to perform transformation studies of two <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (Salicylic acid, Paracetamol) and a biocide. The experimental methodology which was developed in the project was used in a first inter-laboratory comparison (ring test) with 5 laboratories. Experiences of the participants were presented and discussed on a workshop and based on the results the developed test protocol was adapted...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and spread of antimicrobial resistance is of considerable and growing concern. To {{better understand the}} relationship between the use of antimicrobial drugs and emerging antimicrobial resistance, surveillance of the antimicrobial use should take place. The main aim {{of this study was to}} obtain baseline data on systemic antimicrobial <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (<b>VMP)</b> usage in dogs and cats in the Netherlands, by starting to quantify and asses the usage of systemic antimicrobial VMP’s in dog and cats in the Netherlands during 2009 - 2011, using the daily dosage per animal year (DDD/j) as the unit of measurement. All Dutch small animal veterinary practices were invited. Data recorded in practice management systems (PMS’s) of 68 veterinary practices were used to calculate the DDD/j. In 2009 the average dog and cat in the Netherlands received 3, 42 DDD/j (n= 59 practices), decreasing to 3, 40 DDD/j in 2010 (n= 65 practices) and 3, 23 DDD/j in 2011 (n= 67 practices). The most received classes of antimicrobial VMP’s in dogs and cats in the Netherlands are the combination of penicillins, inclusive beta-lactamase inhibitors (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) : 38, 29 %, 36, 32 %, 38, 24 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67), followed by the penicillins with extended spectrum (amoxicillin, ampicillin) : 13, 19 %, 13, 01 %, 11, 73 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67). The third and fourth most received classes of antimicrobial VMP’s in dogs and cats in the Netherlands are the cephalosporins 3 rd generation (cefovecin) : 11, 95 %, 11, 14 %, 10, 23 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67) and cephalosporins 1 st generation (cefalexin, cefadroxil) : 10, 63 %, 11, 43 %, 11, 25 %, respectively 2009 (n= 59), 2010 (n= 65), 2011 (n= 67). Monitoring of the antimicrobial VMP use is important and general surveillance programs for companion animals should be used to monitor the extent and pattern of antimicrobial VMP usage and trends of antimicrobial resistance in companion animals in near future...|$|R
30|$|Residues of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMPs)</b> {{enter the}} {{environment}} via application of manure onto agricultural areas where in particular antibiotics can cause phytotoxicity. Terrestrial plant tests according to OECD guideline 208 {{are part of}} the environmental risk assessment of VMPs. However, this standard approach might not be appropriate for VMPs which form non-extractable residues or transformation products in manure and manure-amended soil. Therefore, a new test design with a more realistic exposure scenario via manure application is needed. This paper presents an extended plant test and its experimental verification with the veterinary antibiotics florfenicol and tylosin tartrate. With each substance, plant tests with four different types of application were conducted: standard tests according to OECD 208 and three tests with application of test substance via spiked manure either without storage, aerobically incubated, or anaerobically incubated for different time periods.|$|E
40|$|A model called ERA-AQUA was {{developed}} to assess the risks posed {{by the use of}} <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMPs)</b> applied in aquaculture ponds for the targeted produce, surrounding aquatic ecosystems, consumers, and trade of the aquaculture produce. The model calculates risks by following a risk quotient approach, calculating predicted exposure concentrations (exposure assessment) and predicted no-effect concentrations (effect assessment) for the endpoint under study. The exposure assessment is performed by combining information on the environmental characteristics of the aquaculture pond, characteristics of the cultured species, aquaculture management practices, and physicochemical properties of the compound under study. The model predicts concentrations of VMPs in the pond water, pond sediment, cultured species, and watercourse receiving pond effluent discharges by mass balance equations. The effect assessment is performed by combining (eco) toxicological information and food safety threshold concentrations for the studied compound. In the present study, the scientific background, strengths, and limitations of the ERA-AQUA model are presented together with a sensitivity analysis and an example showing its potential applications...|$|E

40|$|<b>Veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMPs)</b> require, {{as part of}} the European Union (EU) {{authorization}} process, {{consideration of}} both risks and benefits. Uses of VMPs have multiple risks (e. g., risks to the animal being treated, to the person administering the VMP) including risks to the environment. Environmental risks are not directly comparable to therapeutic benefits; there is no standardized approach to compare both environmental risks and therapeutic benefits. We have developed three methods for communicating and comparing therapeutic benefits and environmental risks for the benefit-risk assessment that supports the EU authorization process. Two of these methods support independent product evaluation (i. e., a summative classification and a visual scoring matrix classification); the other supports a comparative evaluation between alternative products (i. e., a comparative classification).

No studies have been conducted to describe and assess the adequacy of the current routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to these farmers. A combination of focus groups, self-administered questionnaires and direct observations was used to collect information for the purpose of describing and understanding the situation regarding the supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district. A combination of semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and direct observation was used to gather information. The results indicated that the routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district were inadequate. The annual sales from outlets within the Madikwe district were poor, with a total of 396 units sold over a period of one year, although there were approximately 2000 farmers in the Madikwe district who were potential clients for these outlets. The majority of products sold by these outlets were ectoparasiticides, followed by Tetracycline antibiotics. The outlets within the Madikwe district were unable to supply vaccines, as they did not have adequate facilities for the storage of these thermolabile products. Farmers had to travel an average of 70 km if they wished to purchase <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> from farmers' co-operatives and pharmacies in larger towns outside the Madikwe district. The routes and methods of supply did not ensure correct storage, and safe and effective use of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Several examples of misuse and incorrect storage and handling of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> were discovered.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} experimental model ecosystems (microcosms and mesocosms) for the ecological risk assessment of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMPs).</b> VMPs are used in large quantities, but the assessment of associated risks to the environment is limited, although they are continually infused into the environment via a number of routes. It is argued that the experience obtained by pesticide research largely can be used when evaluating VMPs, although there are several major differences between pesticides and pharmaceuticals (e. g., knowledge of their mechanisms of action on nontarget organisms). Also, because microorganisms are often the target organisms of VMPs, risk assessment should focus more on endpoints describing functional processes. This paper provides {{a review of the}} current risk assessment schemes of Europe and North America along with examples of experiments already performed with veterinary medicinal products in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem models.

This study used carcase observation in four abattoirs in England to determine ISL prevalence in beef cattle. Additionally, a questionnaire survey was used to investigate vaccination technique among UK beef farmers. The ISL prevalence was 4. 1 per cent (95 per cent CI 3. 4 per cent to 4. 9 per cent). A potential difference between sites being used for vaccination {{and the distribution of}} ISLs on carcases suggested that factors other than vaccination were contributing to ISL incidence. Questionnaire responses highlighted deficits in good vaccination practices such as using the recommended site of injection and needle hygiene.

A lysimeter study with sulphachloropyridazine was used for a functional validition of the groundwater model PEARL. A simulation error of 0. 02 was established, which means that computed values underestimated the measured values by a factor 50. In this study two major factors for uncertainty in the simulation are discerned. First, the untimely ending of the lysimeter hampered the full expression of downward transport. Second, the uncertainty in the sorption process and parameter is of major importance for a reliable simulation.

However, this standard approach might not be appropriate for VMPs which form non-extractable residues or transformation products in manure and manureamended soil. Therefore, a new test design with a more realistic exposure scenario via manure application is needed. This paper presents an extended plant test and its experimental verification with the veterinary antibiotics florfenicol and tylosin tartrate. With each substance, plant tests with four different types of application were conducted: standard tests according to OECD 208 and three tests with application of test substance via spiked manure either without storage, aerobically incubated, or anaerobically incubated for different time periods. Results: In standard tests, the lowest NOEC was < 0. 06 mg/kg dry soil for florfenicol and 16. 0 mg/kg dry soil for tylosin tartrate. Pre-tests showed that plant growth was not impaired at 22 -g fresh manure/kg dry soil, which therefore was used for the final tests. The application of the test substances via freshly spiked as well as via aerobically incubated manure had no significant influence on the test results. Application of florfenicol via anaerobically incubated manure increased the EC 10 by a factor up to 282 and 540 for half-maximum and for maximum incubation period, respectively. For tylosin tartrate, this factor amounted to 64 at half-maximum and 61 at maximum incubation period. The reduction of phytotoxicity was generally stronger when using cattle manure than pig manure and particularly in tests with cattle manure phytotoxicity decreased over the incubation period. Conclusions: The verification of the extended plant test showed that seedling emergence and growth are comparable to a standard OECD 208 test and reliable effect concentrations could be established. As demonstrated in the present study, phytotoxicity of veterinary antibiotics can be significantly reduced by application via incubated manure compared to the standard plant test. Overall, the presented test design proved suitable for inclusion into the plant test strategy for VMPs...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{salmonella}} in poultry and salmonellosis {{in our country}} became a rather topical one with {{the latest developments in}} industrial poultry farming. Against the expectations, {{it turned out that the}} intensive poultry farming and the relevant intensive methods of farming and feeding do foster development and spread of pathogenic micro-organisms, especially salmonellas. Gyurov et al. (2006) outline that the dominant types of salmonella in poultry are S. enteritidis, S. gallinarum and S. typhimurium are present in 80 % of all the isolates, thus justifying the necessity of regular monitoring of such targeting. Everywhere in diagnostic units countrywide, there is well identified trend of more and more decreasing number of incoming biological samples for pathological examination and microbiological testing and it requires appropriate efforts to be overcome. This study place the focus of analyses on microbiological tests performed on diagnostic materials in laboratories of National Diagnostic & Research Veterinary Medical Institute (NDRVMI) and in others in the country, and also on the trials carried out to achieve a more comprehensive monitoring of flocks of identified salmonella infections. Furthermore, it explores the isolates of the Salmonella strains and summarises the results generated by all the National Programmes for Control of Salmonellosis in Poultry (NPCSP), which cover flocks of breeding stock, laying hens, broilers and turkeys. Subject to analyses are also the methods applied for testing for salmonella and salmonellosis in poultry-breeding and the results collected from testing for salmonella bacteria in feed. Laboratory data on poultry cover the five-year period since 2007 till 2011 and are generated by the tests performed in the laboratory named ‘Bacterial Diseases in Poultry’ with the NDRVMI, where a total of 11269 samples have been tested as taken from fallen poultry and their environment in accordance with the requirements laid down in the NPCSP. This total is broken by years, as follows: • Year 2007 : 636 samples tested for S. enteritidis in day-old and six-day broiler chickens (the 2 positive ones were taken from two flocks of no link between each other). Furthermore, under additional programme there were 3 cases (1 + 1 + 1) of three different salmonella species (S. manchester, S. chester and S. typhimurium) found in one poultry farm of broilers, and other two other isolates of Salmonella gr. C were isolated from samples of laying hens of two flocks. • Year 2008 : There were 2233 samples taken under the surveillance provided for in the Programme for detection of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp., all being also tested (as all others subject to this report) in the above mentioned laboratory. These samples yielded 86 isolates of Salmonella spp. (ref. the NPCS in broilers for 2008); • Year 2009 : There were 1970 samples tested to yield (in March) 2 cases of Salmonellas of gr. OC in broiler chickens and a total of 10 isolates; • Year 2010 : The number of samples tested was 3124 to yield 7 isolates, these including 2 cases of S. typhimurium in fallen herons in January, 2 cases of S. gallinarium (samples taken in backyards) and 1 isolate of Salmonellas of gr. OC of egg-shell samples of broiler chickens; • Year 2011 : a total of 3306 samples tested to have isolates of Salmonellas in laying hens, all being delivered under the self-control requirements applicable to poultry farms. The yield was of only isolate of Salmonella gr. OC. Briefly, there were 11269 samples tested during the whole aforementioned period to yield isolate(s) of S. gallinarum, S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, S. manchester, S. chester and Salmonella gr. OC. The NDRVMI Sector named ‘Bacteriology and bacterial diseases in animals, compound feed and raw materials therefor’ have testing activities in feed to detect Salmonella spp. therein. The summary here is as follows: o 2007 – 242 feed samples of two cases of salmonella isolation (one of S. munchen in compound feed for pigs and one of S. ????? in food for home pets); o 2008 - 206 feed samples tested to yield one case of isolation of Salmonella OE in compound feed for poultry; o 2009 - 204 feed samples tested and not a single Salmonella isolate; o 2010 - 148 feed samples tested and not case of S. isolate yielded; o 2011 - 296 feed samples tested to yield one case of S. isolate (S. hadar). The brief summary for the whole period is a total of 1094 feed samples tested to yield a total of 4 S. isolates. In Bulgaria, official control of Salmonella spp. in breeding flocks, laying hens, broilers (Gallus gallus) and turkey is completely encompassed within respective National Plans for Control of Salmonellas (NPCS) broken in respective industrial categories of poultry. The NPCS in breeding flocks has delivered the following laboratory results: Ø Year 2008 : A total of 85 breeding flocks subject to respective NPCS, the number of poultry therein, being 997, 101. A total of total of 1168 samples tested as faecal ones and such taken from hatcheries (egg-shells). No S+ result confirmed; Ø Year 2009 : The number of flocks under controls was 143 of 1, 205, 575 poultry and 452 tests performed under these official controls. Five (5) flocks were proven as S+ for the year, as follows: one flock of S. infantis, one of S. bareilly, two flocks of S. senftenberg and one of S. agona. This makes the percentage of the S+ flocks compared to all flocks included in the programme to be 3, 49 %; Ø Year 2010 : The official samples taken from breeding flocks were 368, all these being taken from 151 flocks in 35 farms and a total of 1, 569, 702 poultry. The total number of tests performed was 2302 (including the samples taken under the self-control plans of poultry farmers). The overall results were: 3 flocks found positive for S. infantis, 2 flocks positive for S. hadar, 1 flock positive for S. covalis, 1 flock positive for S. glostrup and 1 flock positive for S. Seftenberg. This makes 5, 3 % of positive of all the flocks tested. Ø Year 2011 : the official controls in breeding flocks involved 253 samples taken from 127 flocks (of 37 farms) encompassing 1, 319794 poultry The samples tested under the farmers’ self-control were 2247. The output was 4 positive flocks for Salmonella spp. (i. e. 3, 15 %), one flock being positive for S. typhimurium, 1 flock positive for S. agona and 2 flocks positive for S. livingstone. It should be outlined here, that the case of S. typhimurium (of sero-group OB) has given also reaction for concomitant infection of S. derby throughout the process of isolate confirmation. The 2011 percentage of positive animals is 0, 55 % – the prevalence of sero-types included in the programme. There was one flock of 7230 breeding poultry which was positive for S. typhimurium, which is rather good one, if compared with the data of previous years, in which the percentage of positive poultry (i. e. the spread/prevalence) was substantially higher. The NPCS in laying hens sector has delivered the following laboratory results: ü Year 2008 : A total of 115 farms of laying hens (yielding table eggs), involving 228 flocks of 3, 400, 784 layers. A total of 222 flocks have proven to be negative (-) for S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, while 2 flocks (of 6100 layers) were proven as positive for S. enteritidis. ü Year 2009 : A total of 246 flocks have been involved within the NPCS in laying hens. There were 244 flocks proven negative for S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, while 2 flocks (of 2303 layers) were proven as positive for S. enteritidis. Four other flocks were positive of other Salmonella types, i. e. one flock was positive for S. abovy, one flock for S. Corvallis, one flock for S. Agona and 1 flock for S. virchov. Percentage of flocks positive for S. enteritidis was 0, 81 % (i. e. below 1 %). ü Year 2010 : A total of 275 flocks of 3, 173, 906 poultry were subjected to sampling and testing under the official Salmonellas detection programme. Two (2) flocks have been proven to be positive for S. enteritidis and seven (7) for other Salmonella spp., as follows: 6 flocks positive for S. infantis and 1 flock positive for S. parkroyal. The official samples tested were 460 of 104 farms, while the self-controls samples were 725, all the latter being Salmonellas negative (-). All this making the year of 1 % infection by S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis in the whole sector of laying hens. ü Year 2011 : A total of 228 laying hens flocks of 2, 893, 951 poultry were subjected to sampling and testing under the official Salmonellas detection programme (the NMCSP). Four (4) flocks have been proven to be positive for S. enteritidis and 11 were proven as positive for other Salmonella spp., the latter including 2 positive for S. agona, 1 flock positive for S. hadar, 3 flocks positive for S. kottbus, 4 flocks positive for S. barely and 1 flock positive for S. infantis. This year official samples tested were 325 (of 104 farms), while the self-controls ones were 715. The 2011 data show an increase in the percentage (%) of Salmonellas positive (+) cases and higher level of prevalence of the serotypes provided for in the NCPS in this laying hens sector. Percentage (%) of positive poultry was 1, 31 % for the targeted Salmonella serotypes demonstrated by 4 flocks (of 37800 poultry) of laying hens positive for S. enteritidis. This could be compared with the same indicator (prevalence) for 2010 which was then 0, 88 %. The NPCS for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. within the broiler sector has yielded the following laboratory results: Ø Year 2008 : The number of samples tested was 327 samples taken in 13 broiler fattening farms (Gyurov, B. I. et al. 2011 and in more details Valcheva R et al. 2011). Here, laboratory results has identified 86 salmonella strains of 16 different serovars that are, as follows: S. infantis – 14; S. enteritidis – 18; S. montevideo – 22; S. virchov – 5; S. menden – 4; S. thompson – 3; S. kottbus – 2; S. typhimurium - 1, S. give - 1; S. concord – 1; S. newport - 1; S. bonariensis – 1; S. kiss - 1; S. irumu – 1; S. parkroyal - 1 and S. Group C 1 (6, 7 : - :-) – 10. Ø Year 2009 : A total of 1069 flocks tested for Salmonella spp. under official control represented by 1471 samples tested to cover an array of over 22085874 broiler chickens. Three (3) flocks were positive for S. enteritidis, one for S. virchov, two (2) flocks were positive for S. kottbus and one (1) for S. agona. The test results give grounds to consider the objective of the programme achieved, without any technical difficulties. The percentage of positive flocks (prevalence) for the whole 2009 was 0, 37 %, which is well below 1 %. Ø Year 2010 : More than 18, 916, 348 broilers were covered by official controls by a total of 1094 official samples taken from 1088 flocks of 159 broiler farms. Only one (1) flock was proven as positive for S. typhimurium, while 14 flocks have demonstrated other serovars of Salmonella spp., but none of them all was S. enteritidis. These 14 isolates of Salmonella spp. were as follows: 10 flocks of S. infantis; 1 flock of S. newport, 2 flocks of S. tennessee and 1 flock of S. mbandaka. The tests performed on self controls covered all the 2077 samples taken by broiler farmers, but all were proven as negative for the targeted Salmonella spp. Ø Year 2011 : Official samples from broiler flocks were 513 taken from 1867 flocks in 171 farms (29, 277, 987 broilers). Within this whole year period there have not been any flocks of detected (positive) cases of S. typhimurium or S. enteritidis. Twelve (12) flocks were positive for other Salmonella serotypes. These are as follows: 3 flocks were positive for S. infantis, 4 flocks were positive for S. livingstone and 5 flocks were positive for S hadar. In the year there were also 1865 tests performed on samples taken under the self control of broiler farmers, but these have not yielded any positive (S+) for the targeted Salmonella spp. There are very few farmers keeping turkeys for fattening, this making the results of this ‘fattening turkey’ sector very brief. In 2010 there were 8 pooled samples taken and tested as negative, the same being the case of 2011, in which the number of samples tested was four (4). Usage of vaccines is not prohibited for poultry flocks. Vaccinations take place in breeding flocks (Gallus gallus) and in flocks of laying hens. Vaccines (live or inactivated) should and are all involved in the registrar of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (<b>VMPs).</b> Only the vaccine authorised by the only national Competent Authority, i. e. Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) may be used in Bulgaria. Vaccination against Salmonella spp. is targeted at the three main serovars of importance in poultry farming, i. e. farmed poultry are subject to vaccination against S. gallinarum, S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium. The situation with breeding flocks covered by vaccination during recent years is as follows: 2008 – of 85 flocks (of 1, 205, 575 poultry) the vaccinated ones were 54 flocks (of 204 000 growing up parents); 2009 – of 143 flocks (of 1, 205, 575 poultry) the vaccinated ones were 104 (of 747, 750 growing up parents) plus 101 flocks (of 565 500 parents); 2010 – of 156 flocks (of 1, 569, 702 poultry) there were 116 vaccinated flocks (of 936, 884 growing up parents) plus 87 flocks (of 373, 560 parents); 2011 – of 127 flocks (of 1, 319, 794 poultry), there were 111 vaccinated flocks (of 1, 310, 136. parents) and another 77 flocks (of 480, 545 growing up parents). As for the laying hens sector the situation demonstrates progressively increasing number of vaccinated flocks between 2008 and 2011. The 2011 total gives 1088 flocks (of 130, 797, 780 layers), of which 283 were the vaccinated flocks (of 4, 275, 665). The annual developments and implementation of National Programmes for Control of Salmonella (NPCS) in poultry has proven its disciplining effect on both official controls bodies and the self-control activities applied by poultry farmers. However, a pending necessity it ensure improvement of sampling performed under the self-control plans of poultry farmers or making it incorporated within official controls plans and actions. Furthermore, there is a need to conduct well planned observations and tests on the effectivenes...|$|E
40|$|A {{ranking system}} for <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and {{medicated}} feed additives {{has been developed}} {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the National Residue Control Plan. In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme. Other factors which should be taken into account include issues such as evidence of misuse of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives and changes to maximum residue limits in the specifications for particular <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives.
