40|$|Steam {{condensation}} {{plays an}} essential role in supplying and removing heat in many industrial applications, including the energy sector. It therefore is a phenomena of significance that requires deep understanding. This thesis presents effective <b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> condensation on the shell-side of vertical shell and tube condenser (VSTC) accompanying steam desuperheating. It describes a fundamental study of heat transfer in VSTC with considerations of several factors; explicitly degree of superheat related with each <b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> pressure, temperature waviness in desuperheating section, and steam condensation in absence of non-condensable gas (NCG). Experiments performed on the VSTC are: Steam desuperheating and condensation in the shell-side VSTC at a variety of <b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> pressures and respective <b>steam</b> flowrates, <b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> desuperheating and condensation in the shell-side of VSTC at reduced <b>steam</b> flowrates, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> desuperheating and condensation at tube wall temperatures up to steam saturation temperature (T₂ ≥ Tsat) to analyse dry heat transfer in the desuperheating section. To examine the stated aim, test facility was built in the laboratory of the University of Waikato. By generating desuperheating and condensation models for each test pressure, this investigation proves that <b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> condensation best occurs without involvement of superheat. About 60 % of the VSTC occupied with desuperheating, and the heat transfer involved in desuperheating is minor approximately 1 kW, whereas, the condensation section of VSTC has heat transfer about 10 kW. By reducing the steam flowrate, 10 % reduction in the desuperheating section and 20 % to 50 % reduction in the Reynolds number was observed. After raising the tube wall temperature up to the steam saturation temperature, a smooth temperature profile across the desuperheating the section was seen with significant sensible heat transfer. Obstruction linked with superheated steam condensation in the dairy industrial leads to poor heat transfer area utilization by the desuperheating section and therefore, reduction of the evaporator rating or oversizing of the heat exchangers to attain appropriate duty...|$|R

The sausages were made of beef, cod oil, corn oil, tapioca flour, skimmed milk, salt, pepper, garlic, angkak, and ice, with the ratio of cod oil and corn oil of 2. 9 : 7. 1; 2. 4 : 7. 6; and 1. 9 : 8. 1. All sausages ingredients were mixed and then filled in the casing. The raw sausages were cooked using steaming and <b>vacuum</b> <b>steaming</b> for 30 minutes. The sausages were then analyzed for chemical composition (moisture, protein, and fat contents), physical quality (pH, water holding capacity, and tenderness), and fatty acids profile (omega 3 and omega 6 ratio). The data of chemical composition and physical quality were analyzed statistically using analysis of variance (factorial pattern = 3 factors of oil ratio x 2 factors of cooking method) and the differences between means were tested by Duncan’s new Multiple Ranges Test. The data of fatty acids profile were analyzed descriptively. The results showed that the different ratio of cod and corn oils affected the moisture content, protein content, pH, and water holding capacity of sausages (P< 0. 05). <b>Vacuum</b> <b>steaming</b> increased significantly the moisture content, protein content, fat content, pH, and water holding capacity of sausages (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The new {{techniques}} used today focus mainly on increases in production speed. For this reason yarns {{to be used}} in high speed machines is required to be of high quality. On the other hand high speed frequently causes the degree of yarn moisture to fall minimum level. This decreases in the degree of yarn moisture have negative effects on yarn strength. Since better moisture level increases the yarn strength, yarn is worked more efficiently in weaving and knitting. However each production step in textile plants causes tension in yarn and fibre. Yarns tend to snarl in order to relax themselves. Tension and snarling may lead to problems in the following proceses, thus decreasing productivity. Therefore, the moisture content of yarns should be increased and their tension should be eleminated.

40|$|Background: Dental handpieces are {{required}} to be sterilized between patient use. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> sterilization processes with fractionated pre/post-vacuum phases or unique cycles for specified medical devices, {{are required}} for hollow instruments with internal lumens to assure successful air removal. Entrapped air will compromise achievement of required sterilization conditions. Many countries and professional organisations still advocate non-vacuum sterilization processes for these devices. Aim: To investigate non-vacuum downward/gravity displacement, type-N steam sterilization of dental handpieces, using thermometric methods to measure time to achieve sterilization temperature at different handpiece locations. Methods: Measurements at different positions within air turbines were undertaken with thermocouples and dataloggers. Two examples of commonly used UK benchtop steam sterilizers were tested; a non-vacuum benchtop sterilizer (Little Sister 3, Eschmann, UK) and a vacuum benchtop sterilizer (Lisa, W&# 38;H, Austria). Each sterilizer cycle was completed with three handpieces and each cycle in triplicate. Findings: A total of 140 measurements inside dental handpiece lumens were recorded. We demonstrate that the non-vacuum process fails (time range 0 - 150 seconds) to reliably achieve sterilization temperatures within the time limit specified by the International standard (15 seconds equilibration time). The measurement point {{at the base of}} the handpiece failed in all test runs (n= 9) to meet the standard. No failures were detected with the <b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> sterilization type B process with fractionated pre-vacuum and post-vacuum phases.

40|$|Wood heat {{treatment}} {{is an attractive}} alternative to improve decay resistance of low natural durability wood species. Nowadays, several types of thermal treatments of wood exist. These treatments differ mainly {{by the nature of}} the inert atmosphere used to avoid wood combustion which may correspond to: nitrogen, <b>vacuum,</b> <b>steam</b> or oil. Decay resistance is strongly correlated to thermal degradation of wood cells wall components and consequently of treatment conditions from which depend chemical modifications. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a new generation of treatment performed under vacuum on the chemical modifications occurring during treatment. For this purpose, one hardwood (beech) has been treated under different conditions (<b>vacuum,</b> nitrogen, <b>steam).</b> All treatments were performed at 220 °C for mass losses resulting from wood thermodegradation of approximately 12 %. For each treatment condition extractives, Klason lignin, hemicelluloses and α-celluloses content were determined as well as monosaccharide composition. Intensity of thermodegradation was also evaluated by TD-GC-MS. Results show that extracts content were lower in the case of wood samples treated under vacuum, while lignin, hemicelluloses and α-celluloses contents were higher in the case of samples treated under steam and nitrogen, indicating lower wood degradation under vacuum treatment. These results were confirmed by chromatography analyses according to the nature and quantity of thermodegradation volatile products formed during TD-GC-MS analyses. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The following advice is based on comments from a scientist in an established industrial company, who pointed out that the success of any treatment will depend upon the quality of the material involved. First, refine the animal fat (we are assuming beef tallow) with an alkali, such as caustic soda. Then bleach the material by absorption or treatment with a bleaching earth or carbon. The actual deodorization is achieved by a process called (<b>vacuum</b> <b>steam</b> stripping'. This involves steam distillation and can be done on a relatively small scale in a mild or stainless steel vessel. This must be airtight and oxygen free. The vessel is filled to about half full and then a vacuum is pulled at 4 mm absolute pressure, the oil is heated and superheated steam (approx. 475 degrees F) is blown through a spider distributor {{at the bottom of the}} vessel. This then leads to a condenser where the material is cooled and discharged for storage. We suggest that you speak with your own engineers and to others working in the same field.
