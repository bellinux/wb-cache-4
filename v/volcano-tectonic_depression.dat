40|$|Analysis of Viking Orbiter data {{suggests}} that Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascreus Mons, three large shield volcanoes of the Tharsis volcanoes of Mars, have had similar evolutionary trends. Arsia Mons {{appears to have}} developed in the following sequence: (1) construction of a main shield volcano, (2) outbreak of parasitic eruption centers on the northeast and southwest flanks, (3) volcano-tectonic subsidence of the summit and formation of concentric fractures and grabens, possibly by evacuation of an underlying magma chamber during eruption of copious lavas from parasitic eruption centers on the northeast and southwest flanks, and (4) continued volcanism along a fissure or rift bisecting the main shield, resulting in flooding of {{the floor of the}} <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> and inundation of the northeast and southwest flanks by voluminous lavas locally forming parasitic shields.

Interpretation of horizontal gradient of the gravity data indicated that the area is characterized by the existence of high gradient anomalies associated with existing geothermal fields and manifestations. Horizontal gradient analysis also enabled tracing several faults that are mainly striking in the S-N, NW-SE, and NE-SW directions.

30|$|The results {{presented}} {{in the previous section}} reveal that extensive low-velocity anomalies lie along the Beppu-Shimabara Graben below 5 km (Fig. 6 (0 km, 5 km), Fig. 12) and beneath the Miyazaki Plain to depths of ∼g. 6 (5 km), Fig. 9 (Y = − 440 km, − 80 km)). The Beppu-Shimabara Graben is characterized by steeply low-gravity anomalies and significant negative gravity anomalies in the eastern edge. A geodetic survey shows a N-S extensional strain in the Beppu-Shimabara Graben at a rate of 1.4 cm/yr, and crustal depression of 2 mm/yr in Unzen region during the period from 1891 to 1982 (Tada, 1985). The focal mechanism of micro-earthquakes shows normal- and strike-slip-faulting earthquakes with N-S tension (T) axes (Hatanaka and Shimazaki, 1988; Shimizu et al., 1993). Tada (1993) suggested that the Beppu-Shimabara Graben is a rift valley formed in the continen-tal crust and the north-eastern extension of the Okinawa Trough. In contrast, Kamata and Kodama (1994) suggested that normal faults in the Unzen region and <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depressions</b> in the Hohi Volcanic Zone (HVZ) independently exist due to crustal extensions in the northern Okinawa Trough in the Unzen region and pull-apart geometry by oblique subduction of PHS plate and dextral displacement on the MTL and its western extension, the Oita-Kumamoto Tectonic Line (OKTL) in the HVZ, respectively. Nishimura and Hashimoto (2006) analyzed the GPS-derived velocity field in Kyushu during a period from 1996 to 2002. They interpreted strain field by a N-S extension along the Beppu-Shimabara Graben and E-W right lateral slips and its deficits along the Median Tectonic Line and the Beppu-Shimabara Graben. Low-velocity zones are likely to be spatially restricted below active volcanoes and in the uppermost crust {{in the case of the}} pull-apart basin scenario, and rather more extensive in the case of a rift zone formation mechanism. Our tomographic results reveal a low-velocity anomaly extending from the surface to approximately 5 km in depth, a result compatible with the <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depressions</b> model.|$|R
40|$|The volcanoes of Mars {{have been}} {{divided into three}} groups based on morphology: basaltic shields, domes and {{composite}} cones, and highland patera.

40|$|Kagoshima Graben of {{southern}} Kyushu is a <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression,</b> which {{is presumed to}} have been formed ca. 2. 9 Ma. The depth of the graben considerably exceeds 1, 000 meters. A bore hole deeply dri 11 ed {{in the search for}} hot water is situated in western margin of the graben. Our study of the boring samples has reveals that the subsurface stratigraphic sequence is mainly divided into three formations. The lower formation consists of subaqueous pyroclastic rocks and siltstone with foraminifera and pollen fossils; both the middle and upper formations are composed of welded tuff. These are correlative with the graben-fill marine deposits (Kekura Formation) of the middle Pleistocene and the terrestrial pyroclastic flows from gigantic calderas of the upper Pleistocene respectively. A fault between here and western adjacent area is inferred, and its vertical displacement after the deposition of the lower formation is estimated to be about 500 meters. The fault {{may be one of the}} western marginal normal faults of Kagoshima Graben. We present a structural model of geothermal reservoir based on the analyses of alteration minerals, chemical compositions of thermal water, temperature, change of water level，etc. The geothermal water is embedded in two horizons of the lower formation. The reservoirs are accompanied by superior cap rocks resulted from self-sealing. The water of this well belongs to that of a sea coast-type hot spring.

40|$|The {{presence}} of young, highly explosive volcanoes in the densely populated Roman area (central Italy), makes {{the evaluation of}} the long-term volcanic hazard a crucial point. The Sabatini Volcanic District (SVD), part of the potassic Quaternary Roman Province, extends over an area of 1800 km(2) including the city of Rome. Here we report twenty-six new (40) Ar/(39) Ar age analyses of pyroclastic and lava units in order to put time constraints on the most recent SVD eruptive activity (i. e. post-dating 400 ka), as a groundwork for a detailed reconstruction of the whole volcano-tectonic evolution. Integrated geochronological and field evidence shows that SVD volcanism maintained a typical areal character through the whole history: both effusive and explosive activity phases from different source areas and volcano-tectonic settings overlapped in time and space, while climactic phases migrated repeatedly through time. In particular, new geochronological data better constrain a climactic phase of activity at around 300 ka, related to the Bracciano <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> and the Sacrofano caldera, and point out that the most recent eruptive activity in the SVD took place from time-space-clustered hydromagmatic centres at least up to 90 ka. In addition, we remark some parallelism among major activity phases in the SVD and the nearby districts of the Roman Province, with possible implications on Quaternary regional tectonics. Finally, new age data put constraints on tephrostratigraphic correlations through the Apennine Chain and the Adriatic Sea. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The initial syn-rift infill (Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic) of the Neuquén Basin {{involved}} a complex stacking of lava, pyroclastic and sedimentary units, in which volcanic rocks compose up to 72 % of the infill. The high-quality outcrops {{of the southern}} Sañicó depocentre, which was uplifted and exposed during the Andean orogeny, were studied {{in order to determine}} the lithofacies arrangements, the tectonostratigraphic framework and the main controls over the syn-rift succession. The tectonostratigraphic study made it possible to determine three sections characterized by the predominance of effusive, pyroclastic or sedimentary deposits. These sections indicate three different evolutionary stages of the volcanic rifting. The onset of this rift stage was dominated by effusive rocks with minor ignimbrite and alluvial volcaniclastic units, which indicates the occurrence of composite volcanoes at the boundaries of the depocentre. The mid-rift stage was characterized by the development of fault-controlled, large ignimbrite deposits intebedded with volcaniclastic alluvial deposits and lava units, which suggests a <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> related to asymmetrical and incremental subsidence. The end of the volcanic rifting event was marked by a decrease in the volume of the volcanic rocks and the occurrence of low-relief effusive aggradational volcanic edifices and lava fields in close relation with alluvial, deltaic and lacustrine units. The analysis of the syn-rift sequence in the Sañicó depocentre showed the complex relationships between tectonic and volcanic controls which occurred in different magnitudes and times during the rifting evolution...|$|E
40|$|Io's {{mountains}} are cataloged {{in order to}} investigate their formation. Of the 101 mountains imaged with sufficient coverage and resolution for further analysis, 4 are volcanoes, and 97 are tectonic massifs. Of the 97 tectonic mountains, ≥ 40 abut paterae (volcanic or <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depressions).</b> This juxtaposition {{is unlikely to be}} coincidental as the probability of it occurring by chance is ∼ 1. 08 %. The observed mountain-patera association may be due to orogenic faults acting as conduits for magma ascent, thus fueling patera formation near mountains. As resurfacing buries a shell of material from Io's surface {{to the base of the}} lithosphere, its effective radius is reduced and it heats up. The volume change due to subsidence and thermal expansion is calculated as a function of lithospheric thickness. Conservation of volume dictates that this material is uplifted at Io's surface. By estimating the total volume of mountains, Io's average lithospheric thickness is constrained to ≥ 12 km. A kinematic analysis of Nefertiti Corona, Venus, reveals that the corona's interior moved east as a relatively coherent thrust sheet with most deformation occurring on the distal margin. Additionally, an en-echelon array indicates a history of semi-brittle deformation on the northern side of Nefertiti's tectonic annulus. Regional heating from the thermal diapir that formed Nefertiti probably reduced the crustal viscosity and enabled the semi-brittle deformation. The "Odessa Craters" in the Channeled Scabland of eastern Washington State are basaltic ring structures (BRSs) 50 - 500 m in diameter that are comprised of discontinuous, concentric outcrops of subvertically-jointed basalt and autointrusive basaltic dikes. It is postulated that they formed as follows: phreatovolcanic activity disrupted a relatively thin, active lava flow forming rootless cones; the lava flow inflated around the cones; tensile stresses caused concentric fracturing; dikes exploited the fractures and fed lava to the surface; and subsequent erosive floods excavated the structures. A second population of BRSs near Tokio Station, WA, are morphologically analogous to quasi-circular structures in Athabasca Valles, Mars (a region that is geologically similar to the Channeled Scabland). If the martian features formed as BRSs, then they indicate local water-lava interactions and at least two floods through Athabasca Valles...|$|R
40|$|Paterae (<b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depressions)</b> {{are among}} the most {{prominent}} topographic features on Io. They are unique, yet in some aspects they resemble calderas known and studied on Earth, Mars, and Venus. They have steep walls, flat floors, and arcuate margins, typical of terrestrial and Martian basalt shield calderas. However, they are much larger (2 km - 202 km diameter, mean 42 km  3 km) and typically lack obvious shields. They are often angular in shape or are found adjacent to mountains, suggesting tectonic influences on their formation. A preferential clustering of paterae at the equatorial sub- and anti-jovian regions is likely a surface expression of tidal massaging and convection in the asthenosphere. Paterae adjacent to mountains have a mean diameter 14 km  9 km larger than that for all paterae, which may indicate paterae grow larger in the fractured crust near mountains. Nightside and eclipse observations of Pele Patera by the Cassini and Galileo spacecraft reveal that much of Pele’s visible thermal emission comes from lava fountains within a topographically confined lava body, most likely a lava lake. Multiple filter images provided color temperatures of 1500  80 K from Cassini ISS data, and 1420  100 K from Galileo SSI data. Hotspots found within paterae (79 % of all hotspots) exhibit a wide range of thermal behaviors in global eclipse images. Some hotspots are similar to Pele, consistently bright and confined; others, such as Loki, brighten or dim between observations and move to different locations within their patera. A model for patera formation begins with heating and convection within a high-temperature, low-viscosity asthenosphere. Magma rises through the cold, dense lithosphere either as diapirs [for thermal softening of the lithosphere and sufficiently large diapirs (20 km - 40 km diameter, > 5 km thickness) ] or through dikes. Magma reaches zones of neutral buoyancy and forms magma chambers that feed eruptions. Collapse over high-level chambers results in patera formation, filling of the patera with lava to create a lava lake, or lateral spreading of the magma chamber and subsequent enlargement of the patera by consuming crustal materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and mass transfers at Piton de la Fournaise volcano are investigated using new {{on land and}} offshore measurements. The structures are defined using 2 and 3 D modelling. Short-wavelength positive anomalies to the W and NW of the central area are interpreted as shallow piles of thick, dense lava flows which have filled <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depressions,</b> several hundreds of meters deep. This finding provides a new insight into {{the evolution of the}} volcano. Conversely, the currently active central zone is associated with a negative short-wavelength anomaly, explained by the presence of thin, highly vesiculated and fractured lava flows building the Central Cone. Low density formations underlying the Rivieres des Remparts and Langevin areas are tentatively interpreted as breccias related to erosion and/or to southward directed mass-wasting. Topographic offshore highs in the continuation of the SE and NE rift zones of Piton de la Fournaise are characterized by negative gravity anomalies and reversed magnetic anomalies. Their interpretation as hyaloclastites and pillow lavas provides a coherent explanation for both types of signals if we admit that they were primarily constructed during the Alizes stage. Two main deeper, dense structures are also found: the Grand Brule complex, and a complex beneath the Plaine des Sables and the Enclos Fouque. Both are identified as hypovolcanic intrusive complexes. The Grand Brule complex (10 x 18 km in plan view) shows a marked NS-elongated geometry, unlike the other comparable complexes on the island. The Plaine des Sables-Enclos Fouque complex, a more or less circular structure 5 km in diameter, is attributed to the Ancient Shield stage. It is centered on the Enclos fault, suggesting that the paleo-center of the Ancient Shield was located about 1. 5 km eastward of the previously proposed location. An apparent contradiction was noted between the seismic and gravity images of the internal structure. In particular, a high velocity cylinder beneath the summit was not detected in the gravity models. This contradiction was resolved by considering the relative sensitivity of each method. Finally, the gravity dataset has allowed us to explore the gravity changes that accompanied the major eruptive and volcano-tectonic crisis of April 2007 (350 m collapse of the summit and emission of similar to 120 x 10 (6) m(3) of lava). The change in the mass distribution of the edifice was large enough to be detected in the survey data collected in the central area before and after the crisis. However, the accuracy was too low for the precise assessment of the mass transfers...|$|R
40|$|Gravity and seismic {{studies in}} Mono Basin, Mono County, California, {{completed}} {{during the summer}} of 1957 revealed a large, roughly triangular block that had subsided about 18, 000 ± 5000 feet and received an accumulation of about 300 ± 100 cubic miles of light clastic sediments and volcanic material of Cenozoic age. The seemingly near-vertical faults that bound this great block are displaced {{toward the center of the}} basin from the surrounding mountain masses, but in general they are parallel to well-defined Basin and Range trends. The gravity minimum anomaly associated with the Mono Basin structure has a residual gravity relief of about 50 mgals, and the lowest gravity readings (on Paoha Island) yield a complete Bouguer gravity value of about — 260 mgals with respect to the International Ellipsoid. The computed depth of subsidence is based on a density of 2. 3 gms/cm^ 3 for the basin fill and 2. 7 gms/cm^ 3 for the basement rocks. Seismic-refraction profiles at several places in the basin demonstrate that the Cenozoic deposits are thick where the gravity is low and relatively thin where the gravity is higher. Along common seismic and gravity profiles steep seismic dips coincide with steep gravity gradients. Numerous seismic reflections are present within the basin fill. Anomalies on four aeromagnetic profiles are related in part to volcanic material within the Cenozoic section. It is concluded that Mono Basin may be a <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> caused by subsidence along faults, following extrusion of magma from a magma chamber at depth. Volcanic rocks of Pliocene(?) and Pleistocene ages are exceptionally abundant in this area...|$|E
40|$|The Pauzhetka {{hydrothermal}} {{system is}} located in a <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> near active volcanic centers. Temperatures at depths of 300 - 800 m are 180 - 210 C. The natural discharge of the hydrothermal system includes the discharge of the Pauzhetka springs and a concealed discharge in the bed of the Pauzhetka River (95 kg/s) and the steam discharge in the Kambalny Ridge (15 kg/s). Only the upper part of geothermal reservoir was penetrated by drillholes (up to 1200 m), therefore they have used a mathematical modeling to assess the conditions of water and heat feeding of the hydrothermal system. The hydrothermal system belongs to a linear fracturing zone of NW trend, therefore the two-dimensional model was used in the calculations. It has been defined that (1) the source of heating is a magma chamber located at a shallow depth; (2) the heat and mass transfer in the geothermal reservoir is defined by free and forced hydraulic convection, (3) the conductivity coefficient of a linear fracturing zone is 400 - 600 m{sup 2 }/day, its width is 2 km and length is 10 km, and (4) the water feeding is defined by infiltration in the recharge area. Calculations of temperature and velocity fields agree with real data obtained in the Pauzhtka geothermal area, therefore they may be a base for assessment of water and heat feeding of the hydrothermal system. In accordance with these assessments, the main part of water resources is derived from infiltration. Heat feeding may be maintained by cooling of the magma chamber with a volume of 18 km{sup 3 } that is in accordance with the volume of Holocene igneous rocks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe morpho-structural {{evolution}} of oceanic islands results from competition between volcano growth and partial destruction by mass-wasting processes. We present here a multi-disciplinary {{study of the}} successive stages of development of Faial (Azores) during the last 1 Myr. Using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), and new K/Ar, tectonic, and magnetic data, we reconstruct the rapidly evolving topography at successive stages, in response to complex interactions between volcanic construction and mass wasting, including {{the development of a}} graben. We show that: (1) sub-aerial {{evolution of}} the island first involved the rapid growth of a large elongated volcano at ca. 0. 85 Ma, followed by its partial destruction over half a million years; (2) beginning about 360 ka a new small edifice grew on the NE of the island, and was subsequently cut by normal faults responsible for initiation of the graben; (3) after an apparent pause of ca. 250 kyr, the large Central Volcano (CV) developed on the western side of the island at ca 120 ka, accumulating a thick pile of lava flows in less than 20 kyr, which were partly channelized within the graben; (4) the period between 120 ka and 40 ka is marked by widespread deformation at the island scale, including westward propagation of faulting and associated erosion of the graben walls, which produced sedimentary deposits; subsequent growth of the CV at 40 ka was then constrained within the graben, with lava flowing onto the sediments up to the eastern shore; (5) the island evolution during the Holocene involves basaltic volcanic activity along the main southern faults and pyroclastic eruptions associated with the formation of a caldera <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression.</b> We conclude that the whole evolution of Faial Island has been characterized by successive short volcanic pulses probably controlled by brief episodes of regional deformation. Each pulse has been separated by considerable periods of volcanic inactivity during which the Faial graben gradually developed. We propose that the volume loss associated with sudden magma extraction from a shallow reservoir in different episodes triggered incremental downward graben movement, as observed historically, when immediate vertical collapse of up to 2 m was observed along the western segments of the graben {{at the end of the}} Capelinhos eruptive crises (1957 - 58) ...|$|E
40|$|The Cordon Caulle {{geothermal}} region (40. 5 degrees S) is a 13 km X 6 kin, NW-SE elongate, <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> hosting numerous monogenetic volcanic centers, fumaroles, and hot-springs, most {{of which}} occur spatially associated with {{the edges of the}} depression. Volcanism started at approximately 0. 3 Ma, with dominantly mafic effusions, and expressed ultimately in post-glacial and historic dacite-rhyolite eruptions (1921 - 1922 and 1960). Three NE-trending gravimetric profiles were carried out across the depression of Cordon Caulle, yielding a residual negative anomaly with the greatest amplitude (- 20 mGal) {{at the center of the}} depression. A 2 D-gravity model given by a 490 m thick shallow body with a density contrast=- 650 kg/m(3), interpreted as a shallow package of dacite-rhyolite lavas and tephra, was found to match the residual anomaly. A dense rock equivalent volume of felsic material on the order of 28 km(3) (25 % of the total output of Cordon Caulle) is derived from this thickness. Previous workers explain the origin of felsic rocks at Cordon Caulle in terms of the orientation of the borders of Cordon Caulle relative to the maximum stress direction sigma(1) (i. e. NE-trending) prevailing during the Quaternary, according to which NW-trending domains were compressional, favoring stagnation, storage and differentiation of magmas. The dominantly monogenetic style of volcanism, the plateau-like morphology and the negative Bouguer anomaly, on the contrary, are interpreted as an indication of extensional tectonics. Intra-arc extension is proposed to be related to coseismic or postseismic stress relaxation accompanying major thrust events, such as the great 1960 Chilean earthquake, which is consistent, at Cordon Caulle, with the direction of propagation of dikes of the 1960 eruption (i. e. coseismic extension) and present-day subsidence inferred from InSAR data (i. e. postseismic extension). Prior to the Quaternary (8. 2 - 1. 6 Ma), nearly east-west compression prevailed at the intra-arc zone. A 5. 44 +/- 0. 04 Ma old granodiorite intrusion bracketed by two sub-parallel branches of the regional, margin-parallel Liquine-Ofqui Fault Zone (LOFZ) in a prominent pop-up structure, 15 km to the east of Cordon Caulle, accounts for reverse reactivation of the LOFZ and rapid fault-related exhumation of basement rocks (> I mm/year). We argue that under compression, reverse reactivation of the LOFZ was facilitated by the combined effect of cyclic increase in fluid pressure induced by magmatic-hydrothermal input, and removal of lithostatic load induced by glacial erosion (> 1. 5 mm/year in the vicinity of Cordon Caulle) ...|$|E

Previous workers explain the origin of felsic rocks at Cordón Caulle in terms of the orientation of the borders of Cordón Caulle relative to the maximum stress direction ? 1 (i. e. NE-trending) prevailing during the Quaternary, according to which NW-trending domains were compressional, favoring stagnation, storage and differentiation of magmas. The dominantly monogenetic style of volcanism, the plateau-like morphology and the negative Bouguer anomaly, on the contrary, are interpreted as an indication of extensional tectonics. Intra-arc extension is proposed to be related to coseismic or postseismic stress relaxation accompanying major thrust events, such as the great 1960 Chilean earthquake, which is consistent, at Cordón Caulle, with the direction of propagation of dikes of the 1960 eruption (i. e. coseismic extension) and present-day subsidence inferred from InSAR data (i. e. postseismic extension). Prior to the Quaternary (8. 2 1. 6 Ma), nearly east-west compression prevailed at the intra-arc zone. A 5. 44 ± 0. 04 Ma old granodiorite intrusion bracketed by two sub-parallel branches of the regional, margin-parallel Liquiñe Ofqui Fault Zone (LOFZ) in a prominent pop-up structure, 15 km to the east of Cordón Caulle, accounts for reverse reactivation of the LOFZ and rapid fault-related exhumation of basement rocks (> 1 mm/year). We argue that under compression, reverse reactivation of the LOFZ was facilitated by the combined effect of cyclic increase in fluid pressure induced by magmatic hydrothermal input, and removal of lithostatic load induced by glacial erosion (> 1. 5 mm/year in the vicinity of Cordón Caulle) ...|$|E

40|$|Hudson Volcano (45 ° 54 ′S, 72 ° 58 ′W) {{represents}} the southernmost central volcano of the South Andean Volcanic Zone (SVZ). It lies about 280 km east of Nazca–Antarctic–South American Plate Triple Junction, where the Chile spreading ridge enters the Chile Trench. Hudson {{is located on}} the border of a volcanic gap separating the Southern from the Austral Volcanic Zone (AVZ), which is commonly interpreted as linked to a slab window. The volcano is characterised by a <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> about 10 km wide, set in a morphological high of the Patagonian Batholith. The scarce pre-caldera products are made up of mafic lavas interbedded with hyaloclastite. The majority of the volcanic products out from the caldera rims consist of thick deposits of lahars or hyaloclastitic breccias, subordinate lava flows and pyroclastic deposits linked to historical large explosive eruptions. Rough volume calculations on pre-caldera and post-caldera products suggest that the caldera formed in steps in the lifetime of the volcano and that it is mainly linked to a volcano-tectonic collapse during partial emptying of the magma chamber. The monogenetic cones surrounding Hudson (Río Ibanez and Murta) erupted primitive basalts that gave important clues on magma sources. The volcanic products of Hudson, with composition ranging from basalts to dacites, have a calc-alkaline signature. Nevertheless, they have distinctly higher K 2 O, TiO 2, Na 2 O, LILE, HFSE and REE than the calc-alkaline rocks of SVZ. The basaltic lavas from the monogenetic cones show La/Nb, Ba/Nb and Th/Ta significantly lower than the calc-alkaline lavas. Furthermore, they have some ratios as Th/Yb and La/Yb remarkably low, with values approaching those of MORB-like basalts. All the geochemical characteristics of Río Ibanez and Murta cones are very {{similar to those of the}} basalts dredged in the Chile Ridge. Geochemical modeling suggests that the Hudson basalts may derive from the basalts erupted at the Río Ibanez centre through an assimilation plus fractional crystallisation process. On the basis of these data, we propose a geodynamical model. In correspondence to the monogenetic centres, close to the border of the incipient opening of the slab window, the magma features are still those of the depleted asthenosphere under the subducting ridge. In this zone, remnant fragments of subducted oceanic crust undergo partial melting processes, while the mantle wedge is deeply modified by subduction-related components. In correspondence to Hudson and the nearby monogenetic centres, the MORB-type primary source component is modified by altered oceanic crust and variably mixed with andesitic magmas having a calc-alkaline signature. A contribution from partial melting of the continental lithosphere may be present in the complex source mixing process at the border of the slab window...|$|E

40|$|Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex {{is located}} in Catamarca Province in the {{southern}} limit of Andean plateau. It corresponds {{to a system of}} nested calderas, with associated domes and pyroclastic deposits. All erupted products are rhyolitic/rhyodacitic in composition and constitute the youngest (Middle Pleistocene-Holocene) collapse calderas system in the Southern Central Andes based on the available radiometric ages. The Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex hosts an active, small geothermal field and is subsiding with an average velocity of 0. 87 cm/year. Despite the existence of numerous studies on regional volcanism of the southern edge of the Andean plateau, the stratigraphy of most of eruptive centers in the region is poorly understood. This study presents a new stratigraphic scheme for the Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex using a combination of lithostratigraphic units and Unconformity Bounded Stratigraphic Units, plus the application of volcanic activity units and lithosome concept. The results allowed to reconstruct the Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex evolution in three main eruptive epochs that constitute an eruptive period: i) the Cortaderas eruptive epoch (Middle Pleistocene) is represented by the homonymous synthem and characterized by explosive boiling over eruptions with the generation of huge volumes of pyroclastic density currents (Barranca Blanca and Carachi ignimbrites). The source of these eruptions remains unknown. ii) The Campo de la Piedra Pómez eruptive epoch (Upper Pleistocene), represented by the homonymous synthem and formed by at least one boiling over, explosive eruption. This eruption had two main eruptive phases represented by synthems UI and UII and was characterized by the generation of huge volumes of pyroclastic density currents (Ignimbrita Campo de la Piedra Pómez). A preliminary model is proposed in which the Campo de la Piedra Pómez eruptive epoch is associated with a <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression.</b> iii) The Cerro Blanco eruptive epoch (Holocene), represented by the homonymous synthem which includes the pre-, syn-and post-Cerro Blanco Caldera collapse (subsynthems CB 1, CB 2 and CB 3 respectively). The pre-caldera activity was effusive and is indirectly represented by block and ash flow deposits. The syn-caldera activity was explosive with a plinian/subplinian eruptive style with simultaneous pyroclastic density currents generation, represented by Cerro Blanco Ignimbrite and associated pyroclastic fall deposits. The post-caldera activity was effusive/explosive and is represented by post-caldera domes and associated block and ash and vulcanian fall deposits. The results indicate that over the past 100000 years the Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex had at least two large-scale eruptions (Volcanic Explosivity Index ≥ 6). Particularly, the caldera-forming Cerro Blanco eruption constitutes one of the greatest Holocene volcanic events in the Central Andes. Finally, the results presented in this study could contribute to the evaluation of the potential hazard associated with a possible renewal of explosive activity at Cerro Blanco Volcanic Complex...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{relationships}} between metamorphic basement and Permo-Mesozoic cover, {{in the central}} sector of the Orobic Alps, facilitate the individuation of Alpine and pre-Alpine tectonic histories. Geometries, belonging to different phases of deformation, referable to Alpine and pre-Alpine tectonic evolution of {{this portion of the}} Southalpine belt, are synthesized on a structural map at 1 : 25. 000 scale, covering about 170 square kilometres. This map is located nearby the Orobic lineament which represents the major tectonic discontinuity between the Variscan metamorphic basement, outcropping mainly in the northern sector of the belt, and the Permian sedimentary cover, well exposed in the southern sector. The pre-Alpine tectonic history is polyphase as testified by the occurrence of superposed groups of structures associated with an amphibolite to later greenschist facies metamorphism, followed by post-metamorphic and syn-sedimentary tectonics responsible for the opening of Permian basins. The more ancient tectonic imprints are therefore preserved exclusively in the metamorphic basement that is composed mainly of gneisses and micaschists in which quartzites, minor metagranitoids, metabasics and marbles are interlayered. Two generations (D 1, D 2) of pre-Alpine syn-metamorphic structures coherently deform all these rocks: i) the D 1 folds are small scale rootless folds, with a differentiated axial plane crenulation cleavage and associated with a metamorphic imprint under amphibolite facies conditions, as testified by the occurrence, in the matapelites, of the assemblage: garnet + biotite + muscovite +kyanite+ staurolite + plagioclase + quartz + ilmenite and relict rutile; ii) during the D 2 deformation widespread greenschist retrogradation took place. The metamorphic evolution of this basement unit of the Orobic Alps is thermally coherent with a post-thickening uplift, occurring during pre-Permian time. The Upper Paleozoic sedimentary sequence unconformably overlies the Variscan basement and the oldest sediments belong to Late Carboniferous-Early Permian "Basal Conglomerate" Fm. The Basal Conglomerate is a southwards thinning sedimentary wedge consisting of red-quartz-pebble conglomerate, sandstone and minor siltstones deposited in a braided alluvial plain setting. Both Basal Conglomerate facies and sediments distribution were influenced by rejuvenation of pre-existing basement shear zones. The Basal Conclomerate is conformably overlain by the Early Permian "Collio" Fm, which is here divided in two members. The lower one (acid volcanics and minor andesites interbedded with sediments) was deposited both within and out of a large <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> (cauldron) during two major periods of volcanic activity. U-Pb age determinations on zircon confirm the Early Permian age of the first cycle. The upper member (conglomerates, sandstones, black shales, minor evaporites and volcanics) disconformably lies on the lower one. It was deposited in a half-graben which hosted a large variety of sedimentary environments (alluvial fans, braided river alluvial plains and saline lakes). The upper Collio basin was bounded to the north by steep, fault-controlled escarpments which originated along older basement mylonite-bearing fractures in response to regional strike-slip transtensional tectonics. Towards the end of Early Permian a deformation phase, possibly transpressional, which caused gentle folding, faulting, uplift and erosion occurred. In Late Permian the investigated area became once again an important continental depositional site and fluviatile conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones of the "Verrucano Lombardo" Fm were unconformably laid on the Collio Fm. Continental conditions continued until Early Triassic. Both basement and cover were affected by two Alpine deformation phases (D 3, D 4). The first one is responsible for the setting of an Alpine system of southverging folds and stacked thrust sheets. D 3 is characterized by a regional chevron fold system in the basement rocks (without a differentiated axial plane foliation), while in the cover it is associated with a pervasive pressure-solution cleavage. Moreover these structures are related to the development of cataclastic bands. D 4 structures are discontinuous and revealed by a gentle waving of the pre-existing fabric. The occurrence of andesitic dykes crosscutting D 3 structures indicates that the earliest phase of Alpine thrusting predated the Tertiary magmatism; eo-Alpine age of convergent tectonics is demonstrated by the Cretaceous (ca. 100 Ma) radiometric age of Uranium remobilization along the Alpine thrusts...|$|E
40|$|The Cerro Galán caldera, {{located in}} northwestern Argentina in the Central Andean Volcanic Zone of the Andean {{continental}} margin volcanic arc of South America, {{is often cited}} {{as an example of}} one of the largest caldera-forming “super eruptions” on Earth. No super-eruptions have been witnessed in human history; little is known concerning their frequency, eruption mechanisms and emplacement processes of erupted material. This thesis uses new geochemical and petrological techniques combined with mapping and stratigraphy to shed new light into these relatively unknown features of Cerro Galán and other supervolcanic eruptions. The Cerro Galán volcanic system has erupted at least nine crystal-rich ignimbrites from ~ 6 to 2 Ma. Starting with the earliest eruption, these consist of the Blanco Ignimbrite (date unknown; volume ~ 10 km 3), the Merihuaca Formation Ignimbrites, consisting of the Lower, Middle and Upper Members (~ 5. 1 to 4. 9 Ma; total volume ~ 65 km 3), the Pitas Ignimbrite (~ 4. 8 Ma; 190 km 3), the Real Grande Ignimbrite (~ 4. 7 Ma; 390 km 3) and the Vega Ignimbrite (~ 4. 5 Ma; volume unknown). Together, these ignimbrites are known as the Toconquis Group and were exclusively deposited from the south-west {{to the north of the}} modern caldera. There was then a hiatus in ignimbrite eruptions until the Cueva Negra Ignimbrite (~ 3. 8 Ma; 50 km 3) was deposited to the east of the caldera, followed by the climactic eruption of the Cerro Galán Ignimbrite (CGI; ~ 2. 1 Ma; 630 km 3) which is found radially around the caldera. The eruption of the CGI facilitated a caldera collapse event, producing the modern <b>volcano-tectonic</b> <b>depression</b> preserved today. Collapse occurred via a piecemeal trapdoor process with the hinge located along the eastern margins of the caldera. Post-CGI resurgence uplifted the central portion of intracaldera fill to produce a resurgent dome; this period also witnessed small-volume pyroclastic surges and ignimbrite eruptions (< 2 Ma) with associated domes and block-and-ash flows close to the structural margins of the caldera. The climactic CGI is found 40 km in all directions from the structural margins, with a maximum distal extent of 79 km (to the north). Based on detailed mapping and field observations, the currently-preserved areal extent of the CGI is estiamted to be ~ 2400 km 2. Magma volumes increase with subsequent eruptions in the Galán volcanic system, perhaps reflecting the thermomechanical evolution of the upper crust in response to increased volumes of magma ‘priming’ the crust for formation of large batholith-sized magma chambers. By applying a number of analytical techniques across the spectrum of spatial scales in juvenile components, this thesis has shown that the Cerro Galán volcanic system has repeatedly erupted magmas with nearly identical geochemistries over an almost 4 Myr time period. All ignimbrites are calc-alkaline, high-K rhyodacitic in composition (68 - 71 wt. % SiO 2). The mineralogy is broadly constant throughout the sequence with plagioclase, quartz, biotite, Fe-Ti oxides, apatite and titanite. Early ignimbrite magmas also contained amphibole, while the CGI erupted a magma that contained rare amphibole, but significant sanidine. Each major ignimbrite contains two main juvenile clast types; dominant ‘white’ pumice and ubiquitous but subordinate ‘grey’ pumice. The ignimbrites also contain rare dense, crystal-rich juvenile clasts. Fe-Ti oxide and amphibole-plagioclase thermometry coupled with amphibole barometry reveal the grey pumice originated from potentially hotter and deeper magmas (800 - 840 °C, 3 - 5 kbar) than the more voluminous white pumice (770 - 810 °C, 1. 5 - 2. 5 kbar). The grey pumice is interpreted to represent the parental magmas to the Galán system emplaced into the upper crust from a deeper storage zone. Crystal-rich juvenile clasts are thought to represent crystal cumulate or developing crystal-mush portions of the magma chambers. Most inter-ignimbrite variations can be accounted for by differences in modal mineralogy and crystal contents that vary from 40 to 55 volume % on a vesicle-free basis. This is supported by geochemical modelling showing subtle bulk-rock variations in Ta, Y, Nb, Dy and Yb between the Galán Ignimbrites can be reconciled with small differences in amounts of crystal fractionation from the ‘grey’ parental magma. The amount of fractionation is inversely correlated with volume; the largest volume CGI and Real Grande Ignimbrites return higher F values (amount of liquid remaining) than the older, smaller volume Toconquis Ignimbrites, implying less crystal fractionation took place during their upper-crustal evolution. This relationship is attributed to variations in magma chamber geometry; the largest volume ignimbrites came from flat slab-like magma chambers, reducing the relative proportion of chamber margin crystallisation and fractionation compared to the smaller volume ignimbrite eruptions. The grey pumices are physical evidence of silicic recharge throughout the history of the Cerro Galán system, and recharge days prior to eruption has previously been suggested based on reversely-zoned (OH and Cl) apatite phenocrysts. A rare population of plagioclase phenocrysts with thin anorthite (An) -rich rims in many juvenile clasts in the older ignimbrites support the importance of recharge in the evolution and potential triggering of eruptions. At Cerro Galán, upper crustal magma chambers serve only to modify the geochemistry of the magmas. A geochemical ‘buffer’ zone is hypothesised to exist between mantle magma input and magma evolution in upper crustal chambers, which imparts the underlying geochemical and isotopic signatures. This produces the same parental magmas that are delivered repeatedly to the upper crust. A lower-crustal MASH (Melting, Assimilation, Storage and Homogenisation) zone is proposed to act as this buffer zone. New oxygen isotope values generated from quartz crystals in ignimbrites from the Central Andes yield high δ 18 O(Quartz) values (+ 8. 1 to + 9. 6 ‰) with little variation throughout the lifetime of individual volcanic systems. Rhyodacitic ignimbrites from the Cerro Galán system yield the highest δ 18 O(Quartz) values (+ 8. 8 to + 9. 6 ‰). The most primitive basaltic andesite lavas from the Galán system possess elevated δ 18 O(bulk rock) values (+ 8. 2 to + 8. 5 ‰). Geochemical modelling shows that the elevated δ 18 O common to all magmas produced in the Galán system since ~ 6 Ma can be produced by progressively contaminating mantle magmas with crustal melts. The δ 18 O and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of the Galán Ignimbrites require ~ 40 % assimilation of crustal material. Geochemical signatures of ignimbrites from the Cerro Galán magmatic system are compared to those in the nearby Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC). These two regions have erupted large-volume crystal-rich ignimbrites with very similar stable and radiogenic isotopic compositions, indicating common magma generation and evolution processes underpinning these two regions. Ignimbrites from this Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) are then compared to large-volume ignimbrites from the western US. Ignimbrites from the western US yield lower δ 18 O(Quartz) values (+ 6. 4 to + 8. 4 ‰). These differences are controlled by a combination of factors including; 1) the thicker and more thermomechanically mature crust in the Central Andes, favouring increased crustal melting and assimilation, 2) the high crystallinities and long residence periods of these CVZ ignimbrites in the upper crust, and 3) the higher elevation, aridity and evaporation rates in the CVZ region compared to the western US. 238 U/ 206 Pb ages obtained from SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analyses of zircon crystals in ignimbrites from the Cerro Galán system show evidence for complex magma dynamics and crystallisation histories. The dominant zircon population in each ignimbrite consists of phenocrysts that are shown to have crystallised up to 500 kyr prior to eruption, supporting the long residence times of crystal ‘mushes’ in the upper crust that give rise to crystal-rich ignimbrites such as those observed at Cerro Galán. Many ignimbrites also contain zircon antecrysts that yield ages corresponding to their growth from the preceding ignimbrite magma in the Galán stratigraphy. These crystals provide evidence for the recycling of non-erupted material from older ignimbrite eruptions. Finally, rare zircon xenocrysts (~ 540 to 500 Ma) with ages predating the initiation of the modern Galán system are also observed in the ignimbrites. These are inferred to be derived from local basement outcrops comprising the regional upper crust into which the Galán magmas were repeatedly intruded and stored. These zircon crystals in the Galán Ignimbrites help to explain many features common to other large ‘monotonous’ ignimbrites including their high crystallinities, lack of geochemical variations and isotopic signatures including high O, Sr and Pb isotopic ratios and low Nd isotopic ratios. This study has redefined the eruptive stratigraphy of the Cerro Galán ignimbrites along with producing a new geologic map of the region and better constrained, more realistic volume estimates. The factors that act to reduce the original volumes of erupted material to that which is preserved today are discussed in more quantitative ways than are often applied to these large volume systems. It has also extended the notion that large volumes of nearly identical silicic magmas can be repeatedly generated, producing continued geochemical homogeneity from a long-lived magma source in a subduction zone volcanic setting. The magmas produced in the Galán system share a general chemical familiarity with other large-volume magmas produced in the Central Andean region, suggesting the same large-scale regional magmatic system was operating beneath the Central Andes from 10 to 2 Ma. The origin of homogeneity in these large-volume silicic systems is an ongoing debate and this thesis proposes the main geochemical signatures are imparted on magmas in a lower crustal MASH zone after which they are repeatedly delivered to upper crustal chambers where crustal assimilation and fractional crystallisation serve only to slightly modify their compositions. Finally, although the Galán Ignimbrites and those from other similar systems erupting ‘monotonous intermediates’ are geochemically homogeneous on the hand-specimen scale, this study has emphasised the importance in using micro-analytical techniques to reveal subtle chemical variations on the scale of individual minerals. Minor and trace elements as well as stable and radiogenic isotopic variations are observed in a variety of minerals revealing complex crystallisation histories and magma evolution and crustal interaction processes...|$|E
