Methods: A six-week training intervention was performed including 26 healthy males (26 years, SD= 4). Two groups were analyzed in a parallel design performing either resistive exercise (RE, n= 13) or resistive vibration exercise (RVE, n= 13) training with weekly increasing vibration frequencies (20 - 40 Hz). Resting and exercising blood pressure and heart rate were measured {{before and after the}} 6 -week intervention. Results: Both training interventions decreased resting systolic blood pressure (P= 0. 003). Resting diastolic blood pressure was significantly decreased only in the RVE group (P= 0. 01).

Based on a critical analysis of existing designs with consideration of their flaws, {{the development of new}} technological designs of taps is tasked with ensuring stable operation when handling hard materials. Methods. It is noteworthy that one of the main <b>vibration</b> <b>resistance</b> improvement methods of the tool is to reduce the contact area of the tool with the work piece in the cutting zone. Methods are proposed for improving the <b>vibration</b> <b>resistance</b> of taps, considering the correlation adjustment of tap teeth in order to completely eliminate friction at the sides of the thread cutting surface and uneven implementation flute cutting steps. Results. The idea of increasing <b>vibration</b> <b>resistance</b> has seen the new development of vibration-proof tap designs, heralded as innovations due to the accuracy of thread cutting and durability achieved by reducing the thread contact area with the work piece in the cutting zone.
