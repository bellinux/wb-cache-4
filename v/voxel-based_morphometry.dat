25|$|Both the {{registered}} images and the deformation fields generated upon registration {{can be used}} for morphometric analyses, thereby providing the basis for <b>Voxel-Based</b> <b>Morphometry</b> (VBM) and Deformation-Based Morphometry (DBM).

25|$|Adults who stutter have {{anatomical}} {{differences in}} gyri within the perisylvian frontotemporal areas. A {{large amount of}} white matter {{is found in the}} right hemisphere of the brain, including the region of the superior temporal gyrus. This was discovered using <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (VBM). On the other hand, lesser amounts of white matter are found in the left inferior arcuate fasciculus connecting the temporal and frontal areas in stuttering adults.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (VBM) is {{a method}} that allows one to measure brain tissue {{composition}} differences between subjects. To do so, one must first register all images to a standard coordinate system, by mapping them to a reference image. This is done by use of an affine transformation that minimizes the sum-of-squares intensity difference between the experimental image and the reference. Once this is done, the proportion of grey or white matter in a voxel can be determined by intensity. This allows one to compare the tissue composition of corresponding brain regions between different subjects.|$|E
25|$|Cortical {{thickness}} {{and reduced}} white matter – {{in a recent}} study, <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry,</b> an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right inferior frontal gyrus of amusic individuals as compared to controls. Lack of extensive exposure to music could be a contributing factor to this white matter reduction. For example, amusic individuals may be less inclined {{to listen to music}} than others, which could ultimately cause reduced myelination of connections to the frontal areas of the brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of amusia requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies. A behavioral failure on {{this test is}} diagnostic because there is typically no overlap between the distributions of the scores of amusics and controls. Such scores are generally obtained through the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), which involves {{a series of tests}} that evaluate the use of musical characteristics known to contribute to the memory and perception of conventional music. The battery comprises six subtests which assess the ability to discriminate pitch contour, musical scales, pitch intervals, rhythm, meter, and memory. An individual is considered amusic if he/she performs two standard deviations below the mean obtained by musically-competent controls. This musical pitch disorder represents a phenotype that serves to identify the associated neuro-genetic factors. Both MRI-based brain structural analyses and electroencephalography (EEG) are common methods employed to uncover brain anomalies associated with amusia (See Neuroanatomy). Additionally, <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (VBM) is used to detect anatomical differences between the MRIs of amusic brains and musically intact brains, specifically with respect increased and/or decreased amounts of white and grey matter.|$|E
2500|$|Topographical Disorientation in Mild Cognitive Impairment: A <b>Voxel-Based</b> <b>Morphometry</b> Study {{was done}} to see if Topographical Disorientation {{had an effect on}} {{individuals}} who had mild cognitive impairment.

2500|$|... (TD) was {{assessed}} clinically in all participants. Neurological and neuropsychological evaluations {{were determined by}} a magnetic imaging scan which was performed on each participant. <b>Voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> {{was used to compare}} patterns of gray-matter atrophy between patients with and without TD, and a group of normal controls. The outcome of the experiment was that they found TD in 17 out of the 41 MCI patients (41.4%). The functional abilities were significantly impaired in MCI patients with TD compared to in MCI patients without TD and that the presence of TD in MCI patients is associated with loss of gray matter in the medial temporal regions, including the hippocampus.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the usually slice-based histology of the brain, neuroimaging data are generally stored as matrices of voxels. The most popular morphometric method, thus, is known as <b>Voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (VBM; cf. [...] ). Yet as an imaging voxel is not a biologically meaningful unit, other approaches have been developed that potentially bear a closer correspondence to biological structures: Deformation-based morphometry (DBM), surface-based morphometry (SBM) and fiber tracking based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DTI or DSI). All four are usually performed based on Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data, with the former three commonly using T1-weighted (e.g. Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo, MP-RAGE) and sometimes T2-weighted pulse sequences, while DTI/DSI use diffusion-weighted ones. However, recent evaluation of morphometry algorithms/software demonstrates inconsistency among several of them. This renders a need for systematic and quantitative validation and evaluation of the field.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{the focus}} on {{comparison}} of shapes and forms with a metric structure based on diffeomorphisms, and {{is central to the}} field of computational anatomy. Diffeomorphic registration, introduced in the 90's, is now an important player that uses computational procedures for constructing correspondences between coordinate systems based on sparse features and dense images, such as ANTS, DARTEL, DEMONS, LDDMM, or StationaryLDDMM. <b>Voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (VBM) is an important method built on many of these principles. Methods based on diffeomorphic flows are used in For example, deformations could be diffeomorphisms of the ambient space, resulting in the LDDMM (Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping) framework for shape comparison. One such deformation is the right invariant metric of computational anatomy which generalizes the metric of non-compressible Eulerian flows to include the Sobolev norm, ensuring smoothness of the flows. [...] Metrics have also been defined that are associated to Hamiltonian controls of diffeomorphic flows.|$|E
2500|$|Advances in MRI {{technology}} {{have provided the}} ability to see the brain structure in great detail in an easy, non-invasive manner in vivo. Bartzokis et al., has noted that there is a decrease in grey matter volume between adulthood and old age, whereas white matter volume was found to increase from age 19-40, and decline after this age. Studies using <b>Voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> have identified areas such as the insula and superior parietal gyri as being especially vulnerable to age-related losses in grey matter of older adults. Sowell et al., reported that the first 6 decades of an individual's life were correlated with the most rapid decreases in grey matter density, and this occurred over dorsal, frontal, and parietal lobes on both interhemispheric and lateral brain surfaces. It is also worth noting that areas such as the cingulate gyrus, and occipital cortex surrounding the calcarine sulcus appear exempt from this decrease in grey matter density over time. [...] Age effects on grey matter density in the posterior temporal cortex appear more predominantly in the left versus right hemisphere, and were confined to posterior language cortices. Certain language functions such as word retrieval and production were found to be located to more anterior language cortices, and deteriorate as a function of age. Sowell et al., also reported that these anterior language cortices were found to mature and decline earlier than the more posterior language cortices. It has also been found that the width of sulcus not only increases with age, but also with cognitive decline in the elderly.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Behavioral and Brain Sciences {{published}} a target article that {{put forth a}} biological model of intelligence based on 37 peer-reviewed neuroimaging studies (Jung & Haier, 2007). Their review of a wealth of data from functional imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography) and structural imaging (diffusion MRI, <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry,</b> in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy) argues that human intelligence arises from a distributed and integrated neural network comprising brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes.|$|E
50|$|In {{later stages}} of FTLD, the {{clinical}} phenotypes may overlap. FTD patients tend {{to struggle with}} binge eating and compulsive behaviors. These binge eating habits are often associated with abnormal eating behavior including overeating, stuffing oneself with food, changes in food preferences (cravings for more sweets, carbohydrates), eating inedible objects and snatching food from others. Recent findings have indicated that the neural structures responsible for eating changes in FTD include atrophy in the right ventral insula, striatum and orbitofrontal cortex on structural MRI <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (right hemisphere).|$|E
50|$|In the Group Analysis, the {{objective}} is to detect and quantize abnormalities induced by a disease by comparing the images of two or more cohorts. Usually one of these cohorts consist of normal (control) subjects, and the other one consists of abnormal patients. Variation caused by the disease can manifest itself as abnormal deformation of anatomy (see <b>Voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry).</b> For example, shrinkage of sub-cortical tissues such as the Hippocampus in brain may be linked to Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, changes in biochemical (functional) activity can be observed using imaging modalities such as Positron Emission Tomography.|$|E

5000|$|A neuroimaging {{study with}} {{positron}} emission tomography found that the right caudate nucleus had the largest change in glucose metabolism after patients had been treated with paroxetine. [...] Recent SDM meta-analyses of <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> studies comparing people with OCD and healthy controls have found people with OCD to have increased grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular nuclei, extending to the caudate nuclei, while decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri. These findings contrast with those in people with other anxiety disorders, who evince decreased (rather than increased) grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular / caudate nuclei, while also decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate gyri.|$|E
5000|$|Viskontas's {{research}} has explored the neurological basis of memory, reasoning and self-identity, {{and most recently}} she has studied creativity in people with neurodegeneration.

[...] Techniques used in her research include single-unit recording in patients with epilepsy, high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging, eye-movement tracking, <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry,</b> and various behavioral tasks in healthy adults, patients with epilepsy, and patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

50|$|One {{specific}} methodology used {{to study}} grey matter correlates of intelligence {{in areas of the}} brain is known as <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (VBM). VBM allows researchers to specify areas of interest with great spatial resolution, allowing the examination of grey matter areas correlated with intelligence with greater special resolution. VBM has been used to correlate grey matter positively with intelligence in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes in healthy adults. VBM has also been used to show that grey matter volume in the medial region of the prefrontal cortex and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex correlate positively with intelligence in a group of 55 healthy adults. VBM has also been successfully used to establish a positive correlation between grey matter volumes in the anterior cingulate and intelligence in children aged 5 to 18 years old.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{theories}} {{suggest that}} CH attacks {{may be related}} to dysfunction of the hypothalamus, this may explain why cluster headaches frequently occur around the same time each day, and during a particular season. One of the functions of the hypothalamus is regulation of the biological clock. Metabolic abnormalities have also been reported. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate the brain areas which are activated during attack only, compared to pain free periods. These pictures show brain areas which are active during pain in yellow/orange color (called [...] "pain matrix"). The area in the center (in all three views) is specifically activated during CH only. The bottom row <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> (VBM) shows structural brain differences between individuals with and without CH; only a portion of the hypothalamus is different.|$|E
50|$|Another experiment, {{supporting}} delayed-maturation {{theory of}} obsessive compulsive disorder, {{was conducted by}} Rosenberg and Keshavan in 1998. This research used <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> to investigate {{the development of the}} cingulate structure in a group children's brains, ranging 2-7 in age, observed to be OCD. This technique enabled researchers to identify a correlation between age and cingulate volume by comparing a group of control patients to a group of children that have been diagnosed with OCD. Children that do not have OCD were found to demonstrate a correlation between age and cingulate volume growth, whereas, children exhibiting traits of OCD did not display a significant correlation between age and cingulate volume. The Rosenberg and Keshavan experiment concluded that OCD patients do not exhibit a correlation of age and cingulate volume comparable to the control group of patients that did not have OCD.|$|E
50|$|Jung and Haier (2007) {{proposed}} the P-FIT {{in a review}} of 37 neuroimaging studies with a total of 1,557 participants. The review included only neuroimaging techniques with high spatial resolution to examine the structural and functional correlates of intelligence. Across the structural neuroimaging studies (using <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry,</b> magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging), Jung and Haier found that the full scale IQ scores from the Wechsler Intelligence scales correlated with frontal and parietal regions in more than 40% of 11 studies.More than 30% of studies using full-scale IQ as their intelligence measure correlated with left cingulate as well as both left and right frontal regions. However, there were no observed structural correlations between regions in the temporal or occipital lobes with any of the intelligence scales. The authors attribute this contradictory finding to the task-dependency of relationships between intellectual performance and these brain regions.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that this area may {{have a role in}} obsessive-compulsive disorder {{due to the fact that}} what appears to be an unnaturally low level of glutamate activity in this region has been observed in patients with the disorder, in contrast to many other brain regions that are thought to have excessive glutamate activity in OCD. Recent SDM meta-analyses of <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry</b> studies comparing people with OCD and healthy controls has found people with OCD to have increased grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular nuclei, extending to the caudate nuclei, while decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal/anterior cingulate cortex. These findings contrast with those in people with other anxiety disorders, who evince decreased (rather than increased) grey matter volumes in bilateral lenticular / caudate nuclei, while also decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal medial frontal / anterior cingulate gyri.|$|E
50|$|Haier et al. (2009) {{provided}} further neuroimaging {{evidence for}} the P-FIT by investigating the correlation between g and gray matter volume. This was {{in order to see}} whether psychometric g is consistently related to a certain neural substrate, or a neuro-g. The authors argue that previous studies examining the neural correlates of g have mostly used indirect measures of g, render the findings of these studies as inconclusive. The scores of 6292 participants on eight cognitive tests were used to derive g, and a small subset of 40 participants were also scanned using <b>voxel-based</b> <b>morphometry.</b> The evidence indicates that the neural correlates of g depend on part on the type of test used to derive g, despite evidence indicating that g derived from different tests tap onto the same underlying psychometric construct. The authors suggest that this may, in part, explain some {{of the variance in the}} neuroimaging findings reviewed by Jung and Haier (2007).|$|E
