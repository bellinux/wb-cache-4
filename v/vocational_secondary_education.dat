25|$|Expanding and {{improving}} secondary vocational education {{has long been}} an objective of China’s educational reformers, for vocational schools are seen as those which are best placed to address (by providing trained workers) the rising needs of the nation’s expanding economy, especially its manufacturing and industrial sectors. Without an educated and trained work force, China cannot have economic, hence social and national, development. Yet, given a finite, and often quite limited, pot of money for secondary schools, an allocation competition/conflict necessarily exists between its two sub-sectors: general education and vocational/technical education. Regardless, an over-enrollment in the latter has been the overall result of the mid-1980s reforms. Yet firms that must seek workers from this graduate pool have remained unimpressed with the quality of recruits and have had to rely on their own job-training programs that provide re-education for their newly hired workers. The public, also, has not been very enthusiastic over <b>vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> which, unlike general education, does not lead to the possibility of higher education. The public’s perception is that these schools provide little more than a dead end for their children. Also, vocational institutions are more expensive to run than their counterparts in general education, and they have not had sufficient money to modernize their facilities, as China’s modernizing national economy demands. By mid-decade of the 21st Century, therefore, academics and policy-makers alike began to question the policy that pours funds into vocational schools that do not do their intended function.|$|E

40|$|Achievement {{motive is}} human’s social motive. In some sense, one’s all-life {{achievements}} are decided by his/her achievement motive. By {{which we can}} conclude that achievement motive has close connection with individual emotional experience. People pursuing success experience more positive emotion and less negative one, and have good behavioral adaptability. This study aims at explore the relation between achievement motive and behavior problems in the <b>secondary</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools through questionaries (the achievement motivation scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale，State-Trait Anxiety Inventory，Center for Epidemiologic Studies depression Scale and middle school students'behavior questionnaire). There were 1005 students whose age ranged from 14 to 21 years completed the questionnaires. The main conclusions of this thesis are as follows: (1) 	Achievement motive of student in the <b>secondary</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools is significantly {{lower than that of}} students in the senior high school. (2) 	Students in the <b>secondary</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools show more obvious emotion and Externalizing behavior problems than those of the senior high schools. (3) 	Students’ motivation for pursuing success in the <b>secondary</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools has negative correlation with emotion and Externalizing behavior problem, while the motivation for avoiding failure has positive correlation with the emotion and Externalizing behavior problem. Achievement motivation has negative correlation with emotion and Externalizing behavior problem. (4) 	Students’ achievement motivation shows obvious gender difference in the <b>secondary</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools. The avoiding failure element shows upward trend with the grades increasing and the difference is obvious. While the students’ achievement motive in the <b>secondary</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools shows significantly downward trend with the grades increasing. Whether holding a post at school has influence on the students’ achievement motivation, and the difference is significant. (5) 	Students’ Externalizing behavior problem in the <b>secondary</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>education</b> schools shows obvious gender difference. Whether holding a post at school has influence on the students’ Externalizing behavior problem, and depression and loneliness, and the difference is significant. Key words: Students in the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Education</b> Schools, Achievement Motivation, Behavior Problem, Emotion Problem, Externalizing Behavior Problem (Note: In this study, the behavior problems include not only the externalizing behavior problems, but also emotion problems.) 成就动机是人类的一种社会性动机。在一定意义上,一个人一生的成就,是由他的成就动机决定的。成就动机与个体的情绪体验密切相关,希望成功的人能更多地体验积极情绪而较少体验消极情绪,且其行为适应良好。 本研究采用问卷法（成就动机量表、流调中心用抑郁量表、特质焦虑问卷、孤独量表和中学生行为问卷）探讨了我国中职生的成就动机和行为问题的关系，被试为中职生和高中生（包含三个年级），年龄范围 14 － 21 岁，共 1005 人。主要研究结果如下： （ 1 ）	中职生的成就动机显著低于高中生。 （ 2 ）	中职生的情绪问题和外显行为问题显著高于高中生。 （ 3 ）	中职生希望成功的动机与其情绪问题、外显行为问题呈显著负相关；而回避失败的动机与情绪问题、外显行为问题呈显著正相关；成就动机与情绪问题、外显行为问题呈显著负相关。 （ 4 ）	中职生的成就动机存在显著的性别差异；随着年级的升高，回避失败因子呈显著上升趋势，成就动机呈显著下降趋势；担任职务学生的成就动机显著高于不担任职务的学生。 （ 5 ）	中职生的外显行为问题存在显著的性别差异；担任职务学生的外显行为问题、情绪问题中抑郁和孤独得分显著低于不担任职务的学生。 关键词: 中职生 成就动机 行为问题 情绪问题 外显行为问题 （注：本研究中行为问题具体包含，外显行为问题和情绪问题。...|$|R

40|$|The purpose o f {{this short}} {{article is to}} examine {{critically}} the current orthodoxy concerning social rates o f returns to general and <b>vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> in developing countries. Since George Psacharopoulos has been the prime mover in establishing this orthodoxy, we shall focus in particular on the rates o f return (henceforth ROR) evidence that he has brought to bear in support o f the basic proposition that the social profitability o f <b>vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> is generally lower than for general secondary education. In addition, however, the evaluations o f Zymelman and Tilak will also be scrutinised (in chronological order) as well other, generally more recent comparative ROR studies that either were not or {{could not have been}} included in these three evaluations. It must be emphasised at the outset that the main objective o f this paper is to review research that makes explicit comparisons between the costs and benefits o f (specialist) vocational and general secondary education in any one country. There are many other studies o f school-based vocational education in its wide variety o f forms in developing countries which do not, however, attempt to compare in a systematic and rigorous manner the relative social profitability o f general and <b>vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education.</b> Thus, while some o f these studies do derive social and/or private RORs to specialist <b>vocational</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>education</b> (see, for example, Bennell, 1993 (Zimbabwe); Grootaert, 1988 (Cote d'Ivoire); Paul, 1990 (Togo and Cameroon); IBRD, 1990 (Bangladesh)), no equivalent RORs to general secondary education are presented.
