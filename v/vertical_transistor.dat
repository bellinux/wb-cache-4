The aspect ratios of nanopores, which determine the switching performance of the <b>vertical</b> <b>transistor,</b> are greatly enhanced by transferring the nanostructure to the underlying layers. Without pore accumulation, a low leakage current can be achieved. The <b>vertical</b> <b>transistor</b> delivers an ON current of 0. 35 mA/cm 2 and an ON/OFF current ratio of around 3000 at 1. 8 V. The results prove the feasibility to produce low-voltage organic transistors over a large area with potentially low production cost.

Both problems {{are of particular}} importance {{for the success of}} transparent and flexible organic electronics in the future. To begin with, the static behavior in molecular doped organic pin-diodes is investigated. This allows to deduce important diode parameters such as the depletion capacitance, the number of active dopant states, and the breakdown field. Applying this knowledge, organic pin-diodes are designed for ultra-high-frequency applications and a cut-off-frequency of up to 1 GHz can be achieved using optimized parameters for device geometry, layer thickness, and dopant concentration. The second part of this work is devoted to organic thin-film transistors, high resolution patterning techniques, as well as novel <b>vertical</b> <b>transistor</b> concepts. In particular, fluorine based photo-lithography, a high resolution patterning technique compatible to organic semiconductors, is introduced fielding the integration of organic thin-film transistors under ambient conditions. However, as it will be shown, horizontal organic thin-film transistors are substantially limited in their performance by charge carrier injection. Hence, down-scaling is inappropriate to enlarge the transconductance of such transistors.
