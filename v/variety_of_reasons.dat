5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chernâ€“Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
