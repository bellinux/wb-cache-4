5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasons.</b> Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called Chern–Simons theory. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
