5|$|Over 26,000 South Africans {{registered}} {{to participate in}} the national election in the international voting phase, which took place at 116 international voting stations on 30 April 2014. The last international voting station in Los Angeles closed at 6am SAST on 1 May 2014. All international votes were couriered to South Africa, combined into a single <b>voting</b> <b>district</b> and counted on 7 May 2014.|$|E
5|$|On the {{weekends}} of 9–10 November 2013 and 8–9 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for new voters to register {{and for those}} who moved residence to re-register in their new <b>voting</b> <b>district.</b> The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends to register at an IEC office during office hours. Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed to register to vote until the election date is published in a government gazette, after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million new voters. This increased the number of registered voters to 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the new electoral law of Hungary has been to define a fairer {{apportionment}} into <b>voting</b> <b>districts.</b> This is ensured by a set of rules slightly more premissive than those laid out in the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters of the Venice Commission. These rules fix the average size of the <b>voting</b> <b>districts,</b> require <b>voting</b> <b>districts</b> not to split smaller towns and villages and not to cross county borders. We show that such an apportionment is mathematically impossible. We make suggestions both to the theoretical approach to resolve this problem, study the properties of our approach and using our efficient algorithm and the data of the 2010 national elections we determine the optimal apportionment. We also study the expected effect of demographic changes and formulate recommendations to adhere to the rules over the long term: increase the number of <b>voting</b> <b>districts</b> to about 130, allow the number of <b>voting</b> <b>districts</b> to change flexibly at each revision of the districts and base the districts on regions rather than counties...|$|R

25|$|In the referendum, {{voters were}} asked whether the Saar should remain under League of Nations administration, return to Germany or become part of France. To the {{surprise}} of neutral observers as well as (to some extent) the Nazis themselves, over 90% voted in favour of reuniting with Germany. Every <b>voting</b> <b>district</b> saw at least 83% of voters support returning the Saar to German rule. Meanwhile, despite Georges Clemenceau's previous claim that there were 150,000 Frenchmen in the Saar, less than 1% of voters supported the annexation of the Saar by France.|$|E
500|$|On 8 May, it was {{reported}} that dumped ballots from the Lynnwood <b>voting</b> <b>district</b> in Pretoria had been found.

[...] However, DA party agents from the voting station confirmed that the votes had already been counted. Party agent for the DA, Jordan Griffith tweeted, “I was the party agent there, those votes were counted and recorded[...]signed off.
