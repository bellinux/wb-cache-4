5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, octopuses can {{be readily}} trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They {{have been reported to}} practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. The <b>veined</b> octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of tool use.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and <b>veined</b> surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E

25|$|The {{yellow or}} light greenish-brown wood is often finely <b>veined</b> with a darker tint; being {{very hard and}} close-grained, it is valued by woodworkers.|$|E
25|$|Pitchers {{can vary}} from all green plants to lightly and heavily <b>veined</b> examples, as well as clones with heavily {{pigmented}} throats. Traps also take on a pink or red flush as they age.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{fragrant}} and bisexual, surrounded by five unequal, thinly <b>veined,</b> yellowish-white petals. The flowers are about 1.0-1.5cm (1/2") long and 2.0cm (3/4") broad. They grow on slender, hairy stalks in spreading or drooping flower clusters {{which have a}} length of 10–25cm.|$|E
25|$|The Mugga Mugga Porphyry is a lava flow. It is blue or mauve grey in a mass. The rock is <b>veined</b> with calcite, {{light green}} epidote, and deep red hematite. The phenocrysts are quartz, grey plagioclase, pink potash {{feldspar}} in lesser amounts and flakes of biotite. It is dated at 414±9 Mya. The Federal Golf Course Tonalite introduces some veins and saccharoidal galena.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has a structured steel skeleton, brick walls, a flat asphalt-composition roof, and a reinforced concrete basement. The building's volumetric massing is symmetrical and {{derived from the}} neo-classical phase of Beaux-Arts architecture. The exterior includes aluminum, granite, white bronze, and plinth. The lobby is ornamented with <b>veined</b> marble and a terrazzo floor, the workroom has a maple parquet floor, and the postmaster's offices have oak floors.|$|E
25|$|The face is {{wrinkled}} and <b>veined</b> {{with deep}} creases at the forehead {{and under the}} deep-set eyes. The mustache and beard are full, and the beard {{is divided into two}} {{at the center of the}} chin. Around his head is a wreath of oak leaves. Short hair curls from under the wreath and the top of the head is bald. Evidence of abrasions from original carving are visible on the top of the head.|$|E
25|$|Much of Florida {{consists}} of karst limestone <b>veined</b> with water-filled caves and sinkholes, which provide homes to {{many species of}} aquatic life, some unique to particular Florida locations. As urban and suburban development have increased over the last decades, demand for groundwater has also risen, resulting in damage and drying out of portions of the cave system. This has led to ground subsidence as dry caves collapse, threatening property as well as ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The last {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by species that present petals oblique to the column. Two have petals and sepals marked with other colors: Bifrenaria clavigera, {{that has a}} calcar formed by the fusion of the lateral sepals bases, and Bifrenaria silvana where the calcar {{is a result of}} their superposition; Bifrenaria leucorhoda has white flowers with labellum <b>veined</b> of pink color. The two remaining species have highly similar yellow flowers, although of diverse sizes, the smaller and often paler is Bifrenaria stefanae, the larger and of brighter color is Bifrenaria vitellina.|$|E
25|$|At Fulufjället, the {{sandstone}} is <b>veined</b> with diabase. This diabase {{is particularly important}} in the area, since it forms a much richer substrate than sandstone for vegetation. Additionally, it resists erosion better than sandstone and therefore forms prominent structures in the countryside. For example, the peak Brattfjället, highest zone in the park, is situated {{in one of the}} largest diabase zones. The diabase is a little less than 300 million years old, which corresponds to the formation of the Oslo Rift. This suggests that these diabases are connected to that rifting event.|$|E
25|$|In {{laboratory}} studies, octopuses {{can easily}} be trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They reportedly use observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed to play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often escape from their aquarium and sometimes enter others. They have boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. At least four specimens of the <b>veined</b> octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) have been witnessed retrieving discarded coconut shells, manipulating them, and then reassembling them to use as shelter.|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with <b>veined</b> cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{structure}} of dipteran flies {{is illustrated in}} the diagram. Veterinary parasitology also covers arthropods in the Class Acari, the ticks of domestic animals and mites of livestock which have distinctly different structure from arthropods in the Class Insecta. However, flies in the Order Diptera show clear division of the body into head, thorax and abdomen with distinct segmentation of the thorax and abdomen. The thorax contains large blocks of muscle that power the single pair of wings. Digestive and reproductive organs fill the abdomen. Also unique to the Diptera {{is a pair of}} halteres (derived from wings during evolution) that aid agile flight by these flies. Mosquitoes have <b>veined</b> and scaled wings, long legs, long hypodermic mouthparts sheathed in a protective labium (see photograph of Aedes female engorged with blood). Adult females lay eggs in batches on surface of stagnant water. Larvae feed on microorganisms and organic detritus in water. Pupation occurs at the surface of the water. Feeding by females is {{on a wide variety of}} mammals and birds, whilst males feed on plant sugars.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum is}} located in the town centre. It was built between 1937 and 1940 by {{architect}} Patroklos Karantinos on a site previously occupied by the Roman Catholic monastery of Saint-Francis which was destroyed by earthquake in 1856. The museum's antiseismic building is an important example of modernist architecture and was awarded a Bauhaus commendation. Karantinos applied the principles of modern architecture to the specific needs of a museum by providing good lighting from the skylights above and {{along the top of the}} walls, and facilitating the easy flow of large groups of people. He also anticipated future extensions to the museum. The colours and construction materials, such as the <b>veined</b> polychrome marbles, recall certain Minoan wall-paintings which imitate marble revetment. The two-storeyed building has large exhibition spaces, laboratories, a drawing room, a library, offices and a special department, the so-called Scientific Collection, where numerous finds are stored and studied. The museum shop, run by the Archaeological Receipts Fund, sells museum copies, books, postcards and slides. There is also a café.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{medium-sized}} to large deciduous tree, growing to 15–25 m (exceptionally to 38 m) tall, with an elliptical crown of moderate density {{with a smooth}} or rounded outline. The bark is a light gray with thick irregular curling ridges; as the tree matures, the bark tends to become plated. The twigs are slender, somewhat shiny, reddish brown. The terminal buds are sharply pointed, brown and pubescent. The leaves are opposite, simple, palmately lobed and <b>veined,</b> 3–9.5cm long and 3.5–11cm broad, with an entire margin and three or five somewhat rounded lobes, and a 2–8cm long petiole. They are green above and paler and pubescent below. In fall they turn orange and yellow. The flowers are regular, pentamerous, and appear on yellow-green corymbs and are quite small. They hang from puberulent pedicels 2.4–5cm long in clusters of a few flowers, appearing before or with the leaves in early spring. This is about two weeks prior to the maturation of the flowers of Acer saccharum. The tree is generally diecious, though they are often also polygamous, that is having bisexual and unisexual flowers on the same individual. The fruit is a paired samara 1.5–3cm long.|$|E

500|$|It can be {{difficult}} to distinguish T.oreades [...] from T. mongaensis though the leaves of the latter species are more prominently <b>veined,</b> and mostly (but not always) narrower than [...] wide. Telopea oreades flowers around a month earlier than T. mongaensis in areas where both are present.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Adopus aculeatus and <b>veined</b> octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{were found}} to walk on two arms, {{while at the same}} time {{mimicking}} plant matter. This form of locomotion allows these octopuses to move quickly away from a potential predator without being recognised. A study of this behaviour led to the suggestion that the two rearmost appendages may be more accurately termed [...] "legs" [...] rather than [...] "arms". Some species of octopus can crawl out of the water briefly, which they may do between tide pools while hunting crustaceans or gastropods or to escape predators. [...] "Stilt walking" [...] is used by the <b>veined</b> octopus when carrying stacked coconut shells. The octopus carries the shells underneath it with two arms, and progresses with an ungainly gait supported by its remaining arms held rigid.|$|E
500|$|The grey-brown <b>veined</b> {{limestone}} quarried in {{the area}} is known as [...] "Penmon marble". Brachiopod fossils are sometimes found in it. The largest of the Penmon quarries, Dinmor Park, was worked for limestone by Dinmor Quarries Ltd from about 1898 until the 1970s. Penmon limestone (along with limestone from Llanddona, Moelfre and Holyhead) was used to build Birmingham Town Hall and help with the reconstruction of Liverpool and Manchester following the destruction caused by World War II. [...] The stone was also used {{in the construction of}} the Menai Suspension Bridge (completed in 1826) and the Britannia Bridge (completed in 1850).|$|E
500|$|The second trophic phase {{begins with}} the {{development}} of the plasmodium. The multinucleated organism now absorbs via phagocytosis as many nutrients as possible. These are bacteria, protists, dissolved substances, moulds, [...] higher fungi and small particles of organic material. This enables the cell to undergo enormous growth. The nucleus divides multiple times, and the cell soon becomes {{visible to the naked eye}} and usually has a surface areadepending on the speciesup to one square metre; however, in 1987 one artificially cultivated cell of Physarum polycephalum attained a surface area of 5.5sq m. Myxogastria species have numerous nuclei in their trophic plasmodium phase; the small, non-veined proto-plasmodia have between 8 and 100nuclei, while large, <b>veined</b> meshworks have between 100 and 10 million nuclei. All of these remain part of a single cell, which has a viscous, slimy consistency and may be transparent, white or brightly coloured in orange, yellow or pink.|$|E
500|$|Although Leyland was not {{a stylish}} batsman, he was effective. Cardus {{described}} him as [...] "a sturdy cricketer, not tall, but his sloping bottle-neck shoulders seemed to add inches {{to him and he}} had long arms of impressive thickness, <b>veined</b> with strength at the wrist; also he was broad in the beam, with a rubicund smile on his cheerful open countenance." [...] He was a good driver of the ball, with a high backlift, and moved quickly and economically to reach the pitch of the ball. Cardus thought that his style of batting was representative of his character: [...] "He put his nature into every stroke, {{and as soon as he}} had 'got bowling where he wanted it,' he didn't merely hit or drive it—he walloped it." [...] At times, Leyland's desire to score quickly brought about his dismissal. However, when necessary, he defended strongly and used his pads as a second line of defence if he missed the ball with his bat.|$|E
500|$|The {{plasmodium}} {{or parts}} of the fruit bodies can be smaller than one millimetre, in extreme cases they are up to a square metre and weigh up to [...] (Brefeldia maxima). Their shape is often pediculated or unstiped sporangia with non-cellular stems, but can also appear as <b>veined</b> ar netted plasmodiocarps, pincushion-shaped aethaliae or seemingly pincushion-shaped pseudo-aethaliae. The fruit bodies almost always have a hypothallus on the edge. The abundantly produced spores are stored in a reticular or filamentous structure the so-called capillitiumand are found on nearly all species except Liceida and other species from the genus Echinostelium. When the open fruit bodies have dried, the spores are dispersed by wind or by small animals such as woodlice, mites or beetles, which either pick up the spores through contact with the fruit bodies or ingest and then excrete them. Dispersal by running water is also possible, but it plays a minor role.|$|E
500|$|The writers for {{the film}} {{magazine}} Empire listed Drive as their number one film of 2011. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, declaring that Drive was [...] "a brilliant piece of nasty business," [...] and that [...] "Refn is a virtuoso, blending tough and tender with such uncanny skill that he deservedly won the Best Director prize at Cannes." [...] Travers also said, [...] "Prepare to be blown away by Albert Brooks. Brooks' performance, <b>veined</b> with dark humor and chilling menace (watch him with a blade), deserves to have Oscar calling." [...] The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern also praised Brooks's performance, calling his villainous performance [...] "sensational." [...] James Rocchi of The Playlist gave the film an A letter grade, and wrote that [...] "Drive works as a great demonstration of how, when there's true talent behind the camera, entertainment and art are not enemies but allies." [...] Rocchi placed Drive as his number one film of 2011.|$|E
500|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Dermaptera starts in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic period about [...] in England and Australia, and {{comprises}} about 70 specimens in the extinct suborder Archidermaptera. Some of the traits believed by neontologists to belong to modern earwigs are {{not found in the}} earliest fossils, but adults had five-segmented tarsi (the final segment of the leg), well developed ovipositors, <b>veined</b> tegmina (forewings) and long segmented cerci; in fact the pincers would not have been curled or used as they are now. The theorized stem group of the Dermaptera are the Protelytroptera. These insects, which resemble modern Blattodea, or cockroaches owing to shell-like forewings and the large, unequal anal fan, are known from the Permian of North America, Europe and Australia. There are no fossils from the Triassic when the morphological changes from Protelytroptera to Dermaptera took place. The most likely, and most closely resembling, related order of insects is Grylloblattaria, theorized by Giles in 1963. However, other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to Phasmida, Embioptera, Plecoptera, and Dictyoptera.|$|E
500|$|Along {{the lateral}} and {{posterior}} {{aspects of the}} mesosoma, the pubescence is short, white, and sparsely distributed. [...] The hairs are more densely collected around the [...] lobes. [...] There are a paucity of pale, very short hairs on the [...] [...] The hairs are stiffer, whiter and longer on the scutellum. [...] Punctate markings across the mseoscutum and scutellum are coarse, deep, and closely arranged. [...] The spaces between the mesoscutum and scutellum are shiny and very narrow. [...] Punctate markings are finer on the axilla, where they are closely arranged. [...] The pleura demonstrate punctate markings which are coarse and deep. [...] These are densely arranged anteriorly. [...] The pleura are shiny between the punctate markings. [...] Lateral aspects of the propodeum are dull. [...] They are overall smooth, except some fine and shallow punctures. These are closely arranged. [...] The first tarsal segments are shorter and narrower than the tibiae. Yellow spurs are present on the legs. [...] There are minute and closely spaced punctures on the skeletal plate covering the costal vein of the wing (tegula). [...] The black <b>veined</b> wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.|$|E
500|$|The thorax {{consists}} of three segments as in all insects. The prothorax is small and is flattened dorsally into a shield-like disc which has two transverse ridges. The mesothorax and metathorax are fused into a rigid, box-like structure with internal bracing, and provides a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside it. The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The wings are long, <b>veined,</b> and membranous, narrower at the tip and wider at the base. The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base. The veins carry haemolymph, which is analogous to blood in vertebrates and carries out many similar functions, but which also serves a hydraulic function to expand the body between nymphal stages (instars) and to expand and stiffen the wings after the adult emerges from the final nymphal stage. The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein, and the wing is able to flex at this point. In most large species of dragonflies, the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males. The legs are rarely used for walking, but are used to catch and hold prey, for perching, and for climbing on plants. Each has two short basal joints, two long joints, and a three-jointed foot, armed {{with a pair of}} claws. The long leg joints bear rows of spines, and in males, one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an [...] "eyebrush", for cleaning the surface of the compound eye.|$|E
500|$|There are short, white {{pubescent}} hairs sporadically distributed {{along the}} lateral and posterior {{aspects of the}} mesosoma. [...] They are more densely arranged along the upper surface of the prothorax. [...] Hairs on the mesoscutum are short and infrequent. [...] The hairs on the scutellum are longer and stiffer. [...] Deep, ragged puncture marks are spaced closely together across the mesoscutum. [...] The spaces between each punctate marking are less than the diameters of the marks. [...] They are less closely associated on the scutellem. [...] At the axilla, the markings are less ragged in appearance and are spaced very close together. [...] The pleural surfaces are shiny, with puncture marks along the lower aspects being deep and ragged. [...] Higher up, these markings are less ragged and less sparsely distributed. [...] The lateral aspects of the propodeum are generally of a smoother texture, although there are crisp and shallow markings closely spaced. [...] The spine along the anterior coxal aspect is nearly obliterated. [...] The coxa are covered in dense white hairs. [...] The anterior tarsus is dark. [...] There are long brown hairs on the fronts {{of the first three}} tarsomeres. [...] The more typical fringe of hairs along the posterior aspect is absent. There is a robust mid-tibial spur. [...] The slim middle and posterior tarsi show yellow spurs. [...] There are tiny puncture marks closely spaced together on the tegula. [...] The black <b>veined</b> wings are slightly cloudy at the apices and glassier at the bases.|$|E
