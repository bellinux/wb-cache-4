50|$|There exist {{two main}} passive control types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and {{it leads to}} four stable states with the long axis (axis with {{smallest}} moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet. These purely passive attitude control systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a <b>viscous</b> <b>damper.</b> The <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with internal baffles to increase internal friction.

The governing equations of motion of the connected system are derived and solved for relative displacement and absolute acceleration responses of connected structures. The response of structures {{is found to be}} reduced by connecting with a <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> having appropriate damping. For undamped SDOF structures, the closed-form expressions for optimum <b>damping</b> of <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> for minimum steady state as well as minimum mean square relative displacement and absolute acceleration of either of the connected SDOF structures are derived. The optimum damper damping is found to be functions of mass and frequency ratio of two connected structures.
