25|$|Ignition: a high <b>voltage</b> <b>pulse</b> is used {{to produce}} an {{electrical}} arc – {{in a manner similar}} to a spark plug – which ionizes the xenon gas, creating a conducting channel between the tungsten electrodes. Electrical resistance is reduced within the channel, and current flows between the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|Once {{avalanche}} breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, {{irrespective of the}} gate voltage, until: (a) the potential VAK is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode−cathode) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence VG can be a <b>voltage</b> <b>pulse,</b> such as the voltage output from a UJT relaxation oscillator.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} high <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> on the {{resistance}} of polymer thick film resistors (PTFR) is studied. It is found that the resistance decreases with both the amplitude and duration of the high <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> and {{with the number of}} pulses. The change in resistance is attributed to the dielectrophoretic motion of graphite granules in the PVC medium when high <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> are applied to PTFR. A model has been proposed through which the percentage change in resistance can be estimated {{in terms of the number}} of pulses, duration of pulses etc. Based on these investigations, we suggest a downward trimming method for PTFR through the application of high <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses.</b> This method of trimming is a clean process and trimmed resistors are free from hot spots...|$|R

40|$|High <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> {{are much}} more {{difficult}} to measure precisely because of sensitivity of electrical devices to electromagnetic noise. One commonly used technique to measure high <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses,</b> is the use of Kerr cell containing any optically active material (nitrobenzene in our case). This work is based on optical technique to measure high <b>voltage</b> fast <b>pulses</b> precisely. Optical characteristics of nitrobenzene are exploited to measure the pulses. We have proposed a substitute design of Kerr cell to prevent breakdown in nitrobenzene which causes severe problems in measurement.

They are operated at low-voltage, high-current, DC and started with a high <b>voltage</b> <b>pulse</b> of 20 to 50kV. As an example, a 450 W lamp operates normally at 18 V and 25 A once started. They are also inherently unstable, prone to phenomena such as plasma oscillation and thermal runaway. Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply.|$|E

In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.|$|E

The cut-off voltage is selected such that the voltage lies above desired target cut-off voltage for the memory cells. The <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> connected to verification pulses (10) are adjusted such that the <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> reduce the cut-off voltage of the memory cells approximately to the target cut-off voltage. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for operating charge-trapping based-non volatile semiconductor memory cells.

40|$|The authors {{observed}} <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> having half-widths of {{less than}} 500 ps generated by constant-current-biased superconducting Pb variable thickness microbridges driven normal by short (3 - 5 ps) light pulses. This represents a step to generate even shorter pulses, which {{according to an analysis}} of the Rothwarf-Taylor equations should be possible. The ultimate width should be equal to the phonon pair-breaking time which, for materials such as Nb, can be a few picoseconds. In addition to monitoring the <b>voltage</b> <b>pulses</b> directly use was made of a novel adoption of the optical autocorrelation technique having a time resolution limited only by the laser pulse width.

2500|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>pulse</b> {{produced}} by the detector (or by the photomultiplier in a scintillation counter) is shaped by a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The multichannel analyzer takes the very small voltage signal {{produced by}} the detector, reshapes it into a Gaussian or trapezoidal shape, and converts that signal into a digital signal. In some systems, the analog-to-digital conversion is performed before the peak is reshaped. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) also sorts the pulses by their height. ADCs have specific numbers of [...] "bins" [...] into which the pulses can be sorted; these bins represent the channels in the spectrum. The number of channels can be changed in most modern gamma spectroscopy systems by modifying software or hardware settings. The number of channels is typically a power of two; common values include 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, or 16384 channels. The choice of number of channels depends on {{the resolution of the}} system and the energy range being studied.|$|E
2500|$|To {{conduct an}} atom probe {{experiment}} {{a very sharp}} needle shaped specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage {{is applied to the}} specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a <b>voltage</b> <b>pulse</b> (typically 1-2kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time. [...] Typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E
2500|$|The above {{peak voltage}} is only {{achieved}} in coils in which air discharges do not occur; in coils which produce sparks, like entertainment coils, {{the peak voltage}} on the terminal {{is limited to the}} voltage at which the air breaks down and becomes conductive. [...] As the output voltage increases during each <b>voltage</b> <b>pulse,</b> it reaches the point where the air next to the high voltage terminal ionizes and coronas, brush discharges and streamer arcs, break out from the terminal. This happens when the electric field strength exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, about 30kV per centimeter. [...] Since the electric field is greatest at sharp points and edges, air discharges start at these points on the high voltage terminal. [...] The voltage on the high voltage terminal cannot increase above the air breakdown voltage, because additional electric charge pumped into the terminal from the secondary winding just escapes into the air. [...] The output voltage of open-air Tesla coils is limited to around several million volts by air breakdown, but higher voltages can be achieved by coils immersed in pressurized tanks of insulating oil.|$|E
