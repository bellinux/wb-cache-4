25|$|Recently, two {{damaging}} de novo NAA15 mutations {{were reported}} by exome sequencing in parent-offspring trios with congenital heart disease.

25|$|Losartan is a selective, {{competitive}} angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) antagonist, {{reducing the}} end organ responses to angiotensin II. Losartan administration {{results in a}} decrease in total peripheral resistance (afterload) and cardiac <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> (preload). All of the physiological effects of angiotensin II, including release of aldosterone, are antagonized {{in the presence of}} losartan. Reduction in blood pressure occurs independently of the status of the renin-angiotensin system. As a result of losartan dosing, plasma renin activity increases due to removal of the angiotensin II feedback.|$|E
25|$|Dermatitis is a {{group of}} skin {{conditions}} that includes atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and stasis dermatitis. The exact cause of dermatitis is often unclear. Cases are believed to often involve a combination of irritation, allergy, and poor <b>venous</b> <b>return.</b> The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person's history and the location of the rash. For example, irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of people who frequently get them wet. Allergic contact dermatitis, however, can occur following brief exposures to substances a person is sensitive to.|$|E
500|$|Baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched, which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation [...] As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation. There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true. Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood's oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Levo- or L-looped {{transposition}} of {{the great}} arteries (L-TGA) is a rare form of congenital heart disease characterized by atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} congenitally corrected TGA, double discordance, or ventricular inversion. L-TGA usually does not present with cyanosis unless there are associated cardiac defects. Isolated L-TGA is 2 ̆ 2 physiologically corrected 2 ̆ 2 because systemic deoxygenated <b>venous</b> blood <b>returns</b> to the pulmonary circulation and oxygenated pulmonary <b>venous</b> blood <b>returns</b> to the systemic circulation. Patients with L-TGA are at increased risk for heart failure as adults due to progressive decline in systemic right ventricular function. The pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of L-TGA will be presented here...|$|R

50|$|<b>Venous</b> <b>return</b> (VR) is {{the flow}} of blood back to the heart. Under {{steady-state}} conditions, <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> must equal cardiac output (Q), when averaged over time because the cardiovascular system is essentially a closed loop. Otherwise, blood would accumulate in either the systemic or pulmonary circulations. Although cardiac output and <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> are interdependent, each can be independently regulated.|$|E
50|$|Heat syncope {{is related}} to heat {{exposure}} that produces orthostatic hypotension. This hypotension can precipitate a near-syncopal episode. Heat syncope is believed to result from intense sweating, which leads to dehydration, followed by peripheral vasodilation and reduced <b>venous</b> blood <b>return</b> {{in the face of}} decreased vasomotor control. Management of heat syncope consists of cooling and rehydration of the patient using oral rehydration therapy (sport drinks) or isotonic IV fluids. People who experience heat syncope should avoid standing in the heat for long periods of time. They should move to a cooler environment and lie down if they recognize the initial symptoms. Wearing support stockings and engaging in deep knee-bending movements can help promote <b>venous</b> blood <b>return.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Inhalation {{decreases}} intrathoracic pressure {{which allows}} more <b>venous</b> blood to <b>return</b> {{to the right}} heart (pulling blood into {{the right side of}} the heart via a vacuum-like effect). Therefore, right-sided heart murmurs generally increase in intensity with inhalation. The decreased (more negative) intrathoracic pressure has an opposite effect on the left side of the heart, making it harder for the blood to exit into circulation. Therefore, left-sided murmurs generally decrease in intensity during inhalation. Increasing <b>venous</b> blood <b>return</b> to {{the right side of the}} heart by raising a patient's legs to a 45-degree while lying supine produces similar effect which occurs during inhalation. Inhalation can also produce a non-pathological split S2 which will be heard upon auscultation.|$|R
40|$|The {{axillary}} area presents interesting characteristics. The skin is extremely mobile and stretchable, the thoracic wall is practically muscle free, it is {{away from the}} breast gland and an adducted arm hides it. These factors, because of their cosmetic potential, undoubt-edly make this area attractive for a surgical access to the heart. Yan [1] has used this route not only to close the classical secun-dum type of atrial septal defects, but also, like us [2], to repair more complex defects such as partial atrioventricular canals, peri-membranous ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and partial abnor-mal pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>returns.</b> We also use a mirror incision {{on the left side}} to implant epicardial pacemaker electrodes on the left atrial appendage and on the left ventricle [3].

50|$|Stroke {{volume is}} {{intrinsically}} controlled by preload (the {{degree to which}} the ventricles are stretched prior to contracting). An increase in the volume or speed of <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> will increase preload and, through the Frank-Starling law of the heart, will increase stroke volume. Decreased <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> has the opposite effect, causing a reduction in stroke volume.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> dictates cardiac output, effected through the Frank Starling mechanism. However, {{as noted above}} it is clear that, equally, cardiac output must dictate <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> since over any period of time both must necessarily be equal. Similarly, the concept of mean systemic filling pressure, the hypothetical driving pressure for <b>venous</b> <b>return,</b> is difficult to localise and impossible to measure in the physiological state. Furthermore, the Ohmic formulation used to describe <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> ignores the critical venous parameter, capacitance. It is confusion about these terms that has led some physiologists {{to suggest that the}} emphasis on 'venous return' be turned instead to more measurable and direct influences on cardiac output such as end diastolic pressure and volume which can be causally related to cardiac output and through which the influences of volume status, venous capacitance, ventricular compliance and venodilating therapies can be understood.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLearning {{embryology}} remains difficult, {{since it}} requires understanding of many complex phenomena. The temporal evolution of developmental events has classically been illustrated using cartoons, which create difficulty in linking {{spatial and temporal}} aspects, such correlation being the keystone of descriptive embryology. We synthesized the bibliographic data from recent studies of atrial septal development. On {{the basis of this}} synthesis, consensus on the stages of atrial septation as seen in the human heart has been reached by a group of experts in cardiac embryology and pediatric cardiology. This has permitted the preparation of three-dimensional (3 D) computer graphic objects for the anatomical components involved in the different stages of normal human atrial septation. We have provided a virtual guide to the process of normal atrial septation, the animation providing an appreciation of the temporal and morphologic events necessary to separate the systemic and pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>returns.</b> We have shown that our animations of normal human atrial septation increase significantly the teaching of the complex developmental processes involved, and provide a new dynamic for the process of learning.

Because of the absence of acute clinical manifestations, fibroscopy, isotopic perfusion scan-ning, and hemodynamic and pulmonary angiographic studies were done.

50|$|Gravity: The {{effects of}} gravity on <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> seem {{paradoxical}} because {{when a person}} stands up, hydrostatic forces cause the right atrial pressure to decrease and the venous pressure in the dependent limbs to increase. This increases the pressure gradient for <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> from the dependent limbs to the right atrium; however, <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> actually decreases. The {{reason for this is}} when a person initially stands, cardiac output and arterial pressure decrease (because right atrial pressure falls). The flow through the entire systemic circulation falls because arterial pressure falls more than right atrial pressure; therefore the pressure gradient driving flow throughout the entire circulatory system is decreased.|$|E
50|$|The {{circulatory system}} {{is made up}} of two circulations (pulmonary and systemic) {{situated}} in series between the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV). Balance is achieved, in large part, by the Frank-Starling mechanism. For example, if systemic <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> is suddenly increased (e.g., changing from upright to supine position), right ventricular preload increases leading to an increase in stroke volume and pulmonary blood flow. The left ventricle experiences an increase in pulmonary <b>venous</b> <b>return,</b> which in turn increases left ventricular preload and stroke volume by the Frank-Starling mechanism. In this way, an increase in <b>venous</b> <b>return</b> can lead to a matched increase in cardiac output.|$|E

In this time,we tried to observe the ultrasonographic imaging between pre and after all out running more exactly by latest ultrasonographic equipment with a convex probe. In serial observation after exhaustion,the splenic imagings were increasing gradually and decreasing in size,the diminishing rate was 27. 9 %. In serial observation after exhaustion,the splenic imagigs were increasing gradually {{and there was a}} tendency to return to the size of pre examination after 20 or 30 minutes. Imagings of the both kidneys were decreasing in size,too. The diminishing rates of the left kidney and right one were 20. 2 % and 15. 2 % each other. And imagings of the liver were decreaning in size and thickness after exhaustion,the diminishing rate was 7. 2 %. So we concluded that in organs such as spleen,kindney,and liver,there was a tendency of decreasing in size because of increasing of <b>venous</b> <b>returns</b> from such as organs to heart during running over load.
