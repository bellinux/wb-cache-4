50|$|The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> {{can vary}} {{according}} to numerous factors. Changes in the ion conductances of sodium or potassium can lead to either a raised or lowered <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold.</b> Additionally, {{the diameter of the}} axon, density of voltage activated sodium channels, and properties of sodium channels within the axon all affect the threshold value. Typically in the axon or dendrite, there are small depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals resulting from a prior stimulus. The passive spread of these signals depend on the passive electrical properties of the cell. The signals can only continue along the neuron to cause an action potential further down if they are strong enough to make it past the cell's membrane resistance and capacitance. For example, a neuron with a large diameter has more ionic channels in its membrane than a smaller cell, resulting in a lower resistance to the flow of ionic current. The current spreads quicker in a cell with less resistance, and is more likely to reach the threshold at other portions of the neuron.|$|E

In this paper function f is estimated with a nonparametric approach. Nonparametric approach that used is a wavelet shrinkage or a wavelet threshold method. In the function estimation with a wavelet threshold method, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> has the most important role to determine level of smoothing estimator. The small threshold give function estimation very no smoothly, while the big <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> give function estimation very smoothly. Therefore the optimal <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> should be selected to determine the optimal function estimation. One of the methods to determine the optimal <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> by minimize a cross validation function. The cross validation method that be used is two-fold cross validatiaon. In this cross validation, it compute the predicted value by using a half of data set. The original data set is split into two subsets of equal size : one containing only the even indexed data, and the other, the odd indexed data. The odd data {{will be used to}} predict the even data, and vice versa.

30|$|Recall that, the {{threshold}} value for change {{decision making is}} a key factor of detection accuracy. Potential weakness {{of the majority of}} exiting algorithms, e.g., Refs.

Another contribution {{of this paper is to}} develop a new adaptive threshold when performing change decision making. In particular, we introduce an alternative factor: a fixed-global parameter used to control the coarse-to-fine level of detection, instead of the fixed <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold,</b> for change detection (see Section  3.2 for details). By using this factor, at each step of change decision, {{the threshold}} value can be adaptively computed from the already observed data.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Impulse noise {{detection}} {{schemes for}} filtering of digital images commonly employ median-based methods. In these schemes, {{the selection of}} appropriate <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> becomes difficult as {{it depends on the}} image statistics and noise percentage. The application of a fixed threshold for the entire image, especially with random valued noise, results into a high percentage of missed and false detections. An adaptive threshold is, therefore, highly desirable for detection of random valued impulse noise. In this paper an impulse detection scheme using an adaptive threshold, based on local image characteristics, is proposed. The appropriate <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>threshold</b> is computed from the local statistics derived from the filtering window to minimize the missed and false detections. As confirmed by extensive simulations, the proposed method gives an improved performance with both random valued as well as salt and pepper noise...|$|E

30|$|The {{threshold}} value {{is an important}} parameter that depends {{on a number of}} factors, such as image brightness, contrast, level of noise, and even edge direction. The selection <b>of</b> the <b>threshold</b> in Sobel filtering is associated to the sensitivity of the filter to edges. In particular, the lower the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>threshold,</b> the higher the sensitivity to edges. Too high <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the <b>threshold</b> do not detect edges which are important for quality assessment. On the other side, if the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>threshold</b> is too small, large parts of the image are considered as edges, whereas these are irrelevant for quality assessment. The threshold can be selected following an analysis of the gradient image histogram. Based on this consideration and on the analysis of Sobel filtering performance for the images of the considered databases, the selected {{threshold value}} is t = 0.001.|$|R
