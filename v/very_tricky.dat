Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan.

In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken.

The wellknown problem of this approach is that very often the advice from different experts is contradictory.

40|$|Fine-grained {{concurrent}} data structures (or FCDs) {{reduce the}} granularity of critical sections in both time and space, thus {{making it possible}} for clients to access different parts of a mutable data structure in parallel. However, the tradeoff is that the implementations of FCDs are <b>very</b> subtle and <b>tricky</b> to reason about directly. Consequently, they are carefully designed to be contextual refinements of their coarse-grained counterparts, meaning that their clients can reason about them as if all access to them were sequentialized. In this paper, we propose a new semantic model, based on Kripke logical relations, that supports direct proofs of contextual refinement in the setting of a type-safe high-level language. The key idea behind our model is to provide a simple way of expressing the “local life stories ” of individual pieces of an FCD’s hidden state by means of protocols that the threads concurrently accessing that state must follow. By endowing these protocols with a simple yet powerful transition structure, as well as the ability to assert invariants on both heap states and specification code, we are able to support clean and intuitive refinement proofs for the most sophisticated types of FCDs, such as conditional compare-and-set (CCAS) ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{the ships}} were being repaired, Jones {{had to deal}} with the {{consequences}} of landing in a neutral port with prizes of war. He turned on the charm for diplomatic negotiations at The Hague and networking in Amsterdam, where he was the toast of society, known as [...] "The Terror of the English". On 8 October, the British ambassador, Sir Joseph Yorke, wrote to the rulers of the United Provinces, claiming that under international law, Jones, not being accredited by a recognised state, was a rebel and a pirate. Therefore, the two captured ships should be detained for handing back to their rightful owners. Yorke also asked that the wounded from the two ships should be taken ashore and treated at British Government expense. That request was agreed to immediately, but it was over a fortnight later, during which repair work proceeded without any hindrance, when the Dutch replied that their neutrality meant they could not judge the legality of actions between foreigners on the open sea, but that that would also apply to any attempt made by the British to retake their ships once they left port. Furthermore, Jones’s squadron was obliged to leave the Texel [...] "as soon as possible", and could not be supplied with arms or ammunition except [...] "what are absolutely necessary to carry [...] them safe to the first foreign port they can come at". Yorke replied by quoting treaties, returning to the [...] "pirate" [...] theme, and pointing out that under Dutch law, commanders of foreign naval forces were obliged to present authorisation from their governments when docking in Dutch ports. As the United Provinces did not officially recognise the government of the United States, that was a <b>very</b> <b>tricky</b> legal point, which the Dutch took quite a while to consider. To get round the problem, Pallas and Vengeance were declared officially French, and Captain Cottineau became commodore of a French squadron, his flagship the captured Serapis. With Landais barred from command until the case against him could be heard, Jones became captain of the avowedly American Alliance, not associated in any way with the newly French squadron. Several Royal Navy ships were waiting just off the coast for the day he was obliged to leave—the Dutch authorities making a great show of trying to eject him—but as winter storms made it more and more difficult for them to keep station, John Paul Jones (after recruiting another American commander, Gustavus Conyngham, who had escaped from British captivity) slipped away among a group of Dutch ships on 27 December and sailed to France.|$|E

Authors of different linguistic and theoretical fields propose their own reflection on the so called LSP (“languages for specific purposes”) with reference to their solid experience both as scholars and university teachers. In chapter two Salmon presents her own epistemic analysis of the concept of LSP itself, which is closly related to the <b>very</b> complex and <b>tricky</b> concept of “textual typology”. The main idea is that a binary opposition of expressive versus scientific texts is always naïve and reveals a poor comprehention of the connection between “text typology” and the often very complex reception context. The last can trigger a drastic shift in the text tipology. This fact should be well known in considering the deontological postulates of both the translating project and the following process. In this chapter is argumented the claim that no text as a physical object cointains discrete elements sufficient to infere a “pure typology”. In a text there is eventually a sum of different verbal features which, depending on the overall contex (intended as the interrelation of wh- factors), suggest that a dominant is to be found (cf. Jakobson). The dominant function of the source text is then considered the guideline for a consistent translation project leading to an f-equivalent target text...|$|R

So far as I know them they are a <b>very</b> <b>tricky</b> set of people, bent on getting {{as much as they can}}, by hook or by crook, out of the unfortunate individual who falls into their hands. They begin, as I have said, by asking about twice as much as they ought to receive; and anything between this exorbitant amount and the just price is what they thank heaven for, as so much clear gain. Nevertheless, I am not quite sure that the Italians are worse than other people even in this matter. In other countries it is the custom of persons in trade to take as much as they can get from the public, fleecing one man to exactly the same extent as another; here they take what they can obtain from the individual customer. In fact, Roman tradesmen do not pretend to deny that they ask and receive different prices from different people, taxing them according to their supposed means of payment; the article supplied being the same in one case as in another. A shopkeeper looked into his books to see if we were of the class who paid two pauls, or only a paul and a half for candles; a charcoal-dealer said that seventy baiocchi was a very reasonable sum for us to pay for charcoal, and that some persons paid eighty; and Mr. Thompson, recognizing the rule, told the old vetturino that [...] "a hundred and fifty scudi was a very proper charge for carrying a prince to Florence, but not for carrying me, who was merely a very good artist." [...] The result is well enough; the rich man lives expensively, and pays a larger share of the profits which people of a different system of trade-morality would take equally from the poor man. The effect on the conscience of the vetturino, however, and of tradesmen of all kinds, cannot be good; their only intent being, not to do justice between man and man, but to go as deep as they can into all pockets, and to the very bottom of some.|$|E

As NEX has been growing into a petabyte-size platform for analysis, experiments and data production, it has been increasingly important to enable users to easily retrace their steps, identify what datasets were produced by which process chains, and give them ability to readily reproduce their results. This can be a tedious and difficult task even for a small project, but is almost impossible on large processing pipelines. We have developed an initial reproducibility and knowledge capture solution for the NEX, however, if users want to move the code to another system, whether it is their home institution cluster, laptop or the cloud, they have to find, build and install all the required dependencies that would run their code. This can be a <b>very</b> tedious and <b>tricky</b> process and is a big impediment to moving code to data and reproducibility outside the original system. The NEX team has tried to assist users who wanted to move their code into OpenNEX on Amazon cloud by creating custom virtual machines with all the software and dependencies installed, but this, while solving some of the issues, creates a new bottleneck that requires the NEX team {{to be involved with}} any new request, updates to virtual machines and general maintenance support.

Docker is available on most computer platforms, easy to install and capable of seamlessly creating and/or executing any application packaged in the appropriate format.

40|$|Inborn {{errors of}} metabolism, which affect the liver are a large, {{continuously}} increasing group of diseases. Their clinical onset can occur at any age, from intrauterine period presenting as liver failure already at birth to late adulthood. Inherited metabolic disorders {{must be considered}} in differential diagnosis of every unexplained liver disease. Specific diagnostic work-up for either their confirmation or exclusion should start immediately since any postponing can result in delayed diagnosis and death or irreversible disability. This can be particularly painful while many inherited metabolic liver diseases are relatively easily treatable if diagnosed on time, for instance galactosemia or hereditary fructose intolerance by simple dietary means. Any unexplained liver disease, even one looking initially benign, should be considered as a potential liver failure and therefore should deserve proper attention. Diagnosis in neonates is additionally complicated because of the factors which can mask liver disease, such as physiological neonatal jaundice, normally relatively enlarged liver and increased transaminases at that age. In everyday practice, in order to reveal the etiology, it is useful to classify and distinguish some clinical patterns which, together with a few routine, widely available laboratory tests (aminotransferases, prothrombine time, albumin, gammaGT, total and conjugated bilirubin, ammonia, alkaline phosphatase and glucose) make the search for the cause much easier. These patterns are isolated hyperbilirubinemia, syndrome of cholestasis in early infancy, hepatocellular jaundice, Reye syndrome, portal cirrhosis and isolated hepatomegaly. Despite the fact that some diseases can present with more than one pattern (for instance, alpha- 1 -antitrypsin deficiency as infantile cholestasis, but also as hepatocellular jaundice), and that in some disesases one pattern can evolve into another (for instance, Wilson disease from hepatocellular damage into portal cirrhosis), this classisfication is still very useful. Diagnostic work-up in an unexplained liver disease can be <b>very</b> complex and <b>tricky,</b> particularly in patients with (sub) acute liver failure, when the time for interventions is limited, many pathological laboratory results can be a secondary abnormality, and many specific tests should be done and interpreted properly in parallel with various treatment measures. In such clinical setting, specific knowledge, skills, experience, special drugs and properly equiped diagnostic laboratories are, as a rule, necessary for good clinical outcome. Therefore, it is highly recommended to transfer the patient as soon as possible to a specialized center where all these requirements can be fulfilled by an experienced specialized team comprising pediatric gastroenterologist, subspecialist in metabolic diseases, intensivist, surgeon, biochemist and others. Such an approach {{is the only way to}} decrease the still high proportion of patients with inherited metabolic liver diseases who remain causally undiagnosed and whose outcome is far from optimal. </p...|$|R
40|$|There is {{one area}} in which Craigslist Inc. appears {{particularly}} invested these days: its legal bills. Notoriously cutthroat, this online classified marketplace has steadfastly clung to its bare-boned business blueprint while resisting any form of growth or innovation over the years. Craigslist has not, however, shied away from taking on its would-be competitors in court, oftentimes those attempting only to “add[] a layer of value” to the Craigslist formula. Not surprisingly, Craigslist’s arsenal of litigation weapons has become quite vast in recent years: claims arising under the Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), as well as claims of unjust enrichment, conspiracy, and even trespass to chattel,all aimed at scrappy upstarts sporting a fraction of Craigslist’s resources. Many of these rival companies have employed “web scrapers” to aggregate publicly available data on Craigslist’s servers and then repackage or otherwise make available this content for third-party users. In some cases, this activity clearly constitutes misappropriation or theft, but generalizing these companies’ motives is <b>tricky.</b> <b>Very</b> often these competing companies appear to be simply trying to enhance and augment the Craigslist model, which is a desirable result in a free and unfettered market. Several recent court orders in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California signal a major early victory for Craigslist over these web scrapers and data aggregators, even though much of the early media attention has centered on where Craigslist’s lawsuit fell short: the copyright infringement claims. Indeed, what was lost on many mainstream commentators (but certainly not legal bloggers) is that {{the application of the}} CFAA to online “intrusion,” specifically to Craigslist’s competitors’ web scraping activities. The April and August 2013 orders on the defendants’ motions to dismiss found these activities actionable under the CFAA,which is alarming because the scraped data in question was available on freely accessible, public websites. Moreover, these orders subvert a recent decision from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, United States v. Nosal,which had narrowed the application of the CFAA and its use as a weapon of private enforcement against web scrapers and other data aggregators. 9 In brief, Nosal stands for the proposition that users’ violations of a website’s “Terms of Use” (TOU) could not alone form the basis of CFAA liability. The Nosal case is significant because it seemingly halted the runaway train that the CFAA had become in California. Further, it marked a departure from other circuits by offering a lean, sensible interpretation of the CFAA’s thorniest provision: what activities constitute “unauthorized access. ” However, the Craigslist orders still leave open questions about whether Nosal was the great panacea that it first appeared to be, or if it managed to change anything at all. While there are causes of action that ought to be (and are) available to plaintiffs wishing to guard against unwanted intrusion, CFAA civil actions should not be among them. This cause of action is poorly suited to address complex property issues in the digital age, and it may simultaneously chill web innovation and foster anticompetitive behavior in the market. While it is unclear whether the Northern District of California will ever reach the merits in Craigslist, these early decisions suggest that the court may have misapplied Nosal, or may be poised to misapply it in the future. While Nosal seemed to take a forward step in squaring the circle—particularly with regard to the CFAA’s more troubling provisions—the Northern District’s misguided application of the CFAA post-Nosal illustrates deeper infirmities within the CFAA. Indeed, courts cannot and should not stretch the CFAA to cover unanticipated and uncontemplated forms of technology, and in this regard the CFAA is ripe for a simple statutory fix. A CFAA “safe harbor” of sorts, borrowed from language found in a related statute, would help modernize a statute that has, over time, swept within its ambit a new class of unintended defendants. Part I of this Comment begins by tracking the CFAA’s evolution in the Ninth Circuit as applied in the internet realm. Part II examines the Nosal decision and whether the court properly applied it in Craigslist. Part II also examines the implications for web start-ups seeking to exploit existing, publicly available data if the Northern District eventually holds against 3 Taps Inc. at trial or on summary judgment. Finally, Part III proposes a statutory solution that creates a safe harbor within the CFAA for users accessing public computer systems, effectively removing these defendants from the purview of the CFAA. This Comment focuses on developments principally in the Ninth Circuit, as California web companies are perhaps most poised to litigate these types of issues...|$|R
