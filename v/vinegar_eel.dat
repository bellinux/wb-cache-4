It lends itself to an exercise in a single semester course. Key words: ecology, invertebrate, little-r, population dynamics, vinegar ee...|$|E
50|$|Turbatrix aceti (<b>vinegar</b> <b>eels,</b> <b>vinegar</b> nematode) are {{free-living}} nematodes {{that feed}} on the microbial culture, called mother of vinegar used to create vinegar, and {{may be found in}} unfiltered <b>vinegar.</b> <b>Vinegar</b> <b>eels</b> are often given to fry (baby fish) as a live food, like microworms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vinegar</b> <b>eels</b> (Turbatrix aceti), {{a form of}} nematode, {{may occur}} in some forms of vinegar unless the vinegar is kept covered. These feed on the mother of vinegar and can occur in {{naturally}} fermenting vinegar.|$|R
50|$|Acetic acid {{bacteria}} are airborne and are ubiquitous in nature. They are actively present in environments where ethanol is being {{formed as a}} result of fermentation of sugars. They can be isolated from the nectar of flowers and from damaged fruit. Other good sources are fresh apple cider and unpasteurized beer that has not been filter sterilized. In these liquids, they grow as a surface film due to their aerobic nature and active motility. Fruit flies or <b>vinegar</b> <b>eels</b> are considered as a common vector in propagating acetic acid bacteria.|$|R
50|$|Newly emerged B. nunus fry {{are tiny}} {{and should be}} {{isolated}} from adults so they are not cannibalized. A five gallon tank is big enough for them. The fry {{are very sensitive to}} water quality and changes in temperature or salinity so it is recommended to fill their new tank with water from their original tank and then maintain the water quality rigorously. Newly fry can be fed <b>vinegar</b> <b>eels</b> or commercially-prepared liquid fry food but are big enough to devour newly hatched brine shrimp within a few days.|$|R
50|$|Well-fed {{adults do}} not often eat their own young, {{although}} sometimes safe zones {{are required for}} the fry. Specially designed livebearer birthing tanks, which can be suspended inside the aquarium, are available from aquatic retailers. These also serve to shield the pregnant female from further attention from the males, which is important because the males sometimes attack the females while they are giving birth. It also provides a separate area for the newborn young as protection from being eaten by their mother. However, if a female is put in the breeder box too early, it may cause her to have a miscarriage. Well-planted tanks that offer barriers to adult guppies shelter the young quite well. Guppy grass, water sprite, water wisteria, duckweed, and java moss are all good choices. A continuous supply of live food, such as Daphnia or brine shrimp, keep adult fish full and may spare the fry when they are born. Young fry take roughly {{three or four months}} to reach maturity. Feeding fry live foods, such as baby brine shrimp, microworms, infusoria and <b>vinegar</b> <b>eels,</b> is recommended. Alternatives include finely ground flake food, egg yolk, and liquid fish food, though the particulates in these may be too large for the youngest fry to eat.|$|R
