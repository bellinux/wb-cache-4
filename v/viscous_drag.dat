5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of <b>viscous</b> <b>drag</b> force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

Energy and {{momentum}} balance equations of the dissipative MHD approach {{are applied to}} the coronal plasmoid phenomenon observed with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope during the July 11, 1991 total solar eclipse. The situation is marginal for {{the applicability of the}} MHD description,which has been used for orders of magnitude estimates of the governing physical parameters. Their analysis confirms the suggestion about the possibility for a relatively cold but rapidly moving plasma body to heat the corona through dissipative viscous effects. It also shows that magnetic stresses, gas pressure gradients and <b>viscous</b> <b>drags</b> by the fast plasma flows from the chromosphere are viable candidates to lift the plasmoid against the gravity force.

25|$|Laminar-flow {{control is}} a {{technology}} that offers the potential for significant improvement in drag coefficient which would provide improvements in aircraft fuel usage, range or endurance that far exceed any known single aeronautical technology. In principle, if 80 percent of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25 percent. The frictional force between {{the air and the}} aircraft surface, known as <b>viscous</b> <b>drag,</b> is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations (boundary layer suction).|$|E
25|$|Froning and Roach (2002) {{put forward}} a paper that builds {{on the work of}} Puthoff, Haisch and Alcubierre. They used fluid dynamic {{simulations}} to model the interaction of a vehicle (like that proposed by Alcubierre) with the zero-point field. Vacuum field perturbations are simulated by fluid field perturbations and the aerodynamic resistance of <b>viscous</b> <b>drag</b> exerted on the interior of the vehicle is compared to the Lorentz force exerted by the zero-point field (a Casimir-like force is exerted on the exterior by unbalanced zero-point radiation pressures). They find that the optimized negative energy required for an Alcubierre drive is where it is a saucer-shaped vehicle with toroidal electromagnetic fields. The EM fields distort the vacuum field perturbations surrounding the craft sufficiently to affect the permeability and permittivity of space.|$|E

40|$|Active matter {{systems are}} {{driven out of}} thermal {{equilibrium}} {{by a lack of}} generalized Stokes-Einstein relation between injection and dissipation of energy at the microscopic scale. We consider such a system of interacting particles, propelled by persistent noises, and show that, at small but finite persistence time, their dynamics still satisfy a time-reversal symmetry. To do so, we compute perturbatively their steady-state measure and show that, for short persistent times, the entropy production rate vanishes. This endows such systems with an effective Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem akin to that of thermal equilibrium systems. Last we show how interacting particle systems with <b>viscous</b> <b>drags</b> and correlated noises can be seen as in equilibrium with a visco-elastic bath but driven out of equilibrium by non-conservative forces, hence providing an energetic insight on the departure of active systems from equilibrium.

50|$|Parasitic drag is drag {{caused by}} moving a solid object through a fluid. Parasitic drag {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} components including <b>viscous</b> pressure <b>drag</b> (form drag), and drag due to surface roughness (skin friction drag).

2500|$|Drag, in {{the context}} of fluid dynamics, refers to forces that act on a solid object in the {{direction}} of the relative flow velocity (note that the diagram below shows the drag in the opposite direction to the flow). The aerodynamic forces on a body come primarily from differences in pressure and viscous shearing stresses.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the work accomplished during a first-year investigation of base drag reduction for launch vehicles. Interest {{in this work}} has arisen due to the large base areas associated with {{the current generation of}} launch vehicles. For example, the X- 33 and Venture Star configurations all have large base areas because of the aero-spike engines they use. Because of the large base-to-wetted area ratios of these vehicles, the majority of the vehicle drag is due to base drag. Based on previous research, {{there appears to be a}} means for reducing the base drag on such vehicles. A clear relationship between <b>viscous</b> fore-body <b>drag</b> and base drag was demonstrated. For subsonic flow conditions, an increase in fore-body drag causes a decrease in base drag. This base-drag reduction is a result of boundary layer effects at the base of the vehicle. The shear layer that develops from the boundary layer separating at the back of the vehicle is the conduit through which momentum is transferred from the high energy free-stream flow to the low-energy fluid in the base area. One way to think of the base drag is that it is the momentum required to accelerate this low-energy fluid. The boundary layer that develops on the fore body acts as an "insulator" between the external flow and the low-energy air at the base. As the <b>viscous</b> fore-body <b>drag</b> is increased, the boundary layer thickness at the aft end of the fore body increases, thereby reducing the rate at which momentum is transferred to the base area. As a result of the lower momentum transfer (or reduced pumping), the base pressure coefficient rises resulting in a reduction of base drag...|$|R
