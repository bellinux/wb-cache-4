5|$|According to {{the creator}} of BackupHDDVD, he or she first set out to {{circumvent}} AACS to bypass a restriction in software HD DVD players which reduced the quality of AACS restricted 1080p high definition video to that of standard definition DVD <b>video</b> <b>or</b> refused to play outright unless an HDCP compliant chain of video hardware was present. At the time only a few computer monitors and video cards supported HDCP. As a result, configurations {{that would have allowed}} high-definition HD DVD viewing in software players were exceptionally rare.|$|E

5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to <b>video</b> (<b>or</b> vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Forgoing the {{downloadable}} content {{model used}} in previous Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero Live adds songs {{to the game}} via Guitar Hero TV (GHTV), an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live. Instead of playing the immersive first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music <b>video</b> <b>or</b> footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames found that this approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as a throwback to the heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E
5|$|Previously, viewing YouTube {{videos on}} a {{personal}} computer required the Adobe Flash Player plug-in to be installed in the browser. In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that used the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the HTML5 standard. This allowed videos to be viewed without requiring Adobe Flash Player or any other plug-in to be installed. The YouTube site had a page that allowed supported browsers to opt into the HTML5 trial. Only browsers that supported HTML5 Video using the MP4 (with H.264 <b>video)</b> <b>or</b> WebM (with VP8 video) formats could play the videos, and not all videos on the site were available.|$|E

5|$|Cathedral {{officials}} also described {{the use of}} guns in a city which has a gun crime problem as irresponsible. The Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch, stated that it was well known that Manchester had a gun crime problem, {{and that it was}} beyond belief that a global manufacturer would re-create one of their Cathedrals with photo-realistic quality. Insomniac, the game's developer, declined to comment, referring all inquires to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued a statement, stating that they were aware of the concerns expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the Cathedral authorities, and take them seriously. However, they added that Resistance: Fall of Man is a fantasy science fiction game and not based on reality and that they believed they had sought and received all permissions necessary. Sony also stated that it would be contacting the Cathedral on 11 June 2007 to understand their concerns in more detail. David Wilson, a Sony spokesman, told The Times that it was game-created footage, and not <b>video</b> <b>or</b> photography. Further, he compared it to science fiction shows such as Doctor Who, claiming that it was not based on reality at all.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display <b>video</b> <b>or</b> any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E
