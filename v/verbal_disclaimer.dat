5000|$|The program {{conducted}} {{investigations into}} the controversial and paranormal (e.g., UFOs, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster). Additionally, it featured episodes about mysterious historical events and personalities such as Anna Anderson/Grand Duchess Anastasia, the Lincoln Assassination, the Jack the Ripper murders, infamous cults (e.g., Jim Jones), and missing persons, cities, and ships (e.g., Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa, D. B. Cooper, the Mary Celeste, the Titanic, the lost Roanoke Colony). Because the show often presented offbeat subjects and controversial theories, each episode's opening credits included a <b>verbal</b> <b>disclaimer</b> about the conjectural {{nature of the evidence}} and theories to be presented: ...|$|E
40|$|Since 2008, I have coordinated a unit {{entitled}} Writing Therapy {{as part of}} ECU’s undergraduate writing course. Students {{explore the}} {{theory and practice of}} writing therapy and its connections with discourses of psychology, psychoanalysis, literature and creativity, as well as the related fields of bibliotherapy, trauma studies and testimonial life-writing. They experiment with various kinds of writing, and consider the possible dangers of therapeutic writing, since in some cases the practice may engender anxiety and distress, or facilitate self-delusion and evasion rather than insight and transformation. Even so, suggesting that students experiment with forms of writing that published novelists, poets, social scientists and therapists consider remedial may create expectations of therapeutic benefit. The very title of the unit and its higher education setting posit the existence of a legitimate entity, so that <b>verbal</b> and written <b>disclaimers</b> and warnings that students should reserve their judgements may not be entirely convincing. Furthermore, the usefulness and appropriateness of personal writing in tertiary education is widely debated. This paper acknowledges such arguments, as well as concerns that a ‘therapeutic ethos’ has spread beyond the clinic, damaging social life and institutions and effectively depoliticising, pathologising and diminishing individuals. This type of prognosis, expounded by Phillip Rieff as early as 1966 in The triumph of the therapeutic, has been expressed recently by cultural analysts {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, including Frank Furedi in Therapy culture: Cultivating vulnerability in an uncertain age (2004) and Christina Hoff Sommers and Sally Satel in One nation under therapy: How the helping culture is eroding self-reliance (2005). A particular concern is the alleged intrusion of therapy into education, a case elaborated by Kathryn Ecclestone and Dennis Hayes in The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education (2009). This paper concludes that a Writing Therapy unit can productively negotiate these debates and make a useful contribution to a tertiary writing program, despite—and even because of—its contested status, inherent risks and ethical complexities...|$|R
5000|$|To {{distinguish}} official campaigning {{from independent}} campaigning, political advertisements on television {{were required to}} include a <b>verbal</b> <b>disclaimer</b> identifying the organization responsible for the advertisement. Advertisements produced by political campaigns usually included the statement, [...] "I'm name, and I approve this message." [...] Advertisements produced by independent organizations usually included the statement, [...] "name {{is responsible for the}} content of this advertisement", and from September 3 (60 days before the general election), such organizations' ads were prohibited from mentioning any candidate by name. Previously, television advertisements only required a written [...] "paid for by" [...] disclaimer on the screen.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{modern society}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{attempts}} at political correctness and increasingly liberal social mores, certain issues continue to divide friends, families, and nations. Religion {{is one such}} issue. The conflict over religion 2 ̆ 7 s proper place in society {{is not limited to}} local coffee shop banter, the purview of social commentators, or dinner conversation in a gated suburban home. The Supreme Court has similarly struggled to define a border in the morass between secular and sectarian. The broad language of the First Amendment lends itself to diverse interpretations and conflicting opinions, stating in part, 2 ̆ 2 Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting free exercise thereof. 2 ̆ 22 This language has led to disagreement between Supreme Court Justices 3 and inconsistent employment of Establishment Clause 2 ̆ 2 tests. 2 ̆ 24 The ongoing debate over the Establishment Clause 2 ̆ 7 s meaning recently surfaced in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District. 5 In Kitzmiller, the Dover, Pennsylvania, school board passed a resolution requiring a <b>verbal</b> <b>disclaimer</b> be read to high school biology students. The disclaimer stated in part that there are unexplained gaps in the theory of evolution and directed students to materials related to the alternative theory of intelligent design (2 ̆ 2 ID 2 ̆ 2). 6 The Kitzmiller court held the disclaimer violated the Establishment Clause and also determined that ID was a non-scientific, and hence theological, argument for creation. ...|$|E
