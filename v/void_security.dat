40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the design, construction and eventual deconstruction of the Children’s Art Pavilion at the Newcastle Region Art Gallery in Australia. As {{a space for}} children to experiment with art, the Pavilion metaphorically engaged the verandah as a space that has historically (albeit minimally) mediated the zone where inside and outside meet. Its process of deconstruction referenced the work of Gordon Matta-Clark, and was testament to how the architectural design process continues through this phase, albeit uninhibited {{by the need to}} create a functioning object. In the time leading up to its deconstruction, the Pavilion became perfectly functionless, while its form and architectural content remained critically intact. Cutting into its surface, as a continuation of the design process, framed the <b>void.</b> <b>Security</b> was replaced with instability, not just physically but emotionally. At this point, the ground became cliff, or broke against the surf, and indeterminacy destroyed the purpose of even the most elementary architectural space. The new construction immediately suggested the possibilities of another architecture. As an intriguing social and architectural experiment, undergone by a building that could have quietly been loaded into a bin within a few hours, this project illuminated the social responsibility invested within architecture...|$|E
50|$|The {{conflict}} between the two parliaments was finally resolved by their merger {{under the terms of}} the Acts of Union 1707. The union made the Act anent Peace and War and the Act of <b>Security</b> <b>void,</b> and they were formally repealed in December 1707.|$|R
50|$|Void Server is a high-specs server {{that uses}} Void Technology from eTunnel Network. This is more {{flexible}} than a normal server {{in terms of}} the server speed and stability. Server administration is almost fully automatic and never required the technician to look over it accept for schedule maintenance. <b>Void</b> Server utilize <b>security</b> measures {{to ensure the safety of}} data stored and transferred on their network of servers.|$|R

Wolverine later returns there {{to find a cure}} for the deadly Sheva Strain Virus that acts as a failsafe implanted in Weapon X test subjects. Weapon X is also shown {{to be associated with the}} <b>Void</b> (a maximum <b>security</b> mutant detention center that's similar to the Vault, but holds mutant criminals).|$|R
30|$|Finally, another {{challenge}} {{in the context of}} post-quantum public-key cryptosystems refers to potentially new implementation requirements or constraints. As mentioned before, hash-based signatures are very promising post-quantum candidates (given efficiency and security related to hash functions) but also lead to a new set of implementation challenges, such as the task of keeping the scheme state secure. In more details, most HBS schemes have private-keys (their state) that evolve along the time. If rigid state management policies are not in place, a signer can re-utilize the same private-key twice, something that would <b>void</b> the <b>security</b> guarantees offered by the scheme. Recently, initial works to address these new implementation challenges have appeared in the literature [91]. A recently introduced HBS construction [92] showed how {{to get rid of the}} state management issue at the price of much larger signatures. These examples indicate potentially new implementation challenges for PQC schemes that must be addressed by UbiComp systems architects.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the basic}} {{building}} blocks for working with strong encryption have become fairly widespread {{in the last few}} years, experience has shown that implementers frequently misuse them in a manner that <b>voids</b> their <b>security</b> properties. At least some of the blame lies with the tools themselves, which often make it unnecessarily easy to get things wrong. Just as no chainsaw manufacturer would think of producing a model without a finger-guard and cutoff mechanism, so security software designers need to consider safety features that will keep users from injuring themselves or others. This paper examines some of the more common problem areas that exist in crypto security software, and provides a series of design guidelines that can help minimise damage due to (mis-) use by inexperienced users. These issues are taken from extensive real-world experience with users of security software, and represent areas that frequently cause problems when the software is employed in practice. 1...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of Aqil's escape, the Ottomans were engaged in the Crimean War with the Russian Empire, which left a {{domestic}} <b>security</b> <b>void</b> in its provinces due to {{the large number of}} provincial troops deployed to Crimea. To restore security in the Galilee, Aqil was reassigned to his powerful post in the region in 1855. On his return to Palestine, Aqil's Hanadi tribesmen abandoned their conscription orders to serve with the Ottoman Army in the Crimean War and instead returned to Aqil's service. Aqil was once again charged with protecting the routes of rural Palestine and occasionally Transjordan. He was once commissioned to collect taxes from Karak.|$|R
50|$|Korea Military Academy (KMA) {{was founded}} on May 1, 1946 as South Joseon Defense Academy by National Defense Command, the {{predecessor}} of Ministry of National Defense of Republic of Korea, {{under the authority of}} then-U.S. military administration in South Korea. With the end of Pacific War and the subsequent disbandment of Imperial Japanese Army which had been occupying Korea since 1910, a <b>void</b> of indigenous <b>security</b> force has been created, while the pool of human resource was composed of various backgrounds, including the Imperial Japanese Army, Manchurian Army, and Korean Liberation Army. As a preparatory measure, the U.S. military administration opened Military Language School in Seoul on December 5, 1945 in order to train military interpreters as well as the new generation of commissioned officers with unified, predominantly American military doctrine.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} morphosyntax-based natural {{language}} watermarking scheme. In this scheme, a text is first {{transformed into a}} syntactic tree diagram where the hierarchies and the functional dependencies are made explicit. The watermarking software then operates on the sentences in syntax tree format and executes binary changes under control of Wordnet and Dictionary to avoid semantic drops. A certain level of security is provided via keycontrolled randomization of morphosyntactic tools and the insertion of <b>void</b> watermark. The <b>security</b> aspects and payload aspects are evaluated statistically while the imperceptibility is measured using edit hit counts based on human judgments. It is observed that agglutinative languages are somewhat more amenable to morphosyntaxbased natural language watermarking and the free word order property of a language, like Turkish, is an extra bonus. Key words: Natural language watermarking, treebank, agglutinative, morphosyntax, text payload 1...|$|R
5000|$|Abraham Cornelius {{appears in}} the X2: Wolverine's Revenge video game voiced by Don Morrow. This version of the {{character}} is far more sympathetic than the mainstream. He {{is seen as a}} Weapon X employee alongside Carol Hines. Both of them are sent on their way when Logan confronts Professor Thorton. When Wolverine returns to the Weapon X facility to find the cure for the Shiva Strain Virus (which acts as a failsafe implanted in Weapon X test subjects), he manages to find Abraham Cornelius and Carol Hines at the <b>Void</b> (a maximum <b>security</b> detention center for mutant criminals similar to the Vault) where they end up giving Wolverine the Part A info for the Shiva Strain Virus cure. Due to the Void Shield blocking Wolverine's contact with Professor X as Abraham Cornelius stated that the Void Shield prevents any psychic links to anyone, Wolverine ends up having to head outside to relay the info to him. Before heading to the roof, Wolverine warns Abraham Cornelius and Carol Hines that Sabretooth is in the Void and might be looking for them.|$|R
40|$|Within the European Union (EU), several {{instruments}} {{have been}} created at local, national and international level to monitor the movements of persons, goods and systems. The political justification of this vast expansion of surveillance instruments {{is based on the}} supposed need for security actors to predict and prevent <b>security</b> <b>voids.</b> In this article, we argue that the emergence of security clouds - the spray of data on individuals that floats between accumulated data-systems and networked surveillance instruments - present a considerable challenge to the governance of surveillance. The formally pronounced objects of combating crime and terror can be conceptualized as emerging forms of governance through surveillance and therefore influence societies deeper than merely in the field of security governance. Data which are fused in the security clouds can be stored for different purposes by different actors, acquire new functionalities and technical applications. The responsibility for surveillance technologies reaches beyond the scope of traditional scrutiny mechanisms, including parliaments, judicial authorities and civilian oversight bodies. The European, national, vertical and horizontal legal arrangements for transparency, access and data protection lack coherence and consistency. This article advocates a professional security ethic on top of a consolidated legal framework. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{provides}} {{new insights}} about security behaviour in selected U. S. and Irish organisations by investigating how organisational culture and procedural security countermeasures tend to influence employee security actions. An {{increasing number of}} information security breaches in organisations presents {{a serious threat to}} the confidentiality of personal and commercially sensitive data. While recent research shows that humans are the weakest link in the security chain and the root cause of a great portion of security breaches, the extant security literature tends to focus on technical issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on general deterrence theory and prior organisational culture literature. The methodology adapted for this study draws on the analytical grounded theory approach employing a constant comparative method. Findings: This paper demonstrates that procedural security countermeasures and organisational culture tend to affect security behaviour in organisational settings. Research limitations/implications: This paper fills the <b>void</b> in information <b>security</b> research and takes its place amongst the very few studies that focus on behavioural as opposed to technical issues. Practical implications: This paper highlights the important role of procedural security countermeasures, information security awareness, and organisational culture in managing illicit behaviour of employees. Social implications: Originality/value: This study extends general deterrence theory in a novel way by including information security awareness in the research model and by investigating both negative and positive behaviours...|$|R
5000|$|Wolverine fights {{his way to}} a cavern {{where the}} spirit of the Wendigo (Frank Welker) lives. Wolverine fights with Wendigo and wins. Wendigo gets up and throws Logan out of the cavern where he lands on snow. Logan sees a Weapon X truck and jumps on it. Logan reaches the Weapon X Facility and sneaks in. On the way in, he is ambushed by a group of GIs. The sound of gunfire starts and Wolverine is {{surprised}} that he is not shot. He then sees another GI who shot down the ambushers. When Wolverine asks him why he let him live by asking [...] "Am I supposed to thank you, or are you just a lousy shot?", the GI states, [...] "Lets just say it's not your time to die...yet." [...] Wolverine examines him a moment and he asks [...] "You're not quite human, are you?" [...] To which the GI states, [...] "You should talk." [...] As he walks away. After fighting through the base, he accesses a database and finds that the Weapon X scientists are at the <b>Void</b> (a maximum <b>security</b> mutant detention center that's similar to the Vault) so he makes his way there. Leaving, he is attacked by Sabretooth again. Sabretooth is defeated and grudgingly gives Wolverine the Part B of the virus cure after stating that he knew about the Shiva Virus a long time ago.|$|R
40|$|Internet {{has also}} become an active field of {{crackers}} and intruders. The whole development in this area can become null and <b>void</b> if fool-proof <b>security</b> of the data is not ensured without a chance of being adulterated. Dependence on the Internet as an information highway and knowledge bank is exponentially increasing so that a going back is beyond imagination. Transfer of critical information is also being carried out through the Internet. This widespread use of the Internet coupled with the tremendous growth in e-commerce and m-commerce has created a vital need for information security. The cornerstone of PLA is public key cryptography based digital signature which is added do every outgoing packet by the packet originator. Therefore, signature generation and verification schemes of PLA become infeasible in resource-constrained devices if dedicated hardware accelerator is not used. Hence studies were conducted on various types of algorithms being used in this area. Focus was given to identify the properties imparting security at this stage. By making use of a perception derived from these studies, new algorithms were designed. We present Wireless Packet Level Authentication (WPLA) that extends PLA to offer an adaptive hop-by-hop signature verification scheme. WPLA includes a lightweight signature verification approach for resource-constrained devices while retaining the public key cryptography based signature verification scheme for strong authentication. Furthermore, to ensure end-to-end data confidentiality over the unsecured channels, we integrate a symmetric encryption scheme along with secret key generation and distribution process. Finally, we implement the proposed solution and evaluate the performance of our implementation...|$|R
