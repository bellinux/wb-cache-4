50|$|A {{number of}} legends {{regarding}} <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> exploits exist. <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> {{first arrived in}} China at O-Mei Shan in Szechuan province. During his time there he became quite famous for his skill. Upon arrival on the Pearl River, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> was challenged by a pirate known as Cheung Po-Jai. Cheung was famous for robbing corrupt Qing Dynasty officials. After having defeated Cheung, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> accepted him as a student.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} lineage/tradition, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> is {{described}} as the 36th, 18th or 14th generation inheritor of the Lion's Roar system. There is a 350-year gap between Ah Dat-Ta and <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> and a troubling lack of information regarding this long period. However, we have very definite and established lineages once <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> began teaching in Guangdong province, Southern China. This is a brief summary {{of some of the}} prominent and still active lineages.|$|R
50|$|When the {{misunderstanding}} was corrected <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> {{offered to}} heal the leg using special Tibetan medical techniques and the two became friends. Wong Ping was so impressed by <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> that he asked the old monk to teach his son. Wong Yan-Lam studied {{for many years and}} achieved considerable skill under the direction of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung.</b> In addition to Lama Pai, Wong Yan Lam also learned the Lo Han Myuhn (Boddhisattva division) and Gam Gong Myuhn (Diamond division) internal methods and the Tibetan medical techniques.|$|R
40|$|A <b>vineyard</b> <b>sprayer</b> was {{calibrated}} using a lamellae patternator {{to produce}} either a “canopy pattern”, {{derived from the}} canopy outline, or a “projection pattern”, derived from projection of the canopy crosssection in the directions of the spray fluxes. Both calibration methods were compared with nozzle adjustment in the field, and applied in a hedgerow vineyard, at beginning of flowering and at full foliage development (berries pea-sized). Spray deposits at different heights on the canopy were determined by colorimetry, using a water-soluble dye (Tartrazine) as a tracer. The {{results showed that the}} “projection pattern” can be recommended for a general sprayer calibration performed at a public test centre with reference to a full foliage growth stage of the vine, but methods for sprayer calibration in the field are also necessary, owing to the difficulty of forecasting the canopy size and geometry at the earlier stages...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> (聖龍, also <b>Sing</b> Luhng, meaning [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] or [...] "Venerable Monk") was a Chinese martial artist.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{genealogy}} of Tibetan White Crane, [...] "Ng Mui" [...] is the Chinese {{name of the}} Tibetan monk Jikboloktoto, who was {{the last}} generation of transmission before <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung,</b> who brought the art to Guangdong. This account is most different from the others, with a male Ng Mui, {{the absence of a}} Manchu menace to flee from and, given the dating of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> relocation to Guangdong to 1865, a 19th-century setting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> taught many {{individuals}} his art of Lama Pai. It appears that {{only two of}} his students are primarily responsible for taking the style and spreading it throughout China: Wong Lam-Hoi (黃林开) and Wong Yan-Lam (王隐林). There were five other students who absorbed much of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung’s</b> teaching as well. They are responsible for spreading the style {{to other parts of}} China, but for one reason or another, kept fairly secret about their teachings.|$|R
5000|$|Wong Yan Lam 王隱林 {{was the son}} of a Shaolin Kung-Fu master {{known as}} Wong Ping. Wong Ping was {{something}} of a local legend, known as [...] "the bronze foot", and was fond of demonstrating his kung-fu in public. Because of this he came to the attention of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung.</b> One day <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> came down from the mountain and had an opportunity to observe Wong Ping's kung-fu. He was impressed by Wong Ping's skill and tried to tell him so but because <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> Chinese was not very good there was a misunderstanding. Wong Ping attacked Sing Luhng with a powerful leg sweep but the Tibetan monk utilized a technique known as [...] "GAM GONG HONG LUHNG". He leapt up into the air and landed on the leg, breaking Wong Ping's knee.|$|R

5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} lineage, the figure known as <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> is {{rendered}} in Chinese characters as either [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] (聖龍) or [...] "Star Dragon" [...] (星龍). From a Buddhist point of view, the [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] (聖龍) makes more logical sense {{and the use}} of the character for [...] "star" [...] (星) can easily be explained by the long established tradition of [...] "white characters" [...] in Chinese society, i.e. the use of a simpler character with the same phonetic sound. <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> also has an alias as Gam Ngau [...] "Golden Hook" [...] Leih Wu-Ji (Li Hu Ji) (金钩李胡子).|$|R
50|$|His name {{is more of}} a {{title that}} he was {{referred}} to by the Chinese monks. <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> traveled south to the Dinghu Mountain where he took shelter and became friends with the Buddhist monks of the Dinghu Temple in Guangdong (Canton) during 1865.|$|R
40|$|A new, two-row, air-assisted tunnel sprayer {{was tested}} in the {{vineyard}} in comparison to a conventional, broadcast sprayer. The tunnel was fitted with external axial flow fans (airflow rate: 2. 23 m 3 s 1 per row) and lamellate separating panels, designed to filter the excess spray and recover its liquid fraction for recycling, while discharging the air to the outside. Two field tests were performed, at end of flowering and beginning of ripening. Mean deposits on the leaves and on leaf undersides at twelve canopy locations (three height ranges, two depths and {{the two sides of}} the row) were assessed using a soluble colour dye (Tartrazine) as a tracer. Mean foliar deposition from the tunnel sprayer and the reference sprayerwas not statistically different at either growth stage. The tunnel sprayer gave increased deposit variability on leaf undersides in the first test, associated with uneven deposition over the canopy heights and significant differences between {{the two sides of the}} row. Thiswas corrected bya different adjustment of the nozzles and air outlets in the second test when, as a whole, the overall performances of both sprayers could be considered comparable. Penetration into the canopy was similar despite smaller airflow rate of the tunnel sprayer, and coverage of undersides was also comparable and in line with previous tests performed with air-assisted <b>vineyard</b> <b>sprayers.</b> The recycling rate of the tunnel sprayer was 50. 1...|$|R
40|$|Vertical spray patternators {{are used}} in Europe for the {{inspection}} and calibration of orchard and <b>vineyard</b> <b>sprayers.</b> However, little information is available about their reliability, particularly when used for crop-specific calibration, involving the adjustment of nozzle position and orientation according to canopy size and geometry. A method, based {{on the use of}} a lamellate patternator, was evaluated for adjusting the nozzle orientation of a conventional, axial-fan sprayer. The treatments included: (a) keeping the nozzle orientation as determined by the manufacturer (no calibration); (b) adjusting the nozzle orientation in the field, following visual observation (in-field calibration); and (c) adjusting the nozzles in order to obtain, on the lamellate patternator, a vertical spray pattern reflecting the canopy outline of the vineyard (patternator calibration). The above treatments were applied in a hedgerow vineyard, at beginning of flowering and at fruit set, and spray deposits on the canopy determined by colorimetry, using a water-soluble dye (Tartrazine) as a tracer. No calibration gave the most uniform deposit distribution in the first experiment, whereas in-field calibration was best in the second experiment. In both experiments, Patternator calibration gave the largest differences between deposits at different heights on the canopy, related to low collecting efficiency of the patternator, particularly at the middle and top canopy locations.

40|$|The current global {{population}} is 7. 2 billion. It {{is projected to}} increase by 1 {{billion over the next}} 12 years. There is only 5 % of usable farming land left on earth. Food is a resource that humans must consume daily. These facts undeniably lead to a shortage of food in the future. It is essential to mankind survival that farming becomes more efficient and sustainable. This provided the motivation to design a more efficient transmission for the Victair Mistifier (orchard and <b>vineyard</b> <b>sprayer).</b> Victair Mistifiers are designed, engineered, and manufactured by H. F. Hauff Company in Yakima, WA. The Hauff Company’s commitment to manufacturing the best sprayer on the market accompanied with the desire to address sustainable farming, are the driving forces behind this project. The scope of the project is to design, develop, and test a gearbox that optimizes the overall function of the sprayer. The gearbox simplifies the overall design of the sprayer, by replacing 19 major components with 8. This design decreases material costs, increases manufacturability, and decreases assembly time. The gearbox receives power from the tractor’s power take-off (PTO) via the input shaft. It transmits the power through machine elements to two shafts that will power fans. The fans will spin in opposite directions at an equal, desired rotational speed. The transmission will be enclosed in an engineered metal casted housing. The gearbox design was proven, by the prototype, to perform to specifications while maintaining an oil temperature of less than 90 degrees Celsius. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|In Europe it is {{estimated}} a viticulture surface of approximately 3 millions hectares {{and a number of}} sprayers used to apply pesticides in vineyards of more than 700000. Most of spray application techniques currently used in vineyards are still not optimised and this imply negative effects in terms of efficacy, environmental pollution and operator safety. Several studies (Balsari et al. 2008, Cerruto 2007, Da Silva et al. 2001; Pergher et al. 1997) have estimated that the pesticide deposited on the target is not more than 55 % of the volume sprayed and in several cases this value is only 20 % of total amount applied. Main causes of these high pesticide losses are the bad sprayers performances and the not correct choice of the operating parameters. To solve the first problem it is necessary to renew the sprayers (in several EU countries the average <b>vineyard</b> <b>sprayers</b> age is more than 15 years), to establish a mandatory certification of the performance of sprayers before they’re put on the market, as intended in the proposal of amendment of EU Machinery Directive, and to periodically inspect the functionality of sprayers in use (see EU Directive on Thematic Strategy for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides). More complex is the choice of the correct sprayer operating parameters, due also to the large number (more than 1000) of vineyard training systems in Europe. Several research results are reported, aimed at providing indications concerning the correct choice of fan air volume, nozzles flow rate and sprayer forward speed. It is also reported the advantage of leaf stripping technique in increasing the spray penetration into the canopy and in the bunches and the results obtained using a leaf-stripping machine able to apply pesticides at the same time. Finally some examples of new sprayers are mentioned, enabling to improve in future also the traceability of wines...|$|R

50|$|Fortunately, {{this debate}} {{can be put}} to rest quite quickly if one {{examines}} more closely the history of Lion's Roar. Ah Dat-Ta, the founder of Lion's Roar, is described as both ethnically Chinese (i.e. Han) and as living {{in what is now}} the province of Qinghai, situated in north western China, next to modern day Tibet. There is also reason to believe <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung,</b> the Buddhist monk who brought Lion's Roar to Guangdong, was raised and trained in Qinghai.

Chu Chi-Yu accepted only a few disciples and generally kept what he had learned concealed from the general public. Among his students were Chu Cheung, Lei Seung-Dong, and Chiu Dihk. These students continued to guard what they had learned very closely and only accept a few disciples. Chu Chi-Yu apparently also taught Nhg Siu-Chung for a period of time.|$|R
40|$|Administration of alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU) to rats causes {{damage to}} {{pulmonary}} endothelial cells and possibly mesothelial lining cells that together {{may account for}} the massive pleural effusion characteristic of thiourea toxicity. Using 35 S-thiourea as a model compound, the extent of binding of 35 <b>S</b> to <b>lung</b> proteins correlated well with the extent of edema, suggesting that the extent of binding of thiourea metabolites is a measure of lung toxicity. ANTU and phenylthiourea (PTU) compete for 35 <b>S</b> binding to <b>lung</b> slices, suggesting that these toxins may act in a similar way. Binding of 35 <b>S</b> in <b>lung</b> slices from resistant rats is much less than in controls, and resistance cannot be explained by differences in either whole body metabolism or redistribution of thiourea in vivo. Lung glutathione levels (in vitro and in vivo) in normal and resistant rats following thiourea administration were essentially the same. However, at doses of thiourea that cause pleural effusion, there was an increase in total lung glutathione...|$|R
