Two simple models {{have been used to}} study <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions</b> in these environments. Two-dimensional <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions</b> between co-rotating and counter-rotating vortices have been studied in [1] and references therein. Three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions</b> have been stud-ied in [2] and references therein. These studies focused on simple situations where certain symmetries in the initial conditions were assumed. Here, we consider more general, asym-metric interactions. We examine the interaction between two co-rotating vortices of unequal PV. The interaction depends on 5 parameters: the vortex volume ratio, the height-to-width aspect ratios, the vertical oset and the potential vorticity (PV) ratio. The parameter space is large, thus we need an ecient method to deal with the size of the problem. We rst use the Ellipsoidal Model (ELM) that models vortices as ellipsoids of uniform PV, and lters high-order non-ellipsoidal deformations. First, we determine equilibrium states, then we determine the margin of stability of these states. At this margin, we analyse the energy, the angular impulse, and the enstrophy of the ow. Finally, we examine the outcome of un-stable interactions solving the full quasi-geostrophic equations with the 'contour-advective semi-Lagrangian ' (CASL) algorithm. The QG equations ar...|$|E

Inviscid dynamics is addressed to show how core dynamics affects overall ring motion, and laminar vortex structures are described in two dimensions. Viscous and inviscid structures are related in terms of 'leapfrogging', head-on collisions, and collisions with a no-slip wall. Linear instability theory is shown to successfully describe observational data, although late stages in the breakdown are not completely understood.

In this field-theoretic model, <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions</b> are {{mediated}} by a single scalar gauge boson in its antisymmetric tensor formulation. We show that these long range <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions</b> induce a gauge invariant photon mass in the one-loop effective action. The fermion loop generates a coupling between photons and the vortex gauge boson, which acquires thus charge. This coupling represents also an induced, gauge invariant, topological mass for the photons, leading to the Meissner effect. The one-loop effective equations of motion for the charged vortex gauge boson are the London equations. We propose thus vortex gauge interactions as an alternative, topological mechanism for superconductivity in which no spontaneous symmetry breaking is involved.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and provides analysis of unsteady surface pressures {{measured on a}} model rotor blade as the blade experienced near parallel blade <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction</b> with a twin vortex system. To {{provide a basis for}} analysis, the vortex system was characterized by hot-wire measurements made in the interaction plane but {{in the absence of the}} rotor. The unsteady pressure response resulting from a single <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction</b> is then presented to provide a frame of reference for the twin vortex results. A series of twin <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction</b> cases are then presented and analyzed. It is shown that the unsteady blade pressures and forces are very sensitive to the inclination angle and separation distance of the vortex pair. When the vortex cores lie almost parallel to the blade chord, the interaction is characterized by a two-stage response associated with the sequential passage of the two cores. Conversely, when the cores lie on a plane that is almost perpendicular to the blade chord, the response is similar to that of a single <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction.</b> In all cases, the normal force response is consistent with the distribution of vertical velocity in the flow field of the vortex system. The pitching moment response, on the other hand, depends on the localized suction associated with the vortex cores as they traverse the blade chord...|$|R
40|$|The {{chopping}} of helicopter {{main rotor}} tip vortices {{by the tail}} rotor was experimentally investigated. This {{is a problem of}} blade <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction</b> (BVI) at normal incidence where the vortex is generally parallel to the rotor axis. The experiment used a model rotor and an isolated vortex and was designed to isolate BVI noise from other types of rotor noise. Tip Mach number, radical BVI station, and free stream velocity were varied. Fluctuating blade pressures, farfield sound pressure level and directivity, velocity field of the incident vortex, and blade <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction</b> angles were measured. Blade <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction</b> was found to produce impulsive noise which radiates primarily ahead of the blade. For interaction away from the blade tip, the results demonstrate the dipole character of BVI radiation. For BVI close to the tip, three dimensional relief effect reduces the intensity of the interaction, despite larger BVI angle and higher local Mach number. Furthermore, in this case, the radiation patern is more complex due to diffraction at and pressure communication around the tip...|$|R

The models were configured with landing flaps and flight spoilers to investigate the wake characteristics of these aircraft in ground effect at simulated full-scale distances of 19 m (62 ft) to 116 m (380 ft) above the ground.

40|$|Interactions {{between the}} blades and {{vortical}} structures within {{the wake of}} a helicopter rotor are a significant source of impulsive loading and noise, particularly in descending flight. Advances in the prediction and understanding of such blade <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions</b> have been aided in recent years by the extensive experimental dataset made available through the HART test programme. Brown’s Vorticity Transport Model was used to predict the rotor blade loading, the resultant wake system and the acoustic noise radiation for the HART II rotor. The vorticity conserving properties of the Vorticity Transport Model allow the detailed wake features that are associated with blade <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions</b> to be resolved. The experimental airload data, in particular the higher harmonic loading associated with blade <b>vortex</b> <b>interactions,</b> is matched well by the computations. The computed vorticity distribution in the wake also shows good correlation with the experimentally measured vortex positions. Including a representation of the fuselage within the computation yields marked improvement in the prediction of the vortex positions compared to similar calculations with an isolated rotor. An accoustic analysis, based on a Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings approach, is able to predict accurately the locations of the sound pressure maxima and the upstream attenuation of the sound radiated by the rotor. The principal discrepancies in airload, vortex position and acoustic prediction are confined almost exclusively {{to the rear of the}} advancing side of the rotor and, if errors in measuring the blade deflection can be discounted, may be due to minor inaccuracies in modelling the roll-up of the wake...|$|E

40|$|Unsteady rotor wake {{interactions}} with the empennage, tail boom, and other aerodynamic surfaces have a significant influence on the aerodynamic performance of the helicopter, ride quality, and vibration. A Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) method for computing the aerodynamic interaction between an interacting vortex wake and the viscous flow about arbitrary 2 -D bodies was developed to address this helicopter problem. The vorticity and flow field velocities are calculated on a body-fitted computational mesh using an uncoupled iterative solution. The interacting vortex wake is represented by an array of discrete vortices which, in turn, are represented by a finite core model. The evolution of the interacting vortex wake is calculated by Lagrangian techniques. The flow around circular and elliptic cylinders {{in the absence of}} an interacting vortex wake was calculated. These results compare very well with other numerical results and with results obtained from experiment and thereby demonstrate the accuracy of the viscous solution. The interaction of a simulated rotor wake with the flow about 2 -D bodies, representing cross sections of fuselage components, was calculated to address the <b>vortex</b> <b>interaction</b> problem.
