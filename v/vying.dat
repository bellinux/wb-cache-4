40|$|The use of victim impact {{evidence}} (<b>VIE)</b> {{has been}} a standard feature of capital trials since 1991, when the Supreme Court lifted the previously existing constitutional bar to such evidence. Legal scholars have almost universally condemned the use of <b>VIE,</b> criticizing it {{on a variety of}} grounds. Yet little empirical analysis exists that examines how <b>VIE</b> influences the course and outcome of capital trials. We analyze the influence of <b>VIE</b> based on interviews with over two-hundred jurors who sat on capital trials in South Carolina between 1985 and 2001. First, we describe the <b>VIE</b> introduced at sentencing trials, using a subset of the interviews that posed questions directly focusing on <b>VIE.</b> Second, we analyze a factor closely related to, and influenced by, <b>VIE</b> [...] a factor we refer to as victim admirability. We find evidence of a strong correlation between victim admirability and <b>VIE</b> use. Victim admirability substantially increases with the increased use and refinement of <b>VIE.</b> In addition, we find some correlation between victim admirability and jurors 2 ̆ 7 perceived seriousness of the crime. Our third topic focuses on sentencing outcomes. We study the relation between capital sentencing outcomes and <b>VIE</b> itself, as well as the relation between victim admirability [...] found to be influenced by <b>VIE</b> [...] and capital sentencing outcomes. We find no significant relation between increased victim admirability and juror capital sentencing votes, nor do we find a significant relation between the introduction of <b>VIE</b> and sentencing outcomes...|$|R
