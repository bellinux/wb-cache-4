40|$|Summary: The {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} the requirements for <b>veterinary</b> border <b>checks</b> and procedures as a key pillar for preventing the introduction of any risks to human and animal health into a country originating from imports or transits of live animals and products thereof. To a certain extent also rules on animal welfare during transport of live animals have been taken into account considering the possibility of bottlenecks at the veterinary border inspection posts. Specific criteria and conditions for efficient and effective <b>veterinary</b> border <b>checks</b> are already laid down in specific chapters of the OIE Codes. <b>Veterinary</b> border <b>checks</b> need an all-inclusive legal framework and require a competent and credible Veterinary Service both at central and border post level. In addition, an adequate infrastructure for carrying out the <b>veterinary</b> border <b>checks</b> is required, which {{should be based on}} a long-term strategy and be properly resourced. Furthermore, harmonised procedures for performing the <b>veterinary</b> border <b>checks</b> should be in place, be transparent and based on scientific evidence.

A good crew allows the rider a brief respite and time to concentrate all energies on the strategy and demands of the trail itself.|$|E

5000|$|Competitive trail riding (CTR) is an equestrian sport where riders cover {{a marked}} trail for a {{distance}} {{that is usually}} between 15 and 40 miles per day. Some rides are only one day long, others may run as long as three days. One-day six-mile events have also become popular.The goal of the competition is to demonstrate partnership between horse and rider. Unlike in endurance riding, factors other than speed are considered. If the ride is timed, it {{is a form of}} pace race; otherwise it is a judged trail ride. In a timed ride, horses may not come in under or over a certain time, and <b>veterinary</b> <b>checks,</b> rider behavior and other elements {{play a role in the}} placings.

50|$|Continuous {{efforts are}} made to ensure that each elephantâ€™s day and night beds are kept clean and proper health {{standards}} upheld. A daily <b>veterinary</b> <b>check</b> is carried out on each elephant which involves a foot sweep to check for foot rot, and the feeding of a vitamin dough ball containing all the vitamins and supplements each elephant requires. This process helps detect any medical concerns early, and if further medical attention is required, the foundation maintains a close working relationship with Dr. Ashoka Dangolla, a senior veterinarian from the University of Peradeniya.

Dog breeders in the country are [...] "effectively unregulated" [...] and the KC has no legislative power. This means that breeders can get away with breeding at the expense of welfare, be it pedigree or crossbreed breeders. It states that breed standards (revised with input from the veterinary profession) make it clear that exaggerated features are not acceptable. It will be introducing <b>veterinary</b> <b>checks</b> at shows starting with Crufts 2012 to ensure that judges only reward healthy dogs. The vet checks at Crufts proved controversial as 6 of the 15 high-profile breed champions that were subject to the checks failed them.

Moderate types of many breeds already exist, and the programme shows pictures of them and suggests embracing the Leavitt Bulldog and dumping the current show bulldogs, choosing the working Albany Basset over show Basset hounds, original Chinese Shar Pei over the wrinkly Western type, and working Neapolitan Mastiffs over show types. Evans states that {{it is not possible to}} make already genetically poor dogs better through beauty pageants, comparing it to [...] "polishing a turd".

40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{domestic}} trade in livestock, intra-communal trade across the European Union (EU) {{is subject to}} costly, additional veterinary measures. Short-distance transportation just across a border requires more measures than long-distance domestic transportation, while {{the need for such}} additional cross-border measures can be questioned. This study examined the prospects for cost reductions from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to trade within the cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL) and Germany (GER); that is, North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The study constructed a deterministic spread-sheet cost model to calculate the costs of both routine veterinary measures (standard measures that apply to both domestic and cross-border transport) and additional cross-border measures (extra measures that only apply to cross-border transport) as applied in 2010. This model determined costs by stakeholder, region and livestock sector, and studied the prospects for cost reduction by calculating the costs after the relaxation of additional cross-border measures. The selection criteria for relaxing these measures were (1) a low expected added value on preventing contagious livestock diseases, (2) no expected additional veterinary risks in case of relaxation of measures and (3) reasonable cost-saving possibilities. The total cost of routine veterinary measures and additional cross-border measures for the cross-border region was â‚¬ 22. 1 million, 58 % (â‚¬ 12. 7 million) of which came from additional cross-border measures. Two-thirds of this â‚¬ 12. 7 million resulted from the trade in slaughter animals. The main cost items were <b>veterinary</b> <b>checks</b> on animals (twice in the case of slaughter animals), export certification and control of export documentation. Four additional cross-border measures met the selection criteria for relaxation. The relaxation of these measures could save â‚¬ 8. 2 million (â‚¬ 5. 0 million for NL and â‚¬ 3. 2 million for GER) annually. Farmers would experience the greatest savings (99 %), and most savings resulted from relaxing additional cross-border measures related to poultry (48 %), mainly slaughter broilers (GER), and pigs (48 %), mainly slaughter pigs (NL). In particular, the trade in slaughter animals (dead-end hosts) is subject to measures, such as <b>veterinary</b> <b>checks</b> {{on both sides of the}} border that might not contribute to preventing contagious livestock diseases. Therefore, this study concludes that there are several possibilities for reducing the costs of additional cross-border measures in both countries...|$|E
5000|$|The {{marathon}} phase {{has three}} sections in international competition. Sections A and B may be driven at any pace, but normally {{will be at}} a trot. The transfer section is designed to get the competitors {{from the end of}} A to the start of B and enough time is given to complete this section at a walking pace. There is a compulsory rest halt {{at the end of the}} Transfer section, which may include a <b>veterinary</b> <b>check.</b> The marathon is not a race for speed. Each section has a maximum AND a minimum time allowed, giving a 2 to 3 minute [...] "window". If a competitor finishes outside this window (depending on which section is being driven), penalty points will be awarded. A competitor may also receive penalty points for not driving a section at the required pace.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of long-distance riding, {{competitive}} trail riding and endurance rides. In an endurance ride, discussed in this article, the winning horse {{is the first one}} to cross the finish line while stopping periodically to pass a <b>veterinary</b> <b>check</b> that deems the animal in good health and fit to continue. In the United States, most endurance rides are either 50 or 100 mi long. Shorter rides, called Limited Distance rides (LD), are organized for new riders to the sport or young horses being trained. However, LD's have evolved into a competition of their own, in which more experienced riders and horses also participate. There are also longer, usually multi-day, rides as well. As with human marathon running, many riders will participate to improve their horse's personal best performance and consider finishing the distance with a proper vet completion record to be a [...] "win". In the USA, the American Endurance Ride Conference (AERC) sanctions endurance rides. In the UK, Endurance GB is the governing body. Winning riders can complete 100 mi rides in 14 to 15 hours.|$|R
40|$|Eight {{horses were}} {{subjected}} to a 120 kilometer endurance rids. The eight horses {{were divided into two}} groups of four horses each. Eight days prior to competition the diet of the experimental group was supplemented daily with Plantago Psyllium at a dose of 0. 3 g/kg body weight/day. Blood samples were drawn for measuring haematocrit, total serum protein, sodium, potassium and chloride immediately {{before the start of the}} race and at the 40, 80 and 120 kilometre <b>veterinary</b> <b>check</b> points, In addition, the heart rate of the horses was recorded throughout the whole ride.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Health, disease, and immune {{function}} are key {{areas of research}} in studies of ecology and evolution, but work on free-ranging primates has been inhibited {{by a lack of}} direct noninvasive measures of condition. Here, we evaluate the potential usefulness of noninvasive measurement of three biomarkers, the acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin, and neopterin, a by-product of macrophage activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We took advantage of <b>veterinary</b> <b>checks</b> on captive rhesus (24) and long-tailed (3) macaques at the German Primate Center (DPZ) to analyze serum marker measures, before measuring concentrations in feces and urine, and evaluating relationships between matched serum, urine, and fecal concentrations. In a second study, we monitored excretion of these markers in response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and surgical tissue trauma, undertaken for a separate study. RESULTS: We found that each biomarker could be measured in each matrix. Serum and urinary concentrations of neopterin were strongly and significantly correlated, but neither haptoglobin nor CRP concentrations in excreta proxied circulating serum concentrations. Our infection study confirmed that urinary neopterin, in particular, is a reliable marker of viral infection in macaques, but also indicated the potential of urinary and fecal CRP and haptoglobin as indicators of inflammation. DISCUSSION: We highlight the potential of noninvasive markers of {{immune function}}, especially of urinary neopterin, which correlates strongly with serum neopterin, and is highly responsive to infection.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the relationships between microbial activity or biomass and chemical char- acteristics (i. e. heavy metal and organic matter contents) of a degraded urban soil. The study area is located in an urban park (about 10 ha, called Quarantena) near to the Fusaro Lake of Campi Fle- grei (Southern Italy); the Park was established in 1953 to shelter animals coming from any place of the Planet and execute <b>veterinary</b> <b>checks</b> before their delivery to different European zoos. In 1997, the park was abandoned and nowadays in it a large amount of urban wastes accumulates. Surface soils (0 - 10 cm) were sampled at three points: two of them covered by Holm Oak specimens (P 1 and P 2) and one covered by herbaceous species, particularly legumes (P 3). P 1 was localized at the border of the park and next to a busy road; P 2 at the centre of the Quarantena Park; P 3 at a gap area near the Fusaro Lake. The results showed that the soil sampled at P 1 showed the highest Cr and Ni concentrations; the soil sampled at P 3 had high levels of Cu and Pb, exceeding the threshold values of 100 Î¼g g- 1 d. w. fixed by the Italian law for urban soils, probably due to boat traffic, fishing practice and agricultural activities; the soil sampled at P 2 had interme- diate values of metal concentrations but the highest amount of organic matter (more than 20...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Reasons for {{performing}} study: Investigate {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) activity in equine plasma {{as a predictor of}} performance in endurance competitions and the effect of endurance exercise on ACE activity. Hypothesis: Precompetition values of ACE activity in equine blood are correlated with performance results and with heart rates pre- and post competition used as indicators of fitness. Endurance exercise increases ACE activity. Methods: Nineteen horses participating in an 80 km endurance competition had venous blood samples collected before and after the ride. ACE activity and total protein were measured in the blood samples and heart rates and finishing positions were recorded. Statistical analysis included paired t tests and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: Of the 19 horses enlisted, only 16 horses completed the ride. Of these 16, another 2 were disqualified at the last <b>veterinary</b> <b>check.</b> When the 16 horses were considered, precompetition heart rate, but not ACE, was correlated with finishing position. When only the 14 horses that were classified were considered, the association disappeared. ACE activity was similar before and after competition. Conclusions: Precompetition ACE activity in endurance horses competing in an 80 km event was not associated with either finishing position or heart rates before or after competition, indicating that the enzyme is not a good predictor of performance in this form of equestrian competition. Endurance competition did not significantly alter ACE activity in this group of horses...|$|R

40|$|Geriatric {{medicine}} is increasingly important in equine veterinary practice, as aged horses now represent a substantial {{proportion of the}} equine population. Although older horses may suffer from different health and welfare issues compared to younger animals, there is a paucity of reliable information on the prevalence of medical conditions and causes of mortality in geriatric horses in the UK. Additionally, previous {{studies have suggested that}} owner recognition of health and welfare problems in their aged horses may be suboptimal. A cross-sectional postal questionnaire survey of 918 randomly selected owners of veterinary-registered geriatric horses and ponies (aged ~ 15 years) provided detailed information on demographic characteristics, management practices, preventive health care measures, prevalence of owner-reported health problems and quality of life (QoL). Horses aged ~ 15 years represented 29 % of the equine population, with 2 % > 30 years old. The overall standard of management was high and there were changes in exercise and feeding practices with increasing horse age. However, the provision of several health care measures, including vaccination, farrier care and routine <b>veterinary</b> <b>checks</b> was reduced as geriatric horses increased in age. Owners frequently observed clinical signs of disease in their animals, with 77 % reporting at least one sign, yet a considerably smaller proportion of owners reported their animal currently suffered from a known disease or disorder (31 %). Detailed veterinary clinical examination of a subset of horses (n= 200) enrolled in the cross-sectional survey demonstrated dental disorders (95 %), ocular abnormalities (94 %), dermatological conditions (71 %) and musculoskeletal disease (lameness observed in 51 %) were particularly prevalent, with many animals having multiple disease conditions. Owners tended to underestimate body condition and clinical signs of diseases such as orthopaedic conditions or Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction frequently appeared to be considered as signs of senescence rather than attributed to a disease process. Relatively poor agreement of owner-reported disease compared to that detected on veterinary examination suggests inaccurate or under-recognition of health problems by owners of geriatric horses, which could lead to a delay in presentation for veterinary treatment. Owners reported that the majority of geriatric animals enjoyed a high quality of life (QoL), with 95 % rating their horse's QoL as good or excellent. However, increasing age corresponded negatively with many health-related QoL factors. QoL after the procedure, life-threatening disorders, painful/stressful procedures and veterinary advice were the most important factors in influencing owners' choice of treatment options for a severe illness or injury. To investigate mortality rates, causes of death or euthanasia and factors associated with mortality, horses from the cross-sectional study were enrolled in a cohort study in which follow-up information was obtained over an 18 -month period via telephone questionnaires. Overall mortality rate was 11. 1 (95 % C}, 9. 2 - 13. 2) per 100 horse-years at risk, increasing with increasing horse age. Lameness (24 %) and colic (21 %) were the most common reasons for euthanasia. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that factors associated with increased risk of mortality were breed (Cob/Cob cross and Thoroughbred/Thoroughbred cross), poor body condition, increasing number of owner- reported clinical signs {{and the degree to which}} pain limited normal daily activities. This is the first major study of health and welfare in geriatric horses in the United Kingdom. The reduced frequency of routine preventive health care measures, along with suboptimal owner recognition of health problems may lead to compromised welfare in the geriatric population. Owner perceptions of factors affecting QoL of geriatric horses may prove useful in the development of a QoL assessment tool for aging horses. Results presented in this thesis can be used to inform future veterinary involvement in geriatric equine medicine and in the development of targeted owner education programmes for geriatric health and welfare.

40|$|The {{absence of}} an {{adequate}} experimental animal modelÂ makes difficult study of immunity against whooping coughÂ and its pathogenesis. Experimental whooping cough reportedÂ by us earlier in pubescent non-human primates of the OldÂ World was accompanied by specific clinical and laboratoryÂ marks {{in the absence of}} cough. The possibility of pertussisÂ modelling while experimental whooping cough in impuberalÂ hamadryad baboons was investigated. In the process of selectionÂ of monkeys for the further studies for perfecting of experimentalÂ model for pertussis research unexpectedly wereÂ detected specific pertussis antibodies in impuberal hamadryadÂ baboons. The aim of the study: revealing of source of infection andÂ transmission of pertussis to hamadryad baboons and investigationÂ of response of antibody-positive impuberal hamadryadÂ baboons to secondary contagion by B. pertussis bacteriaÂ while experimental infection. Results. 18 <b>veterinary</b> <b>checked,</b> somatically healthy hamadryadÂ baboons of various gender managed in two neighboringÂ cages. Specific pertussis IgM and IgG antibodies wereÂ found in blood serum of all the animals and one of the monkeyÂ keepers. By real-time PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs ofÂ the monkey keeper and three 7 - and 9 -month-old hamadryadÂ baboons were registered single B. pertussis genom equivalents. Â Seropositive impuberal hamadryad baboons were experimentallyÂ challenged by virulent B. pertussis 475 strain. Â Quantity of B. pertussis genom equivalents and percentageÂ of IgM and IgG antibodies in impuberal hamadryad baboonsÂ after experimental infection were detected.

40|$|A live-stranded harbor {{porpoise}} Phocoena phocoena {{was found}} on the west coast of the Dutch island Texel (North Sea) and transported to a rehabilitation center for small cetaceans, where it underwent a <b>veterinary</b> health <b>check.</b> Cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic cardiac murmur with the point of maximal intensity in the right hemithorax with an intensity of IV out of VI. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a congenital ventricular septal defect with left-to-right shunting. Because the left atrium was not dilated according to the reference range of canine left atrium to aortic ratio, the presence of congestive heart failure was considered very unlikely. Therefore, this congenital cardiac anomaly was thought to be a clinically non-relevant incidental finding and would not explain the weakness, coughing, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Because the animal was still unable to swim or eat by itself after 2 wk of supportive care, it was euthanized. Post-mortem examination confirmed the presence of a ventricular septal defect. The weight of the heart relative to the animal's length was greater than expected, using linear regression analysis on the lengths and cardiac weights of 71 other stranded wild harbor porpoises without macroscopic cardiac pathologic changes. This finding suggests that the left ventricle had an eccentric hypertrophy because of volume overload resulting from the intracardiac shunt. This is the first report of a congenital cardiac anomaly and its ante-mortem diagnosis in this species.

40|$|A dog's {{nutrient}} requirements can theoretically be met from {{a properly}} balanced meat-free diet; however, proof {{for this is}} lacking. Exercise places additional demands on the body, and dogs fed a meat-free diet may be at increased risk of developing sports anaemia. We hypothesised that exercising dogs would remain in good health and not develop anaemia when fed a nutritionally balanced meat-free diet. To this end, twelve sprint-racing Siberian huskies were fed either a commercial diet recommended for active dogs (n 6), or a meat-free diet formulated to the same nutrient specifications (n 6). The commercial diet contained 43 % poultry meal, whereas soyabean meal and maize gluten made up 43 % of the meat-free diet, as the main protein ingredients. Dogs were fed these diets as their sole nutrient intake for 16 weeks, including 10 weeks of competitive racing.

40|$|Background: Recent work on {{non-human}} primates {{indicates that}} the allocation of social attention is mediated by characteristics of the attending animal, such as social status and genotype, {{as well as by}} the value of the target to which attention is directed. Studies of humans indicate that an individualâ€™s emotion state also plays a crucial role in mediating their social attention; for example, individuals look for longer towards aggressive faces when they are feeling more anxious, and this bias leads to increased negative arousal and distraction from other ongoing tasks. To our knowledge, no studies have tested for an effect of emotion state on allocation of social attention in any non-human species. Methodology: We presented captive adult male rhesus macaques with pairs of adult male conspecific face images- one with an aggressive expression, one with a neutral expression- and recorded gaze towards these images. Each animal was tested twice, once during a putatively stressful condition (i. e. following a <b>veterinary</b> health <b>check),</b> and once during a neutral (or potentially positive) condition (i. e. a period of environmental enrichment). Initial analyses revealed that behavioural indicators of anxiety and stress were significantly higher after the health check than during enrichment, indicating that the former caused a negative shift in emotional state. Principle Findings: The macaques showed initial vigilance for aggressive faces across both conditions, but subsequent responses differed between conditions. Following the health check, initial vigilance was followed by rapid and sustaine...|$|R
40|$|OVERVIEW : Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) is a retrovirus {{closely related to}} human {{immunodeficiency virus}}. Most felids are susceptible to FIV, but humans are not. Feline immunodeficiency virus is endemic in domestic cat populations worldwide. The virus loses infectivity quickly outside the host and is susceptible to all disinfectants. INFECTION : Feline immunodeficiency virus is transmitted via bites. The risk of transmission is low in households with socially well-adapted cats. Transmission from mother to kittens may occur, especially if the queen is undergoing an acute infection. Cats with FIV are persistently infected {{in spite of their}} ability to mount antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. DISEASE SIGNS : Infected cats generally remain free of clinical signs for several years, and some cats never develop disease, depending on the infecting isolate. Most clinical signs are the consequence of immunodeficiency and secondary infection. Typical manifestations are chronic gingivostomatitis, chronic rhinitis, lymphadenopathy, weight loss and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. DIAGNOSIS : Positive in-practice ELISA results obtained in a low-prevalence or low-risk population should always be confirmed by a laboratory. Western blot is the 'gold standard' laboratory test for FIV serology. PCR-based assays vary in performance. DISEASE MANAGEMENT : Cats should never be euthanased {{solely on the basis of}} an FIV-positive test result. Cats infected with FIV may live as long as uninfected cats, with appropriate management. Asymptomatic FIV-infected cats should be neutered to avoid fighting and virus transmission. Infected cats should receive regular <b>veterinary</b> health <b>checks.</b> They can be housed in the same ward as other patients, but should be kept in individual cages. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS : At present, there is no FIV vaccine commercially available in Europe.

40|$|OVERVIEW: Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) is a retrovirus {{closely related to}} human {{immunodeficiency virus}}. Most felids are susceptible to FIV, but humans are not. Feline immunodeficiency virus is endemic in domestic cat populations worldwide. The virus loses infectivity quickly outside the host and is susceptible to all disinfectants. INFECTION: Feline immunodeficiency virus is transmitted via bites. The risk of transmission is low in households with socially well-adapted cats. Transmission from mother to kittens may occur, especially if the queen is undergoing an acute infection. Cats with FIV are persistently infected {{in spite of their}} ability to mount antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. DISEASE SIGNS: Infected cats generally remain free of clinical signs for several years, and some cats never develop disease, depending on the infecting isolate. Most clinical signs are the consequence of immunodeficiency and secondary infection. Typical manifestations are chronic gingivostomatitis, chronic rhinitis, lymphadenopathy, weight loss and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. DIAGNOSIS: Positive in-practice ELISA results obtained in a low-prevalence or low-risk population should always be confirmed by a laboratory. Western blot is the 'gold standard' laboratory test for FIV serology. PCR-based assays vary in performance. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: Cats should never be euthanased {{solely on the basis of}} an FIV-positive test result. Cats infected with FIV may live as long as uninfected cats, with appropriate management. Asymptomatic FIV-infected cats should be neutered to avoid fighting and virus transmission. Infected cats should receive regular <b>veterinary</b> health <b>checks.</b> They can be housed in the same ward as other patients, but should be kept in individual cages. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS: At present, there is no FIV vaccine commercially available in Europe. Potential benefits and risks of vaccinating FIV-infected cats should be assessed on an individual cat basis.

5000|$|Collie eye anomaly (CEA), {{a genetic}} disease which causes {{improper}} {{development of the}} eye and possible blindness, is a common ailment in the breed. More rarely, Rough Collies can be affected by progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), another genetic disease in which bilateral degeneration of the retina results in progressive vision loss culminating in blindness. Through genetic testing and careful screening program it would be theoretically possible to eradicate both of these problems in purebred lines, however, certainly in the UK, the Kennel Club does not require these tests to be done either for registration or showing. CEA is so prevalent that elimination of affected dogs except through very slow and careful breeding decisions to avoid shrinking the gene pool more than absolutely necessary. Rough Collie puppies should be screened {{at an early age}} (6-8 weeks) by a certified <b>veterinary</b> ophthalmologist to <b>check</b> for CEA. PRA has a later onset and can be detected by DNA test, but is much less widespread (in the US) than CEA. (In the UK, PRA is more common.) [...] Note, the UK Kennel Club [...] "Accredited Breeder Scheme" [...] requires eye tests and recommends the genetic test for this class of members, [...]|$|R
