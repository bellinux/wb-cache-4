50|$|A new ACD Version-II, {{now called}} the Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), is under {{development}} by The Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO). Unlike ACD, which {{is more of a}} distributed system which acts independently, the TCAS will be more of a centralized system where TCAS controls communication between trains and with trains with the TDMA protocol. The TCAS under development is meant to be a <b>vital</b> <b>safety</b> system. TCAS has a deep coupling with the railway signalling system so ACD systems do not depend on the railway signalling system.|$|E
50|$|A Vehicle Fire Suppression System is a fire {{suppression}} system installed on any type of vehicle. They are especially prevalent in the mobile heavy equipment segment. These systems are designed to protect mobile equipment from fire damage and related losses. These pre-engineered systems are designed per {{the parameters of the}} individual machine.

50|$|These {{inspections}} {{were originally}} intended to supplement Flag State exam programs, but experience taught that port state inspections were essential to ensuring the safety of vessels engaged in worldwide commerce, especially if these exams were organized on a regional basis. Since ships move cargo from port to port and country to country, it {{was found to be}} to every nation's advantage if inspections could be closely coordinated. To facilitate information exchange, the Coast Guard developed the Maritime Information Exchange and Port State Information Exchange systems to share <b>vital</b> <b>safety</b> information with fellow port states and shipping companies. The results of safety inspections and ship specific information are still recorded and made public in these systems. This transparency of information helps to ensure that as many ships as possible are inspected {{while at the same time}} prevents ships from being delayed by unnecessary, redundant inspections. These information systems were developed jointly with the maritime industry to facilitate safe commerce.|$|E
5000|$|The firm {{represented}} victims {{from the}} TWA 800 disaster and Lee Kreindler (d. 2003) {{was one of}} the first to claim that the disaster was caused by mechanical problem, and not a missile or bomb. He argued that <b>vital</b> <b>safety</b> checks were not enforced, saying; [...] "The mandate requires a full engine survey. This one was re-certified immediately, without a survey. It was stamped and approved in a day." [...] Mr. Kreindler was appointed to chair the plaintiffs committee charged with prosecuting the action and the firm, along with other members of the committee, successfully prosecuted the action. The action gave rise to a notable ruling when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the crash had not occurred on the [...] "high seas" [...] as that term is defined in the law and that therefore the restrictive Death on the High Seas Act did not limit plaintiffs' damages. TWA 800 ultimately caused Congress to modify the Death on the High Seas Act to provide for non-economic damages.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 the S-Bahn, or Stadtbahn (City Railway), arrived. The {{idea for}} a North-South Link rapid transit rail line from Unter den Linden to Yorckstrasse, via Potsdamer Platz and Anhalter Bahnhof, had first been mooted in 1914, {{but it was not}} planned in detail until 1928, and then {{approval}} had to wait until 1933. Begun in 1934, it was plagued with disasters. Determination to have it finished in time for the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936 meant <b>vital</b> <b>safety</b> measures were ignored: on 20 August 1935, a tunnel collapse just south of the Brandenburg Gate buried 23 workmen of whom only four survived; then on 28 December 1936, a fire near the Potsdamer Platz station destroyed vital equipment. Needless to say, the line was not ready for the Berlin Olympics; in fact it was another three years before it first saw public use. In spite of all the setbacks, it was opened from Unter den Linden to Potsdamer Platz on 15 April 1939, extended to Anhalter Bahnhof on 9 October, and then to Yorckstrasse, to complete the link, on 6 November. The Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station also contained an underground shopping arcade, the largest in Europe.|$|E

30|$|Since {{broadcasting}} usually lacks a feedback channel, repetition coding {{of safety}} message is {{proposed in the}} WAVE standard [7]. However, {{it is known that}} repetition codes have shortcomings such as high latency and inefficient use of bandwidth that leads to network congestion problems. With the development of fountain codes that are most suitable for broadcasting, these codes have recently been studied for vehicular communications [8 – 10]. However, their work steers towards I 2 V communication for non-safety value-added services. This article focuses on fountain codes for safety applications which provide a very short latency and highly reliable V 2 V exchanges by broadcasting <b>vital</b> <b>safety</b> messages to all surrounding vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, robots {{interact}} {{more frequently}} with a dynamic environment outside limited manufacturing sites and {{in close proximity}} with humans. Thus, safety of motion and obstacle avoidance are <b>vital</b> <b>safety</b> features of such robots. We formally study two safety properties of avoiding both stationary and moving obstacles: (i) passive safety, which ensures that no collisions can happen while the robot moves, and (ii) the stronger passive friendly safety in which the robot further maintains sufficient maneuvering distance for obstacles to avoid collision as well. We use hybrid system models and theorem proving techniques that describe and formally verify the robot’s discrete control decisions along with its continuous, physical motion. Moreover, we formally prove that safety can still be guaranteed despite location and actuator uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Traffic {{monitoring}} systems are <b>vital</b> for <b>safety</b> and traffic optimization. However, these systems may compromise {{the privacy of}} drivers once they track the position of each driver {{with a high degree}} of temporal precision. In this paper, we argue that aggregated data can protect location privacy while providing accurate information for traffic monitoring. We identify a range of aggregate query types. Our proposed Privacy Aware Monitoring System (PAMS) works as an aggregate query processor that protects the location privacy of drivers as it anonymizes the IDs of cars. Our experiments show that PAMS answers queries with high accuracy and efficiency.
