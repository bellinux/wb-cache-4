40|$|Abstract—Antenna {{diversity}} {{is a well-known}} technique used {{to improve the quality}} and reliability of a wireless link. In vehicular networks, a different approach to antenna {{diversity is}} needed due to their unique channel characteristics. However, this issue has not been actively researched, especially for the positioning of antennas. In this paper, we highlight the benefit of <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> over traditional horizontal diversity techniques in vehicular network environments. Through experiments using IEEE 802. 11 a radios in the 5. 2 GHz band, we first show the difference of attenuation patterns from various antenna positions installed in a vehicle, then we show the benefit of <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> by quantifying the diversity gains and combined error rates. This finding has implications for the future position of antenna installation in vehicles.

By adopting Grossman and Maggi's (2000) model to a framework of growth, it shows first that diversity is conducive to growth. As the main innovation, a notion of communication gap is introduced among workers. It is shown that if <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> is sufficiently high relative to the communication gap, the growth rate may not increase with diversity; there may be an inverse-U shaped relationship. ...|$|E

However, the relationship with process innovation, R&D intensity, and product innovation intensity is insignificant or even negative. These results {{are in line with}} the idea that <b>vertical</b> educational <b>diversity</b> enhances the creative moment of the invention phase, while it might affect the commercialization phase negatively due to the dominance of coordination and communication costs relative to the gains in creativity...|$|R

The diversity is more important in offshore stations than in coastal area, notably at the thermocline. The vertical distribution of nutrients is almost homogeneous whereas an increasing surface gradient toward the offshore area was detected for both temperature and salinity.

MalaMala (a concession within Sabi Sand Wildtuin, a private game reserve), and an adjacent {{area in the}} Kruger National Park (Kruger, statutory protected area) in South Africa provide a comparison {{of different types of}} conservation management. We measured three-dimensional woody vegetation structure, as an integral component of biodiversity, across 6200 ha in the two reserves using a LiDAR (Light-Detection-and-Ranging) sensor. We compared how different management approaches in the two reserves affected woody structural <b>diversity.</b> <b>Vertical</b> canopy <b>diversity</b> was measured using: i) percent cover of woody vegetation extracted from LiDAR canopy height models, ii) a volumetric pixel (voxel) approach to extract 3 D vertical canopy-height profiles; and iii) horizontal diversity using landscape metrics. MalaMala had higher vegetation density than Kruger in the 6 m (2. 7 times) height classes. This vegetation was in the form of larger, more cohesive patches {{as a result of the}} legacy of previous land-use (cattle ranching) and current management practices (bush clearing) and the recent increase in megaherbivores. Length of exposure to, and recent higher densities of, megaherbivores (particularly elephants) has altered the density of tall trees in the two reserves, thus affecting structural heterogeneity and associated habitat options for small-bodied vertebrates. These differences in vegetation structure are exacerbated by current management practices (e. g. bush-clearing and fire regime), with potential implications for faunal biodiversity conservation across a wide range of scales...|$|R

We conducted a large-scale crowd-sourced user study, with more than $ 700 $ unique searchers, to investigate the effects of entity cards on search behaviour and perceived workload.

As result pages become more complex, click models evolve as well in order to capture additional aspects of user behavior in response to new forms of result presentation. We propose a method for evaluating the intuitiveness of vertical-aware click models, namely {{the ability of a}} click model to capture key aspects of aggregated result pages, such as vertical selection, item selection, result presentation and <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity.</b> This method allows us to isolate model components and therefore gives a multi-faceted view on a model’s performance. We argue that our method can be used in conjunction with traditional click model evaluation metrics such as log-likelihood or perplexity. In order to demonstrate the power of our method in situations where result pages can contain more than one type of vertical (e. g., Image and News) we extend the previously studied Federated Click Model such that it models user clicks on such pages.

High plant species diversity is often cited as an important characteristic of riparian areas. Graphical summaries, principal components analysis, and analysis of variance were used on species composition and abundance data to determine community patterns in riparian areas and surrounding uplands. Woody plant composition varied with relative elevation above the primary channel, but herbaceous composition appeared unaffected by proximity to the riparian area. Alpha diversity indices, richness, Shannon's H', and Simpson's D, were not always higher within the riparian area. Alpha diversity of woody plants demonstrated no consistent pattern, however <b>vertical</b> structural <b>diversity</b> was highest near the stream. Herbaceous plants showed increased diversity in floodplain sites and decreased diversity in hillslopes sites, suggesting that topographical profile influenced diversity.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Characterization of canopy structure, the {{horizontal}} and vertical distribution of the tree crowns in a forest, {{is important for the}} management of forests in the Pacific Northwest. The canopy is an important habitat element for many wildlife species, canopy structure affects understory development, and influences various natural processes, such as the intensity of propagation of wildfire. Thus, improving our understanding of canopy structures and trends can aid forest management. The overall goal {{of this study was to}} characterize vertical and horizontal canopy structure for multiple forest groups in western Oregon. The specific objectives were to: 1) characterize vertical and horizontal canopy structure for dominant forest types in western Oregon, 2) evaluate methods for measuring canopy cover and structure, 3) compare methods to predict forest canopy cover and <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> using standard inventory measurements, and 4) predict bird species occurrence with different canopy diversity measures. I evaluated patterns of vertical and horizontal canopy structure and understory cover along a successional gradient using 934 forested plots in western Oregon. Observed data were from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program from the 1995 - 97 survey on private and non-federal public lands. Patterns were examined for wet-conifer, wet-hardwood, and dry-hardwood forests. The upper tree canopy layer contributed the most to total cover except in the dry-hardwood stands, where the vertical distribution of tree cover was more evenly distributed. However, mean canopy cover rarely exceeded 85...|$|E
40|$|This PNVG is {{developed}} specific to north central Minnesota outwash plains in {{the proximity of}} the Chippewa National Forest. Landscape is level to rolling. Soil structure is comprised mostly of loamy sand. Local water table is generally more than 100 cm below the soil surface. Soils are moderately to excessively drained. Soil moisture is moderately dry. Vegetation Description Historically, this PNVG had a jack pine, red pine, and white pine supercanopy either alone or as mixed pines. Deciduous trees usually occurred as a subcanopy comprised of quaking aspen, paper birch, northern red oak, bur oak, red maple, and bigtooth aspen. These deciduous trees grow to merchantable size and, in the absence of pines, the deciduous trees would form a cover type. The mature condition was typically a mix of pines and deciduous trees, frequently with two pine species and a subordinate canopy of three deciduous species. The pine coverage would be 50 % to 75 %, with the deciduous species making up the balance. <b>Vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> is definitely a part of these mature and older forests in this system. Oak species and red maple are present at higher levels than aspen and birch in the seedling/sapling size class.

40|$|Trophic {{shifts of}} generalist {{consumers}} can have broad food-web and biodiversity consequences through altered trophic flows and <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity.</b> Previous studies have used trophic shifts {{as indicators of}} food-web responses to perturbations, such as species invasion, and spatial or temporal subsidies. Resource pulses, {{as a form of}} temporal subsidies, {{have been found to be}} quite common among various ecosystems, affecting organisms at multiple trophic levels. Although diet switching of generalist consumers in response to resource pulses is well documented, few studies have examined if the switch involves trophic shifts, and if so, the directions and magnitudes of the shifts. In this study, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes with a Bayesian multi-source mixing model to estimate proportional contributions of three trophic groups (i. e. producer, consumer, and fungus-detritivore) to the diets of the White-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) receiving an artificial seed pulse or a naturally-occurring cicadas pulse. Our results demonstrated that resource pulses can drive trophic shifts in the mice. Specifically, the producer contribution to the mouse diets was increased by 32 % with the seed pulse at both sites examined. The consumer contribution to the mouse diets was also increased by 29 % with the cicadas pulse in one of the two grids examined. However, the pattern was reversed in the second grid, with a 13 % decrease in the consumer contribution with the cicadas pulse. These findings suggest that generalist consumers may play different functional roles in food webs under perturbations of resource pulses.

We utilised LiDAR metrics to estimate plot-scale structural parameters of subtropical rainforest and eucalypt-dominated open forest in topographically dissected landscape in north-eastern Australia. This study is considered an extreme application of LiDAR technology for structurally complex subtropical forests in complex terrain. A total of 31 LiDAR metrics of vegetation functional parameters were examined. Multiple linear regression models were able to explain 62 % of the variability associated with basal area, 66 % for mean diameter at breast height, 61 % for dominant height and 60 % for foliage projective cover in subtropical rainforest. In contrast, mean height (adjusted r² = 0. 90) and dominant height (adjusted r² = 0. 81) were predicted with highest accuracy in the eucalypt-dominated open canopy forest. Nevertheless, the magnitude of error for predicting structural parameters of vegetation was much higher in subtropical rainforest than those documented in the literature.

40|$|Human {{land use}} {{legacies}} have significant and long-lasting ecological impacts across landscapes. Investigating ancient (> 400 years) legacy {{effects can be}} problematic due to the difficulty in detecting specific, historic land uses, especially those hidden beneath dense canopies. Caracol, the largest (~ 200 km 2) Maya archaeological site in Belize, was abandoned ca. A. D. 900, leaving behind myriad structures, causeways, and an extensive network of agricultural terraces that persist beneath the architecturally complex tropical forest canopy. Airborne LiDAR enables the detection of these below-canopy archaeological features while simultaneously providing a detailed record of the aboveground 3 -dimensional canopy organization, which is indicative of a forest’s ecological function. Here, this remote sensing technology is {{used to determine the}} effects of ancient land use legacies on contemporary forest structure. Canopy morphology was assessed by extracting LiDAR point clouds (0. 25 ha plots) from LiDAR-identified terraced (n = 150) and non-terraced (n = 150) areas on low (0 °– 10 °), medium (10 °– 20 °), and high (> 20 °) slopes. We calculated the average canopy height, canopy openness, and <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> from the LiDAR returns, with topographic features (i. e., slope, elevation, and aspect) as covariates. Using a PerMANOVA procedure, we determined that forests growing on agricultural terraces exhibited significantly different canopy structure from those growing on non-terraced land. Terraces appear to mediate the effect of slope, resulting in less structural variation between slope and non-sloped land and yielding taller, more closed, more vertically diverse forests.

40|$|Carnivores have a {{key role}} in {{ecosystems}} and their populations are declining at an increasing rate. Habitat loss and degradation through agricultural practices are among the most serious menaces affecting carnivore survival. Agricultural landscapes are dominant in Western Europe and in several places worldwide are changing quickly into more intensive practices. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how small carnivore occurrence and abundance is affected by these changes in order to find ways to manage agricultural and grazing systems in a sustainable way, allowing both biodiversity and production to co-exist. We present three case studies in Natura 2000 areas, mainly covered by private agricultural land (livestock, cereal crops, oak, pine and eucalyptus plantations) in southern Portugal. In areas of dominant traditional agro–silvo–pastoral systems (montado) small and middle-sized carnivores tend to occur in a mosaic of montado and shrubs. We found that the occurrence of one of the forest species was positively related with the density of trees and shrubs, soil organic matter content, and Shannon’s index of vegetation <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity.</b> The presence of livestock and extension of game-estate areas also seem to influence carnivore occurrence. In areas of extensive cereal crops, the presence of shrubs and age of forest plantations play an important positive role for the carnivore community. Mainly our results suggest that maintaining a sustainable mosaic embracing montado, shrubland and open land areas, may allow higher species richness and abundance by enhancing connectivity between crucial areas. The implementation of this kind of agricultural practices considering the landowners needs is the key issue to achieve the main carnivore conservation goals in Southern Portugal...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Leaf litter degradation {{in fresh}} waters {{is a fundamental}} ecosystem process performed by {{a wide array of}} decomposers. The meiofauna is an important component of aquatic heterotrophic assemblages, which can provide a trophic link between plant detritus and associated microbial and macroinvertebrate communities, but their contribution to leaf breakdown remains poorly understood. 2. We hypothesised that, through their feeding activity, microcrustaceans influence the structure of fungal assemblages and consequently microbially mediated litter breakdown. Litter-associated microcrustaceans were predicted to change the pathways of energy transfer in the food web according to the positive (e. g. complementarity) or negative (e. g. predation) interactions with macroinvertebrate detritivore taxa. 3. We evaluated experimentally in the laboratory, over 6 and 13 days, the potential contribution of two freshwater microcrustaceans (a cladoceran and a copepod) to litter breakdown in the presence of microfungi (aquatic hyphomycetes), with and without macroinvertebrate detritivores (a trichopteran and a gammarid amphipod). 4. The presence of microcrustaceans enhanced leaf mass loss by 62 and 22 % in treatments with fungi or trichopteran alone, respectively, while no significant effect was observed for treatments with the amphipod. Microcrustaceans strongly increased the production of fine particulate organic matter, particularly in treatments with fungi alone (+ 637 %). The leaf consumption rate by the amphipod significantly decreased (61 %) at 13 days in the presence of microcrustaceans, likely due to predation on cladocerans. 5. Our study supports the potential role of microcrustaceans in the detrital food web of streams and rivers. Interestingly, microcrustaceans may interact with microbial and macroinvertebrate decomposers in either positive or negative ways. Therefore, microcrustaceans add complexity to detrital food webs by increasing <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> and modulating biotic interactions with important consequences for carbon and energy transfers in stream ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of nematode communities to the sedimentation of a spring phytoplankton bloom in a sandy, well-oxygenated sediment {{at a single}} station (station 330) in the Southern North Sea was investigated monthly from early March to July 1999. Both structural (nematode density, <b>diversity,</b> <b>vertical</b> distribution and community composition) and functional (feeding type distributions, number of species within feeding groups) characteristics showed considerable changes shortly after the arrival of fresh organic material at the sediment surface. The general increase in numerical densities and diversity was related to changes within the groups of selective deposit-feeding and epistrate-feeding nematodes. It is hypothesised that sedimentation and subsequent remineralisation of fresh organic matter during the spring phytoplankton bloom result in an increase of suitable food items (both living and dead).

Contributions to carbon cycling were also estimated for several taxa. Few animals showed significant seasonal differences in abundance. Abundances and distributions of many taxa varied geographically, {{with some of these}} showing decreasing abundance with increasing distance from shore. Oxygen concentrations and the strength of the OMZ were important in determining geographical and <b>vertical</b> distributions. <b>Diversity</b> of macrozooplankton and micronekton differed between three different oxygen concentration categories. Highest diversity occurred in the most oxygenated water at stations with a strong OMZ. The lower OMZ interface, where oxygen concentrations rose from 0. 15 to 0. 1 ml l− 1, was characterized by high abundance of a few taxa, especially the fish Cyclothone spp. and the decapod Gennadas sordidus. Diversity in the lowest oxygen waters (3 ̆c 0. 14 ml O 2 l− 1) varied between day and night. Diversity in this zone was strongly influenced by diel vertical migrators, found in the core of the OMZ (∼ 300 – 500 m) during the day. This resulted in dominance by a few taxa during the day.

Variables that were included in the best models then were used in a variation partitioning procedure to determine the relative influence of each variable set on the presence of the genet. When considered together, all the variables captured 56. 5 % of the variance in genet occurrence within the study area. The set of ecological variables accounted for most of the explained variance (pure effect: 30. 3 %). In the best ecological model, the occurrence of the genet was positively related to the density of trees and shrubs in the dominant agro–silvo–pastoral system (montado), to soil organic matter, and to Shannon’s index of <b>vertical</b> vegetation <b>diversity.</b> Human influence factors (pure effect: 4. 8 %) highlighted the negative relationship between the presence of the genet and the proportion of game-estate areas.

This causeway was not built on pilings, but by land reclamation; hence, it now acts as a long, thin peninsula. The construction of this causeway was previously shown to have influenced the surrounding marine ecosystem, causing ecosystem fragmentation and loss of water circulation. In this study, we collected sediment cores (n = 10) from five paired sites in 1 m water depths. Each pair of sites consisted of one site each on the immediate north and south sides of the causeway. Originally the members of each pair were much closer to each other (< 150 m) than to other pairs, but now the members of each pair are isolated by the causeway. Each core was 60 – 80 cm long and was divided into 15 -cm layers. We examined the <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity</b> of microbial communities and chemical compounds to determine the correlation between chemodiversity and microbial communities among marine sediment cores and layers. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) of detected compounds and of bacterial and archaeal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) revealed that {{the north and south}} sides of the causeway are relatively isolated, with each side having unique microbial OTUs. Additionally, some bacterial families (e. g., Acidaminobacteraceae, Rhizobiaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae) were found only {{on the south side of}} Kaichu-Doro. Interestingly, we found that the relative abundance of OTUs for some microbial families increased from top to bottom, but this was reversed in some other families.

40|$|Disturbance {{regimes are}} {{changing}} worldwide, {{and the consequences}} for ecosystem function and resilience are largely unknown. Functional diversity (FD) provides a surrogate measure of ecosystem function by capturing the range, abundance and distribution of trait values in a community. Enhanced understanding of the responses of FD to measures of vegetation structure at landscape scales is needed to guide conservation management. To address this knowledge gap, we used a whole-of-landscape sampling approach to examine relationships between bird FD, vegetation diversity and time since fire. We surveyed birds and measured vegetation at 36 landscape sampling units in dry and wet forest in southeast Australia during 2010 and 2011. Four uncorrelated indices of bird FD (richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) were derived from six bird traits, and we investigated responses of these indices and species richness to both vertical and horizontal vegetation diversity using linear mixed models. We also considered {{the extent to which}} the mean and diversity of time since fire were related to vegetation diversity. Results showed opposing responses of FD to vegetation diversity in dry and wet forest. In dry forest, where fire is frequent, species richness and two FD indices (richness and dispersion) were positively related to vertical vegetation diversity, consistent with theory relating to environmental variation and coexistence. However, in wet forest subject to infrequent fire, the same three response variables were negatively associated with <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity.</b> We suggest that competitive dominance by species results in lower FD as vegetation diversity increases in wet forest. The responses of functional evenness were opposite to those of species richness, functional richness and dispersion in both forest types, highlighting the value of examining multiple FD metrics at management-relevant scales. The mean and diversity of time since fire were uncorrelated with vegetation diversity in wet forest, but positively correlated with vegetation diversity in dry forest. We therefore suggest that protection of older vegetation is important, but controlled application of low-severity fire in dry forest may sustain ecosystem function by enhancing different elements of FD...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{achieving}} deeper {{insights into}} the ecological functioning of German Bight benthos, i. e. ecosystem trophic properties that might explain resistance of the system {{in the light of}} decades of frequent bottom trawling, and recovery patterns of the benthic system during 14 months of trawling cessation. (i) Stable isotope ratios served as an indicator for species trophic elevation, i. e. the relative distance of a species to the primary food source within the food web hierarchy. Community trophic complexity and species trophic niche width were determined by means of interspecific and intraspecific variability of trophic elevation. Trophic significance, i. e. a metabolism scaled abundance, served as an indicator of trophic flow through particular populations. (ii) A new two-dimensional approach to trophic complexity (horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>diversity)</b> was developed. It was applied to the German Bight ecosystem, but concurrently provides a robust and standardised tool for the comparison of species and ecosystem trophic properties. (iii) The macrozoobenthic response to trawling cessation was investigated over the course of 14 months by two approaches: firstly, multivariate community analyses using numerical measures which follow changes at different system levels: the community level, the level of compartments (e. g. feeding guilds) and the species level; secondly community and species trophic properties, i. e. trophic elevation and trophic significance. For the first time, this approach identified significant changes due to trawling cessation on a short time-scale within a highly dynamic coastal ecosystem. The synthesis of all results provides a detailed picture of trophic functioning of the German Bight benthos: (a) Most species are trophic generalists, i. e. they are connected by many and mainly 'weak' trophic links. (b) Trophic redundancy is comparatively high, i. e. the loss of one species may be compensated functionally by one or more other species. (c) In terms of size distribution, the system is characterised by small-sized organisms with corresponding high turnover rates. These particular food-web properties correspond to high system resistance, i. e. the current state can be maintained despite the severe impact of continuing bottom trawling...|$|E
40|$|During the {{austral summer}} 1995, suprabenthic {{samplings}} {{were carried out}} at 24 stations (depth range 45 – 649 m) located around Livingston Island, within the caldera of Deception Island and in the Bransfield Strait. At each station, the near-bottom motile fauna was simultaneously collected with a multinet Macer-GIROQ sled in three water layers above the bottom. This study presents original data on the occurrence, <b>diversity,</b> <b>vertical</b> distribution and abundance of suprabenthic taxa in this near-bottom environment. The most speciose taxa were amphipods (at least 140 spp.), followed by isopods (66 spp.), pycnogonids (31 spp.) and mysids (19 spp.). Total abundances ranged between 31 ind. / 100 m 2 (Bransfield Strait, 361 m depth) and 6817 ind. / 100 m 2 (South Livingston Island, 163 m depth). According to stations, the groups numerically dominant and more frequent were amphipods (17 stations) or mysids (seven stations). Four suprabenthic assemblages were discriminated in the study area, apparently more structured by the degree of shelter-exposure and development of sessile epifauna than by water depth or sediment features.

40|$|Sediments {{from the}} western and {{southern}} part of the Arabian Sea were collected periodically in the spring intermonsoon between March and May 1997 and additionally {{at the end of the}} Northeast Monsoon in February 1998. Assemblages of Rose Bengal stained, living deep-sea benthic foraminifera, their densities, vertical distribution pattern, and diversity were analysed after the Northeast Monsoon and short-time changes were recorded. In the western Arabian Sea, foraminiferal numbers increased steadily between March and the beginning of May, especially in the smaller size classes (30 - 63 µm, 63 - 125 µm). At the same time, the deepening of the foraminiferal living horizon, variable diversity and rapid variations between dominant foraminiferal communities were observed. We interpret these observations as the time-dependent response of benthic foraminifera to enhanced organic carbon fluxes during and after the Northeast Monsoon. In the southern Arabian Sea, constant low foraminiferal abundances during time, no distinctive change in the <b>vertical</b> distribution, reduced <b>diversity,</b> and more stable foraminiferal communities were noticed, which indicates no or little influence of the Northeast Monsoon to benthic foraminifera in this region...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of agroforestry based of Sengon Laut with Porang crop area has successfully to increase people economic level. This research aimed {{to analyze and}} compare diversity, composition, structure community of canopy Arthropod at two different location (Sengon Laut of Porang crop area and non porang crop area) which was attracted to blue and yellow colored water pan trap,  <b>vertical</b> variation <b>diversity,</b> abundance, and structure community of canopy Arthropod, to know the relation between community of Arthropod canopy with abiotic factor at local agroforestry and to recommend good cultivating management. Samples of canopy Arthropod was taken at two different location by blue and yellow colored water pan trap, which was hang on bottom layer (1 - 1, 5 m) and upper layer (8 - 10 m). Abiotic factors (Temperature and light intensity) were measured at each location. Non crop vegetation was analyzed by line intercept method and tree vegetation was analyzed by complete count method. Data of structure community comparison each location was analyzed by important value and diversity (Index Shannon-Whienner). The degree of same level composition between two location was analyzed by Index Bray-Curtis and variation vertical analyzed by anova. Canopy Arthropod composition and relation with abiotic factors was analyzed by Pearson Correlation with MINITAP program. The value abundance of canopy Arthropod in Porang crop area was (329 individu), fewer than canopy Arthropod in non Porang crop area which was (829 individu). The result showed that yellow water pan trap had better efficiency on upper layer at non Porang crop area than porang crop area. Recommendation to the farmers {{in order to make}} good cultivation management non crop vegetation is not cleaned and not used pesticide utilization.   Kata kunci:  Arthropoda kanopi, faktor abiotik,  stabilitas ekosistem, sengon laut, budidaya poran...|$|R
