5|$|By heat carrier: Based on the {{material}} used to deliver heat energy to the oil shale, processing technologies have been classified into gas heat carrier, solid heat carrier, wall conduction, reactive fluid, and <b>volumetric</b> heating methods. Heat carrier methods can be sub-classified as direct or indirect.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{has also}} been used locally for shale {{aggregate}} and common fill, although the pyritic shales are not suitable for this purpose because of acid rock drainage and <b>volumetric</b> expansion.|$|E
5|$|Amyloid imaging {{is likely}} to be used in {{conjunction}} with other markers rather than as an alternative. <b>Volumetric</b> MRI can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E
5|$|Graphically, F.E.A.R. uses normal mapping and {{parallax}} mapping to give textures a {{more realistic}} appearance; the latter is used to {{give the appearance of}} depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls. <b>Volumetric</b> lighting and lightmapping are included {{with the addition of a}} per-pixel lighting model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level shaders, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment America {{released}} {{news that}} PlayStation 3 consoles {{would be used}} as the dedicated servers for Warhawk. A photograph was released which showed a server room with several PlayStation 3 consoles in racks. Each server is able to support 32 players. The games developers have commented that the engine used in the game features technology which could not be easily implemented on any other platform, such as procedurally generated water and waves, as well as <b>volumetric</b> clouds.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{decomposition}} of the shale into smaller fragments can affect slope stability, necessitating shallower slopes that require more material be disturbed in {{cut and fill}} work, exacerbating the acid rock drainage problem. The cut material cannot be used as fill beneath roads and structures due to <b>volumetric</b> expansion, compounding the problem. The Tioga ash beds contain bentonite clay which presents a landslide hazard in the unexcavated rock as well.|$|E
5|$|Potassium tetraiodomercurate(II), K2HgI4, is {{also known}} as Nessler's reagent. It is often used as a {{sensitive}} spot test for ammonia. Similarly, Cu2HgI4 is used as a precipitating reagent to test for alkaloids. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative <b>volumetric</b> analysis, for example in iodometry and the iodine clock reaction (in which iodine also serves as a test for starch, forming a dark blue complex), and aqueous alkaline iodine solution is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones. The iodine test for starch is still used to detect counterfeit banknotes printed on starch-containing paper.|$|E
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a <b>volumetric</b> expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E

25|$|The {{rational}} <b>volumetric</b> quantation or constant proportionality of the octahedron, the cube, the rhombic triacontahedron, and the rhombic dodecahedron when {{referenced to}} the tetrahedron as <b>volumetric</b> unity.|$|E
25|$|The 3D model {{approach}} can use <b>volumetric</b> or skeletal models, {{or even a}} combination of the two. <b>Volumetric</b> approaches have been heavily used in computer animation industry and for computer vision purposes. The models are generally created from complicated 3D surfaces, like NURBS or polygon meshes.|$|E
25|$|Graduated {{cylinders}} are cylindrical containers {{used for}} <b>volumetric</b> measurements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Volumetric</b> flasks are for {{measuring}} a specific volume of fluid.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{is highly}} likely that the {{oscillations}} are coherent around the periphery, {{there should be a}} fluctuating <b>volumetric</b> flow rate from the cavity with only a small net lateral force. Thus the source is yet another version of a monopole-like geometry; the <b>volumetric</b> flow rate is a cylindrical area between the jet and cavity.|$|E
25|$|Class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} offer high <b>volumetric</b> efficiency for buffer, by-pass, and coupling applications.|$|E
25|$|In a fluid {{the only}} non-zero {{stiffness}} is to <b>volumetric</b> deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces).|$|E
25|$|Due to minimum {{clearance}} volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll, these compressors {{have a very}} high <b>volumetric</b> efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} {{with high}} <b>volumetric</b> efficiency for buffer, by-pass and coupling applications Common EIA/IEC code abbreviations are: X7R/2XI, Z5U/E26, Y5V/2F4, X7S/2C1, etc.|$|E
25|$|The mole {{fraction}} of a gas component in a gas mixture {{is equal to the}} <b>volumetric</b> fraction of that component in a gas mixture.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of rotary compressors {{depends on the}} air drier, and the selection of air drier is always 1.5 times <b>volumetric</b> delivery of the compressor.|$|E
25|$|As an {{implication}} of undrained condition, no elastic <b>volumetric</b> strains occur, and thus Poisson's ratio {{is assumed to}} remain 0.5 throughout shearing. The Tresca soil model also assumes no plastic <b>volumetric</b> strains occur. This is of significance in more advanced analyses such as in finite element analysis. In these advanced analysis methods, soil models other than Tresca {{may be used to}} model the undrained condition including Mohr-Coulomb and critical state soil models such as the modified Cam-clay model, provided Poisson's ratio is maintained at 0.5.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} table shows {{differences among}} capacitors of various manufacturers in capacitance range, cell voltage, internal resistance (ESR, DC or AC value) and <b>volumetric</b> and gravimetric specific energy.|$|E
25|$|In {{saturated}} groundwater aquifers, {{all available}} pore spaces {{are filled with}} water (<b>volumetric</b> water content = porosity). Above a capillary fringe, pore spaces have air in them too.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol {{can be used}} to form {{a complex}} with boric acid. This {{increases}} the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in <b>volumetric</b> analysis of this acid.|$|E
25|$|Promising {{alternatives}} to Pt-based catalysts are Metal/Nitrogen/ Carbon-catalysts (M/N/C-catalysts). To achieve high power density, or output of power over {{surface area of}} the cell, a <b>volumetric</b> activity of at least 1/10 that of Pt-based catalysts must be met, along with good mass transport properties. While M/N/C-catalysts still demonstrate poorer <b>volumetric</b> activities than Pt-based catalysts, the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate. However, increasing the loading of M/N/C-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker, impairing its mass transport properties. In other words, H2, O2, protons, and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer, decreasing the voltage output of the cell. While high microporosity of the M/N/C catalytic network results in high <b>volumetric</b> activity, improved mass transport properties are instead associated to macroporosity of the network. These M/N/C materials are synthesized using high temperature pyrolysis and other high temperature treatments of precursors containing the metal, nitrogen, and carbon.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{amount of}} raw {{materials}} is very important. Semolina dosing is done by two methods: <b>volumetric</b> feed (measurement by volume), and gravimetric feed (measurement by weight). In <b>volumetric</b> feed, a specific volume of semolina is measured by variable speed screws or rotary air-lock valves. This method is not very accurate since the amount depends on {{the density of the}} semolina. In gravimetric feed, semolina is weighed by a variable speed transport system, which is equipped with a device measuring the flow. Although this method is more accurate, it is more expensive and needs to be isolated.|$|E
25|$|A monopole-like {{sound field}} is {{generated}} by <b>volumetric</b> flow rate oscillations. Karthik and Anderson have studied this phenomenon and concluded that symmetric vortex shedding on the cavity side is the driving agency.|$|E
25|$|MOF-177 has larger pores, so {{hydrogen}} is compressed within holes rather than adsorbed to the surface. This leads to higher total gravimetric uptake but lower <b>volumetric</b> storage density compared to MOF-5.|$|E
25|$|Quantitatively, the {{material}} balance around a wet, evaporative cooling tower system {{is governed by}} the operational variables of make-up <b>volumetric</b> flow rate, evaporation and windage losses, draw-off rate, and the concentration cycles.|$|E
25|$|The {{first term}} {{on the right}} is the {{constant}} tensor, also known as the <b>volumetric</b> strain tensor, and the second term is the traceless symmetric tensor, also known as the deviatoric strain tensor or shear tensor.|$|E
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a {{minimum equipment list}} item) because of technical problems with the thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the <b>volumetric</b> shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the <b>volumetric</b> fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E
25|$|New {{developments}} in ceramic materials {{have been made}} with anti-ferroelectric ceramics. This material has a nonlinear antiferroelectric/ferroelectric phase change that allows increased energy storage with higher <b>volumetric</b> efficiency. They are used for energy storage (for example, in detonators).|$|E
25|$|The Water Industry Act 1999 {{banned the}} {{disconnection}} {{of water and}} sewerage services for non-payment by domestic customers. It also allows the continuation of water charges based on rateable property value, as opposed to <b>volumetric</b> rates based on metering.|$|E
25|$|Class 1 ceramic {{capacitors}} {{have the}} lowest <b>volumetric</b> efficiency among ceramic capacitors. This {{is the result of}} the relatively low permittivity (6 to 200) of the paraelectric materials. Therefore, class 1 capacitors have capacitance values in the lower range.|$|E
25|$|Definition of a {{three-dimensional}} mesh honoring the structural model to support <b>volumetric</b> representation of heterogeneity (see Geostatistics) and solving the Partial Differential Equations which govern physical {{processes in the}} subsurface (e.g. seismic wave propagation, fluid transport in porous media).|$|E
25|$|A water {{retention}} curve {{is the relationship}} between <b>volumetric</b> water content and the water potential of the porous medium. It is characteristic for different types of porous medium. Due to hysteresis, different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished.|$|E
