50|$|Voice portals are {{the voice}} {{equivalent}} of web portals, giving {{access to information}} through spoken commands and voice responses.

50|$|Alerts are {{typically}} delivered through a notification {{system and the}} most common application of the service is machine-to-person communication.

Novel approaches provide users {{with the ability to}} schedule their own alerts (for example Google Calendar). The most sophisticated service providers embrace all capabilities, aggregating a multitude of reminder, notifications and alert, catering the delivery system to the specific context of the content being delivered thus enabling users to create sophisticated scenarios.|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} interests are: {{the use of}} semantic annotations and relation detection in answer selection for dialog systems, integration of answer-selection using logical deduction present in question-answering systems in dialog systems, {{the maintenance of the}} context in question-answering systems in order to simulate dialog management systems, application of transaction logic (as a logic of state changes) and flogic (frames+rules) in dialog knowledge management, automatic generation of information utility functions for ranking slots in frames for dialog systems, and the creation of <b>voice</b> <b>portals</b> as dialog management systems. 1. 1 Past, Current and Future Work My research so far has focused on logical formalisms for dialog management using plan-based approaches (Fodor, Huerta, 2006), standardization of dialog management markup languages and architectures for <b>voice</b> <b>portals</b> (Fodor, Huerta 2005, Fodor, 2006), dialog management approaches for decision processes (Fodor, 2007), and the use of semantic annotations and relation detection in answer selection for dialog systems. SmartKom (Lockelt, 2004), TRINDIKIT (Larsson and Traum, 2000) showed that real dialog systems can be successfully developed over artificial intelligence planning techniques. This requires the conversation acts to be defined like any other planning action with preconditions and effects on the internal state (i. e. context of the conversation). Many times these dialogue systems do not leverage powerful artificial intelligence deduction systems or their logical formalisms were too simple to represent complex preconditions and effects. In (Fodor, Huerta, 2006) we developed a dialog system over Flora 2 system to allow definition of complex types, default negation and quantifiers (universal and existential) over the expressions in the preconditions and the effects of the dialog acts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This chapter {{deals with}} the {{application}} of automatic speaker classification in human machine dialog systems based on telephone operation. In a first step we introduce a taxonomy based on three features that such systems might have. We explain the features, namely online, mirroring, critical and their respective counterparts get explicated and are than used to characterize {{a part of the}} exemplary applications that illustrate the benefit of that approach. Furthermore prototypical application scenarios are described that shall illustrate the vast possibilities to utilize automated speaker classification in dialog applications. Key words: speaker classification, applications, <b>voice</b> <b>portals,</b> taxonomy Contents and Motivation In human-human communication speaker classification takes place at all times and is very valuable for the communication process, as people constantly adapt their manner of speaking based on the assessment they have of their counterpart’s age, gender, mood or mother tongue.

40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in speech technology {{are expected to}} change the way we communicate, facilitating access to web services and applications (<b>voice</b> <b>portals,</b> multimodal email clients or games) in various mobile situations. In order to be attractive for users, however, speech output needs to be more expressive to increase naturalness, meaningfulness and ease of listening. Conventional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems do not express non-verbal elements occurring in written text. This paper describes our user-centred approach to design non-speech sounds to express several non-linguistic elements in an email reader. Furthermore, it reports on a user study in which the effectiveness and satisfaction regarding the sound-enhanced emails was investigated. The results indicate that in most cases the addition of tailored non-speech sounds increases the user's ability to perceive the structure and meaning of the audio content and decreases the subjective workload, without leading to a higher user annoyance. As a consequence, non-speech sound should be integrated into market-ready TTS systems in a systematic way. Keywords Speech, multimodal, usability, non-speech soun...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in speech technology {{are expected to}} change the way we communicate, facilitating access to web services and applications (<b>voice</b> <b>portals,</b> multimodal email clients or games) in various mobile situations. One threshold for broad adoption of speech enabled services is their limited interaction robustness. In this paper, we focus on possibilities to increase interaction robustness by enhancing speech output with non-speech sound. First, we describe the relationship of speech and non-speech output and their contribution to interaction robustness from a user-centered perspective. Second, we report on a user study, in which the addition of non-speech sound to Text-to-Speech (TTS) in an Email reader was evaluated. The results indicate that in most cases the addition of tailored non-speech sounds increases the user’s ability to perceive the structure and meaning of the audio content and decreases the subjective workload, without leading to a higher user annoyance. Finally, we provide an outline of further, currently ongoing research work on nonspeech sound enhancement of speech output. 1...|$|R
