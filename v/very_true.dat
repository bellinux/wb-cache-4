25|$|In 1894 Lockwood and Richardson, {{with their}} pace and sharp break-back, were an irresistible {{combination}} {{on the many}} treacherous wickets. Lockwood's bowling reached its highest point, though, against Yorkshire at the Oval when Richardson was injured: he took 7 for 94 on a <b>very</b> <b>true</b> pitch to win the match that decided the Championship. Lockwood's batting did not suffer from the advance of his bowling: indeed he frequently opened with Bobby Abel in 1894 and scored over 900 runs under the most difficult conditions. After demolishing Kent on a perfect batting wicket in the last match at The Oval, he and Richardson were chosen to tour Australia.|$|E

500|$|Though as a {{minor league}} prospect, analysts derided his {{defensive}} potential, with one calling him [...] "terrible", he progressively improved. Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: [...] "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop he wants. It looks like he's really worked on his glove play, just using the glove along with his strong accurate arm. It's a <b>very</b> <b>true</b> ball that he throws over there. It's got a lot on it. I've {{seen a lot of}} improving developments since I saw him in mid-February. He's come a long way." ...|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{said the}} episode was good but lacked {{significant}} background motivation into the villains. Fuller also noted {{the revelation of}} River Song being Amy's grown up child [...] "is perhaps a narrative strand which would sit uncomfortably with a series where loss has often been brushed off {{as soon as the}} next couple of episodes". However, he did have praise for the performance of Smith's Doctor, commenting [...] "the last few weeks have seen Matt Smith's Doctor in a welcome generally more serious vein, which he kept up here, with leavening at the right moments where his alien lack of comfort with human emotions, although used to comic effect, rang <b>very</b> <b>true,</b> as did his awkwardness when discovering the truth about River".|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the soundtrack were offered to Peter Chelsom, the 's director, for {{inclusion}} on the film. Producer Alfred Gough said, [...] "Peter Chelsom describes the Stewart family [...] as a bilingual family whose second language is music, and that's <b>very</b> <b>true</b> in this movie." [...] Chelsom says the film's numerous songs are tightly woven {{into the fabric of}} the story and the characters, which is why he believes the film will feel like a musical without being one. [...] "We continuously dance very close to the convention of a musical but are more integrated. Songs are going to sit within the film, not apart from the film. At times, you won't notice the music is happening; it'll just move the story along." ...|$|E

500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer {{did a good job of}} playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining <b>very</b> <b>true</b> to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{states that}} when fans {{ask him if}} Jack is really the Face of Boe, he tells them he {{believes}} he is and states that he and Davies hold {{it to be true}} [...] "in [...] little world"; the link is [...] "unconfirmed" [...] within the text of the show. As to how Jack becomes the Face, Barrowman feels the answer doesn't matter as it is intentionally mysterious. Barrowman likes the characters being connected because it means in spite of how the Doctor initially treats Jack, [...] "Boe becomes his confidante and the one the Doctor returns to for advice and information" [...] which he feels is a [...] "wonderful twist of events". However, Davies chooses not to confirm (within the story's narrative) whether or not Jack really is the Face of Boe, stating [...] "the moment it became <b>very</b> <b>true</b> or very false, the joke dies". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{wrote about}} the [...] "palpable, painful sense of dread throughout this episode", stating: [...] "Though Lane's tax trouble seemed {{to come out of}} nowhere a few weeks ago...all of his behavior, and Don's, felt <b>very</b> <b>true</b> to form, and not like characters acting in a way designed to create a specific end point. Lane was doomed, but by his own actions and foibles as much as by any plot engineering to get that noose around his neck." [...] The Guardians Paul McInnes felt the series was [...] "recovering its poise" [...] {{on its way to the}} season finale, stating: [...] "After dallying with melodrama (Pete and Beth Dawes, Harry and Hari Kinsey), the show has moved back towards the darker, more sophisticated narratives of cause and unexpected consequence. This week Lane may have taken his own life, but Don also got his mojo back and the two were directly related." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday compared the characters of Lane Pryce and Don Draper, stating: [...] "Both have secret lives protected by carefully constructed façades. For both, the façade is everything — and Lane's would simply fall away, like a line of dominoes when confronted with the consequences of his lie. A lie, after all, made in the service of his son." ...|$|E

500|$|Opinion on Kain's {{character}} {{has been largely}} positive in critical reviews of the Legacy of Kain games. Praise has frequently been directed towards Simon Templeman's voice acting, with IGN, Game Revolution and Adrenaline Vault citing Kain's soliloquies as [...] "both gruesome and entertaining", [...] "the best part [...] " [...] and [...] "one of the best stints of voice acting ever recorded" [...] respectively in their assessments of his debut in the original Blood Omen. For Blood Omen 2, although critics expressed disappointment with the game itself, they praised Kain's character nevertheless; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin branded him [...] "a very intriguing protagonist" [...] and [...] "as memorable of a main character as they come", while IGN's Douglass C. Perry felt he was [...] "incredibly likeable", and [...] "in a <b>very</b> <b>true</b> sense [...] a great videogame character". GameZone's Michael Knutson opined {{that he was a}} [...] "wicked cool character", and Game Revolution's Johnny Liu named him a [...] "great anti-hero". Kasavin again praised him in a review for Defiance, writing that [...] "it's rare enough to find a truly memorable main character in a game, let alone two", and that the game's ensemble cast [...] " [...] the problems in the gameplay". Ian Dransfield of Play has stated that [...] "we totally and completely fell in love with [...] " [...] and highlighted him as a [...] "character who [...] to be revived".|$|E
500|$|For {{the screen}} adaptation, Spielberg {{wanted to stay}} with the novel's basic plot, while omitting Benchley's many subplots. He {{declared}} that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, [...] "I'd like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be <b>very</b> <b>true</b> to the book for the last third." [...] When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay. The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writer's Guild strike, given Benchley was not unionized. Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers; delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, [...] "I'm written out on this, and that's the best I can do." [...] Benchley would later describe his contribution to the finished film as [...] "the storyline and the ocean stuff – basically, the mechanics", given he [...] "didn't know how to put the character texture into a screenplay." [...] One of his changes was to remove the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the Orca. During the film's production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay <b>very</b> <b>true</b> to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E
