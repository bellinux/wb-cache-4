5000|$|Interestingly, the Java {{language}} specification regards [...] as a reserved keyword - i.e., {{one that}} {{cannot be used}} as <b>variable</b> <b>identifier</b> - but assigns no semantics to it: it is a reserved word (it cannot be used in identifiers) but not a keyword (it has no special meaning). It is thought that the reservation of the keyword occurred to allow for {{an extension of the}} Java language to include C++-style [...] methods and pointer to [...] type.

5000|$|Widgets {{created by}} FLUID are [...] "named", [...] "complex named", or [...] "unnamed". A named widget has a legal C++ <b>variable</b> <b>identifier</b> {{as its name}} (i.e. only {{alphanumeric}} and underscore), and is defined by a global variable or class member that will point at the widget after the function defining it is called. A complex named object has punctuation such as '.' or '->' or any other symbols in its name. In this case, FLUID assigns a pointer to the widget to the name, but does not attempt to declare it. This {{can be used to}} get the widgets into structures. An unnamed widget has a blank name and no pointer is stored.|$|E

Whether, which, and when punctuation marks are permitted in variable names varies from language to language; many languages only permit the underscore ("_") in variable names and forbid all other punctuation. In some programming languages, specific (often punctuation) characters (known as sigils) are prefixed or appended to <b>variable</b> <b>identifiers</b> to indicate the variable's type.|$|R

40|$|In a {{separate}} compilation environment type checks across source files {{are difficult to}} implement, because the natural place to perform them, the linker, is rarely {{under the control of}} the compiler developer. This is typically handled either by programs that perform a global declaration and use consistency check, or by relying on the programmer to create and use a consistent set of headers. We present a solution to this problem based on encoding the identifiers with their types. Each function or <b>variable</b> <b>identifier</b> has an encoding of its type appended to its name. In this way type mismatches are caught at link time as undefined references. Multiple definitions of the same identifier with different types are handled by creating dummy variables.

Consequently, a part of the translation process must be [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Adding environments as {{first-class}} {{values to}} a language can greatly enhance its expressiveness. But first-class environments do not mesh well into a lexically scoped language since {{they rely on}} <b>identifiers</b> (<b>variable</b> names). By distinguishing <b>variables</b> from <b>identifiers</b> and therefore extents from environments, we present an alternative: first-class extents. First-class extents are defined on <b>variables</b> rather than <b>identifiers</b> and are therefore immune to name capturing problems that plague first-class environments. Then by distinguishing variables from locations and therefore extents from stores, our first-class extents can coexist with imperative features and still allow tail-recursion to be properly implemented as iteration. To test our claims, we extend Scheme {{with a collection of}} features that are essential to first-class extents, give a denotational semantics for the extension, and demonstrate that it can be fully embedded into Scheme albeit losing tail-recursiveness. Then we show how [...] ...|$|R

Relative displacements are measured over a range of step rates during both free (self-determined step rate at different speeds) and forced (forced step rate at a constant speed) walking, converted into harmonic coefficients and stored in an array {{as a function of}} step rate. Only six <b>variable</b> <b>identifiers</b> need to be specified to compute any absolute variable or its derivatives at any desirabie step rate. The paper displays some examples of measured relative motions and reconstituted absolute variables. lNTRODUCTâ€™lON Kinematic variables of gait are valuable to both dynamic synthesis and analysis in the studies ofhuman walking. In dynamic analysis, the measured kinematic data of body segments are used to predict forces and moments applied to each isolated segment.

40|$|Program slicing is a {{technique}} by which statements are deleted from a program {{in such a way}} as to preserve a projection of the original program's semantics. It is shown that slicing algorithms based upon traditional defined and referenced variable sets do not preserve a projection of strict semantics with respect to computations which cause errors. Rather, these approaches preserve a projection of the program's semantics which is lazy with respect to errors. A modified version of defined and referenced variable sets is introduced, which provides the freedom to choose the form of semantics to be preserved. 1. Introduction A slice is constructed with respect to a slicing criterion (V; n), where V is a set of <b>variable</b> <b>identifiers</b> and n is a point of interest within the program 1. Definition 1 provides an informal definition of a program slice. Definition 1. (Slice) Given a program p and a slicing criterion (V; n), a program slice p 0 is created by deleting statements from p.

50|$|The highest {{accuracy}} photometric {{data were}} provided as {{a by-product of}} the main mission astrometric observations. They were made in a broad-band visible light passband, specific to Hipparcos, and designated Hp. The median photometric precision, for Hp<9 mag, was 0.0015 mag, with typically 110 distinct observations per star throughout the 3.5-year observation period. As part of the data reductions and catalogue production, new variables were identified and designated with appropriate <b>variable</b> star <b>identifiers.</b> <b>Variable</b> stars were classified as periodic or unsolved variables; the former were published with estimates of their period, variability amplitude, and variability type. In total some 11,597 variable objects were detected, of which 8237 were newly classified as variable. There are, for example, 273 Cepheid variables, 186 RR Lyr variables, 108 Delta Scuti variables, and 917 eclipsing binary stars. The star mapper observations, constituting the Tycho (and Tycho-2) Catalogue, provided two colours, roughly B and V in the Johnson UBV photometric system, important for spectral classification and effective temperature determination.|$|R
