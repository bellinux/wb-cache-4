According to the label directions, ZMA should be taken 30 - 60 minutes prior to bedtime and {{on an empty stomach}} to help synchronise absorption with sleep. Also, the product should not be taken with foods or supplements containing calcium because calcium blocks the absorption of zinc.|$|R
50|$|Ginkgotoxin (4'-O-methylpyridoxine) is a neurotoxin {{naturally}} occurring in Ginkgo biloba. It is an antivitamin structurally related to <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine).</b> It {{has the capacity}} to induce epileptic seizures.|$|R
50|$|PLP is {{the active}} form of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine</b> or pyridoxal). PLP is a {{versatile}} catalyst, {{acting as a}} coenzyme in a multitude of reactions, including decarboxylation, deamination and transamination.|$|R
50|$|Pyritinol {{also called}} {{pyridoxine}} disulfide or pyrithioxine (European drug names Encephabol, Encefabol, Cerbon 6) is a semi-synthetic water-soluble analog of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>Pyridoxine</b> HCl). It {{was produced in}} 1961 by Merck Laboratories by bonding 2 <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> compounds (<b>pyridoxine)</b> together with a disulfide bridge. Since the 1970s, {{it has been a}} prescription and OTC drug in several countries for cognitive disorders and learning disorders in children. Since the early 1990s it has been sold as a nootropic dietary supplement in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Temporary {{impairment}} of proprioception {{has also been}} known to occur from an overdose of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine</b> and pyridoxamine). Most of the impaired function returns to normal shortly after {{the amount of the}} vitamin in the body returns to a level that is closer to that of the physiological norm. Impairment can also be caused by cytotoxic factors such as chemotherapy.|$|R
50|$|The CDC is {{investigating}} a possible connection with wartime chemical exposure. The team is also investigating whether a deficiency in <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine)</b> {{could be a}} cause, noting the seizures of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy and this common deficiency in disease sufferers. Older theories include a 2002 toxicology report that postulated a connection with tainted monkey meat, {{as well as the}} eating of agricultural seeds provided by relief agencies that were covered in toxic chemicals.|$|R
5000|$|Doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine. It {{can be used}} {{by itself}} as a {{short-term}} sedative and in combination with other drugs to provide night-time allergy and cold relief. Doxylamine is also used in combination with the analgesics paracetamol (acetaminophen) and codeine as an analgesic/calmative preparation, and is prescribed in combination with <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine)</b> to prevent morning sickness in pregnant women. Its fetal safety is [...] "A" [...] in Briggs’ Reference Guide to Foetal and Neonatal Risk.|$|R
5000|$|Winter squash is low-calorie and a {{good source}} of complex {{vegetable}} carbohydrates and dietary fiber. It is an excellent source of vitamin A, a great source of vitamin C, potassium, dietary fiber and manganese, {{and a good}} source of folate, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B1 (thiamin), copper, tryptophan, <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine),</b> <b>vitamin</b> B3 (niacin) and vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). [...] It is also a source of iron and beta-carotene. Usually, the darker the skin is, the higher the beta-carotene content.|$|R
50|$|Typical of milk, several dietary {{minerals}} {{are found}} in kefir, such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sodium, copper, molybdenum, manganese, and zinc in amounts {{that have not been}} standardized to a reputable nutrient database. Also similar to milk, kefir contains vitamins in variable amounts, including vitamin A, vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine),</b> <b>vitamin</b> B9 (folic acid), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), vitamin C, vitamin D, and vitamin E. Essential amino acids found in kefir include methionine, cysteine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, lysine, and valine, as for any milk product.|$|R
50|$|Malnutrition (improper dietary intake) or {{malabsorption}} (poor {{absorption of}} nutrients into the body) can lead to nutritional deficiency states, several of {{which can lead to}} stomatitis. For example, deficiencies of iron, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine),</b> <b>vitamin</b> B9 (folic acid) or vitamin B12 (cobalamine) may all manifest as stomatitis. Iron is necessary for the upregulation of transcriptional elements for cell replication and repair. Lack of iron can cause genetic downregulation of these elements, leading to ineffective repair and regeneration of epithelial cells, especially in the mouth and lips. Many disorders which cause malabsorption can cause deficiencies, which in turn causes stomatitis. Examples include tropical sprue.|$|R
5000|$|Ginkgotoxin is the 4'-O-methyl {{derivative}} of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine),</b> but {{the presence of}} the vitamin is not required for the biosynthesis of ginkgotoxin. It indicates that the pyridoxine system can be synthesized de novo in the cells of Ginkgo biloba. [...] The first step of the biosynthesis involves ribulose 5-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. They react {{in the presence of a}} synthase complex consisting of Pdx1 and Pdx2, and form pyridoxal phosphate. The second step is hypothetical and consists of the removal of a hydride in the presence of a dehydrogenase to produce pyridoxine. The last step involves the O-methylation of pyridoxine to form 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (ginkgotoxin).|$|R
50|$|Convulsions {{are often}} caused by {{some sort of}} {{electrical}} activity mishap in the brain. Oftentimes, the cause {{is not able to}} be pinpointed. Convulsions can be caused by chemicals in the blood, as well as infections like meningitis or encephalitis. A very common cause of convulsions is fevers. Other possibilities include head trauma, stroke or lack of oxygen to the brain. Sometimes the convulsion can be caused by genetic defects or brain tumors. Convulsions can also be caused by any type-1 diabetic, whose blood sugar is too low. Hypoglycemia can cause very bad convulsions until the person's blood sugar is raised to normal level. Convulsions can also be caused by deficiency of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> (<b>pyridoxine).</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1934, the Hungarian {{physician}} Paul György {{discovered a}} substance that was able to cure a skin disease in rats (dermititis acrodynia). He named this substance <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6.</b> In 1938, Samuel Lepkovsky isolated <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> from rice bran. Harris and Folkers in 1939 determined the structure of pyridoxine, and, in 1945, Snell was able to show the two forms of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6,</b> pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> was named <b>pyridoxine</b> to indicate its structural homology to pyridine.|$|R
5000|$|Vitamin B1 {{deficiency}} (thiamin deficiency) {{can cause}} glossitis. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can cause glossitis, along with angular cheilitis, cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and other signs and symptoms. The glossitis in vitamin B2 deficiency {{is described as}} magenta. [...] Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) can cause glossitis. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> deficiency (<b>pyridoxine</b> deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with angular cheilitis, cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and seborrheic dermatitis. Folate deficiency (vitamin B9 deficiency) can cause glossitis, along with macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue and possibly neurological signs. Apart from pernicious anemia discussed above, any other cause of vitamin B12 deficiency can cause glossitis, which tends to be painful, smooth and shiny.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that women with active tuberculosis who are pregnant or breastfeeding take isoniazid. Preventive therapy should be delayed until after giving birth. Nursing mothers excrete a relatively low and non-toxic concentration of INH in breast milk, and their babies are at low risk for side effects. Both pregnant women and infants being breastfed by mothers taking INH should take <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> in its <b>pyridoxine</b> form {{to minimize the risk}} of peripheral nerve damage.Vitamin B6 is used to prevent isoniazid-induced B6 deficiency and neuropathy in people with a risk factor, such as pregnancy, lactation, HIV infection, alcoholism, diabetes, kidney failure, or malnutrition.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of water-soluble vitamins {{is very important}} in the food and pharmaceutical industries. A chemiluminescent method using flow injection is described for the {{determination of}} <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Its detection limit, linearity and reproducibility were examined. The method is based on the enhancing effect of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> on the chemiluminescence generated by the oxidation of luminol with hydrogen peroxide in aqueous potassium hydroxide and sodium oxalate. The proposed method is simple and inexpensive. The chemiluminescence intensity is a linear function of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> concentration over the range 10 – 250 mg ml 1 with a detection limit of 6 mg ml 1. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by the determination of <b>pyridoxine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in different tablet formulations and some dietary sources...|$|R
50|$|A {{deficiency}} of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> alone is relatively uncommon and often occurs {{in association with}} other vitamins of the B complex. The elderly and alcoholics have {{an increased risk of}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> deficiency, as well as other micronutrient deficiencies. Evidence exists for decreased levels of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> in women with type 1 diabetes and in patients with systemic inflammation, liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and those infected with HIV. Use of oral contraceptives and treatment with certain anticonvulsants, isoniazid, cycloserine, penicillamine, and hydrocortisone negatively impact <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> status. Hemodialysis reduces <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> plasma levels.|$|R
2500|$|Alterations {{in protein}} {{metabolism}} may also produce pellagra-like symptoms. An example is carcinoid syndrome, a disease in which neuroendocrine tumors along the GI tract use tryptophan {{as the source}} for serotonin production, which limits the available tryptophan for niacin synthesis. In normal patients, only one percent of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin; however, in patients with carcinoid syndrome, this value may increase to 70%. [...] Carcinoid syndrome thus may produce niacin deficiency and clinical manifestations of pellagra. [...] Anti-tuberculosis medication tends to bind to <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> and reduce niacin synthesis, since <b>B6</b> (aka <b>pyridoxine)</b> is a required cofactor in the tryptophan-to-niacin reaction.|$|R
50|$|The {{products}} of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> metabolism are excreted in the urine, the major product {{of which is}} 4-pyridoxic acid. An estimated 40-60% of ingested <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> is oxidized to 4-pyridoxic acid. Several {{studies have shown that}} 4-pyridoxic acid is undetectable in the urine of vitamin B6-deficient subjects, making it a useful clinical marker to assess the <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> status of an individual. Other {{products of}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> metabolism excreted in the urine when high doses of the vitamin have been given include pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine and their phosphates. A small amount of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> is also excreted in the feces.|$|R
