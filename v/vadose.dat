25|$|The {{water content}} is very {{important}} in <b>vadose</b> zone hydrology, where the hydraulic conductivity is a strongly nonlinear function of water content; this complicates the solution of the unsaturated groundwater flow equation.|$|E
25|$|In the Yucatán Peninsula, any surface opening where {{groundwater}} can {{be reached}} is called cenote, which is a Spanish form of the Maya word d’zonot. The cave systems formed as normal caves underwater, but upper sections drained becoming air filled during past low sea levels. During this <b>vadose,</b> or air filled state, abundant speleothem deposits formed. The caves and the <b>vadose</b> speleothem were reflooded and became hydraulically reactivated as rising sea levels also raised the water table. These caves are therefore polygenetic, having experienced more than one cycle of formation below the water table. Polygenetic coastal cave systems with underwater speleothem are globally common, with notable examples being on the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca) of Spain, the islands of the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cuba, and many more.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater can {{be found}} at nearly every point in the Earth's shallow {{subsurface}} to some degree, although aquifers do not necessarily contain fresh water. The Earth's crust can be divided into two regions: the saturated zone or phreatic zone (e.g., aquifers, aquitards, etc.), where all available spaces are filled with water, and the unsaturated zone (also called the <b>vadose</b> zone), where there are still pockets of air that contain some water, but can be filled with more water.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the cave}} via {{either of the}} Village Entrances the visitor passes a shrine used by the locals. The Ayiew Maco Series {{is a set of}} {{interconnecting}} passages of varying in width between 1 m and 10 m. Several can be passed through to the pebble beach on the left bank of the river. A less complex series of passages exists on the right bank. These probably connected to those on the left bank until severed by the <b>vadose</b> action of the Web cutting the river passage deeper.|$|E
25|$|Preparation of the {{vulnerability}} maps typically involves overlaying several thematic maps of physical {{factors that have}} been selected to describe the aquifer vulnerability. The index-based parametric mapping method GOD developed by Foster and Hirata (1988) uses three generally available or readily estimated parameters, the degree of Groundwater hydraulic confinement, geological nature of the Overlying strata and Depth to groundwater. A further approach developed by the US EPA named DRASTIC employs seven hydrogeological factors to develop an index of vulnerability: Depth to water table, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography (slope), Impact on the <b>vadose</b> zone, and hydraulic Conductivity.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{recharge}} water enters the aquifer is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the <b>vadose</b> zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits {{the amount of water}} able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{complications}} which arises in studying the <b>vadose</b> zone, {{is the fact that}} the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is a function of the water content of the material. [...] As a material dries out, the connected wet pathways through the media become smaller, the hydraulic conductivity decreasing with lower water content in a very non-linear fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Most soils have a {{water content}} less than porosity, {{which is the}} {{definition}} of unsaturated conditions, and they make up the subject of <b>vadose</b> zone hydrogeology. [...] The capillary fringe of the water table is the dividing line between saturated and unsaturated conditions. Water content in the capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance above the phreatic surface.|$|E
2500|$|Running {{parallel}} to the Great Hall and interconnected to it via several passages is Flintstone Passage. This splits into many different passages that break into the left bank of the canyon downstream of Holuca. Away from the river, Flintstone runs into another of the caves' unique passages, Mudwall Passage, which [...] has filled with mud almost to the 3 m high roof. Following the infilling process a <b>vadose</b> trench has been cut {{the length of the}} passage revealing that the mud is formed of thin laminations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vadose</b> zone is the undersaturated {{portion of}} the {{subsurface}} that lies above the groundwater table. The soil and rock in the <b>vadose</b> zone are not fully saturated with water; that is, the pores within them contain air as well as water. In some places the <b>vadose</b> zone is absent, as is common where there are lakes and marshes, and in some places it is hundreds of meters thick, as is common in arid regions.|$|E
50|$|While {{installed}} {{primarily in}} water-saturated sediments and rock, MLS systems {{can also be}} installed in the <b>vadose</b> zone for the collection of depth-discrete soil gas samples. Hybrid MLS systems can be constructed with some ports in the <b>vadose</b> zone and some ports in the saturated zone.|$|E

5000|$|Water in the <b>vadose</b> zone has a {{pressure}} head {{less than atmospheric}} pressure, and is retained {{by a combination of}} adhesion (funiculary groundwater), and capillary action (capillary groundwater). If the <b>vadose</b> zone envelops soil, the water contained therein is termed soil moisture. In fine grained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully saturated above the water table at {{a pressure}} less than atmospheric. The <b>vadose</b> zone does not include the area that is still saturated above the water table, {{often referred to as the}} capillary fringe.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>vadose</b> zone, also {{termed the}} {{unsaturated}} zone, {{is the part}} of Earth between the land surface and the top of the phreatic zone, the position at which the groundwater (the water in the soil's pores) is at atmospheric pressure ("vadose" [...] is from the Latin for [...] "shallow").

50|$|The <b>vadose</b> zone {{is often}} the main factor {{controlling}} water movement from the land surface to the aquifer. Thus it strongly affects the rate of aquifer recharge and is critical for the use and management of groundwater.

Understanding of vadose-zone processes is therefore crucial in determining the amount and quality of groundwater that is available for human use.|$|E
