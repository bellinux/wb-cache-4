40|$|Purpose: To report {{outcomes}} {{in breast cancer}} patients with prior breast augmentation treated with external beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (EB-APBI) utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 3 -dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 D-CRT), both with image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Methods and Materials: 16 stage 0 /I breast cancer patients with previous elective bilateral augmentation were treated post-lumpectomy on institutional EB-APBI trials (01185132 and 01185145 on clinicaltrials. gov). Patients received 38. 5 Gy in 10 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Breast/chest wall pain and cosmesis were rated by patient; cosmesis was additionally evaluated by physician per RTOG criteria. Results: The median follow-up from APBI completion was 18. 0 months (range, 1. 2 - 58. 6). Little to no change in cosmesis or pain from baseline was reported. Cosmetic outcomes at last follow-up were judged by patients as excellent/good in 93. 8 % (15 / 16), and by physicians as excellent/good in 100 % (16 / 16). Eight patients (50. 0 %) reported no breast/chest wall pain, and the remaining 8 patients (50. 0 %) reported mild pain. All patients remain disease free at last follow-up. The median ipsilateral breast, planning target volume (PTV), and implant volumes were 614 cc, 57 cc, and 333 cc. The median ratios of PTV/ipsilateral breast <b>volume</b> (<b>implant</b> excluded) and PTV/total <b>volume</b> (<b>implant</b> included) were 9 % and 6 %. Conclusions: These 16 breast cancer cases with prior bilateral breast augmentation treated with external beam APBI demonstrate favorable clinical outcomes.

40|$|Purpose: To {{measure and}} compare the surface dose outside the {{treatment}} area at six different points of interest (POIs) for five different breast cancer radiation treatment modalities by using thermo-luminescent dosimeters (TLDs). This experiment will evaluate {{the magnitude of the}} dose due to scatter and leakage radiation at different areas outside the target on a patient that could potentially lead, in the long term, to radiation induced secondary malignancies. Methods: TLD- 100 were calibrated according to the University of Wisconsin Radiation Calibration Laboratory protocol and then used for dose measurements at selected POIs namely sternum, lower abdomen, contralateral breast, thyroid, shoulder, and eye. Twenty five breast cancer patients and the following modalities were included in this study: Strut-adjusted <b>volume</b> <b>implant</b> (SAVI), mammosite multi-lumen (ML), Accuboost, electron boost and photon boost. The surface doses in all patients were measured in a single fraction. The delivered target doses were normalized to 200 cGy. Finally, breast quadrant analysis was performed. Results: The maximum average dose for each POI was as follows: Sternum 6. 51 cGy (SD 2. 93), lower abdomen 4. 50 cGy (SD 2. 63), contralateral breast 8. 52 cGy (SD 3. 86), thyroid 5. 50 cGy (SD 2. 75), shoulder 5. 58 cGy (SD 2. 77), and eye 2. 65 cGy (SD 0. 68). The highest POI dose of 15. 84 cGy was found in contralateral breast. Conclusion: The measured surface dose at each POI varies with the modality of treatment. The surface doses show a strong correlation to the tumor bed location in the breast quadrant. The SAVI, electron boost, and photon boost modalities had delivered smaller surface dose at POIs than the Accuboost and Mammosite ML modalities. While the measured doses fall within the low range, its significance in producing second malignancies would require a large cohort of patients and a longer follow up. </p...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated partial breast {{irradiation}} (APBI) {{with high}} dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy offers an excellent compact course of radiation {{due to its}} limited number of fractions for early-stage carcinoma of breast. One of the recent devices is SAVI (strut-adjusted <b>volume</b> <b>implant),</b> which has 6, 8 or 10 peripheral source channels with one center channel. Each channel can be differentially loaded. This paper focuses on the treatment planning, dosimetry and quality assurance aspects of HDR brachytherapy implant with GammaMed Plus HDR afterloader unit. The accelerated PBI balloon devices normally inflate above 35 cc range, and hence these balloon type devices cannot be accommodated in small lumpectomy cavity sizes. CT images were obtained and 3 -D dosimetric plans were done with Brachyvision planning system. The 3 -D treatment planning and dosimetric data were evaluated with planning target volume (PTV) _eval V 90, V 95, V 150, V 200 skin dose and minimum distance to skin. With {{the use of the}} SAVI 6 - 1 mini device, we were able to accomplish an excellent coverage — V 90, V 95, V 150 and V 200 to 98 %, 95 %, 37 cc (< 50 cc volume) and 16 cc (< 20 cc volume), respectively. Maximum skin dose was between 73 % and 90 %, much below the prescribed dose of 34 Gy. The minimum skin distance achieved was 5 to 11 mm. The volume that received 50 % of the prescribed radiation dose was found to be lower with SAVI. The multi-channel SAVI-based implants reduced the maximum skin dose to markedly lower levels as compared to other modalities, simultaneously achieving best dose coverage to target volume. Differential-source dwell-loading allows modulation of the radiation dose distribution in symmetric or asymmetric opening of the catheter shapes and is also advantageous in cavities close to chest wall...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{degree of}} error in {{subjective}} estimation of breast <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> remains unknown. Methods: Nine silicone breast implants {{were used by}} 16 examiners for subjective, blinded, <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> estimation. The figures on the stamps were taken as the true breast <b>implant</b> <b>volumes</b> for comparison. The examiners {{were divided into two}} groups of equal size: experienced examiners (consultant breast surgeons) and unexperienced examiners (trainees). Fourteen examiners repeated the tests after about 2 weeks. Results: In both groups of doctors, the <b>implant</b> <b>volumes</b> were underestimated by a mean ± standard deviation of 61. 6 ± 58. 1 cc (21. 9 % ± 20. 1 %) in the first test and 37. 9 ± 59. 1 cc (13. 6 % ± 20. 7 %) in the second test. The absolute deviation independent of volume overestimation or underestimation was 77. 3 ± 36. 9 cc (27. 2 % ± 12. 8 %) in the first test and 58. 1 ± 41. 3 cc (20. 6 % ± 14. 6 %) in the second test. In terms of absolute figures, the experienced examiners showed significantly better results than did the unexperienced examiners during the first test. The unexperienced examiners showed increasing deviations with increasing <b>implant</b> <b>volumes.</b> The degree of estimation error was lower in the second test. Conclusions: These blinded subjective estimations of breast <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> exhibited limited accuracy and reproducibility. Estimation errors were quantified and increased with increasing <b>implant</b> <b>volumes.</b> Experienced examiners performed considerably better than unexperienced examiners, and results of the second test were better in both groups.

40|$|Purpose: To {{perform a}} dosimetric {{comparison}} of 3 accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques: catheter-based brachytherapy (BT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and {{proton beam therapy}} (PBT). Patients and Methods: Twelve patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with SAVI (Strut-Adjusted <b>Volume</b> <b>Implant)</b> were selected in this study. The original BT plans were compared with optimum plans using IMRT and PBT for 34 Gy (RBE) with 1. 1 RBE in 10 fractions using identical parameters for target and organs at risk. Results: Significant reduction in maximum dose to the ipsilateral breast was observed with PBT and IMRT (mean 108. 58 % [PBT] versus 107. 78 % [IMRT] versus 2194. 43 % [BT], P[*]=[*]. 001 for both PBT and IMRT compared to BT). The mean dose to the heart was 0 %, 1. 38 %, and 3. 85 %, for PBT, IMRT, and BT, respectively (P[*]<[*]. 001 and P[*]=[*]. 026). The chest wall mean dose was 10. 07 %, 14. 65 %, and 29. 44 % for PBT, IMRT, and BT, respectively (P[*]=[*]. 001 and. 013 compared to BT). The PBT was superior in reducing the mean ipsilateral lung dose (mean 0. 04 % versus 2. 13 % versus 5. 4 %, P[*]=[*]. 025 and P[*]<[*]. 001). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the maximum dose to the ipsilateral lung, chest wall, 3 -mm skin rind or in the mean ipsilateral breast V 50 % among the 3 techniques (P[*]=[*]. 168,. 405,. 067, and. 780, respectively). PBT exhibited the greatest mean dose homogeneity index of 4. 75 compared to 7. 18 for IMRT (P[*]=[*]. 001) and 195. 82 for BT (P[*]<[*]. 001). All techniques resulted in similar dose conformality (P[*]=[*]. 143). Conclusion: This study confirms the dosimetric feasibility of PBT and IMRT to lower dose to organs at risk while still maintaining high target dose conformality. Though the results of this comparison are promising, continued clinical research is needed to better define the role of PBT and IMRT in the accelerated partial breast irradiation treatment of early-stage breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Cell nanoencapsulation {{is a novel}} {{delivery}} system based on a self - assembly technique mediated by electrostatic interactions called Layer - by - Layer (LbL) deposition, without an increase in <b>volume</b> <b>implant</b> because of the nanometric thickness of its layers. LbL coats the entire surface of individual cells, providing mechanical resistance to cells against manipulation and storage conditions prior to implantation in the patient. In this work, single - cell nanocapsule formation using human adipose - derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC) given their potentiality in regenerative medicine was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and Zeta potential assays. Both methodologies were conclusive in showing layer- by-layer nanocapsule formation of every single ADSC. Significant differences in terms of viability and cell functionality preservation were observed depending on the polycation used. Using a combination of fluorescence microscopy and fluorimetric assays, we found that cell survival after nanocapsulation was only efficient when chitosan was added to cells. These results were consistent with other cell types used in this study. Other polycations such as poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly - L - lysine (PLL) markedly decreased cell viability (22 %, 11 % and 15 %, respectively). In addition, the use of potassium - enriched saline solutions, such as Hanks and Ringer’s solution, during the nanoencapsulation process on ADSCs was harmful on cell viability compared to standard media (36 % vs 79 %, respectively). The addition of a mixture of polyanions such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate did not affect cell viability (79 % and 81 %). The combination of chitosan/hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate was also effective in preserving the cell functionality of ADSCs, including the proliferation and differentiation of these cells as assessed by MTT assay and microscopy, respectively. Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} ADSCs can be successfully nanoencapsulated using a first layer of chitosan and a second layer of a combination of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate with a standard potassium concentration in the culture medium. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation should be limited to physicians with high procedural volume. BackgroundExpanding indications for ICDs will result in an increasing number of physicians implanting these devices. MethodsUsing the 20 % Part B Medicare files for 1999 through 2001, we identified new ICD implantations and the corresponding denominator files. We used Medicare Provider Analysis and Review hospital records and the appropriate International Classification of Diseases- 9 diagnosis and procedure codes to define complications within 90 days. We defined physician volume categories by assigning one-quarter of the patients to each quartile. A logistic regression model was used to adjust outcomes for potential confounders. ResultsNinety-day mortality did not differ between patients who had their ICD implanted by physicians with the highest <b>volume</b> of <b>implants</b> and those who had their ICD implanted by physicians with the lowest <b>volume</b> of <b>implants</b> (6. 2 % vs. 5. 9 %; odds ratio [OR] 0. 99; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 75 to 1. 30). Within 90 days, mechanical complications were significantly higher in the lowest volume quartile (OR 1. 47; 95 % CI 1. 09 to 1. 99) but were comparable for physicians who implanted at least 11 ICDs per year. The risk of ICD infection was significantly higher in patients who had their ICD implanted by physicians with the lowest <b>volume</b> of <b>implants</b> (OR 2. 47; 95 % CI 1. 18 to 5. 17). ConclusionsWe observed an association between a higher <b>volume</b> of ICD <b>implants</b> and a lower rate of mechanical complications and infections. This association suggests that ICD implantation should not be performed by physicians without regard to their procedural volume...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for measuring the buccal bone <b>volume</b> around dental <b>implants.</b> Materials and methods: Three to six implants were inserted into the anterior maxilla of eight skulls, depending on the availability of bone, and after this, the CBCT was performed. By means of CBCT image, measurements of the bone wall at three points of the implant were obtained, analyzed and compared with those obtained in the plaster skull casting. Results: The results showed that for the three points of the implants, no statistically significant difference in the measurements was obtained from the plaster model and CBCT images.

40|$|In anatomy based {{optimization}} {{procedures for}} large <b>volume</b> <b>implants</b> {{the calculation of}} dose-volume histograms (DVH) accounts for the {{major part of the}} time involved and can be as long as a few hours. This time is proportional to the number of seeds or source dwell positions required for the implant. A procedure for the calculation of brachytherapy seed dose distribution calculation employing fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and the convolution theorem has been described by others and was supposed to significantly improve the speed of the dose distribution computation. Using new significantly improved FFT algorithms and various other optimization techniques we have compared the calculated differential and integral DVHs in HDR brachytherapy with a single stepping source using actual clinical implants. This is so that we could assess the efficiency and accuracy of the FFT method with that of conventional methods. Our results showed that the FFT based method of calculating DVHs in brachytherapy is comparable in speed with conventional dose calculation methods, but only for implants with more than 287 sources. It is therefore of limited practical use even for large implants. This result is in direct opposition to the claim by other authors...|$|R

40|$|As lipofilling of {{the female}} breast is {{becoming}} more popular in plastic surgery, the use of MRI to assess breast volume has been employed to control postoperative results. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -based breast volumetry software tools by comparing the measurements of silicone implant augmented breasts with the actual <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> specified by the manufacturer. MRI-based volume analysis was performed in eight bilaterally augmented patients (46 ± 9  years) with three different software programs (Brainlab© I plan 2. 6 neuronavigation software; mass analysis, version 5. 3, Medis©; and OsiriX© v. 3. 0. 2. 32 -bit). The <b>implant</b> <b>volumes</b> analysed by the BrainLab© software had a mean deviation of 2. 2 ± 1. 7 % (r?=? 0. 99) relative to the implanted prosthesis. OsiriX© software analysis resulted in a mean deviation of 2. 8 ± 3. 0 % (r?=? 0. 99) and the Medis© software had a mean deviation of 3. 1 ± 3. 0 % (r?=? 0. 99). Overall, the volumes of all analysed breast implants correlated very well with the real <b>implant</b> <b>volumes.</b> Processing time was 10  min per breast with each system and 30  s (OsiriX©) to 5  min (BrainLab© and Medis©) per silicone implant. MRI-based volumetry is a powerful tool to calculate both native breast and silicone <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> in situ. All software solutions performed well and the measurements were close to the actual implant sizes.

Methods: In this study the post-implantation MRI scans of determined cuboids and cylinders were evaluated. All in-terbody test implants were made of titanium alloys. MRI scans were carried out by using T 1 TSE sequences. The total artifact volume (TAV) of all examined implants were calculated for sta-tistical t-test correlation and <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> (IV) /TAV-relation. Results: Considering all ex-amined test implants with an increasing implant size the TAV became significant larger (p< 0, 001) with simultaneous reduction of the respective IV/TAV-relation.

40|$|Objective: Endometriosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease pathologically {{defined as the}} presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. It {{is one of the most}} important diseases affecting women of reproductive age. The process of endometriotic implant growth is mediated by many complex interactions of immunologic, hormonal, genetic, and environmental mediators. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), besides playing a role in preventing invasion and metastasis, is an antioxidant having anti-inflammatory and -angiogenic effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin C on the prevention and regression of endometriotic implants in a rat model of endometriosis. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, comparative, experimental animal study. After endometriotic implants were induced simultaneously, rats were divided into three groups. Group A was given 500  mg/kg of intravenous vitamin C every 2  days, starting immediately after implantation (n =  11). All rats had a second operation 21  days after the initial one and had the lesion volumes measured. Group B was given 500  mg/kg of intravenous vitamin C every 2  days, starting 21  days after this operation (n =  11). All rats were sacrificed 21  days after the third operation. <b>Implant</b> <b>volume,</b> weight measurements, and histopathological evaluation of the lesions were carried out. Group A received vitamin C throughout the study, while Group C (n =  11) was not given any medication. The findings in the three groups were compared.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the potential clinical application of GAX 65. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten boys and 8 girls an average of 4. 6 years old presented with unilateral or bilateral primary reflux and were randomly divided into 2 groups. All refluxing ureters received 1 endoscopic subureteral injection of an average of approximately 2. 9 ml. collagen. In group 1, 16 refluxing ureters were treated with GAX 65 and in group 2, 12 were treated with GAX 35. In all patients voiding cystourethrography was performed immediately after injection and 3 months postoperatively, and ultrasound was done on day 1, and at 1 and 3 months. <b>Implant</b> <b>volume</b> was calculated at the day of injection and at 3 months. The distribution of reflux grades was comparable in the 2 groups. RESULTS: Both materials had excellent injection properties. Immediately after injection all ureters were reflux-free. Of the 16 ureters treated with GAX 65 14 (87. 5 %) were reflux-free at the 3 -month followup. Three months postoperatively ultrasound revealed an average <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> increase of one-third. However, of the 12 ureters treated with GAX 35 reflux had resolved in 59. 3 % and the average <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> had decreased by half 3 months after injection. CONCLUSIONS: Three months after endoscopic subureteral injection of GAX 65 vesicoureteral reflux was absent in 87. 5 % of patients. Therefore, GAX 65 has greater potential for treating reflux in the short term than GAX 35. To define the final efficacy of GAX 65 for treating vesicoureteral reflux, long-term evaluation of this series is necessary. In addition, further studies are mandatory to prove the long-term advantage of this new injectable substance...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{review the}} dental {{literature}} {{in terms of}} efficacy of soft tissue augmentation procedures around dental implants and in partially edentulous sites. METHODS: A Medline search was performed for human studies augmenting keratinized mucosa (KM) and soft tissue <b>volume</b> around <b>implants</b> and in partially edentulous areas. Due to heterogeneity in between the studies, no meta-analyses could be performed. RESULTS: Nine (KM) and eleven (volume) studies met the inclusion criteria. An apically positioned flap/vestibuloplasty (APF/V) plus a graft material [free gingival graft (FGG) /subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) /collagen matrix (CM) ] resulted in an increase of keratinized tissue (1. 4 - 3. 3 mm). Statistically significantly better outcomes were obtained for APF/V plus FGG/SCTG compared with controls (APF/V alone; no treatment) (p < 0. 05). For surgery time and patient morbidity, statistically significantly more favourable outcomes were reported for CM compared to SCTGs (p < 0. 05) in two randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), even though rendering less keratinized tissue. SCTGs were the best-documented method for gain of soft tissue <b>volume</b> at <b>implant</b> sites and partially edentulous sites. Aesthetically at immediate implant sites, better papilla fill and higher marginal mucosal levels were obtained using SCTGs compared to non-grafted sites. CONCLUSIONS: An APF/V plus FGG/SCTG was the best-documented and most successful method to increase the width of KM. APF/V plus CM demonstrated less gain in KM, but also less patient morbidity and surgery time compared to APF/V plus SCTG based on two RCTs.

Histological examination of brains included assessment of lesion <b>volumes,</b> <b>implant</b> cell survival and differentiation, changes to host brain matrix, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis using immunohis-tochemical methods. Results. Statistically significant dose-related recovery in sensorimotor function deficits (bilateral asymmetry test [BAT; P <. 0002] in the mid- and high-dose groups and rotameter test after amphetamine exposure [P <. 05] in the high-dose group) {{was found in the}} CTX 0 E 03 cell implanted groups compared to the vehicle group. In-life functional improvements correlated with cell dose, though did not correlate with survival of CTX 0 E 03 cells measured at postmortem. Surviving CTX 0 E 03 cells differentiated into oligodendroglial and endothelial phenotypes. MCAO-induced reduction of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) was partially restored to that observed in sham operated controls. No adverse CTX 0 E 03 cell-related effects were observed during in-life observations or on tissue histology. Conclusions. This study found that the implantation of CTX 0 E 03 human neural stem cells in rats after MCAO stroke promoted significant behavioral recovery depending on cell dose. The authors propose a paracrine trophic mechanism, which is triggered early after CTX 0 E 0...|$|R
40|$|Complete implant {{coverage}} by pectoralis major muscle in immediate breast reconstruction prevents implant exposure but restricts <b>implant</b> <b>volume,</b> {{increases the risk}} of a high-riding implant, and prevents natural ptosis. The authors hypothesized that extension of the subpectoral pocket with Vicryl mesh may produce more satisfactory results. The safety and efficiency of this technique were assessed by comparing complication rates and clinical results of the two reconstruction techniques: with and without mesh...|$|R
40|$|Bone {{regeneration}} technique using allografts {{is widely}} used in oral surgery to repair alveolar defects and to increase alveolar <b>volume</b> for endosseous <b>implant</b> insertions. Bone allografts promote the reabsorption and neo-synthesis of bone tissue, which are regulated by numerous cytokines, proteins and growth factors. In this study, six patients with insufficient alveolar <b>volume</b> for endosseous <b>implant</b> insertions, were treated with bone regeneration technique using Fresh Frozen Bone (FFB) allografts collected from the femoral head or the hip. Samples of bone graft collected during graft insertion surgery and biopsies collected six months later during implantology were fixed, decalcified and analyzed histomorphologically and morphometrically by haematoxylin-eosin staining. In addition, TGF-beta 1 and VEGF were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The histological analysis of FFBs showed wide areas of calcified bone organized in osteons intermingled with areas of non-calcified matrix containing osteoblasts. However, the regenerated alveolar bone, collected {{six months after the}} graft insertion surgery, showed wide areas of non-calcified matrix. TGF-beta 1 and VEGF were less expressed in FFB than in regenerated alveolar bone...|$|R
40|$|In former {{studies the}} {{magnesium}} alloy LAE 442 showed promising in vivo degradation behavior and biocompatibility. However, reproducibility might {{be enhanced by}} replacement of the rare earth composition metal "E" by only a single rare earth element. Therefore, it was {{the aim of this}} study to examine whether the substitution of "E" by neodymium ("Nd") had an influence on the in vivo degradation rate. LANd 442 implants were inserted into rabbit tibiae and rabbits were euthanized after 4, 8, 13 and 26 weeks postoperatively. In vivo μCT was performed to evaluate the in vivo implant degradation behaviour by calculation of <b>implant</b> <b>volume,</b> density true 3 -D thickness and corrosion rates. Additionally, weight loss, type of corrosion and mechanical stability were appraised by SEM/EDS-analysis and three-point bending tests. <b>Implant</b> <b>volume,</b> density and true 3 -D thickness decreased over time, whereas the variance of the maximum diameters within an implant as well as the corrosion rate and weight loss increased. SEM examination revealed mainly pitting corrosion after 26 weeks. The maximum bending forces decreased over time. DFG/CRC/ 59...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{whether there is an}} optimal type of mathematical equation for predicting seed and activity requirements for permanent prostate brachytherapy. METHODS: Four institutions with extensive brachytherapy experience each submitted details of more than 40 implants. The data was used to generate power and linear equations to reflect the relationship between preimplant volume and the number of seeds <b>implanted,</b> and preimplant <b>volume</b> and the total implant activity. We compared the R and standard error of the generated equations to determine which type of equation better fit the data. RESULTS: For the limited range of prostate <b>volumes</b> commonly <b>implanted</b> (20 - 60 mL), power and linear equations predict seed and activity requirements comparably well. CONCLUSIONS: Linear and power equations are equally suitable for generating institution-specific nomograms...|$|R
30|$|Deep {{circumflex}} iliac artery flap (DCIA) {{is first}} introduced by Taylor et al. in 1979 [1]. Since then, {{it has been}} used to reconstruct composite defect {{in the head and neck}} area. It provides similar contour of mandible and sufficient <b>volume</b> to accommodate <b>implants</b> than other osseous flaps [2]. However, several donor site complications were reported after DCIA flap such as damage of lateral cutaneous femoral nerve, gait disturbance, bowel obstruction, and herniation [3, 4].|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin-D 3 (vitamin D) and omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega- 3 PUFA) on experimentally induced endometriosis in a rat model. Materials and Methods: A prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled experimental study was performed on 30 Wistar female rats. Endometriosis was surgically induced by implanting endometrial tissue on the abdominal peritoneum. Four weeks later, a second laparotomy was performed to assess pre-treatment <b>implant</b> <b>volumes</b> and cytokine levels. The rats were randomized into three groups: vitamin D group (42  μg/kg/day), omega- 3 PUFA group (450  mg/kg/day), and control group (saline 0. 1  mL/rat/day). These treatments were administered for 4 weeks. At the end of treatment, a third laparotomy was performed for the assessment of cytokine levels, <b>implant</b> <b>volumes</b> (post-treatment) and <b>implants</b> were totally excised for histopathologic examination. Pre- and post-treatment volumes, cytokine levels within the groups, as well as stromal and glandular tissues between the groups were compared. Results: The mean post-treatment volume was statistically significantly reduced in the omega- 3 PUFA group (p =  0. 02) and the level of the interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the peritoneal fluid were significantly decreased at the end of treatment in the omega- 3 PUFA group (p =  0. 02, p =  0. 03, and p =  0. 03, respectively). In the vitamin D group, only IL- 6 levels were significantly decreased. In the histopathologic examination, the glandular tissue and stromal tissue scores of the implants were significant lower in the omega- 3 PUFA group (p =  0. 03 and p =  0. 02). Conclusion: Omega- 3 PUFA caused significant regression of endometriotic implants. Vitamin D has not been as effective as omega- 3 PUFA on endometriosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} show illustrative, {{indication}} of alveolar augmentation before insertion of endoosseous dental implants. In our case report we have shown the indication for ridge augmentation prior to the placement of endoosseous dental implant. The local process of bone regeneration was thus stimulated and {{the chances of a}} good clinical output were increased. Case report: Female patient (27 years old) visited our clinic. Diagnosis was periodontitis of 46 and indication to remove the tooth, and reconstruction of alveolar ridge in order to place the implant in a sufficient <b>volume</b> bone. <b>Implant</b> placement occurred 8 months after extraction of the tooth. After 4 months implant placement prosthetic restoration was made. In conclusion, surgical reconstruction of the tissues and the procedure of ridge augmentation and subsequent placement of dental implant are necessary. ...|$|R
30|$|Tooth {{extraction}} is invariably {{followed by}} loss of height and {{width of the}} alveolar process. During natural healing after extraction, reductions in width of between 2.6 and 4.6  mm and in height of between 0.4 and 3.9  mm are observed [6], and these result in narrowing and shortening of the residual ridge [7]. Osseous augmentation procedures for creating bone <b>volume</b> for dental <b>implants</b> often involve the use of grafting materials with or without barrier membranes [1, 2, 8].|$|R

The technique of perioperative interstitial radiation has several advantages: (1) more accurate placement of the tubes in the tumor bed {{at the time of}} surgery; (2) <b>implant</b> <b>volume</b> is kept to a minimum, which improves cosmetic results; and (3) elimination of second general anesthesia for patients considered for implant boost therapy...|$|R
30|$|Intraoperative {{variables}} also {{alter the}} biological response to mesh. Both animal models and human {{studies have shown}} that reducing the <b>volume</b> of mesh <b>implanted</b> reduces the risk of erosion [38, 39]. The technique of mesh placement and its location also influences the likelihood of erosion. Ovine models demonstrate a greater risk of mesh erosion associated with TVM when compared to mesh placed abdominally [40]. Histological examination of mesh explants in these studies demonstrated a more pronounced FBR after vaginal placement perhaps reflecting clinical findings in human studies.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{significant}} increase in the popularity of breast augmentation surgeries has led to {{an increase in the number}} and types of complications; among these is the postoperative occurrence of Striae Distensae (SD). The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of SD and describing its occurrence in association with age, breast <b>implant</b> <b>volume,</b> history of SD, history of pregnancies and breastfeeding, body mass index (BMI), changes in postoperative weight, smoking habits, and use of oral contraceptives. Methods: A cohort study was conducted and the patient data from a specific social group that underwent augmentation mammaplasty with silicone breast implants in a private clinic was analyzed. Results: 563 patients entered the cohort, while 538 completed the study. The SD incidence was 7. 06 %. The risk was almost the double at 22 – 28 years of age and triple in women of 21 years of age or less. The women who did not use oral contraceptives were 2. 59 times more likely of developing SD. A higher incidence of SD was observed among those with normal or low BMI values, smokers, and in those who had implants larger than 300 ml. Conclusions: Young age, larger <b>implant</b> <b>volumes,</b> smoking, and normal or low BMI values were the risk factors responsibl...|$|R
