5|$|Following {{the third}} prototype, several design {{improvements}} were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke emissions by the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The <b>vertical</b> <b>tail</b> fin was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare equipment bay in the tip. The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased {{maximum take-off weight}} and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF had selected Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, the winner of which {{was expected to be}} finalised in 2006. PT-04, the fourth prototype and the first to incorporate the design changes, was rolled out in April 2006 and made its first flight on 28 April 2006.|$|E
5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown <b>vertical</b> <b>tail.</b> The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} 50 {{aircraft}} placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 {{with the standard}} armament of one 37mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the <b>vertical</b> <b>tail</b> to improve lateral stability; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to smooth the air flow of the engine exhaust and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted {{and a total of}} 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the NASA Langley 20 -Foot Vertical Spin Tunnel to determine the developed spin and spin-recovery characteristics of a 1 / 28 -scale, free-spinning model of the NASA F- 18 HARV (High Alpha Research Vehicle) airplane that can be configured with and without the <b>vertical</b> <b>tails</b> installed. The purpose of the test was to determine what effects, if any, the absence of <b>vertical</b> <b>tails</b> (and rudders) had on the spin and spin-recovery capabilities of the HARV. The model was ballasted to dynamically represent the full-scale airplane {{at an altitude of}} 25 000 feet. Erect and inverted spin tests with symmetric mass loadings were conducted with the free-spinning model. The model results indicate that the basic airplane with <b>vertical</b> <b>tails</b> installed (with unaugmented control system) will exhibit fast, flat erect and inverted spins from which acceptable recoveries can be made. Removing the <b>vertical</b> <b>tails</b> had little effect on the erect spin mode, but did degrade recoveries from erect spins. In contrast, inverted spins without the <b>vertical</b> <b>tails</b> were significantly more severe than those with the tails installed...|$|R

40|$|Buffeting is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon occurring at high angles of attack that plagues high performance aircraft, {{especially those with}} twin <b>vertical</b> <b>tails.</b> Previous wind-tunnel and flight tests were conducted to characterize the buffet loads on the <b>vertical</b> <b>tails</b> by measuring surface pressures, bending moments, and accelerations.

A {{better understanding of the}} partial (spatial) correlation of the differential buffet pressures on the tail was necessary to improve the buffeting predictions.

25|$|The {{prototype}} XP-9, marked A 028-386, {{was first}} flown on 18 November 1930. It had impressive stats on the specification sheet, but {{it quickly became}} apparent that its large (6ft chord) wing, which was placed atop the fuselage {{directly in front of}} the pilot, obstructed downward visibility so badly that simple landing maneuvers were hazardous. Test pilots at the Army Test Centre at Wright Field found that the XP-9's inherent instability was so severe that immediate modifications were requested to increase the size of the <b>vertical</b> <b>tail.</b> An enlarged <b>vertical</b> <b>tail</b> surface with smooth metal skinning was introduced, but failed to effect any significant improvement, and this revised XP-9 was grounded for instructional airframe use in August 1931, after only 15 hours of test flying.|$|E
25|$|The <b>{{vertical}}</b> <b>tail</b> or {{vertical stabilizer}} of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the <b>vertical</b> <b>tail</b> must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E
25|$|The DF 2000 was {{designed}} to provide a fast, robust, comfortable, low-cost side-by-side two-seat ultralight with a short take-off run.

50|$|The empennages of the S.55 and S.63 were similar, {{though the}} latter had two <b>vertical</b> <b>tails</b> rather than three. These were wire-braced and, {{including}} balanced rudders, quadrantal in profile, with one attached to each girder. A rectangular tailplane, mounted {{at a high}} incidence, linked the girders and projected beyond them. It carried a semi-elliptical, balanced elevator.|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} 901s built {{retained}} the curved <b>vertical</b> <b>tail</b> of the 900 {{but the third}} had a straight topped shape with a rudder that was straight edged except at the heel. The 901's undercarriage is a retractable monowheel, fitted with a brake, plus a tail bumper.|$|E
25|$|Any {{factor that}} has {{influence}} on the balance of forces and on the yawing and rolling moments after engine failure might also affect VMCs.

40|$|Buffeting is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon which plagues high performance aircraft at high angles of attack.

Previous flight and wind-tunnel investigations to determine the buffet loads on the tail did not provide a complete description of the spatial characteristics of the unsteady differential pressures. Consequently, the unsteady differential pressures {{were considered to be}} fully correlated in the analyses of buffet and buffeting. The use of fully correlated pressures in estimating the generalized aerodynamic forces for the analysis of buffeting yielded responses that exceeded those measured in flight and in the wind tunnel.
