5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, <b>vanadinite</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element vanadium, which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. <b>Vanadinite</b> is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of <b>vanadinite</b> with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Crystals of <b>vanadinite</b> {{conform to}} a {{hexagonal}} system of symmetry. This internal structure is often {{reflected in the}} hexagonal external shape of the crystals. The crystals are usually {{in the form of}} short hexagonal prisms, but can also be found as hexagonal pyramids, rounded masses or crusts. A unit cell of <b>vanadinite,</b> the smallest divisible unit that possesses the same symmetry and properties, {{is in the form of}} a hexagonal prism. The unit cell of <b>vanadinite</b> is composed of two of its molecules and has the dimensions a = 10.331Å and c = 7.343Å), where a is the length of each side of the hexagon and c is the height of the prism.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} <b>vanadinites</b> (Pb(x) Ca(10 -x)) (VO 4) 6 F 2 delta, 1 < x < 9, adopt a P 6 (3) /m apatite {{structure with}} 9. 7590 (1) < or = a < or = 10. 1179 (1) A and 7. 0434 (3) < or = c < or = 7. 4021 (1) A. The partitioning of calcium and lead over the AI(4 f) and AII(6 h) positions is nonstoichiometric with lead preferentially entering the larger AII site. High-resolution electron microscopy showed that samples annealed for 10 h at 1073 K are in disequilibrium with calcium- and lead-rich microdomains co-existing at unit-cell scales. For (Pb 5 Ca 5) (VO 4) 6 F 2 delta, sintering {{in excess of}} 2 weeks {{is required for the}} metals to order macroscopically. As annealing progresses, c/a, the partitioning coefficient kPb(AI/AII) and the AIO 6 metaprism twist angle (phi) adjust cooperatively to enlarge the apatite channel, and thereby accommodate higher lead content. These results demonstrate that phi is a sensitive measure of disequilibrium and a useful device for monitoring changes in apatite topology as a function of composition...|$|R
5|$|<b>Vanadinite</b> is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of <b>vanadinite</b> contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining <b>vanadinite</b> molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring <b>vanadinite</b> units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadinite</b> is an {{uncommon}} mineral, only occurring {{as the result}} of chemical alterations to a pre-existing material. It is therefore known as a secondary mineral. It is found in arid climates and forms by oxidation of primary lead minerals. <b>Vanadinite</b> is especially found in association with the lead sulfide, galena. Other associated minerals include wulfenite, limonite, and barite.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadinite</b> {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of <b>vanadinite</b> include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. <b>Vanadinite</b> when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadinite</b> {{is usually}} bright-red or orange-red in colour, {{although}} sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless.

5|$|<b>Vanadinite</b> is {{a mineral}} {{belonging}} to the apatite group of phosphates, with the chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It {{is one of the}} main industrial ores of the metal vanadium and a minor source of lead. A dense, brittle mineral, it is usually found in the form of red hexagonal crystals. It is an uncommon mineral, formed by the oxidation of lead ore deposits such as galena. First discovered in 1801 in Mexico, <b>vanadinite</b> deposits have since been unearthed in South America, Europe, Africa, and North America.|$|E
5|$|Deposits of <b>vanadinite</b> {{are found}} {{worldwide}} including Austria, Spain, Scotland, the Ural Mountains, South Africa, Namibia, Morocco, Argentina, Mexico, and 4 {{states of the}} United States: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadinite</b> {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized zone of lead-bearing deposits, the vanadium is leached from wall-rock silicates.

500|$|It was {{originally}} discovered in Mexico by the Spanish mineralogist Andrés Manuel del Río in 1801. He called the mineral [...] "brown lead" [...] and asserted that it contained a new element, which he first named pancromium and later, erythronium. However, {{he was later}} {{led to believe that}} this was not a new element but merely an impure form of chromium. In 1830, Nils Gabriel Sefström discovered a new element, which he named vanadium. It was later revealed that this was identical to the metal discovered earlier by Andrés Manuel del Río. Del Río's [...] "brown lead" [...] was also rediscovered, in 1838 in Zimapan, Hidalgo, Mexico, and was named <b>vanadinite</b> because of its high vanadium content. Other names that have since been given to <b>vanadinite</b> are johnstonite and lead vanadate.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium is the 20th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} earth's crust; metallic vanadium is rare in nature (known as the mineral vanadium, native vanadium), but vanadium compounds occur naturally in about 65 different minerals. Economically significant examples include patronite (VS4), <b>vanadinite</b> (...) , and carnotite (...) [...] Much of the world's vanadium production is sourced from vanadium-bearing magnetite found in ultramafic gabbro bodies. Vanadium is mined mostly in South Africa, north-western China, and eastern Russia. In 2013 these three countries mined more than 97% of the 79,000 tonnes of produced vanadium.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium was {{discovered}} by Andrés Manuel del Río, a Spanish-Mexican mineralogist, in 1801. Del Río extracted the element from a sample of Mexican [...] "brown lead" [...] ore, later named <b>vanadinite.</b> He found that its salts exhibit {{a wide variety of}} colors, and as a result he named the element panchromium (Greek: παγχρώμιο [...] "all colors"). Later, Del Río renamed the element erythronium (Greek: ερυθρός [...] "red") because most of the salts turned red upon heating. In 1805, the French chemist Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils, backed by del Río's friend Baron Alexander von Humboldt, incorrectly declared that del Río's new element was only an impure sample of chromium. Del Río accepted Collet-Descotils' statement and retracted his claim.|$|E
500|$|Andrés Manuel del Río {{discovered}} compounds of vanadium in 1801 in Mexico {{by analyzing}} a new lead-bearing mineral he called [...] "brown lead", and presumed its qualities {{were due to}} the presence of a new element, which he named erythronium (derived from Greek for [...] "red") since, upon heating, most of the salts turned red. Four years later, however, he was (erroneously) convinced by other scientists that erythronium was identical to chromium. Chlorides of vanadium were generated in 1830 by Nils Gabriel Sefström who thereby proved that a new element was involved, which he named [...] "vanadium" [...] after the Scandinavian goddess of beauty and fertility, Vanadís (Freyja). Both names were attributed to the wide range of colors found in vanadium compounds. Del Rio's lead mineral was later renamed <b>vanadinite</b> for its vanadium content. In 1867 Henry Enfield Roscoe obtained the pure element.|$|E
