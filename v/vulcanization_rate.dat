30|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} vulcanization {{time on the}} damping properties of foamed EPDM rubber is shown in Fig. 5, where the vulcanization temperature is 165  °C. It {{can be seen from}} Fig.  5 a that the foamed EPDM rubber has the largest storage modulus when the vulcanization time is 15  min. At other curing times, the storage modulus is not much different. This is because when the vulcanization time reaches 15  min, the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> is already fast, the degree of crosslinking is already high, but the foaming is still in the early stage, and the gas pressure generated by the decomposition of the blowing agent is mostly insufficient to open the cross-linked EPDM rubber matrix, so that the cells are difficult to form. At this time, the foamed EPDM rubber has a small internal cell and a small number. When the vulcanization time is 20  min, at this time, the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> of the foamed EPDM rubber is close to that of vulcanization at 15  min, but the foaming agent is decomposed in a large amount, and the internal pressure generated is too large, which breaks the cross-linking, and finally forms many cells. Thereafter, when the vulcanization time is 25  min, 30  min, and 35  min, the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> and the foaming speed are both fast, the foaming and vulcanization reach a dynamic balance, and a large number of cells having a uniform pore diameter are produced [17].|$|E

The polar chemistry of silica/silicate is resorted {{due to the fact}} that china clay (Rubber grade; processed at Boralesgamuwa refinery by Lanka Ceramic Limited) contains approximately 46 % Sio 2 and 36 % Al 2 O 3 by weight. China clay was oxinated to reduce the agglomeration due to the attraction between Gibsite to Silicate layers. Then treated with selected polar polymers in aqueous and non aqueous mediums to eliminate hydrophilic nature of clay which causes difficulty of achieving rapid wetting and dispersion in rubber and retarding effect on <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rates</b> of accelerated sulphur compounds. In addition to the above treatment methods, coarser particles of clay has been eliminated by incremental gravitational sedimentation and the suspension was subsequently flocculated with a polar polymer.

Similarly, the mixing sequence of ingredient and carbon black into rubber influenced the rate of vulcanization reaction.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  3 that the {{vulcanization}} temperature and the vulcanization time have a great influence on the torque of the foamed EPDM rubber. When the vulcanization temperature is 150  °C, the vulcanization temperature is low, the scorch time is extremely short, the foaming has not started, and the rubber has begun to vulcanize. When the foaming agent starts to decompose, the degree of crosslinking is already high, {{and it is difficult to}} form cells, so it cannot be vulcanized at this temperature. When the vulcanization temperature is 180  °C, the vulcanization process will be over vulcanized in less than 10  min. At this time, the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> drops rapidly, and the foaming agent decomposes in a large amount, which causes the gas generated by the decomposition to substantially destroy the EPDM rubber matrix, causing the cells to collapse, and the resulting foamed EPDM rubber has major defects. Therefore, it cannot be vulcanized at this temperature. Observing a few curves, it can be found that when the vulcanization time is 15  min, the vulcanization period is basically reached, and the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> is faster [16]. Therefore, the effect of vulcanization at a vulcanization temperature of 155  °C to 175  °C for 15  min to 35  min on the damping sound absorption properties of the foamed EPDM rubber will be discussed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: With a view {{to improve}} {{degradation}} properties of natural rubber on prolonged cure at moderately high temperature, a study is made using a co-vulcanizable processing aid known as trans-polyocte ylene (TOR) on natural rubber filled compounds. Rheometer results show that reversion resistance im-proves at all curing temperatures {{in the presence of}} TOR-more so with EV (efficient vulcanization) and semi-EV systems compared to CV (conventional <b>vulcanization)</b> systems. Cure <b>rate</b> diminishes and activation energy increases with incorporation of TOR in natural rubber irrespective of the curing system. Modulus and hardness retention also are much better for TOR filled com-pounds under anaerobic conditions. Tensile strength, however, drops unlike modulus and hardness. Heat buildup and loss tangent (tan&delta;) results reveal less heat development in TOR filled compounds. Retention of Vr (volume fraction of rubber) value indicates a similar trend like modulus and hardness, showing preservation of network structure. Such an improvement of reversion prop-erties under anaerobic ageing conditions may be attributed to simultaneous crosslink formation on TOR phase in addition to natural rubber phase which has been explained through DSC studies. ’Author to whom correspondence should be addresse...|$|R

Parallel studies involving various levels of epoxidation on natural rubber (ENR) in the absence of bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT) coupling agent, as well as a combination of ENRs with different loadings of TESPT, provide a better understanding of the various factors that influence the properties of silica-filled ENR compounds. Based on the overall properties, the best possible combination to optimize processability, to reduce filler–filler interaction, and improve <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> as well as vulcanizate properties, is to use ENR with an epoxide content in the range of 20 – 30 mol%, together with a small portion of TESPT, that is, 2 – 4 wt% relative to the silica content.

40|$|Soon at the {{beginning}} of the last century after it was discovered that carbon black isan active filler in rubbers, it became one of the most important components in man-ufacturing of rubber products. In this work, the effect of carbon black’s type and loading and the structure of rubbers on rate constant and activation energy of the vulcan-ization were studied by the rheometer. The rubbers for this purpose are ethylene propy-lene diene monomer (EPDM), with natural rubber (NR), and butadiene rubber (BR). The overall rate of vulcanization is calculated from the kinetic expression of first order vulcan-ization. The results have showed that carbon black reduces activation energy in all rub-bers and increases overall rate of vulcanization. In this case N 330 reduces the activation energy and increases the overall rate of vulcanization rather than N 660. On the other hand, this research showed that <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> of EPDM/BR is less than EPDM / NR.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  6 a that the foamed EPDM rubber has the highest storage modulus when the {{vulcanization}} temperature is 160  °C. When the vulcanization temperature is 170  °C, 155  °C, the storage modulus is lower. When the vulcanization temperature is 165  °C, 175  °C, the storage modulus is the lowest. According to the analysis of the EPDM rubber vulcanization characteristic curve, when the vulcanization time is 30  min, the vulcanization temperature is in the range of 155  °C to 175  °C, and the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> is not much different. However, at this time, the foaming speed has a large increase with the increase of the vulcanization temperature, which will have a great influence on the damping properties of the foamed EPDM rubber. As shown in Fig. 6 b, the highest loss factor is 1.491 when the vulcanization temperature is 160  °C. However, in the whole effective damping temperature range, the loss factor is smaller than the loss factor of 165  °C, and the maximum loss factor of the foamed EPDM rubber is 1.44 at a vulcanization temperature of 165  °C, which is slightly smaller than the vulcanization temperature of 160  °C. Therefore, when the vulcanization temperature is 165  °C, the foamed EPDM rubber has the best damping performance. This phenomenon occurs because the foaming agent is largely decomposed at a vulcanization temperature of 170  °C and 175  °C, and the generated gas pressure is too large, destroying most of the cross-linking bonds. At the same time, a large number of cells collapse, and a parallel hole phenomenon occurs, and many defective cells are formed, which further reduces the damping performance. When the vulcanization temperature is 155  °C, the decomposition rate of the foaming agent is too low, the gas pressure is insufficient to break the cross-linking bonds, the generated cells are less, and the energy loss is also small. When the vulcanization temperature is 160  °C and 165  °C, the decomposition rate of the foaming agent reaches a certain level, and the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> of the EPDM rubber reaches a dynamic balance. At this time, more cells with more uniform pore diameter will be generated. When the energy passes, there will be a large loss, and the damping performance will be further improved.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the influence of}} the introduction of aluminosilicate microspheres on value of the Payne effect, rheometric, physico-mechanical thermophysical and fire-heat-shielding properties of the elastomer compositions used in the thermal protective coatings based on ethylene-propylene rubber. It was found that partial sorption of vulcanization accelerators and sulfur can occur on the surface of microspheres, followed by their desorption at the vulcanization temperature. This is confirmed by the appearance of a second peak on the <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> curve. The use of hollow aluminosilicate microspheres in the composition of elastomeric fire-heat-shielding coatings makes it possible to increase the efficiency of these compositions by reducing the thermal conductivity and density of the article while saving the optimum level of physico-mechanical properties. In accordance with the proposed mechanism for the interaction of the polymer matrix and microspheres, additional crosslinked structures are formed within the rubber matrix. An increase in the content of microspheres leads to an increase in the filler-filler interaction, which leads to a relative increase in thermal conductivity. However, the thermal conductivity of compositions containing relatively large amounts of the microspheres is still lower than that of the control. The introduction of microspheres slows down the heating of the sample during high-temperature tests, while reducing the loss of mass and the rate of linear combustion...|$|E
40|$|A Parabola-Hyperbola (P-H) {{kinetic model}} for NR sulphur {{vulcanization}} is presented. The idea originates from the fitting composite Parabola-Parabola-Hyperbola (P-P-H) function {{used by the}} authors in [1, 2] to approximate experimental rheometer curves {{with the knowledge of}} a few key parameters of vulcanization, such as the scorch point, initial <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate,</b> 90 % of vulcanization, maximum point and reversion percentage. After proper normalization of experimental data (i. e. excluding induction and normalizing against maximum torque), the P-P-H model reduces to the discussed P-H composite function, which is linked to the kinetic scheme originally proposed by Han and co-workers [3]. Typically, it is characterized by three kinetic constants, where classically the first two describe incipient curing and stable/instable crosslinks and the last reproduces reversion. The powerfulness of the proposed approach stands into the very reduced number of input parameters required to accurately fit normalized experimental data (i. e. rate of vulcanization at scorch, vulcanization at 90 %, maximum point and reversion percentage), and the translation of a mere geometric data-fitting into a kinetic model. Kinetic constants knowledge from simple geometric fitting allows characterizing rubber curing also at temperature different from those experimentally tested. The P-H model can be applied also in the so-called backward direction, i. e. assuming Han's kinetic constants known from other models and deriving the geometric fitting parameters as result. Some existing experimental data available, relying into rheometer curves conducted at 5 different temperatures on the same rubber blend are used to benchmark the P-H kinetic approach proposed, in both backward and forward direction. Very good agreement with previously presented kinetic approaches and experimental data is observed...|$|E
40|$|A {{closed form}} {{procedure}} to determine kinetic constants for NR vulcanized with sulphur is presented. The kinetic scheme originally proposed by Han et al. (Polymer (Korea) 22 : 223 – 230, 1998) and further modified by Milani et al. (Polym Test 32 : 1052 – 1063, 2013) is adopted as starting point to deduce a closed form expression for rubber curing degree. Rheometer experimental data collected at different temperatures {{are used to}} tune model parameters. After the normalization of the rheometer curves and the exclusion of induction period from calculations, the model requires the estimation of three kinetic constants, two of them describing incipient curing and stable crosslinks formations, the last reproducing reversion phenomenon. Whilst such constants are almost always determined by least-squares best fitting, here a numerical iterative procedure—much more stable and efficient from a computational standpoint—is proposed. The approach requires as input parameters only the degree of vulcanization at infinite (i. e. {{at the end of}} vulcanization), the instant where the maximum torque is reached and initial rate of vulcanization. The condition that the numerical curve reaches a maximum at a given time translates mathematically into a non-linear equation in two of the kinetic constants, which are determined iteratively in the paper. The numerical initial <b>vulcanization</b> <b>rate</b> is tuned in such a way to globally minimize the absolute error between numerical and experimental curves. The main capability of the procedure proposed stands in the very straightforward determination of reaction kinetic constants, avoiding demanding least-squares fittings on rheometer experimental data. A set of experimental data available, relying into rheometer curves of the same rubber blend conducted at five different temperatures are used to estimate the fitting capabilities of the mathematical model proposed. Very good agreement with experimental data is observed...|$|E
