5000|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Neck</b> quickly filled one of {{the four}} ships brought by Warwyck with spice and then sailed for home with it and the other three that he had already filled.

40|$|The density matrix {{renormalization}} group (DMRG) has {{an underlying}} variational ansatz, the matrix product state (MPS). The accuracy of this ansatz {{is controlled by}} its virtual dimension. In most applications for quantum chemistry this parameter is very large, and the high-accuracy or FCI regime is studied. With a good orbital choice and ordering, and by exploiting the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, DMRG then allows to retrieve highly accurate results in active spaces {{beyond the reach of}} FCI [1, 2]. However, DMRG can also be of use with smaller virtual dimensions. I will discuss how fundamental ideas from Hartree-Fock (HF) theory are transferable to DMRG. Both methods have a variational ansatz. The time-independent variational principle leads for HF and DMRG to a self-consistent mean-field theory in the particles and lattice sites, respectively. The time-dependent variational principle results in the random-phase approximation (RPA). RPA reveals the elementary excitations: particle and site excitations for HF and DMRG, respectively. Exponentiation of these excitations provides a nonredundant parameterization of the ansatz manifold, formulated by Thouless’ theorem. A Taylor expansion in the nonredundant parameters leads to the configuration interaction expansion [3, 4]. References [1] S. Wouters, W. Poelmans, P. W.
