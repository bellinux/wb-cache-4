25|$|Previously, it {{was unknown}} how {{pufferfish}} inflation took place. Recently, however, Dr. Peter Wainwright completed his {{analysis on the}} series of muscle actions which allow a pufferfish to inflate. First, the pufferfish fills its mouth with water. Then, it seals its mouth using a special valve {{at the bottom of}} the mouth. This <b>valve</b> <b>flaps</b> upward and covers the entire mouth of the fish. Next, a branchiostegal ray (a modified gill arch) pushes the water down the esophagus into the stomach. The extremely elastic stomach then expands. Depending on the species the fugu can achieve an almost perfect spherical shape.|$|E
50|$|Lutembacher affects more {{specifically}} the atria {{of the heart}} and the mitral or bicuspid valve. The disorder itself is known {{more specifically}} as both congenital atrial septal defect (ASD) and acquired mitral stenosis (MS). Congenital (at birth) atrial septal defect refers to a hole being in the septum or wall that separates the two atria; this condition is usually seen in fetuses and infants. Mitral stenosis refers to mitral valve leaflets (or <b>valve</b> <b>flaps)</b> sticking to each other making the opening for blood to pass from the atrium to the ventricles very small. With the valve being so small, blood has difficulty passing through the left atrium into the left ventricle. There are several types of septal defects that may occur with Lutembacher's syndrome: ASD Ostium Secundum or ASD (Primium); Ostium Secundum is the most prevalent.|$|E
50|$|The second {{cause of}} Lutembacher's {{syndrome}} is mitral stenosis (MS). MS {{can be caused}} by birth defects, rheumatic fever, or just stress to the heart due to ASD; because MS {{can be caused by}} several things, there is no exact mechanism but many mechanisms or causes. If mitral valve stenosis is a result of birth defects during development stemming from rheumatic fever, several things may occur in the heart. Rheumatic fever causes the immune system to attack its own protein tissues leading to lesions forming on the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>flaps.</b> As the flaps heals over time, the flaps lose their filmy and floppiness resulting in solid, stiff flaps. The loss of proper flappy mitral valves makes it harder for the valves to open and allow blood to flow through. As a result of blood flow being stopped or slowed by the faulty valve, pressure begins to build in the heart. It was once thought an ASD is not already present, could form because of MS, but it is now thought the ASD is either a birth defect or acquired from surgical procedures.|$|E

40|$|THESE valves are {{designed}} to prevent rebreath-ing during spontaneous or intermittent positive pressure respiration. The transition from spon-taneous to assisted or controlled ventilation is effected by sharply compressing the reservoir bag.

The inspiratory port is immediately closed and the expired gases pass to the atmosphere (fig. 1).

40|$|Background: Mitral valve {{prolapse}} (MVP) is a valvular {{heart disease}} {{in which the two}} <b>valve</b> <b>flaps</b> of the mitral valve do not close equally, and part of the mitral valve slips backward loosely into the left atrium during systole. In general, MVP is associated with low body mass index (BMI), as confirmed by several studies. However, the reason for the higher prevalence of MVP in patients with low BMI remains unknown. Objectives: There is no reliable evidence on the role of genetics or pathophysiological factors in this correlation, and the hypothesis that the size of BMI may lead to MVP or vice versa has not yet been established. Materials and Methods: In this study, all the articles were evaluated in terms of the inclusion criteria. In total, we found 546 articles via PubMed and Google scholar, out of which 30 articles were mainly focusing on MVP, MVR as the major complication of MVP, and BMI, which were included in this systematic review. Results: Among these reviewed studies, patients with MVP had a lower BMI score compared to the subjects without MVP. The low and high BMI score were 28 ± 5 kg/m and 31 ± 6 kg/m, respectively. Conclusions: In the present study, we concluded that low BMI is directly associated with the occurrence of MVP. </p...|$|E

50|$|A voice {{prosthesis}} has to {{be replaced}} regularly, because after a certain time, the <b>valve</b> <b>flap</b> of the voice prosthesis does not close properly anymore, due to yeast and other natural sediments. This causes leakage of saliva or drinks, which enters the wind pipe and makes the person concerned cough. If not resolved by cleaning the voice prosthesis, this {{is a sign that}} the voice prosthesis must be changed. If that is not possible right away, there are special plugs that can block the leakage.

5000|$|Attempts at man-powered flight still persisted. Paucton's {{rotorcraft}} was man-powered, {{while another}} approach, also originally studied by da Vinci, {{was the use}} of <b>flap</b> <b>valves.</b> The <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> is a simple hinged flap over a hole in the wing. In one direction it opens to allow air through and in the other it closes to allow an increased pressure difference. An early example was designed by Bauer in 1764. Later in 1808, Jacob Degen built an ornithopter with <b>flap</b> <b>valves,</b> in which the pilot stood on a rigid frame and worked the wings with a movable horizontal bar. His 1809 attempt at flight failed, so he then added a small hydrogen balloon and the combination achieved some short hops. Popular illustrations of the day depicted his machine without the balloon, leading to confusion as to what had actually flown. In 1811, Albrecht Berblinger built an ornithopter based on Degen's design but omitted the balloon, plunging instead into the Danube. The fiasco did have an upside: George Cayley, also taken in by the illustrations, was spurred to publish his findings to date [...] "for the sake of giving a little more dignity to a subject bordering upon the ludicrous in public estimation", and the modern era of aviation was born.|$|R
50|$|There {{are even}} special, {{problem-solving}} voice prosthesis, e.g. for laryngectomized patients with very short device life times (less than 4 to 8 weeks) {{of their current}} prosthesis. Those extremely short device life times {{may be caused by}} excessive candida growth, so that the valve of the prosthesis does not close properly anymore and content from the food pipe leaks through the voice prosthesis into the windpipe. Some of these prostheses have a magnet within the valve that strengthens the closure, others are made of silver oxide silicone to reduce biofilm formation on the valve or use two valves, in case of defect of the esophageal valve, the other valve would seal. In patients with a short device life, the use of a voice prosthesis with supporting magnets in the valve seat and <b>valve</b> <b>flap</b> has been proven to be cost effective.|$|R

40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out in 15 normal {{subjects}} and 14 patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence to test whether a rectoanal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> could be responsible for maintaining faecal continence in man. Intraluminal pressures were recorded from the rectum and from three sites in the anal canal during serial increases in intra-abdominal pressure, produced by forced expiration into a sphygmomanometer keeping {{the height of the}} column of mercury at prescribed levels. The anal pressures in the normal volunteers always remained higher than the intrarectal pressures even when these were as high as 230 cm H 2 O. This pressure gradient was the reverse of that which would be found if an anterior rectal <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> maintained continence and suggests instead that continence is normally maintained by a reflex contraction of the external anal sphincter. The anal pressures in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence, however, fell below the rectal pressure as the intra-abdominal pressure increased, creating the conditions for a <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve was incompetent, however, because fluid infused into the rectum leaked from the anus whenever the rectal pressure exceeded the anal pressure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a micropump fabricated from low cost materials with specific goal of cost reduction. The micropump {{does not require}} any <b>valve</b> <b>flap</b> and comprises one plastic pump polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) body, one metal diaphragm, and three piezoelectric ceramics to form piezoelectrically actuated diaphragm valves. The valve actuation simplifies micropump structural designs and assembly processes to make the pump attractive for low cost bio-medical drug delivery applications. A detailed optimization design of geometric parameters of the piezoelectrically actuated diaphragm is undertaken by use of 3 D finite element method (FEM) to maximize piezoelectric actuation capability and ensure actuation reliability. An optimized geometric dimensional design: the ratio of thicknesses between the piezoelectric ceramics and the metal diaphragm, and the lateral dimension of the piezoelectric ceramic, is obtained through simulations. Based on the optimized design, a good agreement has been reached between simulated and measured strokes of the micropumps. The tested {{results show that the}} micropump has a high pump flow rate for air, up to 39 ml/min, and for water, up to 1. 8 ml/min, and is capable of ensuring diaphragm's maximum stress and strain is within material strength for reliable work...|$|R

The aim was to investigate histologic and ultrastructural organization of muscular bundles in human IAS, including fossa ovalis (FO) and <b>flap</b> <b>valve.</b> Methods: Macroscopic and light microscopy evaluations of IAS were performed from postmortem studies of 40 patients. Twenty three IAS specimens underwent serial transverse sectioning, and 17 - longitudinal sectioning. The transverse sections from 10 patients were immunolabeled for HCN 4, Caveolin 3 and Connexin 43. IAS specimens from 6 other patients underwent electron microscopy. Results: In all IAS specimens sections the FO, its rims and the <b>flap</b> <b>valve</b> had muscle fibers consisting of working cardiac myocytes. Besides the typical cardiomyocytes there were unusual cells: tortuous and horseshoe-shaped intertangled myocytes, small and large rounded myocytes with pale cytoplasm.
