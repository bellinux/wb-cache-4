40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2008 Dr. Marcus VolzA network is called gradient-constrained if the absolute value of the instantaneous gradient at each differentiable point on the edges in the network {{is no more than}} a given positive constant [13]. A flow-dependent network is a network in which flow demands are assigned between given pairs of vertices, and the cost per unit length of an edge in the network is a function of the total flow through the edge [34]. An application of gradient-constrained flow-dependent networks is to underground mine design. In an underground mining operation, ore is extracted from fixed underground points, called draw points, and transported to a common facility, such as the base of a <b>vertical</b> <b>hoisting</b> shaft or a fixed portal at the surface. The set of tunnels interconnecting the draw points and the facility can be modelled by a mathematical network, where the draw points correspond to fixed vertices and the tunnels correspond to edges. The gradient constraint ensures that a tunnel is navigable by haulage trucks, since the maximum grade at which these vehicles can operate is typically 1 : 7. Fundamental properties of length-minimising gradient-constrained networks have been well-studied [13]. Properties of flow-dependent networks subject to the gradient constraint are, however, less well understood, and in this work we provide a thorough treatment of such networks. Two problems are considered: the Fermat-Weber problem, which asks for a point minimising the sum of weighted distances to a set of given points, and the Gilbert arborescence problem, which asks for a minimum-cost flow-dependent network interconnecting given sources and a unique sink. Initially, we investigate flow-dependent networks in two settings without the gradient constraint. First, we examine networks in Euclidean space. Euclidean networks provide valuable insights into gradient-constrained networks, and are applicable to un derground mining in their own right. Second, we explore flow-dependent networks in Minkowski spaces, which are real finite-dimensional normed spaces. The importance of studying networks in Minkowski spaces is made apparent by the connection that a gradient-constrained network is a special example of a network in a Minkowski space. We demonstrate the application of flow-dependent networks to underground mining via an industry case study, in which aspects from the Fermat-Weber problem and the Gilbert arborescence problem are used to mathematically determine an optimum location and depth of a <b>vertical</b> <b>hoisting</b> shaft in the Callie underground mine.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hoisting}} load on transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries during lifting in coal mines {{was investigated in}} this study. Firstly, dynamic analyses of the <b>vertical</b> <b>hoisting</b> rope were performed. The results show that transverse vibration plays the dominating role in the coupled dynamics of the vertical rope subjected to external excitation induced by axial fluctuations of head sheave, and the rope tension can be approximated by the quasistatic tension. Secondly, employing dynamic simulations, the effect of hoisting load on the transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries was discussed. The results show that, under the second-order excitation frequency, a discrepant large transverse amplitude will be excited when the hoisting load ranges from 0 to 5000 [*]kg, leading to collision between the two adjacent catenaries and accelerating the rupture of rope. To solve this problem, according to simulation curves, the self-weight of conveyance (preload) can be optimized from 39500 [*]kg to 49500 [*]kg. Eventually, on-site measurements were performed on the studied machine, validating {{the accuracy of the}} effect of hoisting load on transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries. This investigation will greatly support facility maintenance, machine design, and even engineering optimization for floor type multirope friction mine hoists...|$|R

50|$|The North Star vein has an {{east and}} west course, with a dip of about twenty-three degrees to the north. This mine was opened by an incline shaft sunk on {{the course of the}} vein to a depth of nearly 700 ft. The lowest {{perpendicular}} depth attained was approximately 300 ft. It was opened by seven levels. The vein varied in thickness from a few inches to 4 - 5 ft, with an average of about 2 ft. The explorations in the fifth level extended about 700 ft east of the shaft. The total known extent was estimated at 1000 ft. The lower level was driven 550 ft east of the shaft. Above the three lower levels, the ground was virgin to surface, and little was extracted from the two next to the bottom. The ore was raised by tram wagons on the incline, with a wire rope. The vein was enclosed in greenstone. A <b>vertical</b> <b>hoisting</b> and ventilation shaft was sunk 800 ft east of the incline. This shaft was set to cut the mine on the level of the fourth gallery. The shoots of ore in this ground had an easterly pitch. The ore had a gradually increasing tenor of gold.|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Deep level mining {{is widely}} practised {{throughout}} South Africa, {{particularly in the}} gold sector, where the extraordinary depths of <b>vertical</b> <b>hoisting</b> present an array of challenges. The accurate and secure positioning of a conveyance next to a station has been {{and continues to be}} one of the unresolved challenges that have led to many serious injuries and equipment damage. The literature study presented in this dissertation highlights some of the complexities associated with properly docking a conveyance and investigates some current, proposed and similar systems to address the issue. From the study it was found that no satisfactory device existed prompting a systematic design of a conveyance arresting device capable of securing a conveyance in a vertical shaft at any level. Proper definition of the system requirements was obtained and summarised into 16 groups. The system requirements play an important role in the design process by setting the direction but also featuring in concept screening and evaluation. In order to generate concepts a variety of creativity inspiring techniques were employed facilitating a systematic search for a solution. Application of the techniques, Brainstorming, Synectics, TRIZ, 2500 Engineering Principles, Sourcebooks and a Morphological chart resulted in the synthesis of 9 concepts. Screening and evaluation was performed on these concepts and the most suitable concept identified. The proposed concept is a simple system where two sets of beams are extended into the shaft in order to have the conveyance settle onto the supporting shaft steelwork. Once the conveyance came to a rest on the steelwork a second set of beams are extended beneath the steelwork to positively lock the conveyance in position. This required the geometric design of the system to ensure adequate strength to satisfy a factor of safety of ten. Design decisions were made on the section properties of the clamp beam by comparing a solid section and a box section. A supporting frame is used to guide the beams, with consideration given to the most appropriate method of attaching this support frame to the conveyance. The first choice was to have the beams extend from the rear of the conveyance but due to the moments and forces involved the conveyance roof structure could not support this configuration. The support frame was instead affixed directly to the conveyance Transom. In order to support the findings of the conventional calculations performed on the system components the system was subjected to finite element analysis. The results obtained from the simulation corresponded well for the simple components and varied somewhat in the more complex shapes attributed to the assumptions made to ease the conventional calculations. Weight and reliability in a harsh shaft environment was identified as critical design parameters and motivated the use of exotic high strength materials. The high strength of the materials made is possible to design a system with practical dimensions of adequate strength supported by the conventional and modelled calculations. Even though high strength materials were used in the design the overall system weigh is dissatisfying. A potentially successful and practical device was designed but certain factors such as weight, cost, conveyance structure and infrastructure modifications threaten the implementation of the design. This dissertation sets a sound foundation for future development and the continued search for a practical simple solution to this age old challenge. Master...|$|R
