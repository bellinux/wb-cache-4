40|$|Transmissions and {{reflections}} have been measured at nine wave‐lengths between 20. 7 μ and 152 μ {{for a number}} of plastics and special surfaces. The residual rays from crystals were used as sources of approximately monochromatic radiation. The general purpose of the investigation is to find materials for absorbing and transmitting filters {{to be used in the}} far infra‐red region of the spectrum. The spectroscopy of the far infra‐red depends primarily upon the use of absorbing filters and reflecting surfaces to obtain purity of spectra. Relatively few materials are suitable for these purposes and additional materials are greatly needed. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>spectrographs</b> and absorption cells require transparent windows capable of standing pressure. It is difficult to avoid using less than four such windows in any spectroscopic arrangement. If the transmission of the individual windows can be raised from 60 percent to 80 percent the transmission of the four is increased by a factor of more than three. Similarly it is a matter of importance that the absorbing material on the receiving surfaces of the thermopile be efficient in transforming incident radiant energy into heat. The satisfactory solution of these technical requirements in the far infra‐red is a much more difficult one than in the near infra‐red, with the result that extended investigations to discover materials suitable for these various purposes cannot well be avoided.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of several high resolution spectrographs for use in astronomy will be described. After a basic outline of the required theory, the design {{and performance of}} HERCULES will be presented. HERCULES is an R 2 spectrograph fibre-fed from the MJUO 1 -m telescope. The échelle grating has 31. 6 grooves/mm and it uses a BK 7 prism with a 50 ° apex angle in double-pass for cross-dispersion. A folded Schmidt camera is used for imaging. With a detector having an area 50 x 50 mm, and pixels less than 25 µm, HERCULES is capable of resolving powers of 40, 000 to 80, 000 and wavelength coverage from 380 to 880 nm. The total throughput (from the fibre entrance to the CCD) {{is expected to be}} nearly 20 % (in 1 " seeing). Measured efficiencies are only slightly less than this. HERCULES is also shown to be capable of excellent radial velocity precision with no apparent difference between long-term and short-term stability. Several significant upgrade options are also described. As part of the evolution of the design of a high resolution spectrograph for SALT, several instruments were developed for 10 -metre class telescopes. Early designs, based in part on the successful HERCULES design, did not meet the requirements of a number of potential users, due in particular to the limited ability to inter-leave object and sky orders. This resulted in the design of SALT HRS R 2 which uses a mosaic of two 308 x 413 mm R 2 échelle gratings with 87 grooves/mm. Cross-dispersion is achieved with a pair of large 40 ° apex angle BK 7 prisms used in double-pass. The échelle grating accepts a 365 -mm collimated beam. The camera is a catadioptric system having a 1. 2 -m primary mirror and three lenses made of BK 7 each around 850 mm in diameter. Complete unvignetted (except by the CCD obstruction) wavelength coverage from 370 nm to 890 nm is possible on a mosaic of three 2 k by 4 k CCDS with 15 µm pixels. A maximum resolving power of R ≈ 80, 000 is possible. For immunity to atmospheric pressure and temperature changes the entire spectrograph is designed to be housed inside either a helium atmosphere or a light <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>spectrograph</b> chamber is nearly seven metres long. An alternative to the R 2 SALT HRS is also described. This instrument is an R 4 dual beam spectrograph based on a white pupil layout. The design is based on suggestions by B. Delabre and follows closely this authors SOAR HRS instrument. SALT HRS R 4 uses volume-phased holographic gratings for cross-dispersion and a 836 x 204 mm échelle grating with 41. 6 grooves/mm. The grating will be replicated from two smaller gratings onto a single Zerodur blank. The spectrograph is split into blue and red arms by a dichroic located near the white pupil relay intermediate focus. Wavelengths from 370 nm to 890 nm are covered by two fixed format blue and red dedicated dioptric cameras. The detectors will be a single 2 k by 4 k CCD with 15 µm pixels for the blue camera and a 4 k by 4 k CCD with 15 µm pixels for the red. The size of the cameras is reduced significantly by white pupil demagnification from an initial 200 -mm diameter collimated beam incident on the échelle grating to around 100 mm (in undispersed light) on the VPH gratings. The final SALT HRS R 4 instrument is also designed to be immersed in a vacuum vessel which is considerably smaller than that proposed for the R 2 spectrograph. SALT HRS R 4 is currently being developed in detail and will be presented for a critical design review in 2005 April...|$|R

40|$|The high {{resolution}} absorption spectra {{of the important}} group VI dihydrides and deuterides in the vacuum ultraviolet below, and up to, their first ionisation potentials are presented. These spectra were recorded using synchrotron radiation as the background light source {{in conjunction with a}} 3 m normal incidence <b>vacuum</b> <b>spectrograph,</b> equipped with holographic gratings. Due {{to the nature of the}} originating orbital for the majority of optical transitions in the VUV well developed Rydberg series are observed. One particular series can be followed up to fairly high n, so that accurate values of the first ionisation potential are determined. The identifications of the Rydberg series are made from arguments relating to their oscillator strengths, quantum defects, symmetries and from comparisons with the spectra of the corresponding united atoms i. e. the inert gases. Examples of the symmetry assignments for Rydberg series from rotational band contour analyses of the lower Rydberg members for the H sub 2 S, H sub 2 Se and H sub 2 Te molecules are presented. Effects due to I-uncoupling and predissociation greatly reduce the accuracy of the rotational analyses, and discussions of these phenomena are given. Also reported are new low resolution spectra for the H sub 2 O, D sub 2 O, H sub 2 S, H sub 2 Se and D sub 2 Se molecules. These spectra are useful for observing weak and diffuse features which were not easily recorded under {{high resolution}} - especially absorption above the series limit...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution {{absorption}} spectra of 16 O 18 O have been photographed, at 300 and 78 K, {{throughout the region}} 175 - 205 nm, in {{the first order of}} a 2400 lines/mm grating in a 6. 65 -m <b>vacuum</b> <b>spectrograph</b> at a dispersion of 0. 06 nm/mm. Precise wavelength measurements and rotational analyses of the Schumann-Runge bands (2, 0) - 16, 0) have been completed. Spectroscopic constants of the B 3 Σ u - state of 16 O 18 O for 2 ≤ v ≤ 16 have been determined. Rotational perturbations are observed in the (16, 0) band. The concept of mass-reduced vibrational quantum numbers, μ - 1 2 (v + 1 2), has been used to combined isotopic molecular constants from 16 O 2, 16 O 18 O, and 18 O 2. It has been shown that the functions of the vibrational spacings, μ 1 2 ΔG v+ 1 2, rotational constants μB v, and μ 2 D v, spin-spin constants, λ v, and spin-rotation constants, μγ v, are isotopically invariant functions of μ - 1 2 (v + 1 2). The isotopic dependence of the spin-spin constants λ v is discussed in terms of the unique perturber approximation. Values of γ v and λ v have been obtained by interpolation for the levels v = 2 - 8, which correspond to bands of 16 O 18 O with unresolved triplet structure. In a theoretical investigation, the calculations of level shifts and perturbations have been reexamined. Excellent agreement between calculated and experimental level shifts has been obtained for all three isotopic molecules. © 1989. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|With the {{advancement}} of descriptive cytology brought about by electron microscopy, there has arisen a need for cytochemical methods at high resolution. The method of x-ray scanning microanalysis has already found numerous applications {{in the field of}} metallography (1 - 3), and may also be extended to the study of biological specimens. Recently, Yasuzumi et al. (4) have succeeded in showing an Fe K, ~ spectrum in human erythrocytes, and Boyde et al. (5) in taking images formed by Ca K ~ and Fe K ~ radiations in dental tissue. The method is based upon the principle of x-ray emission spectrography. A very finely focused beam of electrons is projected onto the surface of a specimen, at the point where it is desired to examine its chemical composition. The minute volume of the specimen which is thus irradiated emits a complex x-ray spectrum consisting principally of the characteristic radiations of the elements present in the volume. Measurement of the wavelength and intensity of each component of this spectrum thus affords a simple method of determining the chemical identity and concentration of these elements. The apparatus itself consists of three main parts: an electron optical system, an x-ray spectrograph, and an optical microscope. The specimen is prepared in the usual way as for optical microscopy. The x-radiation, emitted at the focal spot where the electrons strike the specimen, is analyzed with a curved crystal, Geiger-Mtiller counter, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>spectrograph.</b> The equipment described here, called hereafter a microanalyzer, enables one to determine all the elements of atomic number greater than 12. In the previous (6) and present studies, organic iron elements have been demonstrated in testicular nutritive cells of the pond snail Cipangopaludina malleata Reeve. The present study has been made in order to determine whether this apparatus can also be usefully applied to the elemental iron localized in the cytoplasm...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The 4 s³P₁ {{state of}} argon decays radiatively by a {{resonance}} {{transition to the}} 3 p⁶¹S₀ ground state; the wavelength of this radiation is 1067 A. By direct observation of the decay of the 1067 A radiation from excited argon gas, a value of 0. 93 ± 0. 06 x 10 ⁻⁵ seconds has been obtained for the natural lifetime of the 4 s³P₁ state. The failure of this state to appear as a metastable state points up the inadequacy of {{a description of the}} argon atom by Russel-Saunders coupling. The calculated value (25) of 1. 05 x 10 ⁻⁵ seconds for the natural lifetime of the 4 s³P₁ state requires a larger degree of mixing of the strict Russel-Saunders terms than does the value measured in this experiment. The measurement was made using a modified delayed coincidence method (3). Bombardment of argon gas with a pulsed beam of controlled energy electrons was used to produce cyclic excitation and relaxation of the gas. The cyclic regeneration of the argon decay allowed the entire decay curve to be determined by examining it piecemeal. A small portion of the decay curve is repetetively examined by gating a detector such that it is active only during a small fraction of each cycle. During each cycle the location in time of this sampling interval is set by triggering the gating signal with a delayed pulse which is produced at the termination of the excitation. Different portions of the decay curve are examined by adjusting the delay of the trigger pulse. Because the detector output is a constant which varies only when the location of the sampling interval is shifted along the decay curve, this method avoids the problem of attempting to record a single transient. The atomic excitation is produced within a nine liter cylindrical volume. A slow molecular type flow of argon is maintained through this excitation chamber. The pressure is essentially uniform within this chamber and is varied over the range of 10 ⁻³ to 10 ⁻¹ Torr. The electron gun, located {{at the center of the}} excitation chamber, consists of the cathode and grid structure of a 6 SJ 7 electron tube. The spread in energy of electrons from this gun was small enough to allow selective excitation of the 4 s multiplet of argon, but selective excitation of levels within this multiplet could not be achieved. Radiation from the excitation chamber was detected with a Bendix magnetic photomultiplier (20) which was separated from the excitation chamber by a thinly cleaved lithium fluoride window. This photomultiplier is sensitive only to radiation in the wavelength region between 2 A and 1500 A. Final identification of the observed radiation as that from the 4 s³P₁- 3 p₆¹S₀ transition was made using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>spectrograph.</b> Since the intensity of radiation from the excitation chamber is directly proportional to the concentration of argon atoms in the 4 s³P₁ state, it is the decay of these atoms that is determined. This decay will be governed by the radiative decay constant only if collisional transfer of excitation and trapping of resonance radiation can be neglected. Throughout the range of pressure used in this experiment the rate constants associated with both these processes are known to be pressure dependent (21, 22) and the effect of resonance trapping can be observed separately by its dependence upon the enclosure geometry. It is to be expected that the predominant collision process will be the two body collisions which result in the exchange of excitation between the 4 s³P₁ level and the adjacent metastable levels. The experimental data consistently yield decay curves which represent the sum of two exponential decays having different decay constants. The larger of these decay constants is independent of gas pressure and the smaller one is approximately directly proportional to pressure. Neither is dependent upon enclosure geometry. Therefore, it is concluded that the effects of resonance trapping are negligible, and that the de-excitation of argon atoms in the 4 s³P₁ state is governed predominantly by radiative decay and by two body collisions which result in the transfer of excitation to or from this state. The cross sections for collisional transfer is approximately 4 x 10 ⁻¹⁵cm² at room temperature. The fact that resonance radiation from the 4 s¹P₁ state of argon was not observed indicates that this radiation is heavily trapped and that collisional transfer is primarily responsible for the decay of this state. It thus appears that there is a large difference in the natural lifetimes of the two radiative 4 s levels. This implication is in disagreement with the experimental results obtained by Vaughan & Stacy (35) ...|$|E
