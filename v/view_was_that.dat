5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the {{prevailing}} <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of Benzer using mutants defective in the rII region of bacteriophage T4 (1955-1959) showed that individual genes {{have a simple}} linear structure {{and are likely to}} be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain Cézanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{alternative}} {{theories of the}} cognitive processes <b>that</b> human reasoning <b>is</b> based on.

Another <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people rely on domain-specific or content-sensitive rules of inference.

5000|$|The {{problem of}} essentialist versus {{relational}} {{view of human}} nature: One <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> an essential core to human nature, a view related to the doctrine of intelligible essences; and the other <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> human nature <b>is</b> relational and can change with historical context.|$|R
5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of {{the progressive}} rock genre that relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the progressive rock style had ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} of his posting, Clarke {{had to deal with}} issues {{regarding}} land and labour. The latter was of major significance at this time in Southern Rhodesia. In response to questioning by the African Association and the Manchester Society for the Protection of Native Races, Chamberlain in 1898 responded that forced labour was not permitted. A year later, Chamberlain was concerned by a chief native commissioner instructing chiefs at an indaba that it was their duty to supply labour. Clarke's subsequent report accused officials of the administration of requisitioning labour by 'pressure only short of force', causing 'discontent amongst the natives'. Clarke's <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a mutually beneficial relationship between capital and labour was possible through market forces alone, without additional pressure. Chamberlain agreed, although Milner was in favour of compulsory labour even to the extent of 'recommending the corvée'.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the {{new film}} studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, Toho), advertised for {{assistant}} directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films {{and find ways to}} overcome them. His half-mocking <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if the deficiencies were fundamental, {{there was no way to}} correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director Kajirō Yamamoto, who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} Fra Dolcino and {{his real name}} are a subject of {{constant}} debate among historians. One <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he belonged to the wealthy Tornielli family of Novara, while another <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> the illegitimate son of a priest who fled from Vercelli to escape punishment for some small burglaries.|$|R
5|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also threatened the long-term prospects for the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor's heir was his eldest daughter, Isabel, who had no interest in, nor expectation of, becoming the monarch. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still a very traditional, male-dominated society, and the prevailing <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> only a male monarch would be capable as head of state. PedroII, the ruling circles and the wider political establishment all considered a female successor to be inappropriate, and PedroII himself believed that {{the death of his}} two sons and the lack of a male heir were a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the Brazilian {{abolitionist}} leader Joaquim Nabuco {{said that}} Rio Branco was—of all the politicians who held the office during PedroII's reign—the most fitted to the post of President of the Council of Ministers. Nabuco considered him one of the greatest statesmen of the Empire. However, he also argued that as a leader, a lawmaker, and a creator of doctrines, there were many other politicians far better than Rio Branco. But unlike all the others, who were brilliantly accomplished in one or a few skills, but lacking in many others, Rio Branco was good—though unexceptional—in all. In other words, he was a competent generalist. Nabuco's <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> due to Rio Branco's lack of first-rate abilities, he would not have been the best leader in troubled times—such as the anarchy which existed during PedroII's minority, or {{at the end of}} a period of chaos when strong action was needed to rebuild. Rio Branco was, however, the perfect choice in a time of peace and stability where his multiple skills could shine. His ability exactly fit the situation in Brazil when he became President of the Council of Ministers in 1871.|$|E

25|$|The old <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{extinguishment}} {{of aboriginal}} title extinguished all tribal {{rights to the}} same land. The current view is that usufructory rights pursuant to a treaty may survive the extinguishment of aboriginal title. However, such usufructs may be lost when tribes cede land to the federal government. Certain usufructs may be extinguished by implication.|$|E
25|$|Following the Keynesian {{consensus}} (that {{lasted until}} the 1970s) the traditional <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> federal deficit spending {{associated with the}} war brought full-employment output while monetary policy was just aiding the process.

25|$|Arnold Murray (1929–2014), {{founder of}} The Shepherd's Chapel, taught the serpent seed doctrine.

25|$|State run {{enterprises}} in socialist countries {{had little or}} no interest in producing what customers wanted which resulted in shortages of goods and services.

25|$|The loss of both Loch Vennachar and Loch Sloy {{convinced}} the Marine Board of South Australia {{to argue for}} the bringing forward of a plan that it recommended in 1902 to build a lighthouse at Cape du Couedic.

25|$|In {{the older}} literature, the {{prevailing}} <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Plato's lecture {{took place at}} the end of Plato's life.

Whether or not Plato's early dialogues allude to the unwritten dialogues is contested.|$|E
25|$|In {{the science}} of the day, the {{prevailing}} <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> everything of value could be studied in a laboratory.

Going against this prevailing view, Ritter believed that it was more important to study living things in their natural environment.|$|E
