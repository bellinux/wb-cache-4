5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould,</b> through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.|$|E
500|$|His evolution-related {{experiments}} and investigations led to books on Orchids, Insectivorous Plants, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom, {{different forms of}} flowers on plants of the same species, and The Power of Movement in Plants. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including Grant Allen and H. G. Wells, and [...] in the late C19 and early C20. In his last book he returned to The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.|$|E

It is intended primarily {{for the use of}} plant pathologists and authorities involved in plant protection and quarantine issues. It is based on published papers and unpublished reports of several authors and on our original data. The latter were based on inspections in the field and at the Maltese fruit and vegetable market, on surveys requested by EC and on samples brought by farmers at the Għammieri, Marsa, laboratories of the Ministry for Rural Affairs and the Environment (MRAE). They include records or more than 30 species new for Malta and several new host and new location records. Major diseases observed during 2004 - 2006 include Verticillium wilt of olive, late blight of potato and tomato, powdery mildew on several hosts, crown and root rot (Forl) of tomato, Sclerotinia stem rot of <b>vegetables,</b> grey <b>mould</b> of several crops, leaf mould of tomato. Most of the pathogenic species reported {{at the beginning of the}} last century are still present. Several species, including Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea, Colletotrichum acutatum, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, probably have been introduced recently. Intensified plant trade, due to world trends and the accession of Malta into the EU, increases this risk and requires consolidating the national quarantine service and extending monitoring of the territory. The incidence and severity of some diseases could be traced back to inappropriate cultural practices or unsuitable seed or plant material.

2500|$|Sambourne's {{caricature}} {{deals in}} a playful manner with the topics [...] "evolution" [...] and [...] "descent of man." [...] The title alludes to {{a publication of}} Darwin entitled The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, with Observations of their Habits which was issued in October 1881. In the caricature, evolution is associated with metamorphosis and portrayed as a gradual process which inevitably leads to advancement. This, however, conveys a reduced if not false picture of Darwin's theory in which competition, hereditary transmission, coincidence and selection play a major role. Besides, these circular images of evolutionary progression form a striking contrast to Darwin’s own linear and branching evolutionary trees. In The Origin of Species Darwin [...] "took pains to emphasize that evolution was neither progressive nor circular." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{set out on}} a riding excursion, for {{the purpose}} of geologising the basal parts of the Andes, which alone {{at this time of the}} year are not shut up by the winter snow. Our first day's ride was northward along the sea-coast. After dark we reached the Hacienda of Quintero, the estate which {{formerly}} belonged to Lord Cochrane. My object in coming here was to see the great beds of shells which stand some yards above the level of the sea, and are burnt for lime. The proofs of the elevation of this whole line of coast are unequivocal: at the height of a few hundred feet old-looking shells are numerous, and I found some at 1300 feet. These shells either lie loose on the surface, or are embedded in a reddish-black <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould.</b> I was much surprised to find under the microscope that this <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> is really marine mud, full of minute particles of organic bodies.|$|E
60|$|The civilized nations--Greece, Rome, England--have been {{sustained}} by the primitive forests which anciently rotted where they stand. They survive {{as long as the}} soil is not exhausted. Alas for human culture! little is to be expected of a nation, when the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> is exhausted, and it is compelled to make manure of the bones of its fathers. There the poet sustains himself merely by his own superfluous fat, and the philosopher comes down on his marrow-bones.|$|E
60|$|Crossing the Little Rungeet river, we camped on {{the base}} of Tonglo. The night was calm and clear, with faint cirrus, but no dew. A {{thermometer}} sunk two feet in rich <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> stood at 78 degrees two hours after it was lowered, and the same on the following morning. This probably indicates the mean temperature of the month at that spot, where, however, the dark colour of the exposed loose soil must raise the temperature considerably.|$|E
6000|$|The {{amount of}} fine earth {{brought to the}} surface under the form of castings, and {{afterwards}} transported by the winds accompanied by rain, or that which flows and rolls down an inclined surface, no doubt is small {{in the course of}} a few scores of years; for otherwise all the inequalities in our pasture fields would be smoothed within a much shorter period than appears to be the case. [...] But the amount which is thus transported in the course of thousands of years cannot fail to be considerable and deserves attention. E. de Beaumont looks at the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> which everywhere covers the land as a fixed line, from which the amount of denudation may be measured. {79} He ignores the continued formation of fresh mould by the disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of rock; and it is curious to find how much more philosophical were the views maintained long ago, by Playfair, who, in 1802, wrote, [...] "In the permanence of a coat of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> on the surface of the earth, we have a demonstrative proof of the continued destruction of the rocks."

60|$|I {{have now}} (May 1, 1881) {{sent to the}} {{printers}} the MS. of a little book on 'The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould,</b> through the Action of Worms.' This is a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it will interest any readers (Between November 1881 and February 1884, 8500 copies have been sold.), but it has interested me.

6000|$|In {{the year}} 1869, Mr. Fish {5} {{rejected}} my conclusions {{with respect to}} the part which worms have played in the formation of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> merely on account of their assumed incapacity to do so much work. He remarks that [...] "considering their weakness and their size, the work they are represented to have accomplished is stupendous." [...] Here we have an instance of that inability to sum up the effects of a continually recurrent cause, which has often retarded the progress of science, as formerly in the case of geology, and more recently in that of the principle of evolution.|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. The long drought {{which took}} place in the autumn of the year 1854, sealing every source of waters except these {{perpetual}} ones, left the torrent of which I am speaking, and such others, in a state peculiarly favorable to observance of their least action on the mountains from which they descend. They were entirely limited to their own ice fountains, and the quantity of powdered rock which they brought down was, of course, at its minimum, being nearly unmingled with any earth derived from the dissolution of softer soil, or <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> by rains.|$|E
60|$|In {{the summers}} {{there is one}} visitor, however, to that valley, of which the Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like, and yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground, with long grasses growing through it and <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> {{overrunning}} it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses for a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.|$|E
60|$|It was in 1881 that Darwin {{published}} his last volume, 'The Formation of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.' In this singularly fascinating and interesting monograph {{he took in}} hand one of the lowliest and humblest of living forms, the common earthworm, and by an exhaustive study of its habits and manners strove {{to show how the}} entire existence of vegetable mould--the ordinary covering of fertile soil upon the face of the earth--is due to the long but unobtrusive action of these little-noticed and ever-active architects. By the acids which they evolve, they appear to aid largely in the disintegration of the stone beneath the surface; by their constant practice of eating fallen leaves, which they drag down with them into their subterranean burrows, they produce the fine castings of soft earth, so familiar to everybody, and thus reinstate the coating of humus above the bare rock as often as it is washed away again in the course of ordinary denudation by the rain and the torrents. It is true that subsequent investigation has shown the possibility of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> existing under certain conditions without the intervention of worms to any marked extent; but, as a whole, {{there can be little doubt}} that over most parts of the world the presence of soil, and therefore of the vegetable growth rooted in it, is entirely due to the unsuspected yet ceaseless activity of these humble creatures.|$|E
60|$|He reposed {{himself for}} some time on {{the trunk of a}} fallen hemlock, {{listening}} to the boding cry of the tree-toad, and delving with his walking-staff into a mound of black mould at his feet. As he turned up the soil unconsciously, his staff struck against something hard. He raked it out of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> and lo! a cloven skull with an Indian tomahawk buried deep in it, lay before him. The rust on the weapon showed the time that had elapsed since this death blow had been given. It was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had taken place in this last foothold of the Indian warriors.|$|E
60|$|If earth were {{swallowed}} {{only when}} worms deepened their burrows or made new ones, castings would be thrown up only occasionally; {{but in many}} places fresh castings may be seen every morning, {{and the amount of}} earth ejected from the same burrow on successive days is large. Yet worms do not burrow to a great depth, except when the weather is very dry or intensely cold. On my lawn the black <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> or humus is only about 5 inches in thickness, and overlies light-coloured or reddish clayey soil: now when castings are thrown up in the greatest profusion, only a small proportion are light coloured, and it is incredible that the worms should daily make fresh burrows in every direction in the thin superficial layer of dark-coloured mould, unless they obtained nutriment of some kind from it. I have observed a strictly analogous case in a field near my house where bright red clay lay close beneath the surface. Again on one part of the Downs near Winchester the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> overlying the chalk was found to be only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness; and the many castings here ejected were as black as ink and did not effervesce with acids; so that the worms must have confined themselves to this thin superficial layer of mould, of which large quantities were daily swallowed. In another place at no great distance the castings were white; and why the worms should have burrowed into the chalk in some places and not in others, I am unable to conjecture.|$|E
60|$|Here {{and thus}} Anne {{remained}} concealed. The crunch of the steward's spade, as it {{cut into the}} soft <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> was plainly perceptible to her ears when the periodic cessations between the creaks of the engine concurred with a lull in the breeze, which otherwise brought the subdued roar of the cascade from the further side of the bank that screened it. A large hole--some four or five feet deep--had been excavated by Manston in about twenty minutes. Into this he immediately placed the sack, and then began filling in the earth, and treading it down. Lastly he carefully raked the whole mass of dead and dry leaves {{into the middle of}} the pit, burying the ground with them as they had buried it before.|$|E
60|$|At Stonehenge, some of {{the outer}} Druidical stones are now prostrate, having fallen at a remote but unknown period; and these have become buried to a {{moderate}} depth in the ground. They are surrounded by sloping borders of turf, on which recent castings were seen. Close {{to one of these}} fallen stones, which was 17 ft long, 6 ft. broad, and 28.5 inches thick, a hole was dug; and here the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> was at least 9.5 inches in thickness. At this depth a flint was found, and a little higher up {{on one side of the}} hole a fragment of glass. The base of the stone lay about 9.5 inches beneath the level of the surrounding ground, and its upper surface 19 inches above the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{character}} of the soil is favourable to agriculture. It is composed of a black <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> of a foot to two feet in depth, overlaying a hard yellow clay. The surface earth is very fine, pulverised, and sandy, quite black, and, no doubt, of good quality; when sharpened with sheep-feeding it produces heavy crops. The fallen trees, which are very numerous, shew that the substratum of clay is too hard to produce anything. The roots of the pine never penetrate it. In some places the spontaneous vegetation testifies to {{the richness of the}} soil--such as wild pease or vetches, and wild clover, which I--have seen reach up to my horse's belly--and a most luxuriant growth of underwood, brambles, fern, etcetera.|$|E
60|$|If {{it could}} be shown that worms {{generally}} excavate their burrows {{at right angles to}} an inclined surface, and this would be their shortest course for bringing up earth from beneath, then as the old burrows collapsed from the weight of the superincumbent soil, the collapsing would inevitably cause the whole bed of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> to sink or slide slowly down the inclined surface. But to ascertain the direction of many burrows was found too difficult and troublesome. A straight piece of wire was, however, pushed into twenty-five burrows on several sloping fields, and in eight cases the burrows were nearly at right angles to the slope; whilst in the remaining cases they were indifferently directed at various angles, either upwards or downwards with respect to the slope.|$|E
60|$|We {{will now}} give some {{cases of the}} action of worms, on land differing widely from the dry sandy or the swampy {{pastures}} just described. The chalk formation extends all round my house in Kent; and its surface, from having been exposed during an immense period to the dissolving action of rain-water, is extremely irregular, being abruptly festooned and penetrated by many deep well-like cavities. {43} During {{the dissolution of the}} chalk, the insoluble matter, including a vast number of unrolled flints of all sizes, has been left on the surface and forms a bed of stiff red clay, full of flints, and generally from 6 to 14 feet in thickness. Over the red clay, wherever the land has long remained as pasture, there is a layer a few inches in thickness, of dark-coloured <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould.</b>|$|E
60|$|A {{piece of}} waste, swampy land was enclosed, drained, ploughed, harrowed and thickly {{covered in the}} year 1822 with burnt marl and cinders. It was sowed with grass seeds, and now {{supports}} a tolerably good but coarse pasture. Holes were dug in this field in 1837, or 15 years after its reclamation, and {{we see in the}} accompanying diagram (Fig. 5), reduced to half of the natural scale, that the turf was 1 inch thick, beneath which there was a layer of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> 2.5 inches thick. This layer did not contain fragments of any kind; but beneath it there was a layer of mould, 1.5 inch in thickness, full of fragments of burnt marl, conspicuous from their red colour, one of which near the bottom was an inch in length; and other fragments of coal-cinders together with a few white quartz pebbles. Beneath this layer and at a depth of 4.5 inches from the surface, the original black, peaty, sandy soil with a few quartz pebbles was encountered. Here therefore the fragments of burnt marl and cinders had been covered in the course of 15 years by a layer of fine <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> only 2.5 inches in thickness, excluding the turf. Six and a half years subsequently this field was re-examined, and the fragments were now found at from 4 to 5 inches beneath the surface. So that in this interval of 6.5 years, about 1.5 inch of mould had been added to the superficial layer. I am surprised that a greater quantity had not been brought up during the whole 21.5 years, for in the closely underlying black, peaty soil there were many worms. It is, however, probable that formerly, whilst the land remained poor, worms were scanty; and the mould would then have accumulated slowly. The average annual increase of thickness for the whole period is 0.19 of an inch.|$|E
60|$|A {{hole was}} also dug {{close to a}} second huge stone, which in falling had broken into two pieces; and this must have {{happened}} long ago, judging from the weathered aspect of the fractured ends. The base was buried {{to a depth of}} 10 inches, as was ascertained by driving an iron skewer horizontally into the ground beneath it. The <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> forming the turf-covered sloping border round the stone, on which many castings had recently been ejected, was 10 inches in thickness; and most of this mould must have been brought up by worms from beneath its base. At a distance of 8 yards from the stone, the mould was only 5.5 inches in thickness (with a piece of tobacco pipe at a depth of 4 inches), and this rested on broken flint and chalk which could not have easily yielded to the pressure or weight of the stone.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the year}} 1837, a short paper was read by me before the Geological Society of London, {2} [...] "On the Formation of Mould," [...] {{in which it}} was shown that small {{fragments}} of burnt marl, cinders, &c., which had been thickly strewed over the surface of several meadows, were found after a few years lying at the depth of some inches beneath the turf, but still forming a layer. This apparent sinking of superficial bodies is due, as was first suggested to me by Mr. Wedgwood of Maer Hall in Staffordshire, to the large quantity of fine earth continually brought up to the surface by worms in the form of castings. These castings are sooner or later spread out and cover up any object left on the surface. I was thus led to conclude that all the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> over the whole country has passed many times through, and will again pass many times through, the intestinal canals of worms. Hence the term [...] "animal mould" [...] would be in some respects more appropriate than that commonly used of [...] "vegetable mould." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the several}} {{foregoing}} cases, it {{can hardly be}} doubted that worms swallow earth, {{not only for the}} sake of making their burrows, but for obtaining food. Hensen, however, concludes from his analyses of mould that worms probably could not live on ordinary <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> though he admits that they might be nourished to some extent by leaf-mould. {39} But we have seen that worms eagerly devour raw meat, fat, and dead worms; and ordinary mould can hardly fail to contain many ova, larvae, and small living or dead creatures, spores of cryptogamic plants, and micrococci, such as those which give rise to saltpetre. These various organisms, together with some cellulose from any leaves and roots not utterly decayed, might well account for such large quantities of mould being swallowed by worms. It may be worth while here to recall the fact that certain species of Utricularia, which grow in damp places in the tropics, possess bladders beautifully constructed for catching minute subterranean animals; and these traps would not have been developed unless many small animals inhabited such soil.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe not {{the supernatural}} parts of it, of course," [...] replied Tregarthen; [...] "but there is {{something}} {{in the fact that the}} land of Cornwall has unquestionably given up part of its soil to the sea. You are aware, I suppose, that St. Michael's Mount, the most beautiful and prominent object in Mounts Bay, has been described as `a hoare rock in a wood,' about six miles from the sea, although it now stands in the bay; and this idea of a sunken land is borne out by the unquestionable fact that if we dig down a few feet into the sand of the shore near Penzance, we shall come on a black <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> full of woodland detritus, such as branches, leaves of coppice wood, and nuts, together with carbonised roots and trunks of forest trees of larger growth; and these have been found as far out as the lowest tide would permit men to dig! In addition to this, portions of land have been overwhelmed by the sea near Penzance, in the memory of men now alive." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mountains}} have {{an unusual}} quantity {{of earth and}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> spread over them. Even on the steepest slopes there is everywhere a covering of clays and sands, and generally a good thickness of vegetable soil. It is this which perhaps contributes to the uniform luxuriance of the forest, and delays the appearance of that sub-alpine vegetation which depends almost as much on the abundance of rocky and exposed surfaces as on difference of climate. At a much lower elevation on Mount Ophir in Malacca, Dacrydiums and Rhododendrons with abundance of Nepenthes, ferns, and terrestrial orchids suddenly took {{the place of the}} lofty forest; but this was plainly due to the occurrence of an extensive slope of bare, granitic rock at an elevation of less than 3,000 feet. The quantity of vegetable soil, and also of loose sands and clays, resting on steep slopes, hill-tops and the sides of ravines, is a curious and important phenomenon. It may be due in part to constant, slight earthquake shocks facilitating the disintegration of rock; but, would also seem to indicate that the country has been long exposed to gentle atmospheric action, and that its elevation has been exceedingly slow and continuous.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{the answer}} is that without {{vegetation}} {{there is no such thing}} as soil on earth anywhere. The top layer of the land in all ordinary and well-behaved countries is composed entirely of <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> the decaying remains of innumerable generations of weeds and grasses. Earth to earth is the rule of nature. Soil, in fact, consists entirely of dead leaves. And where there are no leaves to die and decay, there can be no mould or soil to speak of. Darwin showed, indeed, in his last great book, that we owe the whole earthy covering of our hills and plains almost entirely to the perennial exertions of that friend of the farmers, the harmless, necessary earthworm. Year after year the silent worker is busy every night pulling down leaves through his tunnelled burrow into his underground nest, and there converting them by means of his castings into the black mould which produces, in the end, for lordly man, all his cultivable fields and pasture-lands and meadows. Where there are no leaves and no earth-worms, therefore, there can be no soil; and under those circumstances we get what we familiarly know as a desert.|$|E
