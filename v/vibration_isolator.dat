5000|$|This {{is defined}} as a device that {{reflects}} and absorbs waves of oscillatory energy, extending from a piece of working machinery or electrical equipment, and with the desired effect being vibration insulation. The goal is to establish vibration isolation between a body transferring mechanical fluctuations and a supporting body (for example, between the machine and the foundation). The illustration shows a <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> from the series «ВИ» (~"VI" [...] in Roman characters), as used in shipbuilding in Russia, for example the submarine [...] "St.Petersburg" [...] (Lada). The depicted «ВИ» devices allow loadings ranging from 5, 40 and 300 kg. They differ in their physical sizes, but all share the same fundamental design. The structure consists of a rubber envelope that is internally reinforced by a spring. During manufacture, the rubber and the spring are intimately and permanently connected {{as a result of the}} vulcanization process that is integral to the processing of the crude rubber material. Under action of weight loading of the machine, the rubber envelope deforms, and the spring is compressed or stretched. Therefore, in the direction of the spring's cross section, twisting of the enveloping rubber occurs. The resulting elastic deformation of the rubber envelope results in very effective absorption of the vibration. This absorption is crucial to reliable vibration insulation, because it averts the potential for resonance effects. The amount of elastic deformation of the rubber largely dictates the magnitude of vibration absorption that can be attained; the entire device (including the spring itself) must be designed with this in mind. The design of the <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> must also take into account potential exposure to shock loadings, in addition to the routine everyday vibrations. Lastly, the <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> must also be designed for long-term durability as well as convenient integration into the environment in which it is to be used. Sleeves and flanges are typically employed in order to enable the <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> to be securely fastened to the equipment and the supporting foundation.|$|E
50|$|The {{equipment}} or other mechanical components are necessarily linked to surrounding objects (the supporting joint - with the support; the unsupporting joint - the pipe duct or cable), thus presenting {{the opportunity for}} unwanted transmission of vibrations. Using a suitably designed vibration-isolator (absorber), vibration isolation of the supporting joint is realized. The accompanying illustration shows the attenuation of vibration levels, as measured before installation of the functioning gear on a <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> as well as after installation, {{for a wide range}} of frequencies.|$|E

50|$|A bushing or {{rubber bushing}} {{is a type}} of <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator.</b> It {{provides}} an interface between two parts, damping the energy transmitted through the bushing. A common application is in vehicle suspension systems, where a bushing made of rubber (or, more often, synthetic rubber or polyurethane) separates the faces of two metal objects while allowing a certain amount of movement. This movement allows the suspension parts to move freely, for example, when traveling over a large bump, while minimizing transmission of noise and small vibrations through to the chassis of the vehicle. A rubber bushing may also be described as a flexible mounting or antivibration mounting.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} devoted to {{description}} of the method for decreasing of the vibration load level on the tractor operator working place using vibrations dynamic dampers in the cabin suspension. Standard cabin <b>vibration</b> <b>isolators</b> of tractors of DT and VT series include the monolith rubber block and have limited capabilities to change its elastic parameters and adapt {{in the course of}} the impact of vertical and lateral vibration loads with various frequencies. Elastic-damping properties of these <b>vibration</b> <b>isolators</b> doesn’t allow one to provide comfortable conditions for the operator's work because their abilities of vibration damping aren’t sufficient especially at low-frequency vibrations. Dynamic vibration dampers installed in the cabin suspension were proposed by authors for decreasing of the vibration load level on the operator's workplace. 3 D- model of the caterpillar chassis, suspension, engine, cabin and operator's seat of the tractor was created in the software “Universal mechanism” for performing of the computational research. This model was used to conduct research of sprung mass vibration for tractor motion with and without hook load at 3 rd and 7 th gears on the smooth surface and on testing areas with single, periodic and random bumps.

The prototype <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> system {{has the ability to}} adjust the damping and natural frequency characteristics of the system. It consists of an air spring, a variable orifice valve, and an accumulator. In this conguration, the spring characteristics are provided by the air spring and accumulator, while the variable orifice valve provides the damping characteristics. The valve is computer regulated according to the innovative control laws that were developed for the pneumatic system. The <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> system is designed to work in the vibration environment that is typically observed in the case of Class 7 and 8 vehicles as dened by the U.

In order to design a <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> system for the intended application, a benchmarking study was conducted to gain additional insight on OEM <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> systems features and limitations. Based on the insights obtained from this study, the design requirements for the system were dened. This paper presents a methodology of producing a plant model that is based on supplier 2 ̆ 7 s engineering specications and experimental characterization. The plant model includes a complete characterization of nonlinear pressure to volume and eective area to ride height relationships. A detailed design process of selecting and implementing components to optimize system performance is also provided. The plant model was then used to design three semiactive controllers that use position and pressure feedback signals that exploit the nonlinear characterizations to measure direct force generation. The semi-active controllers that were designed for this novel pneumatic <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> system include: a LQI (Linear Quadratic Impulse) optimal controller, Modied Skyhook controller, and a Relative Displacement controller.

40|$|Piecewise linear <b>vibration</b> <b>isolators</b> are {{designed}} to optimally balance the competing goals of motion control and isolation. The piecewise linear system represents a hard nonlinearity, which cannot be assumed small, and hence standard perturbation methods are unable to provide a complete analytical solution.

In this investigation an averaging method was adopted to explore the frequency response of a symmetric piecewise linear isolator at resonance. The result obtained by an averaging method is in agreement with numerical simulation and experimental measurements. Preliminary sensitivity analysis is conducted to find the effect of system parameters.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of shaking table tests {{performed}} to assess the response of an object placed on a <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> to intense ground motions whose peak accelerations are close to or over the gravity acceleration in both vertical and horizontal directions. The passive vertical and horizontal <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator,</b> developed by the authors, has rolling load-bearing elements and constant-force springs to provide piecewise-constant restoring forces. First, we performed shaking table tests, wherein only the horizontal vibration was isolated. An unexpected finding from the tests is that, when the <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> was subjected to ground motions with intense vertical accelerations, not only vertical but also horizontal accelerations were amplified. This led to a large rocking response or overturning of the object placed on the <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator.</b> A likely reason for the amplification is rocking of the upper portion of the <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> above the rolling load-bearing elements induced by intense vertical accelerations. Next, we performed shaking table tests, wherein both vertical and horizontal vibrations were isolated. In this case, the vertical as well as horizontal accelerations were significantly reduced and the rocking response of the vibration-isolated object was suppressed. These results suggest potential risks in conventional horizontal vibration isolators having rolling load-bearing elements when they are subjected to ground motions with intense vertical accelerations. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of vertical vibration isolation to avoid such risks...|$|E

40|$|The primary loading on wind {{turbines}} {{is in the}} lateral direction and is of a stochastic nature, due to wind and seismic forces. As turbines grow larger, they experience proportionally larger lateral forces. Large forces require larger section sizes and overall weight of the turbine. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the use of vibration isolation as a structural control measure to minimize the overall wind and seismic forces transmitted to the turbine. Passive control systems such as tuned mass dampers have previously been proposed to mitigate response to wind loading but have not generally been evaluated under seismic loading. This thesis discusses the potential use of a non-linear <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> just below the wind turbine nacelle to decrease the structural response of the turbine under wind and seismic loading.

40|$|Floor {{vibrations}} and {{acoustic excitation}} may limit {{the performance of}} precision equipment, that is used for example to produce computer chips or to make images of very tiny structures. Therefore, {{it is common to}} mount a <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> in the suspension of such equipment to isolate it from these vibration sources. Most often, a <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> with a low suspension stiffness is used to limit the transmission of floor vibrations onto the suspended equipment. However, a low suspension stiffness introduces problems with leveling of the equipment and it increases its susceptibility to acoustic excitation. The objective of this thesis is to develop an alternative solution based on an active hard mount <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator,</b> which provides a much stiffer suspension such that the problems mentioned before can be circumvented. An active control system, that consists of sensors, actuators and a controller, is used to keep a low transmission of floor vibrations. An additional advantage is that the damping of internal modes of the equipment can be increased, such that its accuracy is improved. Several feedback control strategies for the active hard mount <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> are presented. In both models and experiments it is shown that the best control strategy is using a combination of acceleration and force sensors. Formulas for adjusting the control parameters to obtain the desired vibration isolation performance have been derived. Furthermore, a demonstration setup of a six-axes active hard mount <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> is developed. Unfortunately, due to some hardware problems, the usable control bandwidth is limited and the noise level of the sensors is too high, which results in a vibration isolation performance that is less than desired. Despite these problems, the transmission of floor vibrations is reduced by a factor 18, while simultaneously the suspension stiffness is about 100 times higher as compared to a <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator</b> with a low suspension stiffness. In addition, the damping of the internal modes is increased significantly. Further research should focus on improving the mechanical design of the active hard mount <b>vibration</b> <b>isolator,</b> such that the control bandwidth can be increased, and on using sensors with ultra-low noise levels...|$|E
