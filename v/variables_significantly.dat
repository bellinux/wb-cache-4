Adolescents (N = 389; 50. 4 % males) ages 12 – 14 completed measures of gratitude (moral affect and life-orientation), protective factors (e. g., academic and activity engagement, family relationship), and high-risk behaviors (e. g., sexual attitudes and behaviors, drug/alcohol use). Results indicated greater moral affect gratitude was the only <b>variable</b> <b>significantly</b> associated with greater academic interest, better academic performance, and more extra-curricular activity engagement. Greater moral affect and life-orientation gratitude both significantly correlated with positive family relationship. Greater life-orientation gratitude was the only <b>variable</b> <b>significantly</b> associated with abstinence from sexual intimacy, sexual intercourse, likelihood of engaging in sex during primary school, and abstinence from drug/alcohol use.
