50|$|<b>Vine</b> <b>breeding</b> {{began in}} 1907 at the Württemberg Institute for Grapevine Breeding and Grafting in Offenau (from 1926 with {{an office in}} Lauffen am Neckar). The Grapevine Breeding Institute was {{connected}} in 1947 to LVWO. August Herold, through a scientifically-based grape breeding programme produced several much-cultivated grape varieties. Among the varieties bred by him are Helfensteiner, Heroldrebe (named after him), Dornfelder (named for the school's founder) and Kerner.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{production}} of grapes and <b>vine</b> <b>breeding</b> efficiency in Mikulov sub-region. This work evaluates total grape production in selected municipalities and the description of grapevine breeding problems. Grape production rating {{is focused on}} varieties, number of enterprises, the age of vineyards, the area in Mikulov sub-region and in each selected municipality. Great attention was paid to the new <b>vine</b> <b>breeding,</b> selected cultivated varieties, their cultivation areas and the description of each variety. The graphical outputs were developer from the available data characterizing the grape production in various communities and throughout the Mikulov sub-region...|$|E
40|$|Grape vine {{has been}} {{associated}} with the development of human society since ancient times. It was planted by humans near their dwellings as far as thousand years ago. The grape vine has since undergone many transformations and became worldwide spread and major agricultural produce which is grown for wine production, table grapes and decoration purposes. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to gather and summarise available knowledge about the use of botanical species of common grape vine and its hybrids in breeding and gardening practice. The works of czech authors as well as publications of foreign authors were investigated. It bacame apparent from the published works that <b>vine</b> <b>breeding</b> for resistance is a never ending process the aim of which is to select individual plants either resistant to pathogens or those with sufficient hardiness against them. Another difficult task of botanists and <b>vine</b> <b>breeding</b> experts is naming the individual species of grape vine. Countless species were discovered throughout the history however the number of names of species has exceeded the actual number of species multiple times. Nowadays, modern genetic anlyses are being used for species identification which significantly lessens the task of identifying the species. These analyses employ microsatelite markers which are the most commonly used DNA markers today. These analyses were developed over the past 10 - 15 years...|$|E
50|$|As a rule, popular {{education}} amongst the Cossacks stood {{at a higher}} level than in the remainder of Imperial Russia. They had more schools and a greater proportion of their children went to school. In addition to agriculture, which (with the exception of the Ussuri Cossacks) sufficed to supply their needs and usually to leave a certain surplus, they carried on extensive cattle and horse <b>breeding,</b> <b>vine</b> culture in the Caucasus, fishing on the Don, the Ural, and the Caspian Sea, hunting, beekeeping etc. The Cossacks mostly rented out rights to extract coal, gold and other minerals found on their territories to strangers, who also owned most factories.|$|R
50|$|The Jews {{participate}} {{greatly in}} the exchanges with Al-Andalus, Egypt and the Middle East. Grouped in separate quarters (although many Jews {{settled in the}} Muslim districts of Kairouan during the Fatimid period), they had house of prayer, schools and a court. The port cities of Mahdia, Sousse, Sfax and Gabès saw a steady influx of Jewish immigrants from the Levant {{to the end of}} the eleventh century, and their communities participated in these economic and intellectual exchanges. Monopolizing the goldsmiths' and jewelers' crafts, they also worked in the textile industry, as tailors, tanners and shoemakers, while the smallest rural communities practiced agriculture (saffron, henna, <b>vine,</b> etc.) or <b>breeding</b> of nomadic animals.|$|R
40|$|The {{geographic}} location of Republic of Macedonia is exceptional for <b>breeding</b> <b>vine</b> and specific grape varieties. But, the wine industry waste {{in general is}} a problem in Macedonia, since it does not have any usage. In the European Union, there is approximately 14. 5 million tons of wine industry waste produced from wineries ([URL] In fact, the wine industry waste (grape pomace) contains primarily crushed grape skins and seeds rich in beneficial polyphenol compounds that act as antioxidants, antibacterial agents etc. The largest fraction of winery waste is pomace, or the solid remains of grapes (skins, stalks and seeds), which is thrown away ending up in landfills. From another point of view, transport is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases and biofuels can significantly reduce transport’s carbon footprint since it is dependent on finite fossil fuels such as oil and petroleum for its energy needs (R. E. H. Sims, et al.). Biodiesel, provides significantly reduced emissions of carbon monoxide; compared to petroleum diesel fuel...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{description of}} the vine variety Bacouri (Vitis Vinifera L. spp. sativa) {{that is based on}} descriptors defined by the Organization Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin (OIV) is presented in this paper. The variety Bacouri was investigated as being a valuable Greek variety for the production of high-quality red wines of different classes. Morphological characteristics, technological features with recommendations for red wine production using micro wine-making methods and the economic importance of the variety are provided. Its value in <b>vine</b> <b>breeding</b> has also been taken under consideration. The origin of the variety is the Peloponnese region, in the south part of Greece and it is a descendant of the region’s wild species of Vitis sylvestris. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{influence}} of grapevine rootstocks on vine vigour and crop yield {{is recognized as}} an integral part of viticultural management. However, the genetic potential of Vitis species rootstock hybrids for vigour and yield control is not fully exploited in Australian viticulture. The effect of 55 novel inter- and intra-species hybrids and five traditional hybrid rootstock cultivars on winter pruning weight, berry size and fruit yield of grafted Shiraz vines is presented. The genetic predictions that resulted from this analysis were used to illustrate how rootstocks that best perform for a combination of traits may be selected. Methods and Results: The use of linear mixed models and residual maximum likelihood procedures took into account repeated measures and spatial variation within a large field trial (720 vines). Over 6 years of assessment, variation of up to 93. 9 % in winter pruning weight, 81. 9 % in fruit yield and 21. 0 % in berry weight between rootstocks was estimated. Conclusions: The effect of rootstock genotype accounted for marked differences in conferred pruning weight, berry weight and fruit yield from trial averages. Comparison of statistical analysis techniques illustrated that the choice of such techniques may influence the outcome of genetic selection from field trial data. Significance of the Study: Such quantification of the variation between vines in vigour, fruit yield and berry size due to rootstock genotype provides a framework for selection of well-performing genotypes for inclusion in advanced generations of the CSIRO <b>vine</b> rootstock <b>breeding</b> program...|$|R
