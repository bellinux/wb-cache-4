5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help or through the courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively <b>valid,</b> <b>and</b> refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> abolished Edward's religious laws. Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles, which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their benefices.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation treats {{design of}} two ten storey reinforced concrete buildings in two constructional systems. First building is designed as frame construction, second as wallequivalent dual system. Both buildings are analyzed with computer program Tower 5. With mentioned program we made space model of both constructional systems. We loaded both constructional systems with loads according to <b>valid</b> regulations <b>and</b> EC. In continuation follows comparison of calculated seismic forces according to EC <b>and</b> <b>valid</b> regulations, <b>and</b> difference between calculated seismic forces with modal analysis and simple method. In middle part {{we have shown}} comparison of calculated internal forces and dimensioning with computer program Tower 5, according to <b>valid</b> regulations <b>and</b> EC for some selected constructional elements of both constructional systems, which are beam, column and wall. We checked the results of dimensioning constructional elements with computer program by manual calculating, where we specially dedicated to shear resistance. In last part we made control of seismic demands for constructional elements beam, column, wall, internal joint and coupling beam between walls according to EC 8. Then we made comparison of needed reinforcement in constructional elements according to <b>valid</b> regulations <b>and</b> EC. In conclusion follows short financial evaluation of needed reinforcement according to <b>valid</b> regulations <b>and</b> EC...|$|R

On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried to formally retract his confession, claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the confession was <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E
5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and {{determined}} that the curfew and exclusion orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had determined that the curfew was not <b>valid,</b> <b>and</b> that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be <b>valid,</b> <b>and</b> that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Electronic Arts and Fox Entertainment {{released}} , {{which has}} been labelled a rip-off of the Crazy Taxi formula by game reviewers. In this game, the player controlled one of The Simpsons characters as they drive about Springfield, taking passengers to their destinations {{in the same manner}} as Crazy Taxi. Sega sued Fox Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and developer Radical Games Ltd. over infringement of the 138 patent. The case, Sega of America, Inc. v. Fox Interactive, et al., was settled in private for an unknown amount. The 138 patent itself remains <b>valid,</b> <b>and</b> is considered to be one of the most important patents in video game development today.|$|E
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Teuruarii IV {{left behind}} several notable descendents. In 1923, {{one of his}} sons, Rooteatauira a Teuruarii, was {{involved}} in a controversial embezzlement case that called into question the jurisdiction of French law over native inhabitants of its territories. Rooteatauira, along with his accomplice Tinorrua a Hurahtia, had embezzled various goods to the detriment of Sum-You, a Chinese merchant. In the case, Rooteatauira argued that he should be prosecuted by native law rather than French law and that the annexation was illegal since it was done without the sanctioned of the King of Rurutu or the approval of the French Parliament. However, the French colonial court ruled that the annexation was <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> that he would be prosecuted by French law since the offense was committed against a non-native. Rooteatauira was sentenced to two years in prison and fined fifty francs. In 1934, Rooteatauira was appointed chief of Moerai and given an annual pension of seven hundred and twenty francs.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} first {{heard in the}} District Court. The appellants contended {{by way of a}} {{preliminary}} objection that Order 123 was ultra vires, or beyond the powers, of the UPA and contravened Article 15(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which enshrines the right to freedom of religion. The trial judge dismissed the preliminary objection, holding that Order 123 was <b>valid</b> <b>and</b> constitutional, as the order concerned the public interest and was permitted under s 3(1) of the UPA. Accordingly, the appellants were convicted for possession of the banned publications. They appealed to the High Court against the trial judge's decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{counting}} {{of votes}} took one month, {{and the final}} results were announced on 5 May, one week later than was initially scheduled. Of 148,000,369 registered voters, 124,420,339 ballots (84.06 percent) were submitted. Of these ballots, 113,462,414 were considered <b>valid,</b> <b>and</b> 10,957,925 were declared invalid. In the People's Representative Council, the Party of the Functional Groups (Golkar) received the most number of seats. It had previously lost to the Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle in the 1999 legislative election after being in power since 1970. However, fourteen of the twenty-four participating parties refused to certify the election results after allegations of irregular vote counting.|$|E
5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve {{some of the}} financial burden by passing a law of replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as <b>valid,</b> <b>and</b> a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E
