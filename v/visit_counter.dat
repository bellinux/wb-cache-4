40|$|The Web {{provides}} {{access to}} a wide variety of information but much of this information is fluid; it changes, moves, and occasionally disappears. Bookmarks, paths over Web pages, and catalogs like Yahoo! are examples of page collections that can become out-of-date as changes are made to their components. Maintaining these collections requires that they be updated continuously. Tools to help in this maintenance require an understanding of what changes are important, such as when pages no longer exist, and what changes are not, such as when a <b>visit</b> <b>counter</b> changes. We performed a study to look at the effect of the type and quantity of change on people's perception of its importance. Subjects were presented pairs of Web pages with changes to either content (e. g., text), structure (e. g., links), or presentation (e. g., colors, layout). While changes in content were the most closely connected to subjects perceptions of the overall change to a page, subjects indicated a strong desire to be notified of structural changes. Subjects only considered the simultaneous change of many presentation characteristics as important...|$|E

30|$|A Bayesian {{approach}} is a useful tool in statistics, where all forms of uncertainty are {{expressed in terms of}} probability. The idea of Bayesian statistics within the context of life data analysis is to integrate prior knowledge, along with a given set of current observations, in order to make statistical inferences. The advantages of Bayesian inference are well known and include elicitation of prior beliefs about past experience, avoidance of asymptotic approximations and practical estimation of functions of parameters [24, 25]. Bayesian inference assumes that the data are fixed and consider all unknown parameters as random variables [26]. Studied zero-inflated distributions with the Bayesian point of view using the data augmentation algorithm [27], developed a full Bayesian estimation method of zero-inflated regression model by Gibbs sampling. Analyze zero-inflated models with a Bayesian approach to estimate regression parameters and compare prediction performances with the frequentist approach for applications to ANC <b>visits</b> <b>counter</b> measures. A popular way of simulating from a general posterior distribution is by using MCMC methods.|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{relative}} effectiveness {{of two different}} persuasive strategies embedded in the rationale of a website. The visitor is asked for his/her contact information either prior to or after having access to the guidelines for managing multimedia files offered by the site. Asking for personal data prior to access represents a reward strategy for obtaining such data. In contrast, asking for personal data after access represents a reciprocity strategy. In addition, the mediating effect of website features displaying “social proof” (such as <b>visits</b> <b>counter)</b> is explored. The analysis of the amount and type of contact information provided shows that a persuasive strategy based on reciprocity {{is more effective than}} one based on reward. Also, the presence of social proof features seems counterproductive when using a reciprocity strategy, while it seems to improve the visitors’ compliance with the request when using a reward strategy. The results are discussed in terms of adequacy of the persuasive strategy to the specific website genre...|$|R

40|$|Background: Value added {{services}} (VAS) are {{an innovative}} dispensing system created {{to provide an}} alternative means of collecting partial drug supply from our hospital. This in turn was projected to reduce the necessity for patient to <b>visit</b> pharmacy <b>counter</b> and thus reduce the burden of prescription handling. Objective: To evaluate the impact of increased VAS uptake following promotional campaign towards patient waiting time and to explore factors that may affect patient waiting time at the Ambulatory Pharmacy, Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Methods: A quasi experimental study design was conducted from September 2014 till June 2015 at the Ambulatory Pharmacy. During pre-intervention phase, baseline parameters were collected retrospectively. Then, VAS promotional campaign was carried out {{for six months and}} whilst this was done, the primary outcome of patient waiting time was measured by percentage of prescription served less than 30 minutes.

50|$|Continental and United Airlines waived their {{standard}} 14-day advance purchase requirement for Braniff ticket holders. America West offered to fly Braniff's customers on a standby basis for 75 USD. American and Delta Airlines {{did not offer}} assistance and announced {{that they would not}} take Braniff tickets. Braniff management cited intense competition and fare wars initiated by Northwest Airlines and American Airlines as key reasons for the unannounced shutdown. Buying tickets on Braniff required calling the airline or <b>visiting</b> a ticket <b>counter</b> as the carrier was not part of a large airline reservation system. Because of this tickets could not be purchased at travel agencies. Three other airlines were reorganizing under bankruptcy protection when Braniff ceased operations and included America West, Continental and Trans World Airlines. A nationwide recession exacerbated Braniff's as well as other carrier's financial problems.|$|R
40|$|About half of {{the human}} genome {{consists}} of transposable elements (TE's), sequences that have many copies of themselves distributed throughout the genome. All genomes, from bacterial to human, contain TE's. TE's affect genome function by either creating proteins directly or affecting genome regulation. They serve as molecular fossils, giving clues to the evolutionary history of the organism. TE's are often challenging to identify because they are fragmentary or heavily mutated. In this thesis, novel features for the detection and study of TE's are developed. These features are of two types. The first type are statistical features based on the Fourier transform used to assess reading frame use. These features measure how different the reading frame use is from that of a random sequence, which reading frames the sequence is using, and the proportion of use of the active reading frames. The second type of feature, called side effect machine (SEM) features, are generated by finite state machines augmented with counters that track the number of times the state is <b>visited.</b> These <b>counters</b> then become features of the sequence. The number of possible SEM features is super-exponential in the number of states. New methods for selecting useful feature subsets that incorporate a genetic algorithm and a novel clustering method are introduced. The features produced reveal structural characteristics of the sequences of potential interest to biologists. A detailed analysis of the genetic algorithm, its fitness functions, and its fitness landscapes is performed. The features are used, together with features used in existing exon finding algorithms, to build classifiers that distinguish TE's from other genomic sequences in humans, fruit flies, and ciliates. The classifiers achieve high accuracy (> 85 %) on a variety of TE classification problems. The classifiers are used to scan large genomes for TE's. In addition, the features are used to describe the TE's in the newly sequenced ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophile to provide information for biologists useful to them in forming hypotheses to test experimentally concerning the role of these TE's and the mechanisms that govern them...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This study {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} relationship between service quality perception and customers' satisfaction in Malaysian Islamic banking using the SEM approach. Design/methodology/approach – This model starts with SERVQUAL measurement scales consisting of six dimensional structures: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, and plus the compliance dimensions to measure Malaysian Islamic banking service quality. Respondents are the customers (Muslim and non-Muslim) who <b>visit</b> the bank <b>counters.</b> They must have an account with one of the full-fledged Islamic banking and dual-banking systems. Findings – The results showed that the proportion of Malaysian Muslims' awareness of the Islamic banking products and services were high compared to non-Muslim customers. The majority of the Islamic banking customers were satisfied with the overall service quality provided by their banks. The findings suggest that the standard model of Islamic banking service quality dimensions should consist of the six dimensions and good determinants of satisfaction. The relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction was significant. Research limitations/implications – Further research should be considered in order to gather more information regarding service quality and customer satisfaction dimensions in the context of Malaysian Islamic banking industry. Practical implications – The six dimensions of SERVQUAL represent a valid instrument to measure service quality in Malaysian Islamic banking. Providing financial counseling to attract Muslim customers to use more Islamic banking products and services is critical, where 60 percent of the Malaysian population is Muslim. There is a potential target market for Islamic banking that needs be concerned. Originality/value – This research is important in line with the obvious cross-cultural and religious differences between these two key customer segments; Muslims and non-Muslims. In the Malaysian context, there is a strategic dimension that needs to be understood. Banking, Customer satisfaction, Customer services quality, Islam, Malaysia...|$|R

She <b>visited</b> MAC cosmetics <b>counters,</b> interacted with fans and help raise money and awareness for the cause, which helps people who are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. She also took part in MAC's Fashion Cares show in Toronto, Canada. The show raised close to one million for the AIDS Committee of Toronto. Her endorsement for MAC, with Mary J. Blige, {{would go on to}} raise $4 million for the fund. In October 2001, Jones was featured on the R&B mix of the song [...] "What's Going On". Jones, along with several other popular recording artists, released the song under the name [...] "Artists Against AIDS Worldwide", with proceeds going to AIDS programs worldwide and also United Ways September 11th Fund. That same month, Jones performed at BREATHE, a benefit concert for breast cancer research and treatment. Proceeds from the concert went to the UCLA Breast Center and the Breast Examination Center of Harlem, an outreach program of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. On March 12, 2002, Jones walked her dogs in the 3rd annual [...] "Paws for Style" [...] fashion show. The event is held by Animal Fair magazine as a benefit for the Humane Society of New York. Items worn by the animals were later auctioned off online. In 2004, Jones started her own foundation called Lil' Kim Cares. The foundation raises funds, resources and awareness for national programs that assist with issues of homelessness, HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness, transitional living, child neglect and violence against women. Speaking about the foundation, Jones stated she planned to be involved in a number of causes, most of which had effected her personally in past years. On April 17, 2004, Jones participated in the 28th annual Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race. The event helped raise more than $100,000 for [...] "Racing for Kids", a non-profit program benefiting Southern California children's hospitals in Long Beach and Orange County. On August 24, 2004, Jones encouraged others to vote in the United States presidential election through the Rock the Vote campaign.|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. The {{methodology}} of supply chain optimisation {{is a fairly}} new concept {{in the field of}} logistics management and is also referred to as value chain optimisation. This short dissertation explores and describes the effects of a national improvement in supply chain processes on the sales and profitability of RS Components SA. The study contains discussions from various theoretical disciplines and includes topics such as customer service, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, logistics management and supply chain methodology. The link between the performance of the logistics processes and perceived customer service levels is also discussed in detail. Finally the study will show how improved logistical performance can lead to improved levels of customer satisfaction, which in turn leads to customer loyalty and increased profitability. In order to improve the organisation's national supply chain, RS Components SA decided to open a new Trade Counter in the Cape Town sales region. Before the opening of this Trade Counter however, improvements were made to the national logistical network to ensure seamless integration of the new sales branch as a fully operational warehouse. Various financial indicators were measured for the year after the opening of the new Trade Counter in Cape Town, in order to compare such figures to the year prior to the opening of said Trade Counter. The primary results were as follows: Sales for the Cape Town sales region have increased by a greater margin than originally budgeted for. The sales growth target was exceeded by 30. 21 %. The number of invoices generated for the year after the opening of the Trade Counter in Cape Town has increased steadily while the average invoice value has shown no mentionable growth. This indicates that the Trade Counter in Cape Town has spurned a greater percentage of repeat purchases and that sales have not merely increased due to bigger sales orders. Growth in the number of individual purchasing customers for the Cape Town region also reached a staggering growth of 71. 71 % compared to the growth target of 45 %. Substantial growth was also achieved throughout the year for the number of Trade <b>Counter</b> <b>visits</b> to the Cape Town Trade Counter. Whilst staggering growth rates were achieved in all of the above-mentioned categories, overhead expenses came in lower than was originally budgeted for the Cape Town sales region. A saving of 3. 65 % was achieved against a sales growth of 75. 21 %. In conclusion, this study indicated an increase in sales and profitability in the Cape Town sales region. Based on the success achieved through supply chain optimisation, both in terms of increased revenue as well as perceived levels of customer satisfaction, a recommendation is made for further expansion of the supply chain network of RS Components SA through the opening of a new Trade Counter in Durban...|$|R
