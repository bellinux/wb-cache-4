However, the different patches in the reflection of the <b>varnish</b> also indicates that Raeburn did not only <b>varnish</b> his paintings vertically, but that in addition, he let his paintings dry for a too short while, before <b>varnishing</b> them.

5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is of concern for museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and <b>varnishes</b> in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil <b>varnishes</b> made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used {{extensively}} {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and <b>varnishes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Older {{furnaces}} {{may contain}} rubber parts {{that would be}} affected by biodiesel's solvent properties, but can otherwise burn biodiesel without any conversion required. Care must be taken, however, given that <b>varnishes</b> left behind by petrodiesel will be released and can clog pipes- fuel filtering and prompt filter replacement is required. Another approach is to start using biodiesel as a blend, and decreasing the petroleum proportion over time can allow the <b>varnishes</b> to come off more gradually and be less likely to clog. Thanks to its strong solvent properties, however, the furnace is cleaned out and generally becomes more efficient. A technical research paper describes laboratory research and field trials project using pure biodiesel and biodiesel blends as a heating fuel in oil-fired boilers.|$|E

50|$|Water-based {{paint is}} far easier and cheaper to apply, as undercoat, {{to produce a}} good smooth finish with a {{fraction}} of the time and effort of enamel paints, but harder and slower-drying enamel is best for the top coat {{on the outside of the}} hull, which is subject to a lot of bumps and scraps. Limit <b>varnishing</b> to smaller areas, such as grab rails, hatches, toe rails and trim, unless you have lots of patience and a very dust-free environment for <b>varnishing.</b> Use only marine gloss <b>varnish</b> on the outside, as interior <b>varnish</b> will peel off very quickly in hot sun and rain. Marine <b>varnish</b> has UV inhibitors to slow down peeling and fading. Never <b>varnish</b> a deck as it is slippery when wet. Even top-quality marine <b>varnish</b> is not as water-resistant as paint, so you must apply at least 4 coats. Often perfectionists will apply 8 coats or more to get a glass-like, reflective finish. Never <b>varnish</b> submerged parts like rudders.|$|R
25|$|The {{concept of}} shelf life applies to other {{products}} besides food and drugs. Gasoline has a shelf life, {{although it is}} not normally necessary to display a sell-by date.
