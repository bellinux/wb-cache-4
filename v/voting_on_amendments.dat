For this study, special emphasis is placed on the role of religion <b>on</b> North Carolinians’ <b>voting</b> behaviors.

50|$|The <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>Amendment</b> 1 {{was held}} during the lower-turnout North Carolina primary {{election}} rather than during {{a general election}} when voter turnout is typically higher. Furthermore, whereas the Republican primary was an active contest, the Democratic primary was effectively uncontested and thus had an even further reduced turnout of the Democratic electorate relative to what might have occurred in a hotly contested primary. Some commentators have argued that by selecting this primary date rather than the general election, the North Carolina Republican-controlled legislature circumvented the democratic-spirit of a public <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the issue.|$|R

5000|$|Comments by opponents: Many of {{the most}} {{important}} legislative actions on a bill or resolution take place before the final <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the measure occurs, as the scope and details of the measure are being debated and developed. The proposed amendment is insufficient because it fails to require the recording of all <b>votes</b> <b>on</b> preliminary approval of a bill or resolution, which is arguably the most critical phase in the passage of legislation, as well as <b>votes</b> <b>on</b> <b>amendments,</b> substitutes, and critical procedural decisions such as a motion to table or postpone a bill or to take a bill up out of its regular order.|$|R
5000|$|Committees do {{not change}} the texts of the bills they mark up. Instead, {{committees}} <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>amendments</b> that their members want to recommend that the House adopt when it considers the bill on the floor. The committee concludes a markup not by <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> the bill as a whole, but by <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> a motion to order the bill reported to the House with whatever amendments the committee has approved. A majority of the committee must be present when this final vote occurs. For all other stages of markups, committees may set their own quorum requirements, so long as that quorum is at least one-third of the committee's membership.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2007, it was {{discovered}} that Ensign had used the secret hold rule to prevent a bill requiring senators to file fund-raising reports electronically from being <b>voted</b> <b>on.</b> He required that they first <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> his <b>amendment</b> to strengthen disclosure rules.
