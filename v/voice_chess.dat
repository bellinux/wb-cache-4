2500|$|A {{number of}} early drafts {{for the film}} were written by Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel, co-creators of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. [...] The final {{screenplay}} was written in 1981 by Bill Lancaster, son of Burt Lancaster. Carpenter later recalled {{that he did not}} meet or collaborate with any of the screenwriters.

5000|$|Sir,—On {{behalf of}} the New Orleans Chess Club, and in {{compliance}} with the instructions of that body, we the undersigned committee, have the honor to invite you to visit our city, and there meet Mr. Paul Morphy in a chess match ...... it was suggested that Mr. Morphy, the winner at the late Congress and the present American champion, should cross the ocean, and boldly encounter the distinguished magnates of the transatlantic chess circles; but it unfortunately happens that serious family reasons forbid Mr. Morphy, for the present, to entertain the thought of visiting Europe. It, therefore, becomes necessary to arrange, if possible, a meeting between the latter and the acknowledged European champion, in regard to whom there can be no scope for choice or hesitation—the common <b>voice</b> of the <b>chess</b> world pronounces your name ... New Orleans Chess Club to Howard Staunton ...|$|R
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he <b>voiced</b> the Russian <b>chess</b> player.|$|R
