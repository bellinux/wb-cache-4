5000|$|Climax Pattern Theory was {{proposed}} by Whittaker (1953). The climax pattern theory recognizes {{a variety of}} climaxes governed by responses of species populations to biotic and abiotic conditions. According to this theory the total environment of the ecosystem determines the composition, species structure, and balance of a climax community. The environment includes the species responses to moisture, temperature, and nutrients, their biotic relationships, availability of flora and fauna to colonize the area, chance dispersal of seeds and animals, soils, climate, and disturbance such as fire and wind. The nature of climax vegetation will change as the environment changes. The climax community represents a pattern of populations that corresponds to and changes with the pattern of environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sustainability}} of traditional farming systems {{in many parts}} of Africa is threatened by losses in the variety of species, reduction in land, forest, soil and water resources under demographic pressure. Together with foreign influences these farming system are no longer in equilibrium with local culture and ecology and are therefore disintegrating {{due to the lack of}} local capacity to adjust to these changes. This has led to environmental degradation. The paper employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to: analyse the farming systems, assess the effect of cropping intensification on the <b>climatic</b> <b>climax</b> vegetation, and to establish the post-cultivation vegetation successions in fallows. It reports four crop fallow rotations: crop 3 years with 1 year bush fallow, crop 5 years with 1 - 2 year bush fallow, crop 10 years with 1 - 3 year bush fallow and continuous cropping. The post-cultivation successions present a plagioclimax dominated by Hyparhenia species with scattered shrubs maintained by cycles of cultivation and burning. The paper concludes that these shifting cultivation cycles involving cropping intensification and post cultivation savannization have deprived the farming system of its ecological benefits, that is, nutrient recycling through a long and mature fallow. The inability of the vegetation to reconstitute itself requires the development of farming systems that combine trees and crops in the field because of proven micro-ecological and ecological benefits. The paper therefore identifies the scope for the development of ecologically sustainable agro-ecosystems as a development path for shifting cultivation systems...|$|R
40|$|Larger Foraminifera with test sizes from 2 mm up to 13 cm are {{characteristic}} organisms inhabiting shallow water subtropical and tropical environments today. They prefer clear, nutrition depleted water {{as can be}} found in the surroundings of coral reefs. Two main factors acting as single gradients regulate the distributions of larger foraminifers within coral reef complexes. All living larger Foraminifera house symbiotic microalgae and are thus restricted to the photic zone (down to 150 m), getting independence from food resources outside the cell in various degrees. Differences in water movement, mostly correlated with substrate type, and light availability are managed in various ways. Test constructions in combination with attachment mechanisms of the protoplasm combat strong water movement, while light penetration is handled by test ultrastructure. Larger foraminifers inhabiting intertidal and extremely shallow subtidal environments block high irradiation by thicker tests or porcelaineous structures, making the walls impenetrable. In contrast, species living near the base of the photic zone facilitate light penetration by thin transparent test walls facilitating light penetration and by developing light-collecting mechanisms such as nodes and pillars. Water turbulence, often extreme in coral reef environments, is handled in different ways, but tests are restricted to a few paradigmatic forms. Similar tests were developed in various phylogenetic lines at different <b>climatic</b> <b>climaxes</b> during earth history starting from the Late Paleozoic (325, 000, 000 years ago).

This study examined the influence of slope location on vegetation pattern in Inner Mongolia grassland to provide a scientific basis for vegetation classification, vegetation mapping, rational utilization and ecosystem restoration and reconstruction. Methods In each of three typical sites in Stipa breviflora grassland, we established three parallel line transects of unequal length and placed 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m herb plots at 2 -m intervals along each line. Vegetation and soil were surveyed for each plot. Cluster analysis, binomial test, significant difference test, canonical correspondence analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were used to analyze the influence of slope location on vegetation pattern andsoil effects. Important findings Vegetation types were clearly differentiated between upper and lower slopes, with a <b>climatic</b> <b>climax</b> community on the upper slope and a terrain community on the lower slope. Slope locations affected the species distribution pattern along the slope, mainly in species composition and some dominant species. The productivity of the lower slope is higher than that of the higher slope, and two different functional areas had formed. The character of the surface soil (especially 0 – 5 cm) was largest difference between upper and lower slope. Various geomorphic processes resulted in great habitat heterogeneity in a very small region.

40|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{whether or not}} {{creating}} gaps in planted forests can increase the plant species composition, structure, and biodiversity, and also whether it can be helpful for restoring planted forests (to a more natural state). Based on a comparison of species composition and structure among forest patches, small gaps (4 - 25 m(2)), medium gaps (25 - 150 m(2)) and large gaps (150 - 450 m(2)), we found that (1) creating gaps enhanced vascular plant diversity. Both the species richness and Shannon diversity indices of small, medium and large gaps {{were significantly higher than}} in the understory. The pattern of increasing diversity of vascular plants with gap creation could be partly attributed to the emergence of novel shade intolerant species in gaps. (2) Creating gaps favored the colonization and regeneration of native species. Gap size influenced not only the emergence and density of individuals of different species, but also the emergence of different life form types. Small gaps promoted the regeneration of some shrub species, such as Ostryopsis davidiana, Rosa hugonis, and Forsythia suspense, leading to these species becoming canopy dominants early on in succession. The medium and large gaps favored the growth of tree species, such as Populus davidiana and Betula platyphylla (early successional stage), and Quercus liaotungensis and Pious tabulaeformis (later successional phase). (3) The canonical correspondence analysis showed that plant species composition and distribution were mainly influenced by gap size and slope aspect, and that the recorded plant species could be divided into three life forms (trees, shrubs and herbs) on the biplot diagram. (4) Finally, creating gaps provided opportunities not only for native pioneer species in the early successional stage, but also for <b>climatic</b> <b>climax</b> species to grow to canopy dominants in later successional phases, suggesting that a more natural forest will develop with plant succession.

Moreover recent justification that the original woodland cover of Europe was a dynamic mosaic of habitats from open glades to closed forest (Vera 2000) suggests we should re-evaluate the origins of ancient trees and their direct lineage {{back to the original}} wildwood and their importance in identifying old growth woodlands for biodiversity. ANCIENT TREES AND OLD GROWTH WOODLAND Old growth is described in many different ways and in northern Europe it appears {{to be used in the}} same way as our term ‘primeval’. In North America, old growth is often used for stands with stems over a cer-tain size and a level of standing and fallen dead wood. By comparison, in mainland Europe, primeval woodland is considered to be old forest in a natural state characterised by: 1. a wide range of different aged trees, 2. abundant dead wood 3. continuous small scale changes and 4. grazing by animals significantly influencing the mosaic structure of varied density. Both terms relate to late-successional stands irre-spective of their origin. They describe present day habitat structure. As some primeval or old growth late-successional woodlands are known to have been cleared in the distant past and different species have now become the dominant ones, they do not indicate continuity of the same principal species of tree on the site down through the ages. Over time various seral stages may well have occurred and in this context the concept of local <b>climatic</b> <b>climax</b> becomes rather dubious. Few of the definitions for old growth state the age of trees which need to be present to qualify for this des-ignation.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{comprehensive}} terrestrial ecosystem classification for the central Rocky Mountains of the United States. A comprehensive classification of terrestrial ecosystems in a mountainous study area in northern Utah was developed incorporating direct gradient analysis, spatial hierarchy theory, the zonal concept, and concepts of diagnostic species and fidelity, together with the biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification approach used in British Columbia, Canada. 	This classification was derived from vegetation and environmental sampling of both forest and non-forest ecosystems. The SNOwpack TELemetry (SNOTEL) and The National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) weather station network were used to approximate climate of 163 sample plots. Within the large environmental diversity of the study area, three levels of ecosystem organization were distinguished: (1) macroclimatic - regional climate; (2) mesoclimatic, accounting for local climate and moisture distribution; and (3) edaphic - soil fertility. These three levels represent, in order, the L+ 1, L, and L- 1 levels in a spatial hierarchy. Based on vegetation physiognomy, climatic data, and taxonomic classification of zonal soils, two vegetation geo-climatic zones were identified at the macroclimatic (L+ 1) level: (1) montane zone with Rocky Mountain juniper and Douglas-fir; and (2) subalpine zone with Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir as <b>climatic</b> <b>climax</b> species. A vegetation classification was developed by combining vegetation samples (relevés) into meaningful vegetation units. A site classification was developed, based on dominant environmental gradients within the subalpine vegetation geo-climatic zone. Site classes were specified and a site grid was constructed. This site classification was coupled with the vegetation classification. Each plant community was associated with its environmental space within the site grid. This vegetation-site overlay allowed ecosystems to be differentiated environmentally and a structure, combining zonal, vegetation, and site classifications, forms a comprehensive ecosystem classification.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Black Butte {{presents}} a unique natural laboratory for ecological study. It is a volcanic cone of uniform configuration {{located in the}} rain shadow on the east flank of the Oregon Cascades. Soils are of very recent origin with no obvious development of horizons. Physical and chemical analysis revealed little dissimilarity within the study area. However, fire has played an important ecological role. Dendrochronological analysis of cross sections of mature Pinus ponderosa revealed repeated widespread burning at an average interval of 12. 3 years for the years 1830 to 1903. The Forest Service has practiced fire exclusion since that time. The vegetation of the lower :slopes is dominated by mature Pinus ponderosa. Libocedrus decurrens, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies grandis, Pinus albicaujis, and Abies lasiocarpa become successively more abundant at progressively higher elevations. Tree, shrub and herb data were gathered via the point centered quarter method at 1000 foot elevation intervals along eight transects radiating from the summit. In subsequent analysis, designed {{along the lines of}} a continuum analysis, it was possible to demonstrate via relative importance values that some species gradually give way to other species along environmental gradients. However, considerations of the age class patterns of mixed stands revealed that they are not stable and therefore with freedom from disturbance by fire or other catastrophe will come to be less heterogeneous in overstory composition. In most instances, this will be at the expense of Pinus ponderosa which, due to its superior resistance to fire, has been able to occupy and thrive in habitats considerably more mesic than its true habitat type. After 60 years of fire exclusion, species of greater shade tolerance and with generally higher moisture requirements are now responding with relatively greater reproduction than Pinus ponderosa on these mesic sites. These patterns of reproduction allow one to project to six climax associations which will come to occupy six different habitat types. Due to the uniformity of soil and topography within <b>climatic</b> <b>climax</b> zones, these may be interpreted theoretically as encompassing single habitat types with variation in seres being due to rate of succession following fire. These distributional patterns are very similar to those described by other workers for the east slope of the Cascades.

40|$|In the Australian Continent, {{in those}} areas {{occupied}} by Eurpoeans during the past 200 years, the natural environment has been modified; the change are most severe in the semi-arid regions. Prior to Eurpoean settlement, for some tens of thouthands years of Aboriginal occupation, there were slow changes mainly due to occasional burning of vegetation so that the Australian flora was gradually moved towards fire-resisted species. With the introduction of agricuture and grazing drastic changes in the density, floristics, and structure of native vegetation occurred. Disturbance or removal of vegetation has also affected surface and sub-surface hydrology. These changes have resulted in water or wind erosion and salinization. Where vegetation has been regenerated the species established are often those which are unpalatable to grazing stock or can withstand frequent burning. This leads to "desertification". The concept of "desertification" is ecologically defined as follows: The natural vegetation in equilibrium with the potentiality of regional climate (<b>climatic</b> <b>climax)</b> is replaced by the vegetation which grows naturally and originally in more arid region due to environmental stress directly induced by man and the accompanying land degradation. The Murray-Mallee Region {{in the southern part}} of Austrralia, where the late Pleistocene and Holocene sand dunes are widely distributed, is a semi-arid region with annual rainfall of 250 - 400 mm; it is wholly covered with mallee (Eucalyptus spp.) scrub. The sand dunes which were stable covered totally with such vegetation during the pre-European days have become unstable at many sites due to vegetation clearing, farming and grazing associated with European settlement since the late 19 th Century. The remobilization of sand dunes is one of the typical events of "desertification" and, in extreme cases, the surface remains unvegetated. Various stages in vegetation change can be observed showing "desertification" or regeneration process. The authors describe the processes involved in land and vegetation degradation, and discuss the measures to prevent "desertification" based on the examination of the relationships between activity of sand drifting, thickness of loose sand overlying the stable substrata, floristic composition, community height, and activlty of rabbits (Olyctolagus cuniculus). The natural mallee scrub in the conservation park is dominated by Eucalyptus spp. accompanled by rlch lower shrub layer species such as Casuarina stricta, Callitris verrucosa and Hakea leucoptera. The mallee scrub remaining on farmland, however, is very poor in understory resulting from grazing. Triodia spp. and Acacia spp. invade in the understory of the mallee scrub after bushfires. Acacia spp. regenerate easily and are dominant on the land where the surface is disturbed by vegetation clearance and/or wind erosion. Natural mallee scrub will regenerate through sprouting from so-called mallee roots (lignotuber) persisting after surface disturbance. When the lignotuber is exposed by wind erosion or covered by sand accumulation, the recovery to natural mallee scrub becomes very difficut. On such sites, Triodia colonies and/or Acacia scrub stand as disclimax communities with a life cycle of 30 to 50 years (Figs. 6 and 7). The thicker the loose sand is, the more active and continuous is the sand drifting (Fig. 8). In particular, on many dunes with loose sand thicker than 80 cm, serious drifting has continued for recent tens of years exacerbated by the large amount of mobile sands and the difficulty of vegetation invasion. At the sites with thick loose sands, the population of rabbit introduced from Europe is larger, suggesting that the reactivation and acceleration of sand drifting is induced by rabbit infestation (Fig. 9). On the other hand, where vegetation height is greater than the line shown in Fig. 8, suggesting a minimum height of vegetation for erosion control, sand dunes tend to be stabilized. The results of investigation as mentioned above show the various processes of vegetation changes according to the combinations of local difference in natural conditions and the importance of human impacts, and imply many stages of"desertification". The remobilization of sand dunes is regarded as an extreme stage of "desertification" caused by a combination of many factors. The soil conservation and the vegetation management based on detailed survey of physical and ecological characteristics of land will identify the factors contributing to landscape instability and "desertification" and so provide a framework for reversing the processes of land and vegetation degradation...|$|R
