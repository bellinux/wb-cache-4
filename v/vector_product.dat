25|$|In {{mathematics}} and vector algebra, the cross product or <b>vector</b> <b>product</b> (occasionally directed area product {{to emphasize the}} geometric significance) is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space (R3) and is denoted by the symbol ×. Given two linearly independent vectors a and b, the cross product, a × b, is a vector that is perpendicular to both a and b and thus normal to the plane containing them. It has many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer programming. It {{should not be confused}} with dot product (projection product).|$|E
25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, {{and that includes}} the types mentioned here derive the torque from the <b>vector</b> <b>product</b> of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.|$|E
