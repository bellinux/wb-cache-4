5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E
5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans, but scholars now usually <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought {{an end to the}} war. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many South Africans still <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 {{and the right to}} display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E
50|$|A poll {{conducted}} in July 2012 found that 80% of Americans view Iran's nuclear program <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{threat to the}} United States and its NATO allies. 39% <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very big threat, 41% <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> was a moderate threat, 12% <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{not much of a}} threat, and 6% <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> not being <b>a</b> threat. In regards to how much of a threat the nuclear program is to Israel, 60% <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very big threat to Israel while 27% <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> moderate threat. 80% believe that Iran is building nuclear weapons, including 72% of Democrats, 81% of Independents, and 89% of Republicans.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Levesque's {{role as an}} Executive Senior Advisor {{was officially}} formalized as he was given an office at WWE {{headquarters}} in Stamford, Connecticut. Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011. In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within {{the company has been}} under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to keep him on top on-screen and to give him more television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E

25|$|Among the world's religions, {{views on}} {{masturbation}} vary widely. Some religions <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spiritually detrimental practice, some {{see it as}} not spiritually detrimental and others take a situational view.

The populations of Brexia that occur at higher elevations in the Seychelles are sometimes regarded as a distinct subspecies B. madagascariensis ssp. microcarpa, but others <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate species B. microcarpa.

25|$|Rock art serves {{multiple}} {{purposes in}} the contemporary world.

As such, images taken from cave art have appeared on memorabilia and other artefacts sold {{as a part of the}} tourist industry.|$|E
25|$|Within the United States, social {{location}} {{affects the}} way women perceive menopause and its related biological effects. Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status.

25|$|Despite the new status, {{there was}} some {{apprehension}} in 1919 when Prime Minister Bill Massey signed the Treaty of Versailles (giving New Zealand membership of the League of Nations).

Massey himself did not <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbolic act and would have preferred New Zealand to maintain a deferential role within the empire.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic {{approach}} to Marian art is quite {{distinct from the}} way other Christians (such as the Protestant and the Eastern Orthodox) treat the depictions of the Virgin Mary. From {{the very beginning of}} the Protestant Reformation its leaders expressed their discomfort with the depictions of saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition of art developed, the depictions of the Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Catholic excess.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other left groups, the SPGB {{did not see}} fascism as {{a special}} threat to the working class. Rather than formulating it as the last refuge of {{capitalism}} organising to defend itself against the working class, the party‚Äôs writers and speakers tended to <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> particular type of reform movement. The two specific characteristics identified, though, were that it tended to {{be a form of}} national consolidation ‚Äì unifying fragment nations such as Germany, Italy and Spain ‚Äì and that it tended to have the mass support of the working class.|$|E

25|$|In halakha, {{there are}} two general types of fast: the {{communal}} fast and the individuals' fast. Among other differences between the two, a special prayer is added by the Chazzan (leader of the prayers) on communal fasts whenever both ten fasting individuals congregate and the Chazzan is fasting. While the Magen Avraham treats the fast as an individuals' fast, the Shiyurei K'nesset Ha-G'dolah, the P'ri Chadash, and the Or Zaru'a <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> communal fast. To avoid the practical implications of the controversy, the Mishnah Berurah suggests that a firstborn should not serve as Chazzan {{on the day of}} the fast.|$|E
25|$|It is {{convenient}} {{when talking about}} a set X of natural numbers to <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sequence x0,x1,x2,... of bits, with x'i= 1 {{if and only if}} i ‚àà X. This viewpoint will make it easier to talk about subalgebras of the power set algebra 2N, which this viewpoint makes the Boolean algebra of all sequences of bits. It also fits well with the columns of a truth table: when a column is read from top to bottom it constitutes a sequence of bits, {{but at the same time}} it can be viewed as the set of those valuations (assignments to variables in the left half of the table) at which the function represented by that column evaluates to 1.|$|E
25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of {{intimacy}} with people they consider to be high-status. Their sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations and to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are aware that their statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and to <b>view</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign of weakness. When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).|$|E
