50|$|The <b>Capstan</b> <b>Shafts</b> is {{the musical}} project of American lo-fi artist Dean Wells. He has been {{releasing}} material under the <b>Capstan</b> <b>Shafts</b> name since 1999, through various indie labels such as Yellow Mica, Asaurus and Abandoned Love Records. Most of his albums are very cheap (four or five dollars) or even free.|$|R
5000|$|Recently, National Public Radio {{chose the}} <b>Capstan</b> <b>Shafts</b> {{as one of}} [...] "5 Artists You Should Have Known in 2010".|$|R
50|$|Windlasses are {{sometimes}} used on boats {{to raise the}} anchor {{as an alternative to}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>capstan</b> (see anchor windlass).|$|R
5000|$|The {{pinch roller}} is a rubberized, free-spinning wheel {{typically}} used to press magnetic tape against a <b>capstan</b> <b>shaft</b> {{in order to}} create friction necessary to drive the tape along the magnetic heads (erase, write, read).|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 the <b>Capstan</b> <b>Shafts</b> regrouped as a 5 piece band before playing shows {{across the}} U.S. east coast. Festivals dates at SXSW and CMJ {{followed}} before the band released their first studio LP [...] "Revelation Skirts" [...] for Rainbow Quartz Records.|$|R
50|$|The Backyard Committee has shared stages {{with the}} likes of Richard Buckner, Crooked Fingers, Sean Hayes, The Spring Standards, The Philistines Jr., The Zambonis and the <b>Capstan</b> <b>Shafts.</b> They played B.O.M.B. Fest 2011 at the Meadows Music Theater in Hartford, and at the 2011 Bridgeport Arts Festival.|$|R
50|$|His {{songs are}} {{typically}} short, ranging in length from 45 seconds to 2 minutes, and feature a full-band sound of guitars, bass and drums, {{all of which}} are played by Wells himself. Every <b>Capstan</b> <b>Shafts</b> release to date has been recorded at home, giving the music a fuzzy lo-fi sound similar to bands such as Guided By Voices and The Mountain Goats.|$|R
50|$|WRMC {{has brought}} a plethora of musical acts to the Middlebury campus over the years, {{including}} Rilo Kiley, Yo La Tengo, Animal Collective, The Decemberists, Ratatat, Versus, Mates of State, Smog, Tenacious D, The National, Clearlake, Josh Ritter, Future Islands, the Death Set, Tobacco, the Bran Flakes, the French Kicks, The Ruby Suns, Menomena, The <b>Capstan</b> <b>Shafts,</b> The French Kicks, Enon, The Books, Dan Deacon, Andrew Bird, Regina Spektor, Das Racist, Palms Out Sounds, Marcus Price, Boody B, and E-603 among others.|$|R
5000|$|Technically speaking, {{the term}} [...] "windlass" [...] refers only to {{horizontal}} winches. Vertical designs are correctly called capstans. Horizontal windlasses {{make use of}} an integral gearbox and motor assembly, all typically located above-deck, with a horizontal shaft through the unit and wheels for chain and/or rope on either side. <b>Vertical</b> <b>capstans</b> use a <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft,</b> with the motor and gearbox situated below the winch unit (usually below decks).|$|R
50|$|Horizontal {{windlasses}} offer several advantages. The unit {{tends to}} be more self-contained, protecting the machinery from the corrosive environment found on boats. The dual wheels also allow two anchors on double rollers to be serviced. <b>Vertical</b> <b>capstans,</b> for their part, allow the machinery to be placed below decks, thus lowering the center of gravity (important on boats), and also allow a flexible angle of pull (which means rope or chain can be run out to different fair leads).|$|R

50|$|Most {{magnetic}} tape recorders use one capstan motor and one pinch roller located after the magnetic heads {{in the direction of}} the moving tape. However multiple pinch rollers may also be employed in association with one or more capstans. An example of the application of multiple pinch rollers is the Technics-RS1520 tape recorder, which utilizes two pinch rollers located on opposite sides of a single <b>capstan</b> <b>shaft,</b> providing a more stable transport across two sets of magnetic heads. Dual pinch rollers are also used (along with dual capstans) in auto-reverse cassette decks to drive the tape in both directions as needed. In this case, only one pinch roller is pressed against its corresponding capstan at a time.|$|R
50|$|A <b>vertical</b> steam <b>capstan</b> called 'donkey' for hauling fishing {{lines and}} -nets is {{preserved}} on the museum fishing vessel 'Balder' {{in the historic}} harbour of Vlaardingen (near Rotterdam), the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|Such {{mechanisms}} are not often found since the {{rack and pinion}} is generally more robust for the same job. However the capstan and bowstring is easily fabricated by the home builder from scratch, where accurate rack and pinion {{mechanisms are}} not, and also require much looser tolerances between the working parts. The angle between the <b>capstan</b> <b>shaft</b> and the linear element can also be variable without any special couplings needed, such as universal joints. The cable is typically steel and can be tensioned at the points where it {{is connected to the}} bow. Another feature of the capstan and bowstring is that it can be designed to slip at the ends of its travel if desired by the simple expedient of having the cable slip around the capstan, forming a simple torque-limiting clutch. Capstan and bowstring mechanisms can be used wherever a rack and pinion or other rotary-to-linear conversion is found, such as in the steering mechanism of vehicles, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Steam donkeys {{were also}} found to be useful for {{powering}} other machines such as pile drivers, slide-back loaders (also known as [...] "slide-jammers", cranes which were used to load logs onto railroad cars and which moved along the flat-bed rail cars that were to be loaded), and cherry pickers (a sled-mounted crane used for loading, onto railroad cars, logs that a grading crew had cut down). Sailing fishing vessels on the North sea operated <b>vertical</b> steam-driven <b>capstans</b> called ´the donkey´ to haul fishing lines and -nets, {{some of which are}} still operating today, even though converted to compressed air.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{methods are}} used to increase pitch and reduce durations, or vice versa, reduce pitch and increase duration. This {{can be done by}} replaying a sound waveform at a different speed than it was recorded. It could be accomplished on an early reel-to-reel tape recorder by changing the diameter of the <b>capstan</b> drive <b>shaft,</b> or using a different motor. As technologies improved later designs of motor speeds could be controlled by electronic servo system circuits. This arrangement using “vari-speed” capstan motors allowed the speed change to be achieved more simply. As for vinyl records, the same thing can be done;placing a finger on the turnable to give friction will retard it, while giving it a 'spin' can advance it.|$|R
40|$|Thermomechanical rotary {{actuator}} based on shape-memory property of alloy composed of equal parts of titanium and nickel. If alloy stretched while below transition temperature, it reverts to original length when heated above transition temperature. Two <b>capstans</b> on same <b>shaft</b> wrapped with shape-memory wires. As one wire heated, it contracts and stretches opposite wire. Wires heated in alternation so they switch shaft between two extreme angular positions; "on" and "off" positions of rotary valve...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 65) The {{advent of}} helical scan recording systems {{has brought about}} the necessity for more sophisticated tracking systems. The {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) of data reproduced from the tape decreases dramatically if the reproduce head is not exactly aligned with the recorded track. Any loss of SNR directly affects the probability of data reproduction errors. An example of one such tracking control system is presented. This system is designed to provide for optimum overlap of the reproduce head on. the recorded track. This is accomplished by continuously comparing signal levels obtained from the tap with previous values, and applying control signals to maintain a maximum average level. The system is composed of two basic elements: the capstan servo, and a digital portion, known as autophasing. In itself, the capstan servo constitutes a feedback control system responsible for maintaining tape position and velocity. It drives the capstan motor and feedback is provided from an optical tachometer mounted on the <b>capstan</b> <b>shaft.</b> In the system studied, this servo is one element of a broader feedback loop which also includes the autophasing block. The feedback for the overall system is the actual high frequency signal reproduced from the tape. The block diagrams of each basic element and of the overall system are presented and described. Stability of the capstan servo loop is demonstrated through magnitude and phase plots. A simplified computer model of this system is developed. The system's output response is simulated with a variety of inputs: constant, ramp, and sine wave. The results are compared with that which is theoretically predicted. The simulation results reveal two design limitations which would cause mistracking and instability. Solutions to the problems are derived, in one instance using a truth table, and then implemented in the model by the insertion of new model blocks. The improved model is again tested with ramp and sine wave inputs, and the removal of the instability is demonstrated. Correct system operation is verified...|$|R
