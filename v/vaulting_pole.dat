2500|$|During the {{approach}} the pole vaulter sprints {{down the runway}} {{in such a way}} as to achieve maximum speed and correct position to initiate takeoff at the end of {{the approach}}. Top class vaulters use approaches with 18 to 22 strides, often referred to as a [...] "step" [...] in which every other foot is counted as one step. The run-up to the vaulting pit begins forcefully with the vaulter running powerfully in a relaxed, upright position with knees lifted and torso leaning very slightly forward. The head, shoulders and hips are aligned, the vaulter increasing speed as the body becomes erect. The tip of the <b>vaulting</b> <b>pole</b> is angled higher than eye level until three paces from takeoff, when the pole tip descends efficiently, amplifying run speed as the pole is planted into the vault box. The faster the vaulter can run and the more efficient their take-off is, the greater the kinetic energy that can be achieved and used during the vault.|$|E

25|$|Initially, <b>vaulting</b> <b>poles</b> {{were made}} from stiff {{materials}} such as bamboo or aluminum. The introduction of flexible <b>vaulting</b> <b>poles</b> in the early 1950s made from composites such as fiberglass or carbon fiber allowed vaulters to achieve greater height. Physical attributes such as speed, agility and strength are essential to <b>pole</b> <b>vaulting</b> effectively, but technical skill is an equally if not more important element. The object of <b>pole</b> <b>vaulting</b> is to clear a bar or crossbar supported upon two uprights (standards) without knocking it down.|$|R

5000|$|Lawrence Crock's version {{frequently}} {{appears in}} Young Justice, voiced by Nick Chinlund. He is shown {{as a senior}} operative and enforcer of the Light (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors). His duties are diverse, ranging from acquisition of advanced technology, leading squads from the League of Shadows, to serving as handler for a cloned Roy Harper. In the first season, he uses his relationship to Artemis to try to blackmail her into joining the Light, though she double-crosses him and he is captured. Having escaped custody in the 5 years preceding the second season, he vows vengeance on Black Manta for Artemis' murder {{at the hands of}} Kaldur'ahm. He formally requests that the Light's board let him kill Kaldur in exchange, but immediately sets out to kill Black Manta when this is denied, and Deathstroke replaces him. Crock calls off the hit after discovering Artemis faked her death to infiltrate the Light, even assisting his daughter in covering her tracks. His costume and physical design for the series have been drastically altered, with a simple featureless Hockey mask covering his face, paramilitary armor, and an arm plate. He is portrayed as more of a mercenary, and utilizes Olympic sport-themed weapons such as javelins, a high-tech hammer throw, a <b>vaulting</b> <b>pole,</b> and various types of explosive discuses. He has a longstanding rivalry with Deathstroke, and is very concerned with his reputation, targeting Kaldur'ahm and later Black Manta because he cannot be seen as weak for not seeking revenge for the murder of his daughter Artemis.|$|E
