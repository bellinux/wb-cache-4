The sex pheromone of the <b>vetch</b> <b>aphid,</b> Megoura v i c i a e, {{has recently been}} identified as comprising the,(4 aS, 7 S, 7 aR) - isomers of nepetalactone and nepetalactol. The stereochemistry at carbon- 1 of the lactol was not defined, but is now shown, by X-ray crystallography on the 3, 5 -dinitrobenzoate ester, to have the R configuration, This lactol is the major product from reduction of the lactone with diisobutylaluminium hydride. Results from the similar reduction of other nepetalactone isomers are presented...|$|E

Electroantennograms (EAGs) were recorded from the antennae of these aphid forms, reared from a single clone, to thirty five plant volatiles and to paraffin oil extracts from leaves of the two host plants. The EAG peak responses were normalised against the adjacent responses to a standard stimulus ((E) - 2 -hexenal at log 2 dilution). The comparison of different parameters of the EAG responses, i. e. peak, rise and decay, reveals that peripheral olfactory perception of most volatiles is not significantly different between these two forms. In addition, the responses of adult wingless virginoparae to thirteen of the plant volatiles show, with one exception, similar peripheral perception. The results indicate that any odour discrimination between the two alternative host plants by their respective colonisers is not perceived {{at the level of}} the peripheral olfactory receptors. The EAG response profile of A. fabae differs from that of the <b>vetch</b> <b>aphid,</b> Megoura viciae, which also colonises bean...|$|E
40|$|Aphids use {{chemical}} cues {{to locate}} hosts and find mates. The <b>vetch</b> <b>aphid</b> Megoura viciae feeds {{exclusively on the}} Fabaceae, whereas the currant-lettuce aphid Nasonovia ribisnigri alternates hosts between the Grossulariaceae and Asteraceae. Both species use alarm pheromones to warn of dangers. For N. ribisnigri this pheromone is a single component (E) -β-farnesene but M. viciae uses a mixture of (E) -β-farnesene, (-) -α- pinene, β-pinene, and limonene. Odorant-binding proteins (OBP) are believed to capture and transport such semiochemicals to their receptors. Here, we report the first aphid OBP crystal structures and examine their molecular interactions with the alarm pheromone components. Our study reveals some unique structural features: 1) the lack of internal ligand binding site; 2) a striking groove in {{the surface of the}} proteins as a putative binding site; 3) the N-terminus rather than the C-terminus occupies the site closing off the conventional OBP pocket. The results from fluorescent binding assays, molecular docking and dynamics demonstrate that OBP 3 from M. viciae can bind to all four alarm pheromone components and the differential ligand binding between these very similar OBP 3 s from the two aphid species is determined mainly by the direct π-π interactions between ligands and the aromatic residues of OBP 3 s in the binding pocket...|$|E

40|$|Predator-mediated {{plasticity}} in the morphology, {{life history}} and behaviour of prey organisms {{has been widely}} reported in freshwater ecosystems. Although clearly adaptive, similar responses have only recently been reported for terrestrial organisms. This is surprising as aphids are polyphenic and develop very rapidly compared with their predators and often produce very large colonies, which are attractive to predators. Therefore, one might expect terrestrial organisms like aphids to show a facultative change in their development {{in response to the}} presence of predators and other results have confirmed this. The results presented below indicate that the pea aphid responded to the tracks left by ladybird larvae by producing a greater proportion of winged offspring, which avoid the impending increased risk of predation by dispersing. Associated with this was a short-term increase in activity and reduction in fecundity. The black bean and <b>vetch</b> <b>aphids,</b> which are afforded some protection from ladybirds because they are ant attended and/or unpalatable, did not respond in this way to the presence of ladybird larvae...|$|R
40|$|Competition {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} biotic factors determining the structure of ecological communities. In this study, we show that there is variation in competitive ability between two clones of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, both of which out-compete a clone of the <b>vetch</b> <b>aphid,</b> Megoura viciae, in the laboratory. We tested whether this variation in competitive ability would alter the outcome of interspecific competition in the field. White one pea aphid clone followed the pattern set in the laboratory, out-competing the Megoura viciae clone, another showed the reverse effect with Megoura viciae dominating. These differences appear to be the result of variation in early population growth rate between the pea aphid clones, rather than predation, although predation did lead to the eventual extinction of colonies. We also questioned whether intra- and interspecific differences in predator escape behaviour could affect the outcome of competition in the field. All three clones responded similarly to the presence of foraging hoverfly larvae (Episyrphus balteatus), but the Megoura viciae clone dropped from the plant significantly less often in response to the presence of a foraging two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata). This work provides evidence that intraspecific variation in competitive ability can alter the outcome of interspecific competitive interactions in nature and suggests that species-specific behavioural. traits may have the potential to modify the outcome of these interactions.

40|$|Olfaction {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} senses by which insects obtain information about their environment. In the early stages of olfactory perception in insects, odour molecules are carried across the sensillum lymph by small soluble Odorant Binding Proteins (OBPs). This is followed by activation of the appropriate olfactory receptor, resulting in an electrical impulse, and subsequent degradation of the initial signal. OBPs have been studied in a range of insect orders including Lepidoptera, Diptera and Orthoptera, and this study reports the cloning and characterisation of cDNAs with a potential olfactory role in the <b>vetch</b> <b>aphid,</b> Megoura viciae (Buckton, Homoptera: Aphididiae). Construction and sequencing of antennal cDNA libraries identified two cDNAs, MvicOBP 1 and Mv 164, which were approximately 0. 8 kb and 1 kb respectively. The amino acid sequence of MvicOBP 1 has the spacing pattern of six cysteine residues that is characteristic of insect OBPs, and Mv 164 shows similarity to insect cytochrome P 450 enzymes. RT-PCR showed that these cDNAs have specific or enhanced expression in the chemosensory tissues of M. viciae, and parallel expression patterns suggest a "linked" function. Related sequences are present and expressed in other aphid species, and sequencing of genomic fragments allowed the partial elucidation of the intron/exon organisation of these genes. Subtracted antennal cDNA libraries identified two cDNAs encoding proteins with significant similarity to insect chemosensory proteins (CSPs), cDNAs encoding Juvenile Hormone Binding Proteins (JHBPs), and a tissue-specific cDNA with a potential carrier role. These, coupled with the OBPs, add evidence to the suggestion that there is an insect superfamily of binding proteins. A PBP from Bombyx mori (BmorPBP 1) was used as a model system for in vitro expression of an insect OBP and subsequent characterisation of the recombinant protein. Four forms of this protein, identified through their interaction with an anti-BmorPBP antibody, were resolved by isoelectric focusing...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{two questions}} of fundamental importance to evolutionary ecology - how genetic variation in traits that affect interactions between and within species are maintained within populations, and how such variation. affects patterns of intra- and interspecific interactions in the field. In chapter one, I,review the evidence concerning these issues. I also introduce the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Homoptera: Aphididae) - natural enemy model system {{used in the}} following experimental chapters. In chapter two, I describe a field experiment that illustrates how pea aphid clonal variation can affect natural enemy recruitment and community structure. The major predator in this system is the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus De Geer (Diptera: Syrphidae). I measured the costs of parasitoid attack in E. balteatus (chapter three), finding that parasitized E. balteatus consumed fewer aphids, took longer to pupate and experienced higher pupal mortality, and flies that survived attack had reduced life spans. Chapter four describes a series of experiments that test whether a trade-off between competitive ability and dispersal ability could maintain clonal variatiqn in these traits among clones of the pea aphid. Significant clonal variation was detected for interspecific competitive ability, lifetime fecundity and dispersal ability. Lifetime fecundity was found to correlate positively. with the production of winged offspring. Chapter five describes an experiment in which we tested whether the variation in interspecific competitive ability detected in the laboratory (chapter four) could alter the outcome of interspecific competition in the field. In the laboratory the pea aphid populations were always larger than populations of a single clone of the <b>vetch</b> <b>aphid</b> M~,. oura viciae Buckton (Homoptera: Aphididae), but in the field the outcome of interspecific competition depended on pea aphid genotype. Chapter six describes a field experiment that measured the effects of competition and predation on the population dynamics of two clones of the pea aphid. Both clones did equally well in monoclonal colonies, while in mixed colonies one clone was competitively superior. The strength of predation depended on aphid density. One clone did better when sharing a patcli, but not a plant, with the second clone compared with when sharing a patch with a second colony of the same clone (apparent mutualism). In chapte'r seven, I review the principal results of these experiments and discuss how these new insights fit into the wider evolutionary and applied ecological literature.

40|$|In Japan, pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum mainly feed on vetch and clover, {{and many}} aphid clones produce more progeny on vetch than on clover. In this context, {{particular}} genotypes of the facultative symbiont Regiella insecticola enhance reproduction of infected pea aphids specifically on clover, thereby broadening the suitable food plant {{range of the}} insect. A species that is sympatric to A. pisum, <b>vetch</b> <b>aphids</b> Megoura crassicauda, are commonly found on vetch but not on clover. Laboratory rearing of M. crassicauda strains revealed active reproduction on vetch but substantially no reproduction on clover. Experimental transfection of Regiella from A. pisum to M. crassicauda by haemolymph injection established stable and heritable infection in the recipients, although no Regiella infection has been detected in natural populations of M. crassicauda. Different strains of Regiella-transfected M. crassicauda grew and reproduced on vetch, but exhibited lower fitness in comparison with corresponding uninfected aphid strains. Strikingly, the Regiella-transfected M. crassicauda exhibited improved survival and some reproduction on clover. These results suggest that Regiella {{has the potential to}} confer an ecological trait, adaptation to clover, on novel insect hosts, and also account for why Regiella is able to infect M. crassicauda but is scarcely found in these aphid populations...|$|R
