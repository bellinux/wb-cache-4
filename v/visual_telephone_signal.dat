50|$|The first {{focus was}} on anti-induction {{telephone}}s. In the 1930s, the telephone infrastructure in Japan was primarily used by the railroad industry, the police, the utility industry and the mining industry. The telecommunications infrastructure was so poor {{that it had to}} rely on power lines and railway cables—upon which <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were superimposed. Because the <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were susceptible to inductive interference and noise and the defective wiring in the long lines caused too much <b>signal</b> loss, normal <b>telephone</b> conversations were difficult. Iwasaki Kogyo set out to develop an anti-induction telephone to solve this problem, whilst running the cable manufacturing operations. Similarly, Iwasaki Kogyo focused on secure, anti-tapping telephones.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the same}} twisted pair carries <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> in both directions,echo {{is often a}} problem on these circuits.

50|$|The {{international}} standard for <b>telephone</b> <b>signaling</b> utilizes dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling, more {{commonly known as}} touch-tone dialing. It replaced the older and slower pulse dial system. The push-button format is also used for all cell phones, but with out-of-band signaling of the dialed number.|$|R

50|$|There is also H.320 standard, which {{specified}} {{technical requirements}} for narrow-band <b>visual</b> <b>telephone</b> systems and terminal equipment, typically for videoconferencing and videophone services. It applied mostly to dedicated circuit-based switched network (point-to-point) connections of moderate or high bandwidth, such as through the medium-bandwidth ISDN digital phone protocol or a fractionated high bandwidth T1 lines. Modern products based on H.320 standard usually support also H.323 standard.|$|R
