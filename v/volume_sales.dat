That also meant that the company had to temporarily use manual ordering, which of course meant a loss of sales at stores and wastage costs that ran into tens of millions of pounds. Asda was entering a vicious circle with a flawed and compromised trading strategy and with a management team who were floundering and in charge of a company heading into a steady decline.|$|E
500|$|Delrina's initial product {{offering}} was an electronic forms application called PerForm. Amato and Skapinker {{came up with}} the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer. There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada and the United States, the latter spurred on in particular by the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the total amount of paperwork handled by the United States government. One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990.

40|$|Background Forecasts {{are used}} {{as a basis for}} {{decision}} making and they mainly affect decisions at strategic and tactical levels in a company or organization. There are two different methods to perform forecasts. The first one is a qualitative method where a n expert or group of experts tell about the future. The second one is a quantitative method where forecast are produced by mathematical and statistical models. This study used a quantitative method to build a forecast model and took into account external f actors in forecasting the <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> of Bosch Rexroth’s hydraulic motors. There is a very wide range of external factors and only a limited selection had been analyzed in this study. The selection of the variables was based on the markets where Bosch Rexroth products are used, such as mining. Purpose This study aimed to develop five predictive models: one model for the global <b>sales</b> <b>volume,</b> one model each for <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> in USA and China and one model each for <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> of CA engine and Viking engine. By identifying external factors that showed significant relationship in various time lags with Bosch Rexroth’s <b>sales</b> <b>volume,</b> the forecasts 2016 and 2017 were produced. Methods The study used a combination of multiple linear regression and a Box - Jenkins AR MA errors to analyze the association of external factors and to produce forecasts. Externa l factors such as commodity prices, inflation and exchange rates between different currencies were taken into account. By using a cross - correlation function between external factors and the <b>sales</b> <b>volume,</b> significant external factors in different time lags were identified and then put into the model. The forecasting method used is a Causal forecasting model. Conclusions The global <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> of Bosch Rexroth turned out to be affected by the historical price of copper in three different time lags, one, six and seven months. From 2010 to 2015, the copper price have been continuously dropping which explain s the downward trend of the <b>sales</b> <b>volume.</b> The <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> in The U SA showed a significant association by the price of coal with three and four time lags. This means that the change of coal price takes three and four months before it affects the <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> in the USA. The market in China showed to be affected by the development of the price of silver. The <b>volume</b> of <b>sales</b> is affected by the price of silver by four and six time lags. CA engine also displayed association with the price of copper at the same time lags as in the global <b>sales</b> <b>volume.</b> On the other hand, Viking engine showed no significant association at all with any of the external factors that were analyzed in this study. The forecast for global mean <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> will be between 253 to 309 units a month for May 2016 – December 2017. Mean <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> in USA projected to be in between 24 to 32 units per month. China's mean <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> is expected to be in between 42 to 81 units a month. Mean <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> of CA engine has a forecast of 175 to 212 units a month. While the mean s ales of Viking engine projected to stay in a constant volume of 25 units per month...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the choice of a}} numeraire for the {{calculation}} of the <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> variance. The <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> variance seeks to report the effect of the actual <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> being different from the budgeted <b>sales</b> <b>volume.</b> If different numeraires are possible, then different values for the <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> variance will exist for a given deviation between planned and actual sales levels. We observe from the explicit or implicit materials in various common cost accounting textbooks that at least three numeraires are in evidence of use. These are: sales revenue; contribution margin and full-cost margin. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the effects of using the different numeraires. We also discuss the interrelationship between <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> variances and production volume variances as two of the numeraires lead to the reporting of the production volume variance while the use of the contribution margin as a numeraire leads to a situation where the production volume variance cannot exist. In order to illustrate these concepts in an accessible form we present a case study. The case study demonstrates the results that are obtained when three different managers, each using a different numeraire, report on the results of a company where <b>sales</b> <b>volume</b> has missed the budget by a substantial amount. Given the strategic importance of making realistic sales forecasts and achieving sales targets, then this issue of reporting the effect of deviations from targets is of major importance...|$|R
