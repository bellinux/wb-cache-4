5|$|In 1876, Wallace {{needed a}} £500 advance from the {{publisher}} of The Geographical Distribution of Animals {{to avoid having to}} sell some of his personal property. Darwin was <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the £200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{return to}} Versailles, Eliza joins Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate at her estate before the {{invasion}} of the Palatinate in her name. Eliza informs William of Orange of the troop movements caused by the French invasion which frees his forces along the border of the Spanish Netherlands, a region of stalemate between France and the Dutch Republic. During her flight from the Electorate of the Palatinate, Eliza becomes pregnant by Louis's cryptographer, though popular knowledge suggested it was the French nobleman Etienne D'Arcachon's child. Meanwhile, William takes the free troops from the border on the Spanish Netherlands to England, precipitating the Glorious Revolution, including the expulsion of JamesII. James flees London and Daniel Waterhouse soon encounters him in a bar. Convinced that the Stuart monarchy has collapsed, Daniel returns to London and takes revenge on Jeffreys by inciting a crowd to capture him for trial and later execution. Though he plans to depart for Massachusetts, Daniel's case of bladder stones increasingly worsens during this period. The Royal Society and other family friends are <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this and force Daniel to get the stone removed by Robert Hooke at Bedlam.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 80´s Kjell Eng, {{the founder of}} Engtex, got the idea to use {{textiles}} for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed tricot fabric that peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging. However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.|$|E
25|$|Humans are {{the primary}} predators on markhor. Because markhor inhabit very steep and {{inaccessible}} mountainous habitat, several strongholds of markhor populations have been rarely approached by man. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reported preying upon young markhor. Among wild carnivores, Himalayan lynx (Felis lynx), leopard cats (Felis bengalensis), snow leopards (Panthera uncia), wolves (Canis lupus), and black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are the main predators of markhor. Because of these threats, the markhor possess keen eyesight and {{a strong sense of}} smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their surroundings and are on high alert for predators. In exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators.|$|E

25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{what they}} wanted to do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

Cardinal Christoph Schönborn gave example from the story of Saint Augustine, written in his Confessions, who took pears from neighbor's garden when he was young.

500|$|After {{the release}} and tour for the album Radio-Activity, Kraftwerk {{continued}} to move {{further away from}} their earlier Krautrock style of improvised instrumental music, refining their work more into the format of melodic electronic songs. During the tour for Radio-Activity, the band began to make performance rules such {{as not to be}} drunk on stage or at parties. Karl Bartos wrote that about these rules, stating that [...] "it's not easy to turn knobs on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs. ... We always tried to keep <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what we were doing while acting in public." [...] During this tour, early melodies that would later evolve into the song [...] "Showroom Dummies" [...] were being performed.|$|E

500|$|... "Brawl in the Family" [...] {{features}} British {{actor and}} theater director Delroy Lindo as Gabriel, the social worker. According to Jean, Lindo {{was chosen to}} guest star because of his [...] "great voice." [...] Gabriel was then designed to match Lindo's voice. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Lindo expressed dissatisfaction with the character's design. He said [...] "Were I an audience member, looking at this [...] I'd think, 'That guy doesn't sound like he looks.'" [...] However, he added that his appearance in the episode earned him [...] "much cred" [...] among his nieces and nephews. In an interview with The A.V.

500|$|Hawes {{suggests}} that Kafka, though <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his own Jewishness, did not incorporate {{it into his}} work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes. In the opinion of literary critic Harold Bloom, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer. Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: [...] "The presence of Jewishness in Kafka's [...] is no longer subject to doubt". Pavel Eisner, one of Kafka's first translators, interprets [...] (The Trial) {{as the embodiment of}} the [...] "triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer).

[...] In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in 'dog block' (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital {{because he was a}} 'wolf' (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper." [...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on {{one of the problems that}} prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual."

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, Washing Machine {{was recorded}} at Easley Studios in Memphis, where indie rock bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices and Grifters previously recorded albums. Moore remarked that {{the atmosphere in}} Memphis [...] "lent itself to avoiding {{the reality of the}} record-buying public. In the past we were always <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> who was out there checking us out. This was the first record where we've gotten this certain level of notoriety and we were just, like, 'fuck it. He also felt that Washing Machine was conceived and recorded like some of the band's earlier albums: [...] "It hearkens back to records like Sister where we'd write a bunch of songs, go into the studio for a month, put them down, then go on the road and play them for a year.

500|$|In {{this book}} Wallace did not confine {{himself to the}} {{biogeography}} of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the Northern Hemisphere, migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia. Wallace was <b>very</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of,</b> and interested in, the mass extinction of megafauna in the late Pleistocene. In The Geographical Distribution of Animals (1876) he wrote, [...] "We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared". He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation, {{but by the time}} he wrote World of Life (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were [...] "due to man's agency".|$|E
