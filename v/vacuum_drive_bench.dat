50|$|The {{cruise control}} takes its speed signal from a {{rotating}} driveshaft, speedometer cable, {{wheel speed sensor}} from the engine's RPM, or from internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle. Most systems do not allow {{the use of the}} cruise control below a certain speed - typically around 25 mph. The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the throttle cable with a solenoid, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>driven</b> servomechanism, or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle (fully electronic) if it uses a 'drive-by-wire' system.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in the USA by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, it was common to use manifold <b>vacuum</b> to <b>drive</b> windscreen wipers with a pneumatic motor. This system was cheap & simple but resulted in the comical yet unsafe effect of wipers which operate at full speed while the engine idles, operate around half speed while cruising, and stop altogether when the driver depresses the pedal fully. Vehicle HVAC systems also used manifold <b>vacuum</b> to <b>drive</b> actuators controlling airflow and temperature.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} ways to mount the pump: either directly on the truck with the <b>vacuum</b> <b>drive</b> powered by the truck motor, or on the trailer with an independent motor. The second option with the independent motor is more complicated and not commonly used. It {{has the advantage of}} potentially having the pump closer to the septic tank. It is also able to use the negative pressure suction side of the pump as well as the positive pressure side to pump sludge over longer distances or lift it higher into the tank.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Due {{to those}} {{disadvantages}} of the cycloidal-pin wheel transmission, such as complex structure, low efficiency and low bearing capacity, {{a new kind}} of axis-fixed cycloid transmission is proposed. A new method for optimum modification quantity of cycloid gear is put forward on the ground of its drive principle. Considering the influence of modification to tooth contact stress, finite element model of tooth contact for the drive is built. The analysis result indicates that there is no obvious edge contact of tooth profile and it is more reasonable for the contact stress to distribute along tooth width.

40|$|Exact closed-form {{solutions}} to Maxwell's equations {{are used to}} investigate the acceleration of electrons in <b>vacuum</b> <b>driven</b> by ultrashort and nonparaxial radially polarized laser pulses. We show that the threshold power above which significant acceleration takes place is greatly reduced by using a tighter focus. Moreover, electrons accelerated by tightly focused single-cycle laser pulses may reach around 80 % of the theoretical energy gain limit, about twice the value previously reported with few-cycle paraxial pulses. Our results demonstrate that the direct acceleration of electrons in vacuum is well within reach of the current laser technology. Comment: 3 pages. Accepted for publication in Optics Letter...|$|R
40|$|We have {{observed}} acceleration of relativistic electrons in <b>vacuum</b> <b>driven</b> by a linearly polarized visible laser beam incident on a thin gold-coated reflective boundary. The observed energy modulation effect follows all the characteristics expected for linear acceleration {{caused by a}} longitudinal electric field. As predicted by the Lawson-Woodward theorem the laser driven modulation only appears {{in the presence of}} the boundary. It shows a linear dependence with the strength of the electric field of the laser beam and also it is critically dependent on the laser polarization. Finally, it appears to follow the expected angular dependence of the inverse transition radiation process. experiment as the Laser Electron Accelerator Project (LEAP) ...|$|R

50|$|The natural {{evolution}} of the automated bell and PAC controls led itself {{to the use of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>driven</b> provers with arrays of sonic nozzles (utilizing choked flow to provide precise flow rates. Such a use eliminated the need for a bell, as the flow rate is provided through the nozzles. When sufficient vacuum is applied to a sonic nozzle it creates a constant flow rate. Bernoulli's principle is applied to calculate the chosen flow rates chosen by the user or automated by a computer. Computers and PAC systems automate the process, and most sonic nozzle provers are capable of displaying not only meter proofs to a user, but are also capable of transmitting proofs as well as other important data to database systems across a computer network.|$|R

40|$|GPS {{was used}} with ultra-short {{baselines}} (2 - 3 carrier wavelengths) in a triple antenna configuration to obtain attitude for General Aviation (GA) aircraft. Through algorithm selection and error source calibration, accuracies of 0. 1, 0. 15 and 0. 2 rms {{were obtained for}} pitch roll and yaw respectively. The accuracy and robustness of the system was enhanced by combining the ultra short-baseline GPS attitude solution with an attitude solution derived using inexpensive automotive grade rate gyros. The solid state gyros allow coasting through temporary GPS outages lasting 2 minutes with attitude errors less than 6 degrees.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{we present}} here of SPP driven field emission, after propagation to a probe tip axis, leads to two firm conclusions. First, we have demonstrated nonlocal electron emission into <b>vacuum</b> <b>driven</b> by an SPP coupled to a surface after geometric focusing. Emitted electrons were measured as a current either using a weak (emission rate independent) collecting bias {{or with a}} strong DC voltage whose apex focused local field contributes to the work function suppression of the SPP driven field emission. Second, we demonstrate a number of informative effects of this emission behavior through comparative studies of material, applied voltage ranges, and a fully optimized and controlled surface geometry. The {{most important of these}} findings were thermal effects and local damage for this unique case of emission from sites far from incident radiation. While these observations demonstrate efficient coupling to SPPs, they underscore the limitations of local field strength attainable with propagating modes...|$|R
