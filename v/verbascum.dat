5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of <b>Verbascum</b> has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. <b>Verbascum</b> subsect. <b>Verbascum</b> depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as <b>Verbascum</b> nigrum (black or dark mullein), <b>Verbascum</b> lychnitis (white mullein) and <b>Verbascum</b> sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E

6000|$|The {{experiments}} of Vilmorin and Buckman on {{carrots and}} parsnips prove that abundant nutriment produces a definite and inheritable {{effect on the}} roots, with scarcely any change {{in other parts of}} the plant. Alum directly influences the colour of the flowers of the Hydrangea. (23/25. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 1 page 160.) Dryness seems generally to favour the hairiness or villosity of plants. Gartner found that hybrid <b>Verbascums</b> became extremely woolly when grown in pots. Mr. Masters, on the other hand, states that the Opuntia leucotricha [...] "is well clothed with beautiful white hairs when grown in a damp heat, but in a dry heat exhibits none of this peculiarity." [...] (23/26. See Lecoq on the Villosity of Plants 'Geograph. Bot.' tome 3 pages 287, 291; Gartner 'Bastarderz.' s. 261; Mr. Masters on the Opuntia in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1846 page 444.) Slight variations of many kinds, not worth specifying in detail, are retained only as long as plants are grown in certain soils, of which Sageret (23/27. 'Pom. Phys.' page 136.) gives some instances from his own experience. Odart, who insists strongly on the permanence of the varieties of the grape, admits (23/28. 'Ampelographie' 1849 page 19.) that some varieties, when grown under a different climate or treated differently, vary in a slight degree, as in the tint of the fruit and in the period of ripening. Some authors have denied that grafting causes even the slightest difference in the scion; but there is sufficient evidence that the fruit is sometimes slightly affected in size and flavour, the leaves in duration, and the flowers in appearance. (23/29. Gartner 'Bastarderz.' s. 606, has collected nearly all recorded facts. Andrew Knight in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 160, goes so far as to maintain that few varieties are absolutely permanent in character when propagated by buds or grafts.) ...|$|R
5|$|Bull thistle (Cirsium vulgare), {{common mullein}} (<b>Verbascum</b> thapsus), and Klamath weed (Hypericum perforatum) have been {{identified}} as noxious pests in Yosemite since the 1940s. Additional species that have been recognized more recently as aggressive and requiring control are yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), sweet clover (Melilot spp.), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), cut-leaved blackberry (Rubus laciniatus) and large periwinkle (Vinca major).|$|E
5|$|<b>Verbascum</b> thapsus {{has a wide}} native range {{including}} Europe, northern Africa and Asia, {{from the}} Azores and Canary Islands east to western China, north to the British Isles, Scandinavia and Siberia, and south to the Himalayas.

5|$|At the time, no type {{specimen}} was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century.

Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State's {{campus was}} among the first to serve as a botanical {{laboratory}} for its faculty and students and is the site of what is, today, the oldest continuously operated botanical garden in the US. In December 1879, Professor William J. Beal buried seeds of 23 common plants in 20 jars of sand (to prevent water accumulation) in various locations around campus. At certain fixed intervals, currently every 20 years, a jar is dug up to determine which seeds still germinate after their prolonged periods of unlit isolation. The most recent jar exhumation, April 2000, found only a few specimens surviving to germinate, notably <b>Verbascum</b> blattaria (moth mullein), after 120 years. Five buried jars remain, with the next unearthing scheduled for 2020.|$|E
5|$|Other insects {{commonly}} found on great mullein feed exclusively on <b>Verbascum</b> species in general or V.thapsus in particular. They include mullein thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the mullein moth (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the mullein plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures, like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including the stalk borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|E

The Pontic rhododendron is {{the symbol of the}} park and an important relict species with a highly disjunct areal in Europe where it inhabits only the north-western Iberian Peninsula and Strandzha. There are 56 endemic plant species, including local endemics (Veronica turrilliana and Anthemis jordanovii), western Black Sea coast endemics (Silene caliacrae and Lepidotrichum uechtrizianum), 6 Bulgarian endemics (Pyrus bulgarica, Oenanthe millefolia, Galium bulgaricum, Veronica krumovii, among others) and 40 Balkan endemics, such as Saponaria stranjensis. 113 species are listed in the Red Book of Bulgaria, including several species that within Bulgaria can only be found in the park— Ophrys reinholdii, <b>Verbascum</b> bugulifolium, Sideritis syriaca, Cistus laurifolius, among others.|$|E

60|$|The {{following}} case is {{far more}} remarkable, and seems at first quite incredible; {{but it is the}} result of an astonishing number of experiments made during many years on nine species of <b>Verbascum,</b> by so good an observer and so hostile a witness, as Gartner: namely, that yellow and white varieties of the same species of <b>Verbascum</b> when intercrossed produce less seed, than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from their own coloured flowers. Moreover, he asserts that when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a DISTINCT species, more seed is produced by the crosses between the same coloured flowers, than between those which are differently coloured. Yet these varieties of <b>Verbascum</b> present no other difference besides the mere colour of the flower; and one variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of the other.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have spoken}} of the {{legitimate}} unions as being fully fertile; and I am fully justified in doing so, for flowers artificially fertilised {{in this manner}} yielded rather more seeds than plants naturally fertilised {{in a state of}} nature. The excess may be attributed to the plants having been grown separately in good soil. With respect to the illegitimate unions, we shall best appreciate their degree of lessened fertility by the following facts. Gartner estimated the sterility of the unions between distinct species, in a manner which allows of a strict comparison with the results of the legitimate and illegitimate unions of Primula. (1/6. 'Versuche uber die Bastarderzeugung' 1849 page 216.) With P. veris, for every 100 seeds yielded by the two legitimate unions, only 64 were yielded by an equal number of good capsules from the two illegitimate unions. With P. Sinensis, as we shall hereafter see, the proportion was nearly the same- -namely, as 100 to 62. Now Gartner has shown that, on the calculation of <b>Verbascum</b> lychnitis yielding with its own pollen 100 seeds, it yielded when fertilised by the pollen of <b>Verbascum</b> Phoeniceum 90 seeds; by the pollen of <b>Verbascum</b> nigrum, 63 seeds; by that of <b>Verbascum</b> blattaria, 62 seeds. So again, Dianthus barbatus fertilised by the pollen of D. superbus yielded 81 seeds, and by the pollen of D. japonicus 66 seeds, relatively to the 100 seeds produced by its own pollen. We thus see--and the fact is highly remarkable--that with Primula the illegitimate unions relatively to the legitimate are more sterile than crosses between distinct species of other genera relatively to their pure unions. Mr. Scott has given a still more striking illustration of the same fact: he crossed Primula auricula with pollen of four other species (P. palinuri, viscosa, hirsuta, and verticillata), and these hybrid unions yielded a larger average number of seeds than did P. auricula when fertilised illegitimately with its own-form pollen. (1/7. 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8 1864 page 93.) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{flowers of}} this plant are frequented by various insects, chiefly by bees, {{for the sake}} of the pollen. Hermann Muller, however, has shown ('Die Befruchtung' etc. page 277) that V. nigrum secretes minute drops of nectar. The {{arrangement}} of the reproductive organs, though not at all complex, favours cross-fertilisation; and even distinct species are often crossed, for a greater number of naturally produced hybrids have been observed in this genus than in almost any other. (3/9. I have given a striking case of a large number of such hybrids between <b>Verbascum</b> thapsus and lychnitis found growing wild: 'Journal of Linnean Society Botany' volume 10 page 451.) Nevertheless the present species is perfectly self-fertile, if insects are excluded; for a plant protected by a net was as thickly loaded with fine capsules as the surrounding uncovered plants. <b>Verbascum</b> lychnitis is rather less self-fertile, for some protected plants did not yield quite so many capsules as the adjoining uncovered plants.|$|E

60|$|It {{is known}} that many species of <b>Verbascum,</b> when the stem is jarred or struck by a stick, cast off their flowers. (2/25. This was first {{observed}} by Correa de Serra: see Sir J.E. Smith's 'English Flora' 1824 volume 1 page 311; also 'Life of Sir J.E. Smith' volume 2 page 210. I was guided to these references by the Reverend W.A. Leighton, who observed this same phenomenon with V. virgatum.) This occurs with V. thapsus, as I have repeatedly observed. The corolla first separates from its attachment, and then the sepals spontaneously bend inwards so as to clasp the ovarium, pushing off the corolla by their movement, {{in the course of}} two or three minutes. Nothing of this kind takes place with young barely expanded flowers. With <b>Verbascum</b> lychnitis and, as I believe, V. phoeniceum the corolla is not cast off, however often and severely the stem may be struck. In this curious property the above-described hybrids took after V. thapsus; for I observed, to my surprise, that when I pulled off the flower-buds round the flowers which I wished to mark with a thread, the slight jar invariably caused the corollas to fall off.|$|E
