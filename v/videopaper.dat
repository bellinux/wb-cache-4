Cases that demonstrate teacher professional growth through self-dialogue and peer communication of specific pedagogical insights are exhibited. Critical success factors in implementation of this tool are outlined. In this paper we discuss {{the use of a}} <b>VideoPaper</b> (Nemirovsky, Peterson, Cogan-Drew, DiMattia, & Galvis, 2005) as a tool for promoting professional self-dialogue and communication among 25 middle school teachers enrolled in a capstone course bearing credit toward a Masters degree in Mathematics Education. The capstone course was the final course in a three-year program in which students had the option of completing either a <b>VideoPaper,</b> portfolio, or research project. From 30 total students 25 opted to complete VideoPapers because of various reasons such as the ability to share their teaching experience with others, to reflect on their practice, and interest in the technology. As instructors, we had no idea such a large proportion of teachers would select this option, nor did we envision those critical success factors (Galvis, 2004) necessary for implementation of this project. In this paper we will share some of those factors that our students found necessary {{as well as some of}} the successes that made the <b>VideoPaper</b> a unique tool for Mathematics Education professional development. Using Video to Document Classroom Episodes Although video has regularly been used by researchers conducting case-based research, it has only recently been used for teacher professional development. Video of mathematics classroom lessons has been used as rich sources of material for the professiona...|$|E

It is trivial to observe that -	every experiment has to match the time of the school (periods, weekly schedule, holidays); -	the processes - either individual or social - develop over time; -	observation is carried out over time. The above are three instances of ‘physical time’, the linear sequence of moments measured by the clock (Varela, 1999 a. This physical time, which the observer can read on his clock, is in recent <b>videopapers</b> (Carraher et al., 1999) emphasised by the timeline where different media such as video, text, graphics and audio files are synchronised. Yet, Varela himself calls our attention on the existence of an ‘inner time’, that gives rise to human temporality, centred on the present and manifesting as a threefold unity of the just-past and the about-to-occur. This inner time is mostly individual and unconscious. However its features may be inferred from external traces (linguistic expressions, gestures, metaphors). Moreover, it may be partially shaped from outside (e. g. by the teacher), so that the learner becomes conscious of the possibility of moulding it in problem solving. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that: 1) 	both kinds of time are relevant in the research in Mathematics Education, when the focus is on the processes of teaching and learning mathematics; 2) 	a further finer specification of both is needed, that requires the introduction of several theoretical constructs related to human temporality and that introduces a lot of methodological problems concerning the relationships between them...|$|R
