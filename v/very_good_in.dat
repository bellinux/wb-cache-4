For instance, in the UK, between 2003 and 2005 there were 32,100 ectopic pregnancies resulting in 10 maternal deaths (meaning that 1 in 3,210 women with an ectopic pregnancy died).|$|E

500|$|In addition, safety Jamie Silva {{would have}} to play a strong game to support the Boston College cornerback {{replacing}} the injured Tribble. Silva, an All-ACC defensive selection, led the team with five interceptions and was <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> moving up to stop the run as well. On the defensive line, defensive end Nick Larkin was a quarterfinalist for the Lott Trophy, an award given to the defensive player with the most [...] "defensive impact" [...] nationally.|$|E
500|$|In Bright Lights, Big City, Fox {{played a}} fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying {{with alcohol and}} drugs. The film {{received}} mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in The Washington Post criticizing Fox by claiming that [...] "he was the wrong actor for the job". Meanwhile, Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: [...] "Fox is <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> the central role (he has a long drunken monologue {{that is the best}} thing he has ever done in a movie)". During the shooting of Bright Lights, Big City, Fox co-starred again with Tracy Pollan, his on-screen girlfriend from Family Ties.|$|E
500|$|Allen {{was born}} in Trenton, New Jersey on February4,1989. His mother is Paula Allen and his father, Dave Allen, is a truck driver. When he was nine years old, Lavoy moved to Morrisville, Pennsylvania, and {{struggled}} to make friends in his new surroundings. He did not play much organized basketball until eighth grade. In an interview, Allen admitted he was not <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> the beginning, and focused on passing the ball to a better teammate. His initial motivation was how schoolchildren mocked him for his height yet {{not being able to}} dunk. [...] "I could barely jump over the Sunday paper," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|Although the XPTBH-2 met most of {{its design}} {{specifications}} and was rated overall <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> flight testing, it {{failed to meet the}} contractual requirements for top speed and attack speed. In addition, the U.S. Navy did not consider a seagoing torpedo-bomber to be an aircraft for which there was an operational requirement; the fact that as a floatplane the aircraft was restricted to operation from water was also considered a negative, while the aircraft's [...] "three-in-one" [...] role led it to be viewed as a jack of all trades, purpose-designed aircraft for each role being considered superior. The company, however, blamed Navy politics for the lack of a production order.|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was cast}} as a short-tempered tattooed man with soon-to-be ex-wife Claire Bloom in the science fiction picture The Illustrated Man (1969). The film was a {{critical}} and commercial failure, and Ray Bradbury, who wrote the screenplay, said: [...] "Rod was <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> it, but it wasn't a good film...the script was terrible". Steiger had better luck alongside Bloom later that year in Peter Hall's British drama Three into Two Won't Go, playing an Irishman who cheats on his wife with a young hiker. It was entered into the Berlin International Film Festival and became the 19th most popular film at the UK box office in 1969.|$|E
500|$|Over 1982–1983 Reyne {{was filmed}} with Australian actresses Rebecca Gilling and Wendy Hughes in the {{television}} miniseries Return to Eden, which was screened in September 1983. For Reyne's role of playboy tennis professional Greg Marsden, {{he was given the}} 1984 [...] "Most Popular New Talent Award" [...] at the TV Week Logie Awards. Reyne later declared he was not <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> the part, declining many acting offers since. During breaks in filming, the singer accepted an offer from Paul Christie (Mondo Rock) and Kevin Borich to join their part-time band The Party Boys with Harvey James from Sherbet and Graham Bidstrup from The Angels. The group played a short run of shows around Sydney venues and played covers exclusively. The resultant album, Live at Several 21sts, peaked at No. 9 on the national chart.|$|E

500|$|On October 5, 2015, Grant {{was signed}} by the Island Storm and would return to Canada for the 2015–16 season. He would join the Storm for {{training}} camp in early December. Team head coach Joe Salerno commented on Grant: [...] "Since seeing {{him for the first}} time back in 2013, he has been a guy on my radar, someone I believed could be very, <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> our league if put in the right system and situation." [...] Grant was also praised by Salerno for his experience in the ACC in his college years. In his debut for the Storm, Grant recorded a double-double, with 24 points and 10 assists. Grant started 23 of his 34 regular season games, led the Storm in assists and assists per game with 157 and 4.6 respectively, and posted averages of 11.6 points, 1.7 rebounds and 0.8 steals per game.|$|E
500|$|The petition's {{claims were}} also {{taken up by}} the UK's {{independent}} telecommunications regulator, Ofcom. The body investigated official protests made by several Caracas residents. The concerns largely focused on footage of the residents' attending a neighborhood meeting in June 2002, which was positioned in the film as a prelude to the April coup attempt. The residents said that the filmmakers had used footage of them without consent and that the film had misrepresented their views. In September 2005, Ofcom provisionally ruled that it had not upheld the complaints, citing the BBC's internal review and rebuttal as grounds. A subsequent appeal by the residents was unsuccessful. Two weeks after Ofcom's initial ruling, the BBC announced it had closed the complaint and that no further investigations would take place. Stoneman believed the BBC had overreacted, saying its guardedness was merely a product of being a frequent victim of press attacks on its ethos. Fraser said, [...] "The film was <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> many respects, but also misleading." [...] He believed the filmmakers considered Chávez honorable, but having written a book on Peronism was more skeptical himself. Fraser concluded, [...] "I still think it's a good film, because of the coup sequence. It should be seen as a Venezuelan West Wing—biased, of course, but highly entertaining." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Bob Ezrin {{had worked}} with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Kiss, as well as {{producing}} Peter Gabriel's debut solo album. At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend Lady Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album. From the start, Waters {{made it very clear}} who was in charge: [...] "You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit". [...] Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [...] A 40-page script was presented {{to the rest of the}} band, with positive results: [...] "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album." [...] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or gestalt character named Pink. Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer, [...] "Ezrin was <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them." [...] Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour co-writing [...] "Comfortably Numb", [...] "Run Like Hell", and [...] "Young Lust", and Ezrin co-writing [...] "The Trial".|$|E
