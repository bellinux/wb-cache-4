S., including 27 attendees from 8 countries outside the U. S. The contributions and sacrifices made by foreign speakers is genuinely appreciated and has, as always, added greatly to the diversity of the conference. As most of you know, the council 2 ̆ 7 s primary goal is fostering education and advancement in the field of vertebrate pest management. We have always tried to draw noted experts to present a broad range of information on animals, large and small, from areas around the world. Our program chairpersons, John O 2 ̆ 7 Brian and Gary Simmons, have accomplished this goal by providing a new program with a variety of information regarding development of new materials, techniques and improvements in integrated pest management. In addition, we have also listened to environmental and regulatory issues and have been challenged to consider new and varying public values, attitudes and philosophies covering a very broad spectrum of vertebrate pest control and <b>Animal</b> Rights <b>vs.</b> <b>Animal</b> <b>Welfare</b> issues. The council also tries to provide a forum for networking between professionals with all levels of expertise. It is for this reason the commercial exhibit and poster presentation area were used to offer refreshments at breaks and the complimentary buffet reception. I feel these changes were successful thanks to Paul Gorenzel, the Commercial Displays Chair, and Lew Davis, who once again did an outstanding job of handling arrangements for us...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> {{definitions}} and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> assessment. <b>Animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is a prolonged mental state, resulting from how the animal experiences its environment over time. There are different methods for <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> assessment. The four basic criteria for <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> assessment are feeding, housing, health and appropriate behavior. Therefore, criteria {{used to assess}} <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> are not direct measures of the mental state but only parameters {{that need to be}} interpreted in terms of welfare. The immediate housing environment and feeding may influence <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> either positively, when most of the important requirements are respected, or negatively, when animals are exposed to various stress factors and unpleasant emotions that contribute to animal disease, injuries or inappropriate behavior. Therefore, <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is a unique link between housing conditions, feeding and watering on one side, and animal health status and behavior on the other side...|$|R

With this transition, some changes occurred for those who work as <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors. The aim {{for this study was}} to examine farmers' view on the transition between the municipalities and County Administrative board, in order to compare the two authorities. I have also studied the farmers view about <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors' knowledge, both theoretical and practical. The questionnaire also included questions about farmers' view on <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. I choose to interview farmers from various places in Dalecarlia County, so that I would get all the municipalities represented. The questionnaire was sent to 40 farmers, which 26 chose to participate in my survey. The results of my questionnaire showed a lack of introduction to the farmer, 38 percent of the farmers received no initial information. 62 percent of the farmers did not want <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls to be pre-notified. The overall opinion of the farmers was that they always should take care of their animals well, therefore they do not need <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls to be pre-notified. The County Administrative welfare inspector was considered to have a better knowledge than the municipality's <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector had, although the difference was barely noticeable with 22 to 21 pleased farmers. Farmers were also pleased with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector’s practical experience, 50 percent were pleased with the municipality´s <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector and 58 percent were pleased with the County Administrative <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector. Overall, the farmers were very satisfied with the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector’s ways to deal with <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> controls. Twice as many indicated that they were dissatisfied with the municipality´s <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector than the County Administrative welfare inspector; as they do not take into account the farmers' thoughts and opinions. 81 percent of the farmers were satisfied with the County Administrative <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors work because they considered the farmer's thoughts and opinions. One of my questions was how the farmers perceived the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. Half of the farmers responded that they had knowledge of the legislation surrounding their species. In my study, 18 out of the 26 farmers perceive that the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation is at an acceptable level. About half of the farmers had suggestions on how contact between farmers and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector could be done better.

As a result, many countries are reconsidering the way <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> {{is embedded in the}} legislation and rules for housing and care of animals. This requires general agreement of what <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is. Unfortunately, the current science of <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is less scientific than what has been claimed. In our view, it is overly guided by anthropocentric thinking about how animals ought to be handled and neglects the latest concept of physiology: `The Allostasis Concept¿. Allostasis, which means stability through change, has the potential to replace homeostasis as the core model of physiological regulation.

40|$|Purpose ¿ The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{insights}} into the rationale of Dutch pig farmers concerning <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and animal-friendly production. It aims to show the interrelations between farmers' production logic, their ideas about good farming and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and the characteristics of Dutch pig production. Design/methodology/approach ¿ In total, 62 Dutch pig farmers, participating in quality assurance schemes with different focuses on <b>animal</b> <b>welfare,</b> were interviewed about <b>animal</b> <b>welfare,</b> legislation, quality assurance schemes, and possibilities for animal-friendly production. Findings ¿ Farmers' attitudes towards <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and the implementation of <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> measures follow their understanding of good farming practices, which in turn are strongly influenced by the rationale of the market in which they operate. Two groups can be distinguished. Farmers operating in markets that focus on price and production-efficiency tend to define <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> in terms of animal health and optimal zoo-technical performance. Farmers operating in markets with a broader sense of quality, which incorporates values such as naturalness, <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and care for the environment, define <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> in terms of the room the animals have to express natural behaviour. Originality/value ¿ This article provides insights into the perception of Dutch pig farmers about <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and their readiness to change towards more animal-friendly production methods. It points to the interrelations between <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> attitudes and behaviour, farmers' perception of good farming and the production logic of the farm. These interrelated influences should be borne in mind by policy makers and researchers seeking to raise welfare levels in pig production...|$|R

40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> {{movement}} 2 ̆ 2 {{has been}} gaining impetus recently in Western Europe and the U. S. Concern about the moral status and treatment of animals in research laboratories and on confinement farms has brought increasing public activism, a burgeoning of <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> organizations, and legislative deliberations. Yet sociologists have failed to place the movement on their research agenda. Despite sociological relevance from a social movement perspective, the potential for farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation that will impact the livestock industry lends the phenomenon special important for rural sociology;This study provides data {{on the status of}} the farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> issue in Iowa. Mail survey data were collected in 1985 from representative samples of rural and urban Iowans. Participants in the study included 536 farm residents, 221 open-country nonfarm residents, and 324 city residents. Factors hypothesized to be important determinants of support for farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation were age, education, gender, residence, environmentalism, moral orientation toward animals, perception of a farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> problem, and support for the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> movement. These arguements were tested using a linear structural relationship (LISREL) model, with multiple indicators of the key variables;Residence was found to be an important predictor of farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> attitudes, while age, education and gender contributed relatively little to this explanation. Urban residence was associated with a moral orientation toward animals, perception of a farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> problem, and support for farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation. The next highest levels on these attitudinal dimensions were from open-country nonfarm respondents. Farm residents collectively displayed the most conservative stance toward the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> issues. These findings of residential differences suggest the potential for considerable public turmoil along residential lines, in Iowa and elsewhere, over farm <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> issues...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we first give an {{overview}} of different interpretations of <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> and their relation to different lay and expert approaches to <b>animal</b> <b>welfare.</b> The importance of values to <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> is discussed and confronted {{with the role of}} science and the scientific ideals of value-freedom and objectivity.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate what farmers view is on the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspections done by regional Swedish authorities as well as the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors work. The study investigated whether or not there were any differences between different counties in Sweden. There were also questions asked to see what animal producers thought could change in the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors work so it would benefit them. The study was conducted using a telephone interview questionnaire. Answers from 36 animal producers were gathered from four different counties; Skåne, Halland, Dalarna and Östergötland. The main results were that more than half of the animal producers are of the opinion that <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors have inadequate experience of practical work with farm animals. It was also shown that animal producers find that <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspector have a better theoretical knowledge of <b>animals</b> and <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> legislation than they have of practical experience with animals. The animal producers in the study seem to be satisfied with how <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspectors treated them when they were conducting the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspection. Some of the animal producers thought that the <b>animal</b> <b>welfare</b> inspections need to be more standardized between different inspectors and between the different counties.
