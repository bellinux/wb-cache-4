5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black students from the city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white students from the county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfer</b> program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfer</b> program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has been that the program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} altruism on <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers</b> and government redistribution in a simple model: two jobs of different productivity are assigned by chance to two individuals. Ex ante the individuals are identical, ex post they have different incomes. The {{first part of the}} paper examines <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers</b> determined ex post or agreed upon ex ante in the absence of altruism. In the second part, the influence of altruism is examined. Altruism is modelled as a pure public good: the minimum consumption (or income, since there is only one consumption good). Both individuals can contribute to its provision, one person by earning wage income, the other by <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers.</b> The ex ante solutions generally lead to higher expected welfare but create several incentive problems. Only lump-sum transfers are considered. Altruism, redistributive taxation, social insurance, public good, <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{members of the}} Missouri General Assembly and Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon again began attacking the {{desegregation}} plan {{on the grounds of}} its costs. Nixon proposed that instead of spending money to transfer students, funds would be better spent improving derelict conditions in city schools, a view supported by St. Louis's first black mayor, Freeman Bosley, Jr.. After another legal challenge to the plan in early 1996 (based on recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings), the court ordered a review of the plan and a second settlement agreement. A settlement plan developed in the Missouri legislature called for reduced state money for the program and a focus only on funding magnet schools in the city and the <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfer</b> program. All but one of the suburban districts agreed to renew the agreement on these terms (Ladue School District was the exception), and in 1999, the renewed settlement was established. However, under the 1999 agreement, school districts have been permitted to withdraw from the <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfer</b> program starting in 2002, and two districts have done so (Lindbergh School District and Pattonville School District). A five-year extension of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfer</b> program was approved in 2007, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 2013–2014 school year in participating districts.|$|E
25|$|Ze'evi later {{advocated}} the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million {{residents of the}} West Bank and Gaza to Arab nations. He believed this could be accomplished by making life difficult, so they would relocate on their own, through {{use of military force}} during wartime, or by agreement with Arab nations. In July 1987, Ze'evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfer</b> {{and the only way to}} make peace with the Arabs. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Ze'evi proposed transferring Palestinians to the east side of the Jordan River to serve as a buffer zone against any Iraqi attempt to attack Israel.|$|E

Hobson left London on 15 August 1839 and was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor in Sydney on 14 January, finally arriving in the Bay of Islands on 29 January 1840.

40|$|The {{increasing}} social {{demand for}} quality in public {{services and the}} universality of it, {{in contrast to the}} decrease in public revenues in recent years, make the resources derived from the <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers</b> of the federal government to play a fundamental role in the execution of projects of the state executive power. In a state in which investment resources depend on <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers,</b> a lack of planning of funding and execution, with the absence of a public tool for monitoring and controlling these resources, lead to financial and social losses that are difficult to repair. The main objective {{of this article is to}} propose a routine and a management tool for monitoring, in a timely manner, the budgetary, financial and physical execution of all phases of the projects within the scope of the state executive power, executed with funds from <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers.</b> This qualitative research based on a case study is exploratory and descriptive. The main results are: a) the identification of agreements in execution and the sum of resources returned in the last years, b) the proposal of a routine and monitoring tool for the public power.

40|$|Abstract: We {{compare the}} impact of {{mandatory}} against <b>voluntary</b> ownership <b>transfer</b> on stock price informativeness using the unique research setting provided by the Split Share Structure Reform in China. Ownership transfers from state to private entity are expected to improve corporate governance, which in turn reduce managerial incentives to withhold value-relevant information to outside investor. However, we show that <b>voluntary</b> <b>transfers</b> initiated by firms are associated with significantly greater increases in stock price informativeness than mandatory transfers required by the Split Share Structure Reform. This implies that firm incentives are more effective in improving corporate governance than regulatory intervention...|$|R

In particular, we show that in a simple two country model and for a plausible set of economic parameter values, a currency area is optimal...|$|R
