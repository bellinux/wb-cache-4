Any kind of pedal assist, electric bike, scooter, moped or vehicle which has any form of propulsion, whether in full or as assist, other than human power, must be approved as either a car, motorcycle, <b>van,</b> <b>truck,</b> bus or similar. This makes tilt-controlled two-wheel personal vehicles, and pedelecs illegal in all practical ways, as they cannot be registered as a motor cycle.|$|E
50|$|In economics, cargo or freight are {{goods or}} produce being {{conveyed}} - generally for commercial gain - by ship, boat, or aircraft, although {{the term is}} now often extended to cover all types of freight, including that carried by train, <b>van,</b> <b>truck,</b> or intermodal container. The term cargo is also used in case of goods in the cold-chain, because the perishable inventory is always in transit towards a final end-use, {{even when it is}} held in cold storage or other similar climate-controlled facility.|$|E
50|$|During the 1920s {{the company}} also marketed a variety of {{delivery}} vehicles based around motorcycle combinations. A van, a small <b>van,</b> <b>truck</b> and box carrier were advertised until 1929. They were powered by Dunelt’s own 499cc single cylinder engine. The three-wheeler commercial vehicle market was a difficult one for all motorcycle manufacturers, and Dunelt {{did not have the}} success they wished for in this area. From 1929, most of the combinations were discontinued and, by 1930, they also stopped producing their own engines. Sturmey-Archer and Villiers units were used instead and, from 1933, they also fitted Rudge Python and J.A.P. engines.|$|E

50|$|By 1982 the BL Cars Ltd {{division}} renamed itself Austin Rover Group, {{shortly before}} {{the launch of the}} Austin Maestro and Michael Edwardes was replaced by Harold Musgrove as chairman and chief executive. The emergence of the Austin Rover brand effectively {{put an end to the}} separate Austin-Morris and Jaguar-Rover-Triumph divisions, since by this time, Jaguar now resided in a separate company called Jaguar Car Holdings, and this was later de-merged from BL completely and privatised in 1984. That same year, with both the Morris Ital and the Triumph Acclaim being discontinued, their respective brands were effectively shelved, leaving only the Austin and Rover marques, whilst Land Rover moved into the Freight Rover Group alongside the light trucks division. After the divestment of Unipart and the <b>van,</b> <b>truck</b> and bus divisions in 1987 (see below), leaving just two subsidiaries - Austin Rover (volume cars) and Land Rover (SUVs) this essentially remained the basic structure of BL and subsequently the Rover Group until the 2000 break-up.|$|E
50|$|In May 1967 the Compagno {{received}} a minor facelift, with new head- and taillights {{and a new}} grille. The fender pressings were also subtly altered so as to streamline production. A Super Deluxe version of the four-door was added, while the Spider and GT gained front disc brakes. Last amongst the news was the 1000 GT Injection, with mechanical fuel injection albeit no more power than the existing twin-carb version. In April 1968 the front grille was altered again, with black trim for the Spider and GT. The Super Deluxe gained chrome trim at the rear. In April 1969 the succeeding Daihatsu Consorte appeared, using the 1.0 engine and the Toyota Publica KP30 body. Daihatsu decided to depend on Toyota for designing compact cars from now on. The Consorte was initially only available as a two-door sedan, and while the <b>Van,</b> <b>Truck,</b> and Convertibles were not replaced the four-door Super Deluxe remained in production until January 1970 so as to meet existing orders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a vision based monitoring system which (1) classifies targets (vehicles and humans) based on shape appearance, (2) estimates their colors, and (3) detects special targets, from images of color video cameras set up toward a street. The categories of targets were classified into {human, sedan, <b>van,</b> <b>truck,</b> mule (golf cart for workers), and others), and their colors were classified into {{the groups of}} {redorange-yellow, green, blue-lightblue, white-silver-gray, darkblue-darkgray-black, and darkred-darkorange). On the detection of special targets, the test was carried out setting {FedEx van, UPS van, Police Car) as target and yielded desirable results. The system tracks the target, independently conducts category classification and color estimation, extracts the result with the largest probability throughout the tracking sequence from each result, and provides the data as the final decision. For classification and special target detection, we cooperatively used a stochastic linear discrimination method (linear discriminant analysis: LDA) and nonlinear decision rule (K-Nearest Neighbor rule: K-NN). ...|$|E

40|$|RAILS. ” A newly {{developed}} aesthetic bridge rail, the Type 90, was tested {{in accordance with}} NCHRP Report 350. The bridge rail is a steel post and beam system atop a concrete curb with a reverse slope of 5. 2 ° from vertical on the traffic side. The “reverse-slope ” raises the reaction point of impacting vehicles, reducing the potential for vehicle roll. The concrete curb is 550 mm high and the total height of the rail is 925 mm. The steel rail consists of a 254 x 102 x 6. 4 -mm tube steel beams with 178 x 127 x 7. 9 -mm tube steel posts spaced 3 m apart. The barrier tested was about 24 m long and was constructed at the Caltrans Dynamic Test Facility in West Sacramento, California.

40|$|Multi-category object {{detection}} in aerial {{images is}} an important task for many applications such as surveillance, tracking or search and rescue tasks. In recent years, deep learning approaches using features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNN) significantly improved the detection accuracy on detection benchmark datasets compared to traditional approaches based on hand-crafted features as used for object detection in aerial images. However, these approaches are not transferable one to one on aerial images as the used network architectures have an insufficient resolution of feature maps for handling small instances. This consequently results in poor localization accuracy or missed detections as the network architectures are explored and optimized for datasets that considerably differ from aerial images in particular in object size and image fraction occupied by an object. In this work, we propose a deep neural network derived from the Faster R-CNN approach for multi- category object detection in aerial images. We show how the detection accuracy can be improved by replacing the network architecture by an architecture especially designed for handling small object sizes. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different parameters of the detection framework on the detection accuracy for small objects. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our network for object detection in aerial images by comparing our network to traditional baseline approaches and deep learning based approaches on the publicly available DLR 3 K Munich Vehicle Aerial Image Dataset that comprises multiple object classes such as car, <b>van,</b> <b>truck,</b> bus and camper...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{computer}} vision system for daytime vehicle detection and localization, an essential step {{in the development of}} several types of advanced driver assistance systems. It has a reduced processing time and high accuracy thanks to the combination of vehicle detection with lane-markings estimation and temporal tracking of both vehicles and lane markings. Concerning vehicle detection, our main contribution is a frame scanning process that inspects images according to the geometry of image formation, and with an Adaboost-based detector that is robust to the variability in the different vehicle types (car, <b>van,</b> <b>truck)</b> and lighting conditions. In addition, we propose a new method to estimate the most likely three-dimensional locations of vehicles on the road ahead. With regards to the lane-markings estimation component, we have two main contributions. First, we employ a different image feature to the other commonly used edges: we use ridges, which are better suited to this problem. Second, we adapt RANSAC, a generic robust estimation method, to fit a parametric model of a pair of lane markings to the image features. We qualitatively assess our vehicle detection system in sequences captured on several road types and under very different lighting conditions. The processed videos are available on a web page associated with this paper. A quantitative evaluation of the system has shown quite accurate results (a low number of false positives and negatives) at a reasonable computation time.
