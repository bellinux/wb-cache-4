25|$|Although this stork shows many common {{courtship}} {{displays in}} storks, these behaviours seem to omit {{some of the}} vocal and <b>visual</b> <b>features</b> {{to be replaced by}} an augmented tactile element. This may be yet another reflection of this stork's adaptation to nesting on the ground; in that the subdued visual displays will less likely attract the attention of predators that detect prey by sight at close range; and although loud vocalisations would be useful for mates to attract each other's attention, this could also render them more conspicuous to potential ground predators.|$|E

25|$|Six {{years after}} the release of the final Republic serial, Dick Tracy headlined four feature films, {{produced}} by RKO Radio Pictures. Dick Tracy (a.k.a. Dick Tracy, Detective) (1945) was followed by Dick Tracy vs. Cueball in 1946, both with Morgan Conway as Tracy. Ralph Byrd returned for the last two features, both released in 1947: Dick Tracy's Dilemma and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome. Gruesome is probably the best known of the four, with the villain portrayed by Boris Karloff. All four movies had many of the <b>visual</b> <b>features</b> associated with film noir: dramatic, shadowy photographic compositions, with many exterior scenes filmed at night (at the RKO Encino movie ranch). Lyle Latell co-starred in all four films as Pat Patton. Anne Jeffreys played Tess Trueheart in the first two, succeeded by Kay Christopher and finally Anne Gwynne; Ian Keith joined the cast as the actor Vitamin Flintheart for two films; Joseph Crehan played Chief Brandon. RKO stocked the films with familiar faces, creating a veritable rogues' gallery of characters: Mike Mazurki as Splitface, Dick Wessel as Cueball, Esther Howard as Filthy Flora, Jack Lambert as hook-handed villain The Claw; baldheaded, pop-eyed Milton Parsons, mild-mannered Byron Foulger, dangerous Trevor Bardette, pockmarked, gently sinister Skelton Knaggs.|$|E
25|$|Both hemispheres of {{the brain}} make a {{contribution}} to the McGurk effect. They work together to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has privileged access to the right hemisphere and words to the left hemisphere. In people that have had callosotomies done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower. In people with lesions to the left hemisphere {{of the brain}}, <b>visual</b> <b>features</b> often {{play a critical role in}} speech and language therapy. People with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls. Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people. There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if left hemisphere damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception. In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect. Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible. Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new class of <b>visual</b> text <b>features</b> that are based on text in cameraphone images.

Our experiments with image that contain text show that the new <b>visual</b> text <b>feature</b> based image matching pipeline performs on par or better than a conventional image feature based pipeline while requiring less than 10 bits per feature.

2500|$|Cattle can {{recognize}} familiar individuals. Visual individual recognition {{is a more}} complex mental process than visual discrimination. [...] It requires the recollection of the learned idiosyncratic identity of an individual that has been previously encountered {{and the formation of}} a mental representation. By using 2-dimensional images of the heads of one cow (face, profiles, ¾ views), all the tested heifers showed individual recognition of familiar and unfamiliar individuals from their own breed. [...] Furthermore, almost all the heifers recognized unknown individuals from different breeds, although this was achieved with greater difficulty. [...] Individual recognition was most difficult when the <b>visual</b> <b>features</b> of the breed being tested were quite different from the breed in the image, for example, the breed being tested had no spots whereas the image was of a spotted breed.|$|E
2500|$|The attention-free {{hypothesis}} soon {{emerged to}} challenge early models. The initial {{basis for the}} attention-free hypothesis was the finding that in visual search, basic <b>visual</b> <b>features</b> of objects immediately and automatically pop out to the person doing the visual search. Further experiments seemed to support this: Potter (as cited by Evans & Treisman, 2005) showed that high-order representations can be accessed rapidly from natural scenes presented at rates of up to 10 per second. Additionally, Thorpe, Fize & Marlot (as cited by Evans & Treisman) discovered that humans and primates can categorize natural images (i.e. of animals in everyday indoor and outdoor scenes) rapidly and accurately even after brief exposures. [...] The basic idea in these studies is that exposure to each individual scene is too brief for attentional processes to occur, yet human beings are able to interpret and categorize these scenes.|$|E
30|$|Audio-visual speech {{recognition}} which uses dynamic visual lip and audio {{information has been}} studied as a technique for robust {{speech recognition}} in noisy environments. In audio-visual speech recognition, there are three priminary integration methods: early integration [7], which connects the audio feature vector with the <b>visual</b> <b>feature</b> vector; late integration [8], which weighs {{the likelihood of the}} result obtained by a separate process for audio and visual signals, and synthetic integration [9], which calculates the product of the output probability in each state. A discrete cosine transform (DCT) is widely used as a <b>visual</b> <b>feature</b> in audio-speech recognition. Previously, we have proposed audio-visual speech recognition using a <b>visual</b> <b>feature</b> extracted from an active appearance model [10, 11]. The feature contains shape information that expresses lip movement and texture information that expresses intensity changes, such as tooth.|$|R
