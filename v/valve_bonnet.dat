50|$|Although showy {{polished}} brass covers over {{safety valves}} {{had been a}} feature of steam locomotives since Stephenson's day, the only railway to maintain this tradition into the era of pop valves was the GWR, with their distinctive tapered brass safety <b>valve</b> <b>bonnets</b> and copper-capped chimneys.|$|R
5000|$|After {{years of}} running, a costly {{overhaul}} of the locomotive was declined by the National Railway Museum. In part, {{this was due to}} the fact that since its second renovation, a second class-member King Edward I had been restored for mainline operation. Further, the higher ballast beds now in place on the Western Region since the early 1980s, to allow for the high speed running of the InterCity 125 train sets, had greatly reduced the running-level loading gauge of the former GWR mainline - especially under bridges - to 13 ft. To hence enable mainline running of a [...] "King" [...] class, resulted in the need to cut-down and reduce the height of the original GWR built chimney, cab and safety <b>valve</b> <b>bonnets</b> by , as had been done on the restoration of King Edward I.

The replica loco was completed in December 1982 and displayed outside Steamtown in January 1983 (where it was constructed), before being transported by road to Windsor on 12 January 1983 and arriving on 14 January.The main frames, footplate, 'boiler', smokebox, cab and splashers were fabricated by Babcock's of Tipton. The tender was modified from an LBSCR C2x tender. Parts from a GWR tender, {{that came from the}} Dumbleton Hall Preservation Society, were used to provide the wheels for the front bogie and the real wheels. The top halves of the driving wheels do not exist, and were cast from 2 quarters, being bolted together to make a half, and the driving wheels also don't sit on the rail, so the loco could be wheeled into position on its front bogie and rear wheels.Some boiler fittings were obtained from the Great Western Society and sandblasted, and the dome and safety <b>valve</b> <b>bonnet</b> were made by Newcastle Metal Spinners.Tussaud's fitted smoke and steam generators, so steam was emitted from the cab, whistles, safety valves and smoke from the chimney.

40|$|The ASB reviews all structures, systems, and {{components}} (SSC) provided {{to support the}} reactor facility that require protection from internally generated missiles (outside containment) to assure conformance {{with the requirements of}} General Design Criterion 4. The review concerns missiles that could result from in-plant compo-nent overspeed failures and high-pressure system ruptures. The ASB reviews the functional operations and performance requirements for all structures, systems, {{and components}} outside containment and identifies the SSC that are necessary for the safe shutdown of the reactor facility and the SSC whose fail-ure could result in a significant release of radioactivity. All SSC will be re-viewed to assure adequate protection from internally generated missiles if the SSC are necessary to perform functions required for attaining and maintaining-a safe shutdown condition or if the SSC are necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The review of internally generated missile protection includes the following: structures, systems or portion of systems, and components that require protection from internally generated missiles are identified; pressurized components and systems are reviewed to determine their potential for generating missiles such as <b>valve</b> <b>bonnets</b> and hardware retaining bolts, relief valve parts, and instrument wells; high speed rotating machinery are reviewed to determine their potential for generating missiles from component overspeed or failure, such as failure of the pump itself (resulting from seizure), pump or component parts, and rotating seg-ments (e. g., impellers and fan blades). If safety-related systems or components are located in areas containing nonsafety-related SSC, then the nonsafety-related SSC are reviewed with respect to interna...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Diaphragm {{gas meter}} is a {{specialized}} flow meter that measures {{the volume of}} fuel gas such as natural gas and coal gas. <b>Valve</b> <b>bonnet</b> and valve seat are the key parts of diaphragm gas meter, which compose the main factors of its metering error. The widely detecting ways are direct observational method and pneumatic pressure method. Direct observational method only realizes the qualitative detection with lacking science. Pneumatic pressure method can realize the quantitative detection, but with low accuracy and bad reliability. In order to evaluate the gas tightness of diaphragm gas meter valve accurately, surface texture method was adopted. Firstly, the surface roughness mathematical model of valve working face was established. A fast Gaussian filtering convolution algorithm was proposed based on the symmetry of Gaussian density function. Secondly, the working face of gas valve on the high-precision air floating stage was scanned by the chromatic confocal sensor. And the roughness profile of valve working face was got through the fast Gaussian filter when the cut-off wavelength was 0. 8 mm. Then the roughness parameters could be calculated with MATLAB by setting the sampling length and evaluation length. The results show that surface roughness has a difference of over 1 µm between the qualified and unqualified valve. Besides, {{there is a little}} deviation of below 9 % between the experimental value and the stylus profilometer measuring value, which has no influence on the judging result of qualified or unqualified about the measured workpiece. The gas tightness performance of gas valve can be judged by measuring surface roughness of its working face, which can provide a scientific basis for evaluating the quality of diaphragm gas meter valve in a quantitative way. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project will {{transfer}} metallic SNF {{from the}} Hanford 105 K-East and 105 K-West Basins to safe interim storage in the Canister Storage Building in the 200 Area. The initial basis for design, fabrication, installation, {{and operation of}} the fuel removal systems was that the basin leak rate which could result from a postulated accident condition would not be excessive relative to reasonable recovery operations. However, an additional potential K Basin water leak path is through the K Basin drain valves. Three twelve-inch drain valves {{are located in the}} main basin bays along the north wall. Five four-inch drain valves are located in the north and south loadout pits (NLOP and SLOP), the weasel pit, the technical viewing pit, and the discharge chute pit. The sumps containing the valves are filled with concrete which covers the drain valve body. Visual observations indicate that only the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the twelve-inch drain valve and that much less of the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the five four-inch drain valves. It was recognized, however, that damage of the drain <b>valve</b> <b>bonnet</b> or stem during a seismic initiating event could provide a potential K Basin water leak path. The objectives of this analysis are to: (1) evaluate the likelihood of damaging the three twelve-inch drain valves located along the north wall of the main basin and the five four-inch drain valves located in the pits from a seismic initiating event, and (2) determine the likelihood of exceeding a specific consequence (initial leak rate) from a damaged valve. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where each variable is modeled using available information and engineering judgement. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution (probability density function). Uncertainty exists because of the inherent randomness associated with the distribution of values that a variable may assume, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge concerning a variable. Engineering judgement and technical information are used to develop the variable probability density functions, but the bounds of the probability density function are based on physical limitations. The uncertainty, described by probability distributions, is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve'') ...|$|E
