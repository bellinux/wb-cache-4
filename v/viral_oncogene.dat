2500|$|Vertebrate {{genes and}} {{proteins}} have names (typically strings of words) and symbols, which are short identifiers (typically 3 to 8 characters). For example, the gene cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 has the HGNC symbol CTLA4. These symbols are usually, but not always, coined by contraction or acronymic abbreviation of the name. They are pseudo-acronyms, however, {{in the sense}} that they are complete identifiers by themselves—short names, essentially. They are synonymous with (rather than standing for) the gene/protein name (or any of its aliases), regardless of whether the initial letters [...] "match". For example, the symbol for the gene v-akt murine thymoma <b>viral</b> <b>oncogene</b> homolog 1, which is AKT1, cannot be said to be an acronym for the name, and neither can any of its various synonyms, which include AKT, PKB, PRKBA, and RAC. Thus, the relationship of a gene symbol to the gene name is functionally the relationship of a nickname to a formal name (both are complete identifiers)—it is not the relationship of an acronym to its expansion. In this sense they are similar to the symbols for units of measurement in the SI system (such as km for the kilometre), in that they can be viewed as true logograms rather than just abbreviations. Sometimes the distinction is academic, but not always. Although it is not wrong to say that [...] "VEGFA" [...] is an acronym standing for [...] "vascular endothelial growth factor A", just as it is not wrong that [...] "km" [...] is an abbreviation for [...] "kilometre", there is more to the formality of symbols than those statements capture.|$|E

A hallmark of HPV-associated cervical carcinoma is loss of the expression of the viral E 2 protein, often by disruption of E 2 -encoding gene. We showed previously that reintroduction of E 2 in HPV 18 -associated cervical carcinoma cells induces cell cycle arrest in G(1) because of the transcriptional repression of the <b>viral</b> <b>oncogenes</b> E 6 and E 7 and concomitant reactivation of the p 53 and pRb pathways.

Surprisingly, E 2 repressed a subset of E 2 F-regulated mitotic genes in an E 6 /E 7 -dependent pathway. This was corroborated by the observation that E 2 delayed mitotic progression, suggesting the involvement of a mitotic pathway in HPV carcinogenesis.

In tumour cell lines proto-oncogenes are activated by either quantitative or qualitative changes in gene structure: activation of these genes was originally {{thought to be}} a necessary primary event in carcinogenesis, but activated cellular <b>oncogenes,</b> unlike <b>viral</b> <b>oncogenes,</b> do not transform normal cells in culture. In experimental models cooperation between two oncogenes can induce transformation of early passage cells, and this has become the basis of an hypothesis for multistep carcinogenesis. Proto-oncogene products also show sequence homology to various components in the mitogenic pathway (growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transducing proteins and nuclear proteins), and it has been postulated that they may cause deregulation of the various components of this pathway. In human tumours single or multiple oncogene activation occurs. The pattern of oncogene activation in common solid malignancies is not consistent within any one class of tumour, nor is it uniform between classes, with three exceptions. In neuroblastoma, breast cancer, and perhaps in lung cancer there is relatively consistent activation of N-myc, neu, and c-myc/N-myc, respectively. Amplification of these genes generally correlates with poor prognosis.

40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>oncogenes</b> are {{responsible}} for oncogenesis resulting from persistent virus infection.

Expression of the viral E 6 and E 7 oncogenes in papillomavirus, E 1 A and E 1 B oncogenes in adenovirus, large T and small t antigen in polyomavirus, and Tax oncogene in HTLV- 1 are regulated by alternative RNA splicing. However, this regulation is only partially understood. DNA tumor viruses also encode noncoding RNAs, including viral microRNAs, that disturb normal cell functions. Among the determined viral microRNA precursors, EBV encodes 25 from two major clusters (BART and BHRF 1), KSHV encodes 12 from a latent region, human polyomavirus MCV produce only one microRNA from the late region antisense to early transcripts, but HPVs appears to produce no viral microRNAs. </p...|$|R

Multiple-integration events in the tissues of cervical carcinoma (CxCa) are significantly more often than those of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL).

40|$|The {{transforming}} (onc) {{genes of}} oncogenic retroviruses share {{most or all}} of their coding sequences with normal cellular genes termed proto-onc genes. The viral genes differ from proto-onc genes in virus-specific promoters and in various point mutations and substitutions of cell-derived coding regions. In view of the structural similarities between <b>viral</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and cellular proto-onc genes, the hypothesis has been advanced that proto-onc genes become cellular cancer genes if they have suffered mutations. Indeed, point mutations and substitutions have been observed in the proto-onc genes of some cancers. However, the hypothesis has been difficult to prove because mutated proto-onc genes from tumors do not transform diploid cells. Moreover, owing to the popularity of this hypothesis, even <b>viral</b> <b>oncogenes</b> are thought to derive transforming function from mutations of this cell-derived coding region. A competing hypothesis proposes that enhanced expression from retroviral promoters is necessary and sufficient for oncogenic function of proto-onc genes. To distinguish between these hypotheses we have tested tumorigenicity of RpSV, a synthetic retrovirus with the normal proto-src coding region in a vector derived from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). In addition, we have tested the role of RSV-specific src point mutations on the tumorigenicity of RpSV. It was found that RpSV with an unmutated proto-src coding region is tumorigenic in chickens and that tumorigenicity is enhanced by RSV-specific src point mutations. It is concluded that retroviral promoters are essential for the transforming function of <b>viral</b> <b>oncogenes</b> and that certain point mutations merely supplement their transforming function. Thus retroviral onc genes are not models for the hypothesis that mutated, but transcriptionally normal, proto-onc genes of certain tumors are cancer genes...|$|R

To date, a variety of RNA tumor viruses have been isolated and charac-terized to give a set of 20 or more <b>viral</b> <b>oncogenes</b> (v-onc), {{all of which have}} been derived from the corre-sponding proto-oncogene in genomes of host animals (Bishop 1985).

Another line of progress has been made by gene transfer experiments. Morphological transformation of NIH- 3 T 3 cells by transfection with genomic DNA has been used to detect dominantly acting transforming genes in human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines (for review, see Cooper 1982; Weinberg 1982).
