This approach is readily applicable for other nonlinear interactions, and may be applicable for various quantum-measurement tasks. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to Phys. Rev. Let...|$|R

5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye {{in the night sky}} and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low.

5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. The star's metal abundance is ten {{times higher than the}} Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. Barely <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye is HD 172365, a likely post-blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun. When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means the star is located {{at a distance of}} 50.6 light years (15.51 parsecs). Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of +5.12 and is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E
25|$|The ACU {{originally}} {{used the}} Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), which used a pixelated pattern of tan, gray and green (Desert Sand 500, Urban Gray 501 and Foliage Green 502) and {{was intended to}} work equally in desert, woodland, and urban environments. It is aesthetically similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> USMC's MARPAT and Canadian CADPAT camouflage scheme on which it was based. The shade black was omitted from the uniform since it is highly <b>visible</b> both <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye and <b>to</b> modern optics.

5000|$|Depending {{on local}} sky cloud cover, {{pollution}}, humidity, and light pollution levels, <b>the</b> stars <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unaided <b>naked</b> eye appear as hundreds, thousands or {{tens of thousands}} of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some feint nebulae or clouds of light [...] [...] In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for stereopsis to offer any depth cues. Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of feint light, most look white because they stimulate the rod cells without triggering the cone cells. If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, averted vision may be helpful.|$|R
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye.|$|E

HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet {{at least three times}} the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E

50|$|The comet's orbit, later {{computed}} by John Russell Hind, {{showed a}} perihelion distance (closest approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun) of 4.05 AU {{which is just}} within the orbit of Jupiter. However, despite this it became <b>visible,</b> although faintly, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye, and indeed remained visible for six months in total. This suggests that its absolute magnitude or intrinsic brightness was unusually high, possibly as high as −3.0. It is therefore likely that the Comet of 1729 was an exceptionally large object, with a cometary nucleus {{of the order of}} 100 km in diameter. The JPL small-body database only uses three observations, a two-body model, and an assumed epoch <b>to</b> compute <b>the</b> orbit of this parabolic comet.|$|R
50|$|The MK281 is a {{new type}} of 40 mm grenade {{ammunition}} that has been accepted for use into the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army. The Rheinmetall MK281 Mod 0 and Mod 1 40×53mm Practice cartridges are precision, high-velocity training and practice cartridges. The MK281 uses a patented Rheinmetall propulsion unit that is designed to produce a very low standard deviation in muzzle velocity for improved accuracy. The MK281 round is compatible with all types of automatic grenade launchers, including the MK19, the MK47 and the HK GMG, and comes in two different types: 40×53mm Cartridge MK281 Mod0 Impact Marker and 40×53mm Cartridge MK281 Mod1 Day/Night Marker. The MK281 is manufactured by an American subsidiary of the Rheinmetall Group. The MOD1 cartridge allows operators to train at night; the cartridge marking is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye and when using night vision equipment. As an additional option, a tracer is available for both variants of the cartridge. This tracer has a burn time of six seconds and allows <b>the</b> user <b>to</b> observe <b>the</b> ammunition’s trajectory as it approaches the target.|$|R
5|$|In early times, {{astronomy}} only {{comprised the}} observation and {{predictions of the}} motions of objects <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, {{an important factor in}} knowing when to plant crops, as well as in understanding the length of the year.|$|E
5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make Vesta the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye from dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion {{were only a few}} weeks apart. It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{classical}} planets, Uranus is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye, {{but it was}} never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.

60|$|But {{some part}} of the army will {{certainly}} cross at Potgieter's; and as I looked down on the smooth smiling landscape it seemed very strange to think that in a few days it would blaze into a veritable hell. Yet the dark lines of shelter trenches, the redoubts crowning the hills, the bristle of tiny black figures busily entrenching against the sky line, hundreds of horses grazing in the plain, all promised a fierce and stubborn defence. I turned about. <b>The</b> country <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southward was also <b>visible.</b> What looked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye like an endless thin rope lay streaked across the spacious veldt, and when I looked through the glass I saw that it was ten or twelve miles of marching men and baggage.

40|$|Nacre, the {{iridescent}} outer {{lining of}} pearls and inner lining of many mollusk shells, {{is composed of}} periodic, parallel, organic sheets alternating with aragonite (CaCO_ 3) tablet layers. Nacre tablet thickness (TT) generates both nacre's iridescence and its remarkable resistance to fracture. Despite extensive studies on how nacre forms, the mechanisms controlling TT remain unknown, even though they determine the most conspicuous of nacre's characteristics, <b>visible</b> even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye. Thermodynamics predicts that temperature (T) will affect both physical and chemical components of biomineralized skeletons. The chemical composition of biominerals is well-established to record environmental parameters, and has therefore been extensively used in paleoclimate studies. The physical structure, however, has been hypothesized but never directly demonstrated <b>to</b> depend on <b>the</b> environment. Here we observe that the physical TT in nacre from modern and fossil shallow-water shells of the bivalves Pinna and Atrina correlates with T {{as measured by the}} carbonate clumped isotope thermometer. Based on the observed TT vs. T correlation, we anticipate that TT will be used as a paleothermometer, useful to estimate paleotemperature in shallow-water paleoenvironments. Here we successfully test the proposed new nacre TT thermometer on two Jurassic Pinna shells. The increase of TT with T is consistent with greater aragonite growth rate at higher T, and with greater metabolic rate at higher T. Thus, it reveals a complex, T-dependent biophysical mechanism for nacre formation...|$|R
2500|$|While {{generally}} considered invisible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, {{in an experiment}} a short time after Röntgen's landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint [...] "blue-gray" [...] glow which seemed <b>to</b> originate within <b>the</b> eye itself. Upon hearing this, Röntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube {{on the opposite side}} of a wooden door Röntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming <b>to</b> emanate from <b>the</b> eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> glow plainly visible and the experiment was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark-adapted <b>naked</b> eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> desire not <b>to</b> repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with ionizing radiation. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of rhodopsin molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of phosphorescence in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.|$|R

And it argues an admirable providence of Nature in the contrivance and fabrick of them; for their texture is such, that though by any external injury the parts of them are violently dis-joyn'd, so as that the leaves and stalks touch not one another, and consequently several of these rents would impede the Bird's flying; yet, for the most part, of themselves they readily re-join and re-contex themselves, and are easily by the Birds stroking the Feather, or drawing it through its Bill, all of them settled and woven into their former and natural posture; for there are such an infinite company of those small fibres in the under side of the leaves, and most of them have such little crooks at their ends, that they readily catch and hold the stalks they touch.|$|R
