Manstein took his recommendation at face <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack.|$|E
5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare <b>value),</b> <b>while</b> those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is a difference between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E

5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its <b>value</b> <b>while</b> lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
5|$|A feature-length {{preview of}} the series premiered at the Frameline Film Festival in June 2005, and was {{screened}} at numerous other venues before the television debut. The complete, eight-episode series aired on the Sundance Channel from September to November 2005, and on Logo TV from January to February 2006. In Italy it aired on Cult, a satellite television channel. It was released on DVD in the US in March 2006, and on Google Video and iTunes a few months later. That year, TransGeneration won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary, and was a nominee for the IDA Documentary Award in the Limited Series category. The response to the show from critics and other viewers ranged from exuberant to dismissive. In addition, some viewers believed the show had distinct educational <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> others felt that the chosen narratives oversimplified the subject.|$|E
5|$|Baccarat is a {{game for}} up to 20 players, {{together}} with a banker and croupier; several packs of cards are used, depending {{on the number of}} players. The value of the ace to nine cards are as their pip <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> tens and court cards count as zero. A player is dealt two cards and adds up the combined pips, discounting 10's and court cards, and only using the single digit value as a score - a King and a 6 will equal 16, but their value will be 6; two 8s will equal 16, and their value will also be 6. Two court cards will count as zero, or baccarat. The idea of the game is to get 9 points. A player may ask for one extra card to be added to their hand. Betting is between the player and the bank, with the closest to reach 9 on a hand receiving the stake.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the film}} went into production, the {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in Portland, came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film. One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight, {{and it was only}} because the U.S. dollar had, at that time, dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas. Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather. With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets that were used in the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were able to find a parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight. David Thompson Secondary School would then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{security}} {{features in the}} Ship Series were carried over to the Portrait Series, and new ones incorporated into the banknote. The two most prominent {{security features}} are the engraved portrait of Yusof bin Ishak (which contains fine lines that are difficult for counterfeiters to mimic) and the Kinegram (a printed security hologram); MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and Kinegram command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the face <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (a mythical creature and national symbol) and the face value. Polymer versions of the banknote have the Kinegram replaced by {{an image of the}} Singapore lion symbol with the face value, showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.|$|E

Those who had not taken part in the fighting themselves, but had incited others to rise up against the king, were fined at two years' <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> those who had been compelled to fight, or played only a minor part, had to pay one year's value of their land. The proceedings from the fines were awarded to royal supporters, some of whom had already been awarded parts of the rebels' land, and now had to give it back.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism and {{the modern}} {{discipline}} of Psychology have multiple parallels and points of overlap. This includes a descriptive phenomenology of mental states, emotions and behaviors, as well as theories of perception and unconscious mental factors. Psychotherapists such as Erich Fromm have found in Buddhist enlightenment experiences (e.g. kensho) the potential for transformation, healing and finding existential meaning. Some contemporary mental-health practitioners such as Jon Kabat-Zinn increasingly find ancient Buddhist practices (such as the development of mindfulness) of empirically proven therapeutic <b>value,</b> <b>while</b> Buddhist teachers such as Jack Kornfield see Western Psychology as providing complementary practices for Buddhists.|$|E
