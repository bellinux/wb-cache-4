She saw him at once, over by the piano, with his short, square companion, listening to a voluble lady, and looking <b>very</b> <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> restless. All that overcast afternoon, still and with queer lights in the sky, as if rain were coming, Gyp had been feeling out of mood, a little homesick. Now she felt excited. She saw the short companion detach himself and {{go up to the}} baroness; a minute later, he was brought up to her and introduced--Count Rosek. Gyp did not like his face; there were dark rings under the eyes, and he was too perfectly self-possessed, with a kind of cold sweetness; but he was very agreeable and polite, and spoke English well. He was--it seemed--a Pole, who lived in London, and seemed to know all that was to be known about music. Miss Winton--he believed--had heard his friend Fiorsen play; but not in London? No? That was odd; he had been there some months last season. Faintly annoyed at her ignorance, Gyp answered: ...|$|E

5000|$|One famous example {{illustrates}} {{the difference between}} inclination and duty while illustrating a criticism of it, as given by Michael Stocker in his paper The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories (1976). Suppose {{you are in a}} hospital, recovering from a long illness. You are <b>very</b> <b>bored</b> <b>and</b> restless and at loose ends when Smith comes in once again. You are now convinced more than ever that he is a fine fellow and a real friend - taking so much time to cheer you up, traveling all the way across town, and so on. You are so effusive with your praise and thanks that he protests that he always tries to do what he thinks is his duty[...] [...] [...] You at first think he is engaging in a polite form of self-deprecation, relieving the moral burden. But the more you two speak, the more clear it becomes that he was telling you the literal truth: that it is not essentially because of you that he came to see you, not because you are friends, but because he thought it his duty. The visitor could be seen as lacking in moral merit. In other words, which scenario has more moral worth: one in which the friend goes to the hospital out of a cold sense of duty (what one should do) instead of wanting to do it (inclination)? Kant might argue that the former has the [...] "true" [...] or [...] "authentic" [...] moral worthiness where Stocker argues acting purely out of duty in his example is morally inauthentic.|$|E

40|$|Verifying the {{reliability}} and functionality of a complex system like a trading system is highly demanding since failure in such a system can cause serious economic problems.

This thesis aims to create a model for automating the task of the debugging to reduce the failed test case to an equivalent test case that only contains relevant actions that together cause the failure.

40|$|Considering {{that the}} course group {{regarding}} theory and design of mechanisms is characterized by strong engineering application background and the students generally feel <b>very</b> <b>boring</b> <b>and</b> tedious during the learning process, some teaching reforms for the theory and design of mechanisms are carried out to improve the teaching effectiveness in this paper. Taking the engineering cases as the teaching objectives, we combine the course contents with the engineering background. Moreover, {{in order to help}} the students understand the knowledge difficulty and improve the design capacity of the mechanisms and machines, the matlab technology is introduced into the theoretical teaching to provide assisted analysis. At the same time, the matlab is also introduced into the practical teaching to provide theoretical guidance. The teaching effect shows that matlab—based teaching reform under the engineering application can deepen the understandings of course contents for students, improve the interest in learning, strengthen the design capacity and develop the innovation ability. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} our group wanted to {{advocate}} {{the importance of}} the artwork on Iowa Avenue, specifically the Iowa Literary Walk and the mural.

We also decided to interview our peers about the walk and their knowledge about the walk. We wanted to call awareness to the walk especially from our peers. We chose to focus on this aspect of Iowa Avenue because we believe it is a major part of Iowa Avenue that does not get enough attention. Before the Iowa Literary Walk, the street was <b>very</b> <b>boring</b> <b>and</b> did not have a lot of foot traffic. Once the artwork was created Iowa Avenue has become more of a local attraction.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to the Internet, most art is {{displayed}} in a very typical fashion. Even web sites for art galleries and museums are normally <b>very</b> <b>boring</b> <b>and</b> only allow you to cycle through one picture at a time. Simply put, viewing art on the web does not compare with seeing art in a gallery.

These shortcomings are the inspiration for AbsorbArt. com, a web site designed to show that art can be displayed in a creative and interactive manner on the Internet. This creative thesis combines art, video, and the Internet to create an online interactive art gallery that recreates a gallery experience and provides insight and criticism from the featured artists as well as art experts.

She rented a home at 1712 Stanley Street, in Hollywood, and began hosting parties that were said to [...] "have no boundaries". Bankhead's first film was Tarnished Lady (1931), directed by George Cukor and the pair became fast friends. Bankhead behaved herself on the set and filming went smoothly, but she found film-making to be <b>very</b> <b>boring</b> <b>and</b> {{did not have the}} patience for it.
