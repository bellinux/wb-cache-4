5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated cranium under the melted, translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was widely}} {{respected}} and <b>very</b> <b>cautious.</b> He {{was able to}} continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 {{may have been in}} part a response to fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began to fear that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire was at stake if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.|$|E
5|$|Cincinnati {{already had}} a large anti-slavery {{movement}} who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents {{in the years before}} Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> about helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he could trust and the community learned that it could trust him. Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home's rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests coming and going, the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would be dressed as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman's attire; its high collar, long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its wearer when their head was tilted slightly downward.|$|E

50|$|Sakis are diurnal animals. They live in {{the trees}} of the rain forests and only {{occasionally}} go onto the land. They mostly move on all fours, sometimes running in an upright position on the hind legs over the branches, and sometimes jumping long distances. For sleeping they roll themselves cat-like in the branches. They are generally <b>very</b> shy, <b>cautious</b> animals.|$|R
5|$|Hammond toured South Africa in {{the winter}} of 1930–31, in a weak M.C.C. side without some of the best English players. The {{tourists}} were short of opening batsmen, frequently forcing Hammond into the role. Although successful, he brought a more wary approach than usual to his unaccustomed position. In all first-class cricket, he scored 1,045 runs (average 61.47). In the five-Test series, which South Africa won 1–0, he scored 517 runs (average 64.62), passing fifty five times in nine innings. A <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> approach batting at number three saw Hammond score 49 and 63 in the first Test. Opening the batting in the second Test, he scored two fifties to save the game; he also kept wicket for a time following an injury to the regular wicketkeeper. Hammond continued to open in the third Test, playing more aggressively for 136 not out, before returning to number three and making 75 in the fourth Test. In the final Test, he opened both the batting and the bowling.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1938–39, Verity toured South Africa with the MCC team under Hammond's captaincy. He took 47wickets at 19.93 in {{first-class}} games. In {{the first game of}} the tour, Verity took 11 wickets against Griqualand West. In the Test matches, the batsmen played in a negative fashion, despite pitches that were very good for batting. High scoring games left the bowlers with expensive figures and Verity had the best bowling average on either side, bowling accurately and reliably. He played in all five Test matches, taking 19wickets at 29.05. The first two matches were drawn: in the first innings of the opening Test, he took four for 61 in 44 eight-ball overs; in the first innings of the second Test, he took five for 70 in nearly 37overs. England won the third match, the only result in the series and the fourth was also drawn. The final game was to be played without a time limit until there was a winner; after 10 days it had to be abandoned as the MCC had to catch a boat home. The match established a record at the time for the total number of runs scored in a first-class game, as both teams combined to post an aggregate of 1,981 runs. Verity took four wickets and bowled 766 balls in the game, establishing a new record for deliveries in a first-class game. It proved difficult to score runs from Verity's bowling but the batsmen generally were <b>very</b> <b>cautious.</b>|$|E
25|$|What {{followed}} {{was the beginning}} of a rivalry which became legendary. In the first conflict between the two, both Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda Shingen were <b>very</b> <b>cautious,</b> only committing themselves to indecisive skirmishes. Over the years, there would eventually be a total number of five such engagements at the famous site of Kawanakajima (1553–1564), though only the fourth would prove to be a serious, all-out battle between the two.|$|E

25|$|The Saharan cheetah (northwest African cheetah) {{lives in}} Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso. There remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs, which are <b>very</b> <b>cautious,</b> fleeing any human presence. The cheetah avoids the sun from April to October, seeking {{the shelter of}} shrubs such as balanites and acacias. They are unusually pale. The other cheetah {{subspecies}} (northeast African cheetah) lives in Chad, Sudan and the eastern region of Niger. However, it is currently extinct in the wild in Egypt and Libya. There are approximately 2000 mature individuals left in the wild.|$|E
25|$|A nuclear renaissance is {{possible}} but cannot occur overnight. Nuclear projects face significant hurdles, including extended construction periods and related risks, long licensing processes and manpower shortages, plus long‐standing {{issues related to}} waste disposal, proliferation and local opposition. The financing of new nuclear power plants, especially in liberalized markets, has always been difficult and the financial crisis seems almost certain to have made it even more so. The huge capital requirements, combined with risks of cost overruns and regulatory uncertainties, make investors and lenders <b>very</b> <b>cautious,</b> even when demand growth is robust.|$|E

25|$|Poor {{communications}} {{plagued the}} Austrian commanders throughout the campaign. This was {{a consequence of}} the wide separation between the two wings. Furthermore, many of Alvinczi's men were indifferently equipped raw recruits who straggled badly. The Austrians also suffered from a serious shortage of officers. After Alvinczi sent him a mistaken report that Masséna was reinforcing Vaubois, Davidovich became <b>very</b> <b>cautious.</b> The report was sent on 9 November but only reached its recipient on the 11th, which was typical of the Austrian communications problems. Alvinczi also repeatedly urged Davidovich to speed up his march toward Verona.|$|E
25|$|Faced with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's advance from Chattanooga to Atlanta in {{the spring}} of 1864, Johnston {{conducted}} a series of withdrawals that appeared similar to his Peninsula Campaign strategy. He repeatedly prepared strong defensive positions, only to see Sherman maneuver around them in expert turning movements, causing him to fall back {{in the general direction of}} Atlanta. Johnston saw the preservation of his army as the most important consideration, and hence conducted a <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> campaign. He handled his army well, slowing the Union advance and inflicting heavier losses than he sustained.|$|E
25|$|The second {{attempted}} {{censorship of}} the film was the huge scandal when the German embassy in France asked for the film to be withdrawn from the Cannes Film Festival. The French press reacted against the proposed withdrawal, noting that Cayrol and Resnais were <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> in defining {{the difference between the}} Nazi criminals and the German people. Articles were written in French magazines including Libération and L'Humanité, protesting any censorship {{of the film}} at Cannes. One of the few writers who supported the withdrawal, Jean Dutourd, felt that Auschwitz and other concentration camps should be forgotten.|$|E

This has raised many questions about his interference with coaching. The fact that Ivanković's team still plays a lot like Shahrokhi's team, <b>very</b> defensive and <b>cautious,</b> added to the controversy about Dadgan and Shahrokhi's interference with Branko Ivanković's decisions. Ivanković has never complained so far.|$|R

25|$|Outliers {{can occur}} by chance in any distribution, {{but they often}} {{indicate}} either measurement error or that the population has a heavy-tailed distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them or use statistics that are robust to outliers, while {{in the latter case}} they indicate that the distribution has high skewness and that one should be <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> in using tools or intuitions that assume a normal distribution. A frequent cause of outliers is a mixture of two distributions, which may be two distinct sub-populations, or may indicate 'correct trial' versus 'measurement error'; this is modeled by a mixture model.|$|E
25|$|For Besant, politics, {{friendship}} and love were always closely intertwined. Her decision {{in favour of}} Socialism came about through {{a close relationship with}} George Bernard Shaw, a struggling young Irish author living in London, and a leading light of the Fabian Society. Annie was impressed by his work and grew very close to him too in the early 1880s. It was Besant who made the first move, by inviting Shaw to live with her. This he refused, but it was Shaw who sponsored Besant to join the Fabian Society. In its early days, the society was a gathering of people exploring spiritual, rather than political, alternatives to the capitalist system. Besant began to write for the Fabians. This new commitment – and her relationship with Shaw – deepened the split between Besant and Bradlaugh, who was an individualist and opposed to Socialism of any sort. While he defended free speech at any cost, he was <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> about encouraging working-class militancy.|$|E
25|$|When he was young, Dian Wei once {{agreed to}} help a certain Liu family in Xiangyi (襄邑) take revenge by killing Li Yong (李永), a man from Suiyang (睢陽). Li Yong was {{formerly}} the Chief (長) of Fuchun County (富春縣), and he was <b>very</b> <b>cautious</b> about his personal protection. Dian Wei disguised himself as a marquis and travelled to Li Yong's house in a carriage filled with food and wine. He entered the house without challenge, stabbed Li with a concealed dagger, and killed Li's wife as well. He then left the house and retrieved his weapons (a sword and a ji) from the carriage and walked away. As Li Yong lived near the marketplace, news of his death spread quickly and the whole town was shocked. Hundreds of men went to pursue the murderer {{but none of them}} dared to approach Dian Wei. After travelling four or five li on foot, Dian Wei met his companions and they escaped after a brief fight with the pursuers. Dian Wei became recognised as a hero after that incident.|$|E

25|$|Formations of the Allied army of Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg began {{crossing}} the Rhine River at Basel on 21 December 1813. In the lead was an Austro-Bavarian raiding force of 700 cavalrymen led by Karl von Scheibler. When he received {{news of the}} invasion, Marshal Claude Perrin Victor ordered Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud to take the 3,500 troopers of V Cavalry Corps and scout enemy movements. On 23 December, now reinforced with two regiments of Don Cossacks, Scheibler's force moved north through Mulhouse. Meanwhile, his 200-man spearhead captured 12 artillery caissons, reached Colmar, learned Milhaud's corps was due {{the next day and}} fell back to join the main force. On the morning of 24 December at Sainte-Croix-en-Plaine, Scheibler's 800 horsemen were routed by 1,000 French dragoons led by Gabriel-Gaspard Montélégier. As the Allies galloped to safety they found the two lead squadrons of Collaert's brigade blocking their escape route. Scheibler received three wounds but most of his force managed to cut its way out of the trap, suffering the loss of nine officers and about 200 troopers. French casualties were 80 but they recaptured the lost caissons. Though it was only a skirmish, Schwarzenberg became <b>very</b> <b>cautious,</b> believing that strong French forces were nearby. In fact, Schwarzenberg's 75,000 soldiers vastly outnumbered Victor's 10,000.|$|E

60|$|In fact, Fergus Mac-Ivor, of whom a Frenchman {{might have}} said as truly as of any man in the Highlands, 'Qu'il connoit bien ses gens' {{had no idea of}} raising himself in the eyes of an English young man of fortune by {{appearing}} with a retinue of idle Highlanders disproportioned to the occasion.

Therefore, although, had he been to receive a brother chieftain, he would probably have been attended by all that retinue which Evan described with so much unction, he judged it more respectable to advance to meet Waverley with a single attendant, a very handsome Highland boy, who carried his master's shooting-pouch and his broadsword, without which he seldom went abroad.|$|R
