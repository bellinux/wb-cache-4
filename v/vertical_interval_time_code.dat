5000|$|The first {{generation}} of U-matic VCRs were large devices, approximately 30 in wide, 24 in deep, and 12 in high, requiring special shelving, and had mechanical controls limited to Record, Play, Rewind, Fast-Forward, Stop and Pause (with muted video on early models). Later models sported improvements such as chassis sized for EIA 19-inch rack mounting, with sliding rack rails for compressed storage in broadcast environments, solenoid control mechanics, jog-shuttle knob, remote controls, <b>Vertical</b> <b>Interval</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Code</b> (VITC), longitudinal time code, internal cuts-only editing controls, [...] "Slo-Mo" [...] slow-motion playback, and Dolby audio noise reduction.|$|E
40|$|A {{model space}} {{positioning}} system (MSPS), a state-of-the-art, real-time tracking system {{to provide the}} test engineer with on line model pitch and spin rate information, is described. It is noted that the six-degree-of-freedom post processor program will require additional programming effort both in the automated tracking mode for high spin rates and in accuracy to meet the measurement objectives. An independent multicamera system intended to augment the MSPS is studied using laboratory calibration methods based on photogrammetry to characterize the losses in various recording options. Data acquired to Super VHS tape encoded with <b>Vertical</b> <b>Interval</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Code</b> and transcribed to video disk {{are considered to be}} a reasonable priced choice for post editing and processing video data...|$|E
40|$|Several {{applications}} today need to digitally capture every {{frame of}} a video stream or a camera. These range from psychological studies to surveillance to video processing. Some applications also need to capture the frames from multiple video streams synchronously and to correlate them with one another. A video stream of color data, though, represents a sustained bandwidth of about 26 Mbytes per second from the digitizing hardware to a secondary storage device without compression. This rate is well beyond the capabilities of most affordable systems today. We present a system that can synchronously capture every frame [...] or any user-specified subset of them [...] from multiple cameras at full resolution and store them on a regular secondary storage device. The outputs of the cameras are recorded on tape using conventional VCRs. The <b>Vertical</b> <b>Interval</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Code</b> (VITC) is inserted onto each stream before recording. Each tape is played back, repeatedly under computer control if necessary, off-l [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|The Sony BVU series added {{longitudinal}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> SMPTE <b>time</b> <b>code,</b> balanced audio XLR connectors, and heavier-duty transport features. The BVU-50 enabled recording in {{the field}} but not playback, and the BVU-100 permitted both recording and playback {{in the field}}. Portable recorders were connected to the camera with a multi-conductor cable terminated with multi-pin connectors on each end. The cable carried bi-directional audio, video, synchronisation, record on/off control, and power. Early studio and all portable U-Matic VCRs had a drawer-type mechanism which required the tape to be inserted, followed by manual closure of the drawer (a [...] "top-loading" [...] mechanism). Later studio VCRs accepted the cassette from a port opening and the cassette was pulled into and seated in the transport (a [...] "front-loading" [...] mechanism).|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} DRI architecture, {{due to the}} memory size of video cards at that time, there was a single instance of the screen front buffer and back buffer (also of the ancillary depth buffer and stencil buffer), shared by all the DRI clients and the X Server. All of them rendered directly onto the back buffer, that was swapped with the front buffer at <b>vertical</b> blanking <b>interval</b> <b>time.</b> In order to render to the back buffer, a DRI process should ensure that the rendering was clipped to the area reserved for its window.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} defining {{property of}} the semicubical parabola {{is that it is}} an isochrone curve, meaning that a particle following its path while being pulled down by gravity travels equal <b>vertical</b> <b>intervals</b> in equal <b>time</b> periods. In this way it is related to the tautochrone curve, for which particles at different starting points always take equal time to reach the bottom, and the brachistochrone curve, the curve that minimizes the time it takes for a falling particle to travel from its start to its end.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{synchronizing}} multiple video recordings to {{some type}} of 'range' time has been tried to {{varying degrees of success}} in the past. Combining this requirement with existing time code standards (SMPTE) and the new innovations in desktop multimedia however, have afforded an opportunity to increase the flexibility and usefulness of such efforts without adding costs over the traditional data recording and reduction systems. The concept described can use IRIG, GPS or a battery backed internal clock as the master time source. By converting that time source to <b>Vertical</b> <b>Interval</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Code</b> or Longitudinal Time Code, both in accordance with the SMPTE standards, the user will obtain a tape that contains machine/computer readable time code suitable for use with editing equipment that is available off-the-shelf. Accuracy on playback is then determined by the playback system chosen by the user. Accuracies of +/- 2 frames are common among inexpensive systems and complete frame accuracy is more a matter of the users' budget than the capability of the recording system...|$|E

25|$|For {{portions}} of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, {{it is recommended that}} the luma samples be assigned the code word 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0mV. It is permissible to encode analog <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> information (such as <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> timecode or <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> test signals) without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata).

50|$|A <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> {{test signal}} {{inserter}}, or VITS inserter inserts test patterns into the <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> {{of a television}} signal. Unlike test signal generators; a VITS inserter is used to insert the test signal into live programming, so that inline measurements of a transmission chain can be made while the chain is operational. (As the <b>vertical</b> <b>interval</b> is typically not visible on end-user televisions, {{this can be done}} without producing any artifacts noticeable to viewers). Since VITS signals can often be transmitted, it is also possible for a television station to receive its own on-air feed, and use the VITS to detect and troubleshoot problems in on-air transmission.|$|R

3000|$|When {{the space}} between soil and water {{conservation}} structures is wider than the required space, the risk of soil erosion on cropland will increase (Masresha 2014; Molla and Sisheber 2017).

40|$|The ELVIS {{project had}} three locally based teams (in Canada, at McGill, in Scotland, at Aberdeen, and in New England, USA, divided between MIT, the lead, and Yale), {{each of which}} focused on a {{different}} aspect of the overall research program: using computers to understand musical style. The central unifying concept of the ELVIS project was to study counterpoint: the way combinations of voices in polyphonic music (e. g. the soprano and bass voices in a hymn, or the viola and cello in a string quartet, as well as combinations {{of more than two}} voices) interact: i. e. what are the permissible <b>vertical</b> <b>intervals</b> (notes from two voices sounding at the same time) for a particular period, genre, or style. These <b>vertical</b> <b>intervals,</b> connected by melodic motions in individual voices, constitute <b>Vertical</b> <b>Interval</b> Successions. In more modern terms, this could be described as harmonic progressions of chords, but what made ELVIS particularly flexible was its ability to bridge the gap to earlier, contrapuntally-conceived music by using the diad (a two-note combination) rather than the triad (a combination of three notes in particular arrangements) as a basis (since triads and beyond may be expressed as sums of diads) ...|$|R
