40|$|A coated graphite-epoxy {{ion-selective}} electrode for iron(III), {{based on}} the ion-pair formed between [Fe(citrate) 2] 3 - and the tricaprylylmethylammonium cation (Aliquat 336) in a poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) matrix has been constructed. A thin membrane film of this ion-pair, dibutylphthalate (DBPh) in PVC was deposited directly onto a Perspex® tube, which contained a graphite-epoxy conductor substrate. The coating solution was prepared by dissolving 30 % (w/w) of PVC in 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran following addition of 65 % (w/w) DBPh and 5 % (w/w) of the ionic pair. The effect of pH, citrate concentration and some cations on the electrode response has been investigated. The E(mV) vs. log [Fe(citrate) 2] 3 - electrode response was linear for iron(III) concentration from 1. 0 x 10 - 3 mol/L to 1. 0 x 10 - 1 mol/L in 1. 0 mol/L citrate medium, with a slope of 19. 3 ± 0. 5 mV/decade and a useful lifetime of {{at least six months}} (more than 800 determinations for each polymeric membrane used). The detection limit was 7. 5 x 10 - 4 mol/L and the relative standard deviation was less than 3 % for a solution containing 5. 0 x 10 - 3 mol/L of iron(III) (n = 10).

MethodsThe first part {{of this study was}} further subdivided in to several phases; the first of these involved a comparative study of the germination of Phalaenopsis ovules on six different basal medium formulations and seven different sets of medium supplements. The second phase involved a comparative study of the development of Phalaenopsis protocorms on six different basal medium formulations and ninteen different sets of medium supplements. The third phase involved a comparative study of the growth of Phalaenopsis seedlings on six different basal medium formulations and twelve sets of medium supplements. The forth and final phase involved a comparative study of the development and growth of Phalaenopsis protocorms and seedlings on media containing varing concentrations and combinations of auxins and cytokinins. The second part of this study involved a comparative study designed-to determine the suitability of several sizes of axillary buds and plantlets for the clonal propagation of Phalaenopsis orchids and the modification of several procedures in an attempt to determine suitable explant material and procedures for the commercial clonal propagation of Phalaenopsis orchids. Results and DiscussionResults of this study indicated that of the basal medium formulations and medium supplements tested Modified Heller's salt base medium {{and to a lesser extent}} Modified Vacin and Went salt base medium supplemented with <b>vitamin</b> <b>formulation</b> 1 and Bactopeptone yielded the highest percent germination and development up to the seedling stage. At the seedling stage the growth rate of seedlings grown on media supplemented with banana homogenate nearly doubled the growth rate of the seedlings grown on all of the other medium supplementstested. Results of the second part of this study indicated that by modifying the procedures of Bouriquet, Broly, and Legrand (1982) the proliferation rate (shoots per plantlet) could be increased by a factor of two to eight. This can be translated into an increase from two to five shoots per plantlet per six weeks to an increase of eight shoots per plantlet per six weeks with a minimal mortality rate. With further modification of the procedure of Bouriquet, Broly, and Legrand (1982), other results indicated that it may be possible to increase to forty the number of shoots per plantlet produced per six week period.

Cow milk is considered as a remarkable source of bioactive components promoting human health, which has renewed interest in the effects of vitamin E supplementation on its nutritional value, sensory quality and shelf life. Thus, defining relative bioavailability, utilisation and transfer into milk of different <b>vitamin</b> E <b>formulations</b> is particularly important to assess the adequate levels of supplementation for animal health and milk quality. In nature vitamin E is present under one isomeric form, RRR α-tocopherol; when α-tocopherol is synthesized chemically, a racemic mixture of 8 possible isomers of α-tocopherol in equimolar concentrations is produced (all-rac α-tocopherol). The different stereoisomers have different biopotencies in humans and livestock; the conversion factor between RRR and all-rac vitamin E was estimated by early studies {{on the basis of}} the rat foetal resorption bioassay, and then extended to other species.

40|$|The photoprotective {{potential}} of the dietary antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin E, lycopene, beta-carotene, and the rosemary polyphenol, carnosic acid, was tested in human dermal fibroblasts exposed to ultraviolet-A (UVA) light. The carotenoids were prepared in special nanoparticle <b>formulations</b> together with <b>vitamin</b> C and/or <b>vitamin</b> E. Nanoparticle <b>formulations,</b> in contrast to dimethylsulphoxide, stablized lycopene in the cell culture medium and allowed efficient cellular uptake. The presence of vitamin E in the formulation further increased the stability and cellular uptake of lycopene. UVA irradiation of the human skin fibroblasts led to a 10 - 15 -fold rise in metalloproteinase 1 (MMP- 1) mRNA. This rise was suppressed {{in the presence of}} low microM concentrations of vitamin E, vitamin C, or carnosic acid but not with beta-carotene or lycopene. Indeed, in the presence of 0. 5 - 1. 0 microM beta-carotene or lycopene, the UVA-induced MMP- 1 mRNA was further increased by 1. 5 - 2 -fold. This increase was totally suppressed when vitamin E was included in the nanoparticle formulation. Heme-oxygenase 1 (HO- 1) mRNA expression was strongly induced by UVA irradiation but none of the antioxidants inhibited this effect at the concentrations used in this study. Indeed, beta-carotene or lycopene (0. 5 - 1. 0 microM) led to a further 1. 5 -fold rise in the UVA-induced HO- 1 mRNA levels. In conclusion, vitamin C, vitamin E, and carnosic acid showed photoprotective potential. Lycopene and beta-carotene did not protect on their own but in the presence of vitamin E, their stability in culture was improved and the rise in MMP- 1 mRNA expression was suppressed, suggesting a requirement for antioxidant protection of the carotenoids against formation of oxidative derivatives that can influence the cellular and molecular response...|$|R

The study focused on the suitability of PKC and OPF as a major source of crude protein,crude fiber and as well as minerals and <b>vitamins</b> in the <b>formulation</b> of rabbit feed. The nutritional compositions of these raw materials and a common animal feedstuffs, maize and soybean meal are analyzed using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). The results of crude protein (CP) content using NIRS analysis are 17. 24 % in PKC, 0. 00 % in OPF, 7. 51 % in maize and 38. 76 % in soybean meal. The result of crude fiber(CF) content in OPF is 32. 99 %. These feed ingredients are then grinded and mixed on proper formulation using laboratory blender. Final product 1 analyzed using NIRS has 15. 79 % crude protein(CP), 8. 75 % crude fiber (CF) and 20. 70 % acid detergent fiber (ADF) which represents high digestibility. Gross energy(GE) value is 4005. 18 kcal/kg which resulted in a comparable appetite of rabbit with a commercial rabbit pellet. Final product 1 is considered suitable as a supplementary rabbit feed. Final product 2 and final product 3 are used as a comparison. At 40 % total formulation of PKC and OPF in the rabbit feed,the environmental problem of biomass from oil palm industry is solved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{nutritional}} supplements, a Yeast Extract (YE) and a <b>vitamin</b> D 3 <b>formulation</b> (VD) on growth and structural properties of bones from turkeys, transiently {{subjected to a}} simulated stress using Dexamethasone (Dex) administration, was determined. The birds were fed diets with or without YE or VD supplements during wks of 6, 11 and 15 post hatch. At weeks 6 and 15 of age, half of the birds in each treatment group received 3 intramuscular injections of Dex at concentrations of 2 mg/kg BW on 3 alternating days to induce simulated stress. At 16 wk of age, the birds were weighed, bled prior to euthanasia and the tibia were harvested at necropsy to determine their mineral content, density and biomechanical properties. Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Bone Mineral Content (BMC) of whole tibia were determined by Dual Energy X ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and the biomechanical properties using Instron material testing machine. The ash yield and bone densities were determined using bone marrow free mid diphyseal segments manually by ashing and Archimedes principle. Serum Ca, P, protein and alkaline phosphatase measured using a clinical chemistry analyzer. Neither YE nor VD had any effect on body or bone weights by itself or in combination. Dex reduced both BW and bone weights. DEXA estimated BMD and BMC of whole tibia were reduced in Dex-stressed birds {{but it was not}} evident measuring the diaphyseal bone and ash densities. Dex treatment lowered the breaking strength and the plasticity of bone but had no significant effect on its stiffness. Dex treated turkeys showed higher relative bone weights indicating faster recovery of bones from Dex induced growth suppression. Overall, these results suggest that decreased bone mass due to Dex-induced growth suppression reduces bone strength and can alter some structural properties. Intermittent treatment with either VD or YE individually or in combinations do not provide much protection against the negative effects of stress...|$|R
