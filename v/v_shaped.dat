This formal, {{group work}} shows {{high-ranking}} women {{dressed in the}} contemporary fashion of high—here divided—hennin and <b>v</b> <b>shaped</b> neck-lines.|$|E
2500|$|The frog is a <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> {{structure}} that extends forwards across {{about two-thirds of}} the sole. Its thickness grows from the front to the back and, at the back, it merges with the heel periople. In its midline, it has a central groove (sulcus), that extends up between the bulbs.|$|E
2500|$|The tailplane, {{attached}} {{to the top of}} the fuselage was triangular, without eternal bracing and carrying elevators with a <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> gap to allow rudder movement. [...] The fin was very small and triangular; the rudder hinge ran from fin tip to the bottom of the fuselage. [...] Control wires ran externally from about halfway down the rear fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>V</b> <b>shape</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic yo-yo shapes. Starting with a low wall, close to the bearing, it rises {{straight}} up and out to the edges, with no steps or other distortions. The catch zone resembles a steep <b>V</b> <b>shape,</b> hence the name.|$|R

5000|$|V shaped: Tree is {{cut to a}} low wire 15 to 18 {{inches from}} the ground; two buds {{lengthen}} into branches which are attached to canes that keep them straight, and the canes are attached to another wire that maintains a <b>V</b> <b>shape.</b> The <b>V</b> <b>shape</b> {{is the first step}} in producing many other formal patterns.|$|R
2500|$|Evidence {{of fishing}} along the Trent {{can be traced}} back to the Neolithic period, with the {{possible}} remnants of a fish weir discovered in the abandoned river channels at Hemington. More definitive finds from the medieval period were also found at this site and [...] near Colwick. These consisted of <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> alignments of stakes; wattle panels and a large wicker trap and demonstrate that passive fishing techniques were in use on the river.|$|E
2500|$|Hills or ridges {{in front}} of the {{railroad}} road bed would have to have a flat-bottomed, <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> [...] "cut" [...] made to get the railroad through the ridge or hill. The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade--cut and fill construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment {{that could be used to}} make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by wheelbarrow and/or horse or mule cart or blast it loose. To blast a <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> cut out, they had to drill several holes up to [...] deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way though the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill. Initially, many valleys were bridged by [...] "temporary" [...] trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier—load it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and dump it over the side of the trestle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{designer}} of the Pirate was the experienced Harold Boultbee, who had recently produced the Civilian Coupé, and construction began early in 1935. The high wings were straight edged, but tapered, slightly swept {{on the leading edge}} and fully slotted. [...] The trailing edge carried differential ailerons and interacting flaps. A pair of <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> lift struts ran from the two wing spars down to the lower fuselage side where there was a universal joint to facilitate wing folding. [...] The folding mechanism was unusual: unlocked, the wings slid forward and tipped leading edge down, so that when the front spar was released from its fitting the wings could fold rearwards and downwards about the rear spar. [...] Because of the initial forward movement, the folded length was less {{than it would have been}} with conventional geometries.|$|E

5000|$|Horizontal T, also {{referred}} to as a horizontal cordon: Branches are trained horizontally along evenly spaced wires. Start with a <b>V</b> <b>shape</b> where a third bud is trained straight up to another wire. Train other two branches to stepover. In spring of second year prune the vertical stem to the second wire and again train to a <b>V</b> <b>shape,</b> etc. It takes one year per each level.|$|R

2500|$|The horse's {{circulatory system}} {{includes}} the four-chambered heart, averaging [...] in weight, {{as well as}} the blood and blood vessels. Its main purpose is to circulate blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and to remove waste from these tissues. The hoof (including the frog - the <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> part {{on the bottom of the}} horses hoof) is a very important part of the circulatory system. As the horse puts weight onto the hoof, the hoof wall is pushed outwards and the frog compressed, driving blood out of the frog, the digital pad, and the laminae of the hoof. [...] When weight is removed from the hoof, the release of pressure pulls blood back down into the foot again. [...] This effectively creates an auxiliary blood-pumping system at the end of each leg. [...] Some of this effect is lost when a horse is shod (eliminating the expansion and contraction of the hoof wall and raising the frog higher from the ground).|$|E
2500|$|At the Battle of Gettysburg, Baxter's I Corps brigade arrived {{around noon}} just as Confederate Maj. Gen. Robert Rodes's 8,000 man {{division}} {{began to appear}} on Oak Hill. Baxter's brigade advanced far beyond the nearest Federal brigade on the right flank {{of the line and}} deployed in a <b>V</b> <b>shaped</b> formation along the Mummasburg Road. Rodes's division attacked piecemeal, and scores of Colonel Edward A. O'Neal's men were mowed down. Shortly afterward, a Confederate brigade under Colonel Alfred Iverson advanced without skirmishers and moved past Baxter's men, who were hidden behind a stone wall. Suddenly, the men of Baxter's brigade rose up and delivered a lethal fire into the North Carolinians. In one of the most one-sided exchanges during the war, Baxter's surprise attack killed, wounded and captured 758 of 1300 men in Confederate Iverson's brigade and eliminated it as an effective fighting force in under ten minutes. Running low on ammunition, Baxter's men withdrew to the north end of Cemetery Ridge, having lost all of the officers on Baxter's staff and close to half the brigade in defense of the I Corps right flank. He received glowing praise from his division commander, Maj. Gen. John C. Robinson, and a subordinate wrote that, [...] "I wish to say one word outside of my regiment in regard to Generals Baxter and Robinson. They were on every part of the field, encouraging and stimulating the men by their presence and bravery." ...|$|E
