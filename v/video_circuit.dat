5000|$|In analog <b>video</b> <b>circuits,</b> {{impedance}} mismatch can cause [...] "ghosting", where the time-delayed {{echo of the}} principal image appears as a weak and displaced image (typically {{to the right of}} the principal image). In high-speed digital systems, such as HD video, reflections result in interference and potentially corrupt signal.|$|R
50|$|One {{director}} {{who did not}} partake in the home <b>video</b> <b>circuit</b> is Takeshi Kitano, whose existential yakuza films are known {{around the world for}} a unique style. His films use harsh edits, minimalist dialogue, odd humor, and extreme violence that began with Sonatine (1993) and was perfected in Hana-bi (1997).|$|E
50|$|Not {{strictly}} an operating system, the MGR windowing system run under 1616/OS, but usurped the console video and keyboard, and added virtual tty devices for each window.

50|$|The Devonsville Terror {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} in Lincoln County, Wisconsin in 1983, and {{was intended for}} a theatrical release but instead hit the home <b>video</b> <b>circuit</b> in 1984 through Embassy Home Entertainment. The most recent home video release for the film was in 1999, released on both VHS {{as well as a}} double billing DVD paired with Lommel's The Boogeyman (1980).|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} <b>video</b> <b>circuits</b> of the era, {{it does not}} offer dynamic RAM refresh capabilities. Thus the VIC-20 {{employed}} the more expensive static RAM chips; but with the low RAM capacity of that machine, just 5 KB in the main box, that didn't matter too much. Memory expansions for the VIC-20 either used SRAM as well or implemented their own refresh circuit.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{conflicts}} resulting from the CPU and the <b>video</b> <b>circuits</b> both accessing the shared main memory ("snowing"), CPU memory access is constrained to occur on microsecond boundaries, effectively padding every CPU instruction to a multiple of four CPU cycles. As typical Z80 instructions require three or four CPU cycles, the resulting loss of processing power is minor, reducing the effective clock rate to approximately 3.3 MHz.|$|R

50|$|The {{standard}} {{video signal}} (or more precisely composite video signal) is a signal {{with a maximum}} level of 1 volt into 75 Ω. In this signal 0.3 volt corresponds to black and 1 volt corresponds to white. The 0.0 volt to 0.3 volt range is reserved for the sync pulses. <b>Video</b> <b>circuits</b> are designed around these limits. These limits apply to recording on analogue video tape and analogue transmission {{as well as in}} analogue to digital video converters.|$|R
50|$|In <b>video</b> <b>circuits,</b> {{electrical}} ringing causes closely spaced repeated {{ghosts of}} a vertical or diagonal edge where dark changes to light or vice versa, going {{from left to}} right. In a CRT the electron beam upon changing from dark to light or vice versa instead of changing quickly to the desired intensity and staying there, overshoots and undershoots a few times. This bouncing could occur anywhere in the electronics or cabling and is often caused by or accentuated by a too high setting of the sharpness control.|$|R

5000|$|The film {{did not do}} well at box-office; it {{recovered}} {{its cost}} mainly due to business from big cities, but did not {{turn out to be}} a massive hit contrary to everyone's expectations. It earned an excess of [...] The lack of publicity and tough competition from other films of that year including Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!, Krantiveer and 1942: A Love Story were reasons for it to fail. All of these films were very strong in their box office presence and Andaz Apna Apna, belonging to a different genre, could not compete well. It has however in subsequent years, achieved a cult classic status among Hindi audiences. Each dialogue and character of the movie are immensely likeable and have terrific recall.

50|$|The 1200XL {{included}} {{a number of}} missing or poorly implemented features. The PBI expansion connector from the original 1000X design was left off, making the design rely entirely on the SIO port again. Frustrating this {{was the fact that}} the +12V pin in the SIO port was left unconnected; only +5V power was available which made a few devices stop working. An improved <b>video</b> <b>circuit</b> provided more chroma for a more colorful image, but the chroma line was not connected to the monitor port, the only place that could make use of it. Even the re-arrangement of the ports made some joysticks and cartridges difficult or impossible to use. Changes made to the operating system to support the new hardware also resulted in compatibility problems with some older software that did not follow published guidelines. Considered as a whole, the differences between the 1200 and earlier machines was minor, or even retrograde.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1960s, Forest (born 1933, Algeria) began {{a series}} of actions using of {{audiovisual}} and communication technologies to challenge conventional artistic media and activity. Images of many works are available at Webnetmuseum He projected slides onto his paintings (Tableau Ecran, 1963), initiated community events in impoverished neighborhoods (Family Portrait, 1967), and used video to engage social spaces ("Mur d’Arles and Cabine Telephonique", 1967). In the early 1970s, his utilization of the press and video as tools of social engagement and political provocation expanded. In January 1972, Forest began his [...] "Space Media" [...] project by placing a blank rectangle in the newspaper Le Monde and inviting readers to fill it in and mail it to him. For an exhibition entitled “Archeology of the Present” (“Archeologie du present”) at the Galerie Germain, Paris, in May 1972, Forest took the street where the gallery was located, Rue Guénegaud, as a topic, creating a <b>video</b> <b>circuit</b> displaying the street in the gallery and the gallery in the windows facing the street and collecting trash from the street to show in the gallery. Pierre Restany carried out short interviews with passersby for an episode of “Forum des Arts", aired on May 13, 1973. In June 1973, with the collaboration of the philosopher Vilem Flusser and sociologist Philippe Butaud, Forest set up a video studio in a community of retirees to launch a video exchange in the south of France ("Video Troisieme Age", 1973). On the occasion of the XII Bienal de São Paulo in October 1973, he effectuated a series of events, including a version of Space Media, a sociological walk, and a procession through the city center with participants holding white placards ("Blancs evanhit la ville"), all of which were provocations {{in the face of the}} established military dictatorship. Always highly critical of those in power, committed to participatory art, and deeply engaged with new communication technologies, Forest would continue these pursuits after joining the collective in October 1974.|$|E
