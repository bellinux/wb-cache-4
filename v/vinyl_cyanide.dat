Frequency-modulated spectrometers combined into a single broadband 50 - 1900 GHz spectrum provided measurements of CH_ 2 CHCN covering a spectral range of 18 - 1893 GHz, whose assignments was confirmed by Stark modulation spectra in the 18 - 40 GHz region and by ab-initio anharmonic force field calculations. For analyzing the emission lines of CH_ 2 CHCN species detected in Orion-KL we used the excitation and radiative transfer code (MADEX) at LTE conditions.

The four molecules have been detected trough pure rotational transitions in the course of a 3 mm line survey carried out with the IRAM 30 -m telescope. The molecular column densities are derived by constructing rotational temperature diagrams. A detailed chemical model of the circumstellar envelope is used to analyze the formation of these molecular species. We have found column densities in the range 5 x 10 ^(12) - 2 x 10 ^(13) cm^(- 2), which translates to abundances relative to H 2 of several 10 ^(- 9). The chemical model is reasonably successful in explaining the derived abundances through gas phase synthesis in the cold outer envelope. We also find that some of these molecules, CH 2 CHCN and CH 2 CN, are most probably excited trough infrared pumping to excited vibrational states. The detection of these species stresses the similarity between the molecular content of cold dark clouds and C-rich circumstellar envelopes.

We analyse the {{excitation}} of 114 rotational transitions of <b>vinyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> (acrylonitrile), C 2 H 3 CN, in its ν 11 and ν 15 vibrational states, {{together with}} 98 transitions {{in the ground}} state. The data {{were taken from the}} SEST line survey of Sgr B 2 (N) in the 1. 3 mm band. For the lines with energies above 200 K a rotational temperature of 440 + 190 − 90 K,aC 2 H 3 CN column density of 5. 1 + 7. 2 − 2. 5 × 1018 cm− 2, and a source size in the range 0. 025 – 0. 037 pc are most consistent with observations. The resulting abundance of C 2 H 3 CN is about 6 × 10 − 8. Weargue that the high rotation temperature of the high-energy lines is most likely due to direct radiative excitation through far-infrared emission from hot dust. A Monte-Carlo analysis was applied to the radiative transfer of the lines with upper-state energies below 200 K. A good fit to the intensities of the a-type lines is achieved by a model cloud with a fractional C 2 H 3 CN abundance of 4 × 10 − 10. By increasing the abundance to 6 × 10 − 9 in the outer portion of the cloud also the intensities of the b-type lines could be reasonably well fitted. This model is, however, inconsistent with the low intensities of low-energy a-type lines observed at longer wavelengths. Hence, we favour a constant C 2 H 3 CN abundance of 4 × 10 − 10 in the part of the cloud where the kinetic temperature is below 180 K, and regard the excitation of the intrinsically weak b-type lines as anomalous...|$|E

In contest, the isonitriles and a few exceptional nitrites and related species produce bands at lower frequencies spanning the 2200 - 2080 /cm (4. 55 - 4. 81 micron) range. These features also have similar positions in both Am and H 2 O matrices and the bands are broader in the H 2 O matrices. Three of the compounds (pyruvonitrile, dicyandiamide, and cyanamide) show unusually large shifts of their C(is congruent to) N stretching frequencies when changing from Ar to H 2 O matrices. We attribute these shifts to the formation of H 2 O:nitrile complexes with these compounds. The implications of these results for the identification of the 2165 /cm (4. 62 micron) "XCN" interstellar feature and the 4550 /cm (2. 2 micron) feature of various objects in the solar system are discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vinyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> (C 2 H 3 CN) is theorized {{to form in}} Titan's {{atmosphere}} via high-altitude photochemistry and is {{of interest}} regarding the astrobiology of cold planetary surfaces due to its predicted ability to form cell membrane-like structures (azotosomes) in liquid methane. In this work, we follow up on the initial spectroscopic detection of C 2 H 3 CN on Titan by Palmer et al. with the detection of three new C 2 H 3 CN rotational emission lines at submillimeter frequencies. These new, high-resolution detections have allowed for the first spatial distribution mapping of C 2 H 3 CN on Titan. We present simultaneous observations of C 2 H 5 CN, HC 3 N, and CH 3 CN emission, and obtain the first (tentative) detection of C 3 H 8 (propane) at radio wavelengths. We present disk-averaged vertical abundance profiles, two-dimensional spatial maps, and latitudinal flux profiles for the observed nitriles. Similarly to HC 3 N and C 2 H 5 CN, which are theorized to be short-lived in Titan's atmosphere, C 2 H 3 CN is most abundant over the southern (winter) pole, whereas the longer-lived CH 3 CN is more concentrated in the north. This abundance pattern {{is consistent with the}} combined effects of high-altitude photochemical production, poleward advection, and the subsequent reversal of Titan's atmospheric circulation system following the recent transition from northern to southern winter. We confirm that C 2 H 3 CN and C 2 H 5 CN are most abundant at altitudes above 200 km. Using a 300 km step model, the average abundance of C 2 H 3 CN is found to be 3. 03 ± 0. 29 ppb, with a C 2 H 5 CN/C 2 H 3 CN abundance ratio of 2. 43 ± 0. 26. Our HC 3 N and CH 3 CN spectra can be accurately modeled using abundance gradients above the tropopause, with fractional scale-heights of 2. 05 ± 0. 16 and 1. 63 ± 0. 02, respectively...|$|E

(2016), A Systematic Study on the Prep­aration and Hydrogen Storage of Zeolite 13 X-Templated Microporous Carbons. European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry, which has been published in final form at doi: 10. 1002 /ejic. 201501180. A systematic study on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) -based synthesis strategies (single CVD process, double CVD process and a combination of liquid impregnation and a CVD process) for the nanocasting of zeolite-templated porous carbon materials with commercially available zeolite 13 X as hard template and ethylene, furfuryl alcohol, acetonitrile and/or <b>vinyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> as carbon precursor is presented. The {{results indicated that the}} combination of liquid impregnation and CVD is superior to the single or the double CVD processes in producing carbon materials with high surface area, high pore volume and high microporosity. The combination of liquid impregnation with furfuryl alcohol and CVD with ethylene generates carbon materials with the highest surface area of 2841 m 2 /g, a pore volume of 1. 54 cm 3 /g and a hydrogen-uptake capacity of 6. 3 wt. -% (at – 196 °C and 20 bar). Under the studied conditions, the porous carbon materials exhibit variable structural ordering and tuneable textural properties with surface areas of 1600 – 2850 m 2 /g, pore volumes of 1. 0 – 1. 8 cm 3 /g and hydrogen-uptake capacities in the range of 3. 4 – 6. 3 wt. -% (at – 196 °C and 20 bar). Notably, linear relationships between the hydrogen-uptake capacity and the total surface area, the micropore volume and the micropore surface area were found for the studied porous carbons, and this implies an important role of the total surface area, the micropore volume and the micropore surface area in the hydrogen adsorption.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of amino acids in meteorites and {{the detection of}} glycine in samples returned from a comet to Earth suggest that the interstellar chemistry is capable of producing such complex organic molecules. Our goal is to investigate the degree of chemical complexity that can be reached in the ISM. We performed an unbiased, spectral line survey toward Sgr B 2 (N) and (M) with the IRAM 30 m telescope in the 3 mm window. The spectra were analyzed with a simple radiative transfer model that assumes LTE but takes optical depth effects into account. About 3675 and 945 spectral lines with a peak signal-to-noise ratio higher than 4 are detected toward N and M, i. e. about 102 and 26 lines per GHz, respectively. This represents an increase by about a factor of 2 over previous surveys of Sgr B 2. About 70 % and 47 % of the lines detected toward N and M are identified and assigned to 56 and 46 distinct molecules {{as well as to}} 66 and 54 less abundant isotopologues of these molecules, respectively. We also report the detection of transitions from 59 and 24 catalog entries corresponding to vibrationally or torsionally excited states of some of these molecules, respectively. Excitation temperatures and column densities were derived for each species but should be used with caution. Among the detected molecules, aminoacetonitrile, n-propyl cyanide, and ethyl formate were reported {{for the first time in}} space based on this survey, as were 5 rare isotopologues of <b>vinyl</b> <b>cyanide,</b> cyanoacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide. We also report the detection of transitions from within 12 new vib. or tors. excited states of known molecules. Although the large number of unidentified lines may still allow future identification of new molecules, we expect most of these lines to belong to vib. or tors. excited states or to rare isotopologues of known molecules for which spectroscopic predictions are currently missing.

40|$|We present strong detections of {{methyl cyanide}} (CH 3 CN), <b>vinyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> (CH 2 CHCN), ethyl cyanide (CH 3 CH 2 CN) and cyanodiacetylene (HC 4 CN) {{molecules}} with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) toward the Sgr B 2 (N) molecular cloud. Attempts {{to detect the}} corresponding isocyanide isomers were only successful {{in the case of}} methyl isocyanide (CH 3 NC) for its J(sub K) = 1 (sub 0) - 0 (sub 0) transition, which is the first interstellar report of this line. To determine the spatial distribution of CH 3 NC, we used archival Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array data for the J(sub K) = 1 (sub 0) - 0 (sub 0) transitions but no emission was detected. From ab initio calculations, the bonding energy difference between the cyanide and isocyanide molecules is greater than 8500 per centimeter (greater than 12, 000 K). Thus, cyanides are the more stable isomers and would likely be formed more preferentially over their isocyanide counterparts. That we detect CH 3 NC emission with a single antenna (Gaussian beamsize(omega(sub B)) = 1723 arcsec(sup 2)) but not with an interferometer (omega(sub b) = 192 arcsec(sup 2)), strongly suggests that CH 3 NC has a widespread spatial distribution toward the Sgr B 2 (N) region. Other investigators have shown that CH 3 CN is present both in the LMH hot core of Sgr B 2 (N) and in the surrounding medium, while we have shown that CH 3 NC appears to be deficient in the LMH hot core. Thus, largescale, non-thermal processes in the surrounding medium may account for the conversion of CH 3 CN to CH 3 NC while the LMH hot core, which is dominated by thermal processes, does not produce a significant amount of CH 3 NC. Ice analog experiments by other investigators have shown that radiation bombardment of CH 3 CN can produce CH 3 NC, thus supporting our observations. We conclude that isomers separated by such large bonding energy differences are distributed in different interstellar environments, making the evaluation of column density ratios between such isomers irrelevant unless it can be independently shown that these species are co-spatial...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{observations}} {{carried out}} with the IRAM 30 -meter telescope. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN (Spain). [...] Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. We report on the detection of <b>vinyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> (CH 2 CHCN), cyanomethyl radical (CH 2 CN), methylacetylene (CH 3 CCH) and thioformaldehyde (H 2 CS) in the C-rich star IRC + 10216. These species, which are all known to exist in dark clouds, are detected {{for the first time}} in the circumstellar envelope around an AGB star. The four molecules have been detected trough pure rotational transitions in the course of a 3 mm line survey {{carried out with}} the IRAM 30 -m telescope. The molecular column densities are derived by constructing rotational temperature diagrams. A detailed chemical model of the circumstellar envelope is used to analyze the formation of these molecular species. We have found column densities in the range 5 x 10 ^(12) - 2 x 10 ^(13) cm^(- 2), which translates to abundances relative to H 2 of several 10 ^(- 9). The chemical model is reasonably successful in explaining the derived abundances through gas phase synthesis in the cold outer envelope. We also find that some of these molecules, CH 2 CHCN and CH 2 CN, are most probably excited trough infrared pumping to excited vibrational states. The detection of these species stresses the similarity between the molecular content of cold dark clouds and C-rich circumstellar envelopes. However, some differences in the chemistry are indicated by the fact that in IRC + 10216 partially saturated carbon chains are present at a lower level than those which are highly unsaturated, while in TMC- 1 both types of species have comparable abundances.

40|$|Deuteration is a {{powerful}} tracer {{of the history of}} the cold prestellar phase in star forming regions. Apart from methanol, little is known about deuterium fractionation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium, especially in high mass star forming regions. We use a spectral line survey performed with ALMA to search for deuterated complex organic molecules toward the hot molecular core Sgr B 2 (N 2). Population diagrams and integrated intensity maps are constructed to fit rotational temperatures and emission sizes for each molecule. Column densities are derived by modelling the full spectrum under the LTE assumption. The results are compared to predictions of two astrochemical models that treat the deuteration process. We report the detection of CH 2 DCN toward Sgr B 2 (N 2) with a deuteration level of 0. 4 %, and tentative detections of CH 2 DOH, CH 2 DCH 2 CN, the chiral molecule CH 3 CHDCN, and DC 3 N with levels in the range 0. 05 %- 0. 12 %. A stringent deuteration upper limit is obtained for CH 3 OD (< 0. 07 %). Upper limits in the range 0. 5 - 1. 8 % are derived for the three deuterated isotopologues of <b>vinyl</b> <b>cyanide,</b> the four deuterated species of ethanol, and CH 2 DOCHO. Ethyl cyanide is less deuterated than methyl cyanide by at least a factor five. Except for methyl cyanide, the measured deuteration levels lie at least a factor four below the predictions of current astrochemical models. The deuteration levels in Sgr B 2 (N 2) are also lower than in Orion KL by a factor of a few up to a factor ten. The discrepancy between the deuteration levels of Sgr B 2 (N 2) and the predictions of chemical models, and the difference between Sgr B 2 (N 2) and Orion KL may both be due to the higher kinetic temperatures that characterize the Galactic Center region compared to nearby clouds. Alternatively, they may result from a lower overall abundance of deuterium itself in the Galactic Center region by up to a factor ten.
