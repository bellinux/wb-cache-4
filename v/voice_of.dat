40|$|This study {{opened up}} avenues for {{exploring}} the dismembering effects of trauma and the “re-membering” process of healing. Six participants engaged in a 60 - to 90 -minute semi-structured interview modelled after Elliot’s Change Interview. Utilizing the Listening Guide, the research team identified voices speaking about trauma and recovery. The voices were grouped into three categories: the <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> trauma’s dismembering effects, the <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> turning towards the pain, and the <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> healing. Among the <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> trauma’s dismembering effects were disconnection, dissociation, impasse, and pain. <b>Voices</b> <b>of</b> turning towards the pain included the <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> active acceptance and <b>of</b> mourning. <b>Voices</b> <b>of</b> healing included the <b>voices</b> <b>of</b> personal essence, integration, astonishment, agency, and calm and peace. Examining these voices, we traced patterns of shifting from fragmentation, aloneness, and numbness to wholeness, connection, and presence. This progression highlights the fulfilled potential of personhood through the transformational process of healing in therapy. TraumaHealingWholenessLifespan Integration therapyListening Guid...|$|R
