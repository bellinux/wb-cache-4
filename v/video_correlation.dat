Unlike single stream processing, correlations between different video streams require a distributed execution system to observe a new correlation constraint that any two correlated data must be distributed to the same host. ViCo achieves three unique features: (1) correlation-awareness that ViCo can guarantee the correlation accuracy while spreading excessive workload on multiple hosts; (2) adaptability that the system can adjust algorithm behaviors and switch between different algorithms to adapt to dynamic stream environments; and (3) finegranularity that the workload of one resource-intensive correlation request can be divided and distributed among multiple hosts.

A four-point dynamic susceptibility is deduced from <b>video</b> <b>correlations,</b> and is found to exhibit a peak that grows in height and shifts to longer times as the jamming transition is approached from two different directions. In particular, the time for particle-size root-mean square relative displacements is found to scale as τ^* ∼ (γ̇Δϕ^ 4) ^- 1 where γ̇ is the strain rate and Δϕ=|ϕ-ϕ_c| is {{the distance from the}} random close packing volume fraction. The typical number of particles in a dynamical heterogeneity is deduced from the susceptibility peak height and found to scale as n^* ∼ (γ̇Δϕ^ 4) ^- 0. 3.

40|$|Abstract—Utilizing <b>video</b> <b>correlations</b> among views would {{definitely}} improve multiview video compression {{in terms of}} coding efficiency, which usually requests an expensive system to collect videos from different cameras and jointly compress them. Thanks to recent developments on distributed video coding, this paper proposes a new multiview video coding scheme based on Wyner–Ziv (WZ) coding technique, in which the complicated temporal and interview correlation exploration process is shifted from the encoder side to the decoder side so that broadband raw data traffic and high intensive computation for jointly encoding can be avoided. At the encoder side, a wavelet-based WZ scheme is proposed to compress video of every camera. Furthermore, {{in order to better}} utilize correlation in wavelet domain, all coefficients are organized as that done in SPIHT bit plane by bit plane. At the decoder side, a more flexible prediction technique that can jointly utilize temporal and view correlations is proposed to generate side information. Finally, experimental results show the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional intra-frame coding for better random access and is even close to the inter-frame coding for better efficiency. Furthermore, compressed data is much robust when it is transmitted over an error-prone channel.

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a behavior-based similarity measure {{that tells us}} whether two different space-time intensity patterns of two different video segments could have resulted from a similar underlying motion field. This is done directly from the intensity information, without explicitly computing the underlying motions. Such a measure allows us to detect similarity between video segments of differently dressed people performing {{the same type of}} activity. It requires no foreground/background segmentation, no prior learning of activities, and no motion estimation or tracking. Using this behavior-based similarity measure, we extend the notion of two-dimensional image correlation into the three-dimensional space-time volume and thus allowing to correlate dynamic behaviors and actions. Small space-time video segments (small video clips) are “correlated ” against the entire video sequences in all three dimensions (x, y, and t). Peak correlation values correspond to video locations with similar dynamic behaviors. Our approach can detect very complex behaviors in video sequences (for example, ballet movements, pool dives, and running water), even when multiple complex activities occur simultaneously within the field of view of the camera. We further show its robustness to small changes in scale and orientation of the correlated behavior.
