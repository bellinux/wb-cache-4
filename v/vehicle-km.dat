40|$|Road pricing aims {{to reduce}} the amount that is driven and thereby it can reduce the number of road {{accidents}} and casualties. The SWOV has calculated the road safety effects following the introduction of a road pricirig scheme called 'Anders Betalen voor Mobiliteit'. This road pricing scheme has a different aeffect on the use of passenger cars, heavy goods vehicles and minivans whereas it has no aeffect on other modes (e. g. cycling and motorcycling). Furthermore, a different payment for mobility affects the number ofvehicle kilometres driven on the major and minor road networks in- and outside the built up areas in different ways. By applying the most commonly occurring confficts (e. g. car-bicycle) to the modelled traffic exposure (<b>vehicle-kms</b> driven) of the different transport modes and on the different road networks, estimates of the road safety effects could be calculated. Depending on the modelled scenario, the pricing strategy and the introduction of a peak hour tariff, a different payment for mobility can result in between 3, 7 % and 6, 9 % fewer traffic related fatalities in the target year 2020. The resulting benefit to society will amount to a saving of € 450 to € 850 million annually. (Author/publisher...|$|R
40|$|The Full Cost of Intercity Transportation Page ES- 1 This study {{evaluates the}} full cost of three modes of {{intercity}} transportation: air, highway, and high speed rail. The evaluation is done {{within the context of the}} California Corridor, connecting the Los Angeles Basin and the San Francisco Bay Area. The purpose of evaluating full cost is to compare the economic implications of investment in, or expansion of, any of these three modes. The scope of the analysis is full transportation cost. Full transportation costs includes external, or social cost, in addition to the internal costs of construction, operation and maintenance. In this study we include estimates of four types of external, social costs: accidents, congestion, noise, and air pollution. The 677 kilometer corridor for which these estimates are computed represents one of the alignments of a proposed high speed rail system between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The methodology used is to construct cost functions that relate costs to levels of output, as measured by passenger-kms. or <b>vehicle-kms.</b> Different types of costs are estimated as permitted by available data. These include short run costs, in which the physical capacity is held fixed; and long run functions in which capacity is allowed to expand to meet higher levels of demand. Average and marginal costs are computed for highway and for air transportation. But given the absence of high speed rail systems in California only average costs are estimated. The highway and air cost models are developed from basic principles and are estimated with actual data and system design characteristics observed in the California corridor. Rail costs are estimated with models that have been adapted from estimates for the French high speed rail system, the TGV, using available data for their estimation. Based on the results summarized in Chapter 7 and shown in Table 7. 1, we find that {{the full cost}} of air transportation for the California Corridor ($ 0. 1315 per passenger-kilometer traveled (pkt)) is significantly less costly than the other two modes. The full cost of high speed rail and highway transportation cost approximately the same; rail costs $ 0. 2350 /pkt and highway costs $ 0. 2302 /pkt. The internal, or private, monetary costs comprising infrastructure, carrier, and vehicle operating costs are clearly highest for rail ($ 0. 19 /pkt), followed by air ($ 0. 11 /pkt) and then highway ($ 0. 10 /pkt). And as is to be expected, user time costs are highest for the slowest mode, the highway system, followed by rail and then air. Adding user travel time costs to the monetary costs results in the total internal system costs per passenger-km. of $ 0. 124 for air; $ 0. 233 for rail; and $ 0. 198 for highway. In other words, if we disregard external costs then we find that high speed rail is nearly twice as costly as air and that the highway is not far behind. However, if we look at social costs alone [...] congestion, air pollution, noise, and accidents [...] we find that high speed rail is clearly less costly than the other modes. In this research the only measurable social cost of high speed rail is that of noise, which at $ 0. 002 /pkt, is significantly lower than that of air at $ 0. 0043 /pkt and highway at $ 0. 0045 /pkt. Highway transportation, on the other hand, has a relatively high cost in terms of air pollution and accidents, two externalities which are virtually absent in high speed rail. In this study, we consider that the pollution resulting from the electric power generation used to drive a train is to be allocated to the energy, and not the transportation sector. Thus, any pollution externality associated with high speed rail should be already internalized in a higher price for electricity. Similarly, a 100 % safe system, such as high speed rail, implies higher capital costs due to construction of grade separations, more intelligent systems, etc [...] . Hence, the avoidance of accidents by high speed trains is not "free". Therefore, high speed rail, while more costly than highway transportation in terms of internal costs, primarily due to its high capital cost, is significantly less costly than highway in terms of social costs. This comparison is illustrated in the following figure, where full costs are broken down into three categories: internal, travel time, and external.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to examine and}} forecast impacts of telecommuting on <b>vehicle-km</b> travelled in urban areas. The impact of telecommuting including the change of commuting trips as well as non-commuting trips are estimated in term of network <b>vehicle-km</b> saved. The model to calculate the reduction of commuting trips is explained using a concept diagram and mathematical expressions. A formulation is developed to form the model specific to examine impacts on <b>vehicle-km</b> travelled. A classification of telecommuting into full-day and part-day telecommuting is proposed to allow the systematic evaluation of impacts of the full or part substitution of journeys to work with arrangements to work at alternative locations. The proposed model accounts {{for a range of}} variables including employment, telecommuting proportion, telecommuting frequency, transport mode split and a number of transport network performance measures. Travel pattern adjustments of commuters when telecommuting arrangements introduced are also quantified in the model. The growth of telecommuting is simulated using the Logistic function of the technological substitution. The model has been calibrated from aggregate results of previous telecommuting studies. The model aims to enable the simulation of transport scenarios under different employment attendance arrangements to assist decisions related to allocation of funds and resources to promote telecommuting.

40|$|AbstractSparse Road Networks are {{dominant}} in Indonesia, e. g. the regency, the provincial {{and the national}} road network. For these cases, measuring the network quality, apart from the physical qualities of the road segments and the intersections, is very important. The quality measure {{must be based on}} how the network can perform its function. Three main road network function as a measure of network quality are: to connect different points, to flow the traffic and to cover the area in a certain density. This paper is designated to present the research result on formulating the traffic flow quality as part of network quality and on developing its calculation method. It can be concluded that the research objectives have been attained, the traffic flow quality has been formulated and its calculation method has been also developed. Two type of measure of traffic flow quality: the flow itinerary quality and the flow fluidity quality. The fluidity quality deals with traffic engineering, which is already a lot developed. On the other hand the flow itinerary quality still has to be formulated. The flow itinerary quality is about whether for doing trip from point A to point B, the existing itinerary is say direct or going around. Thus the quality is formulated by a ratio between the existing itinerary length to the direct distance and a ratio between the existing <b>vehicle-km</b> flow to the direct distance <b>vehicle-km.</b> It needs a special calculation method to be practical.

40|$|Transport {{externalities}} such as {{costs of}} emissions and accidents {{are increasingly being}} used within appraisal and optimisation frameworks alongside the more traditional congestion analysis to set optimal transport policies. Models of externalities and costs of externalities may be implemented by a simple constant cost per <b>vehicle-km</b> approach or by more complex flow and speed dependent approaches. This paper investigates the impact of using both simple and more complex models of CO 2 emissions and cost of accidents on the optimal toll for car use and upon resulting welfare levels. The approach adopted {{is to use a}} single link model with a technical approach to the representation of the speed-flow relationship as this reflects common modelling practice. It is shown that using a more complex model of CO 2 emitted increases the optimal toll significantly compared to using a fixed cost approach while reducing CO 2 emitted only marginally. A number of accident models are used and the impact on tolls is shown to depend upon the assumptions made. Where speed effects are included in the accident model, accident costs can increase compared to the no toll equilibrium and so tolls should in this case be reduced compared to the congestion optimal toll. Finally it is shown that the effect of adding variable CO 2 emission models along with a fixed cost per <b>vehicle-km</b> for accidents can increase the optimal toll by 44 % while increasing the true welfare gained by only 8 %. The results clearly demonstrate that model assumptions for externalities can {{have a significant impact on}} the resulting policies and in the case of accidents the policies can be reversed...|$|E

The relevant tonne-kilometres and vehicle-kilometres data for UK registered as well as foreign registered vehicles were derived from DfT Road Freight Statistics [7] as revised in 2008 [10], and corresponding accident data for HGV’s during 2005 to 2007 were collected from DfT’s annual publication ‘Road Casualties Great Britain’ in from [6] to 2008. The Odds Ratios, which are equivalent to relative risks, for personal injury accidents of LHD HGV’s while driving in left side in the UK were estimated in relation to proportional annual <b>vehicle-km</b> driven. The average Odds Ratios for slight injury, serious injury and fatal accidents for LHD HGV’s during 2005 to 2007 were 1.69, 1.16 and 1.10 respectively. This implies that the LHD HGV’s were 69  %, 16  % and 10  % more at risk of participating a slight injury, serious injury and a fatal accident respectively than RHD HGV’s in the UK. The weighted average Odds Ratio for personal injury accident was 1.61 indicating that relative risk of driving LHD HGV’s having opposite steering wheel control was 61  % higher in comparison to RHD HGV’s in the UK. The same relative incremental risks for personal injury (+ 61  %) and fatal (+ 10  %) accidents were adopted {{in the present study}} for determination of accident impacts of HGV’s, having opposite-side steering wheel control, in Rwanda.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{one of a series of}} ITS working papers and {{technical}} notes describing the methodology and results of the EPSRC funded project "The definition of capacity in urban road networks : The role of area speed flow relationships". The objectives of the project were to investigate the interaction between vehicle-hours and <b>vehicle-km</b> within a network as the demand for travel increases; to develop improved area speed flow relationships; to use the relationships to explain the process by which networks reach capacity; and to assess the significance for the evaluation of road pricing policies. The approach used was to collect the vehicle-hours and the <b>vehicle-km</b> directly from a simulation model and thus create relationships between supply and demand in terms of veh-hours/hr and veh-km/hr demanded and also between times per trip and trips demanded. During the project two models were used. The first was a micro-simulation model called NEMIS. This model was used on hypothetical networks ranging from single link to a six by six grid and finally a ring-radial network. The networks were used to study the effects of changes in OD pattern and the effects of varying capacity on the resulting speed flow measures. The second model used was SATURN. This model was used to study the same ring-radial as before and a full SATURN model of Cambridge. The SATURN results were then taken one step further in that they were used to create an aggregate model of each network using SATURN in buffer only mode. The related papers discuss issues such as network aggregation. Note that the methodology and terminology was developed as the study progressed and that in particular the method varies between application of the two distinct models.

40|$|This study {{develops}} computation {{models to}} examine impacts of telecommuting on transport systems and environment for both macro and micro levels. Models {{have been developed}} as tools to analyse transport policy and transport control systems relating to telecommuting. For transport policy development, four performance evaluation models have been attempted to examine the reduction of traffic congestion, <b>vehicle-km</b> travelled, travel time and pollution of transport networks. These computation models are developed consistent with empirical data from the literature for the aggregate assessments. In this thesis these models are called macro-level assessment models. For operation and control, a model to determine changes of flow pattern by telecommuting is proposed. This model applies traffic engineering theory {{referred to as the}} network equilibrium problem. This model accounts for impacts at road link level and it is called the micro-level assessment model. This study also proposed a definition and a classification of telecommuting to serve the development of models mentioned above. The proposed definition is presented by the precise approach and the approach based on characteristics of telecommuting. A new classification is necessary due to impacts of full-day and part-day telecommuting on transport and environment being different. The proposed classification distinguishes between full-day and part-day telecommuting instead of full time and part time telecommuting as in previous studies. This framework is applied to develop computational models. Numerical examples of the macro-level assessment models are demonstrated for data of New South Wales and Ho Chi Minh City. The average numerical magnitude estimated is about 7 % for the reduction of traffic congestion in Ho Chi Minh City. The reduction of <b>vehicle-km</b> travelled in New South Wales is forecasted to be from 11 % to 15. 5 % and the maximum saving of travel time would reach to II% in 2021.

Australia had the peak in the mid to late 1970 s but has been successful thereafter in reducing the toll steadily.

PAH declines were comparable to those measured in tunnels for carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and particulate organic carbon. The historical PAH “source terms” determined from the data are relevant to quantifying the benefits of emissions control technology and can be used in epidemiological studies evaluating the health effects of exposure, such as those undertaken with breast cancer in New York State...|$|E
40|$|As a {{key element}} in the British government’s {{integrated}} transport policy, a comprehensive road safety strategy has as its focus casualty reduction targets for 2010. The strategy is presented in relation to ten themes and envisages addressing these through partnership with the relevant organisations and with road users in implementing new or enhanced policies for opening up or progressing further along twelve avenues of casualty reduction. The quantitative basis (in analysis of the likely effects of these policies, long term trends in casualty rates, and a range of possible levels and patterns of road use in 2010) is set out for advice to Ministers leading to their choice of casualty reduction targets for 2010 - 40 per cent fewer killed or seriously injured (including 50 per cent fewer children) and a 10 per cent lower rate of slightly injured per 100 m <b>vehicle-km</b> than the averages for the five years 1994 - 1998. The same analysis provides a transparent basis for monitoring and periodic review of progress towards the targets. The strategy includes commitment to further research into various aspects of road safety, and these and other related research requirements are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the cost}} bahaviour of motorway renewal costs {{with the aim}} to derive an estimate of marginal infrastructure costs per <b>vehicle-km</b> of trucks as part of optimal road user charges. The analysis is based on cross-sectional data of motorway renewal costs and traffic volume per motorway section in Germany during the period 1980 - 1999. The translog model estimated in this paper includes the factor input prices for labour, material and capital, the average annual daily traffic volume of trucks and passenger cars with the respective second-order terms. {{and a set of}} dummy variables for regions (the German länder) {{as well as for the}} type of material used for renewal as the most explanatory variables. In contrast to this, we could not find any significant influence of the age of motorway sections, the past renewal expenditures and the climate conditions measured as days with temperature fluctuations around zero. The cost elasticity, i. e. the relationship between marginal and average costs found in this analysis ranges from 0. 05 up to 1. 17 with a digressive increase of marginal costs. Cost functions, motorway renewal costs, marginal costs, infrastructure charging, road transport...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study how the maximum vehicle weight (76 t) will affect roundwood transportation in environmentally efficient transportation system. Actual traffic levels were assessed with calculations based on the vehicle configurations (60, 64, 68, and 76 t) a year after the weight limit was raised. Consequences of this change were also assessed for predicted future traffic levels. The reduction in operational <b>vehicle-km</b> was 12. 5 % (versus a decrease of 9. 3 % based on the legal weight), though this may underestimate the long-term prediction (26. 7 %) that will be achieved when the roundwood transportation sector adjusts fully to the higher maximum weight limit. The migration of loads to heavier vehicles did not create any wood harvesting problems for 60, 64 and 68 t vehicle configurations. However, 76 t vehicles were often volume-constrained, so it was harder to achieve the maximum weight. The main operational challenge was pulpwood (3. 5 and 4. 0 m) when onboard loaders were not available. Based on comparison of roundwood length measurements as an indicator of volume-constraint vehicles, the best practice system is discussed to enable an efficient transportation system for sustainable wood procurement...|$|E
