40|$|The morphodynamics of the John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Pass–Blind <b>Pass</b> dual {{inlet system}} were {{investigated}} based on hydrodynamic and morphology measurements, and numerical modeling. The co-existence of the dual inlets is realized by {{the dominance of}} mixed-energy John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass</b> in terms of tidal prism {{and size of the}} ebb delta and the artificial maintenance of the wave-dominated migratory Blind Pass. Due to the secondary role of Blind Pass, the aggressive anthropogenic activities there do not seem to have a significant influence on the morphodynamics of John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass.</b> On the other hand, the opening (in 1848) and subsequent evolution of John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass</b> had substantial influence on Blind Pass, causing it to migrate rapidly to the south. In addition, anthropogenic activities had much more influence on the morphodynamics of the secondary Blind Pass than that of the dominating John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass.</b> Results from numerical modeling provide a semi-quantitative understanding of the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass</b> and Blind Pass in association with cold front passages, which have substantial influences on inlet morphology. Two large eddies are modeled from the interactions between the southward longshore current and John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass</b> ebb and flood flow, respectively. These eddies are closely related to the morphodynamics of the channel margin linear bar and longshore transport divergence at the downdrift side. Both are key features of a mixed-energy inlet. The shallow water and wave-breaking-induced longshore current and elevated sediment suspension along the ebb delta terminal lobe provide the pathway for sediment bypassing. The morphodynamics of Blind Pass are dominated by wave forcing. The weak ebb jet is not capable of forming a sizable ebb delta and tends to be deflected by the strong longshore current, causing elevated longshore transport along the downdrift beach. The 90 -degree turn of the inlet, which is common for wave-dominated migratory inlets, results in weak ebb flushing along the updrift (north) side of the inlet, and is responsible for the alongshore migration of the inlet before the artificial stabilization and sedimentation along the northern side of the inlet following stabilization...|$|R

40|$|Tropical Storm Debby {{affected}} the Gulf coast of Florida in late June, 2012. The storm 2 ̆ 7 s southerly approach temporarily reversed the annual net southward longshore sediment transport. The energetic conditions associated with Tropical Storm Debby {{can be seen}} in the wind, wave and tidal measurements taken from both onshore and offshore weather stations around the dual tidal inlets system of John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass</b> and Blind Pass, approximately 25 kilometers north of the mouth of Tampa Bay. The energetic and persistent southerly forcing, in addition to higher storm induced water levels and wave heights, resulted in atypical beach erosion and sediment deposition on the ebb tidal deltas of the two inlets and the surrounding beaches. The John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass</b> ebb delta gained 60, 000 cubic meters of sediment and the Blind Pass ebb delta gained 9, 000 cubic meters as a result of the storm. Shoreline position, beach profile and offshore bathymetric surveys conducted before and after Tropical Storm Debby illustrate the changes in the coastal morphology such as the development of an offshore bar south of Blind Pass and erosion of the dry beach north and south of John 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Pass.</b> The Coastal Modeling System (CMS) was used to simulate wave and tide-driven current fields during the passage of the storm. The modeled wave field qualitatively illustrated the shadowing effect of the Tampa Bay ebb delta in reducing the southerly approaching storm wave energy arriving at the study area during the storm. The tidal flow patterns through the inlets and over the ebb tidal deltas were considerably different during the storm, as compared to normal tidal cycles...|$|R
