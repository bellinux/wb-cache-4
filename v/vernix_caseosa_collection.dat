Each had a protracted course with significant comorbidities requiring surgical and medical intervention. This contrasts with other reports suggesting that a rapid resolution can be expected. This cluster may be a consequence of the rising caesarean section rate, a heightened local awareness of the condition and possibly a result of leaving material in the paracolic gutters intraoperatively.

The specificity of lipids was investigated at the level of fatty acids in the total lipid extracts and intact lipids of several neutral lipid classes. Hydrocarbons, wax esters, cholesteryl esters, diol diesters and triacylglycerols were isolated using optimized semipreparative thin-layer chromatography, and the molecular species within each class were characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Statistical evaluation revealed significant quantitative sex-related differences in the lipid composition of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> among the newborns, pronounced in the two lipid classes associated with the activity of sebaceous glands.

40|$|<b>Vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> is {{a natural}} biofilm which covers {{the skin of a}} human fetus from the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy.

40|$|AbstractHyperbilirubinemia {{continues}} {{to pose a}} significant and common problem in the newborn period. Exposure of the brain {{to high levels of}} unconjugated bilirubin leads to acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, especially in preterm infants. Given the shared embryological origin of the skin (epidermis) and brain, we hypothesized that cutaneous binding of unconjugated bilirubin to skin (i. e., jaundice) might protect the immature brain. Support for this hypothesis requires direct quantification of binding of unconjugated bilirubin to cutaneous structures. Bilirubin binding was tested using a series of in vitro experiments wherein newborn skin and <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> were exposed to physiologically-relevant solutions of bilirubin. Tissue binding was assessed spectrophotometrically and via bilirubin autofluorescence. Study findings indicate the following: (1) unconjugated bilirubin binds quickly and avidly to thin films of vernix caseosa; (2) bilirubin binds to human epidermis in vitro via a mechanism involving dermal diffusion; (3) unconjugated bilirubin localizes to the dermis and epidermis as shown by autofluorescence; and (4) topical application of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> to the epidermis augments bilirubin binding; i. e., increases jaundice. These findings are consistent with a physiological neuroprotective role for the skin in shielding the immature brain from high levels of unconjugated bilirubin. New therapies based on these results are envisioned with the goal of increasing cutaneous bilirubin binding (jaundice) thereby protecting the developing brain and facilitating bilirubin excretion with phototherapy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> is a white, creamy, {{naturally}} occurring biofilm covering {{the skin of}} the fetus during the last trimester of pregnancy.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was to use semi-synthetic lipid {{mixtures}} to mimic the complex lipid composition, organization and thermotropic behaviour of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> (VC) lipids. As VC shows multiple protecting and barrier supporting properties before and after birth, it is suggested that a VC substitute could be an innovative barrier cream for barrier deficient skin. Lanolin was selected as the source of the branched chain sterol esters and wax esters — the main lipid classes of VC. Different lipid fractions were isolated from lanolin and subsequently mixed with squalene, triglycerides, cholesterol, ceramides and fatty acids to generate semi-synthetic lipid mixtures that mimic the lipid composition of VC, as established by high-performance thin-layer chromatography. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy investigations revealed that triglycerides play an important role in the (lateral) lipid organization and thermotropic behaviour of the synthetic lipid mixtures. Excellent resemblance of VC lipids was obtained when adding unsaturated triglycerides. Moreover, these lipid mixtures showed similar long range ordering as VC. The optimal lipid mixture was evaluated on tape-stripped hairless mouse skin in vivo. The rate of barrier recovery was increased and comparable to VC lipid treatment...|$|R
