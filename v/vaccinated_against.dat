5|$|Polio {{vaccines}} are vaccines used {{to prevent}} poliomyelitis (polio). There are two types: one that uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection (IPV), and one that uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization recommends all children be fully <b>vaccinated</b> <b>against</b> polio. The two vaccines have eliminated polio {{from most of the}} world, and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 37 in 2016.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prior to {{introduction}} of universal varicella vaccination, {{it is crucial}} to gain insight into the willingness to vaccinate among the population. This is because suboptimal national vaccination coverage might increase the age of infection in children, which will lead to higher complication rates. We studied the attitude and intention to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> varicella among Dutch public health professionals who execute the National Immunisation Programme (NIP), and parents. METHODS: Medical doctors and nurses of regional public health services (RPHS) and child health clinics (CHC), and a random sample of parents received an internet survey on varicella vaccination. Separate logistic regression models were used to identify determinants for a positive attitude (professionals) or a positive intention (parents) to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> varicella within the NIP (free of charge). RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 181 RPHS professionals (67 %), 260 CHC professionals (46 %), and 491 parents (33 %). Of professionals, 21 % had a positive attitude towards universal varicella vaccination, while 72 % preferred to limit vaccination to high-risk groups only. Of parents, 28 % had a positive intention to <b>vaccinate</b> their child <b>against</b> varicella within the NIP. The strongest determinant for a positive attitude or intention to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> varicella among professionals and parents was the belief that varicella is a disease serious enough to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against.</b> CONCLUSIONS: We showed {{that a majority of the}} Dutch public health professionals and parents in this study have a negative attitude or low intention to <b>vaccinate</b> universally <b>against</b> varicella, as a result of the perceived low severity of the disease. Most participating professionals support selective vaccination to prevent varicella among high-risk groups...|$|R

25|$|Patients who are <b>vaccinated</b> <b>against</b> {{streptococcus}} pneumoniae, health professionals, nursing-home {{residents and}} pregnant {{women should be}} vaccinated annually against influenza.

50|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} <b>vaccinating</b> <b>against</b> measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), and varicella (chickenpox) {{because the}} risks of these diseases far outweigh {{the risks of}} <b>vaccinating</b> <b>against</b> them. In particular, the World Health Organization recommends varicella vaccination in countries where the vaccine is affordable, the disease is a relatively important problem, and high and sustained coverage can be achieved. The U.S. {{and a few other}} countries have widely implemented this. MMR and varicella vaccine are given at roughly the same time and a booster injection is recommended for both. The MMRV vaccine, a combined MMR and varicella vaccine, simplifies administration of the vaccines. As measles and rubella cause upper respiratory disease that leads to complications of pneumonia and bronchitis which are also caused by varicella, MMR vaccine is beneficial to reduce exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.|$|R
40|$|In many Tennessee counties, {{children}} {{under the care of}} health departments have low measles vaccination levels. An immunization survey and a health department record audit of 2 -year-olds were undertaken in two counties to determine the reasons for this situation. The results indicated that faulty clinic procedures played a large part in the failure to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> measles. Nearly half of the unvaccinated 2 -year-olds with health department records had been present in the health department clinic at the appropriate age for measles vaccination; the remainder had dropped out of the well-child program before their first birthday. Emphasis on tuberculin skin testing and delay in the administration of the basic series of DTP immunizations correlated with the failure to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> measles. For {{more than half of the}} children who attended the clinic after their first birthday, no reason was recorded for the failure to <b>vaccinate</b> them <b>against</b> measles. Improved clinic procedures could bring measles vaccination levels within the acceptable range. These procedures would include new methods for correcting immunization delinquency, simultaneous tuberculin skin testing and measles vaccination of children without a history of tuberculosis exposure, emphasis on vaccinating at-risk groups, and more convenient vaccination clinic hours...|$|R

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} it is {{possible}} to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> xenomas. One study showed that developing a vaccine using a 103 to 105 dose of killed spores from a low-virulence strain of Loma salmonae resulted in rainbow trout producing 85% less xenomas in their gills after experimental infection (compared to the control). This ultimately offers much improved protection to microsporidial gill disease which is common amongst rainbow trout. Therapeutic drugs have proved ineffective at treating this disease and harvesting whole-spores is a relatively easy technique.|$|R
40|$|AbstractInfection of {{fish with}} the facultative {{intracellular}} bacterium Francisella noatunensis remains an unresolved problem for aquaculture industry worldwide {{as it is}} difficult to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> without using live attenuated vaccines. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are biological structures shed by Gram-negative bacteria in response to various environmental stimuli. OMVs have successfully been used to <b>vaccinate</b> <b>against</b> both intracellular and extracellular pathogens, due to an ability to stimulate innate, cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. We show by using atomic force and electron microscopy that the fish pathogenic bacterium F. noatunensis subspecies noatunensis (F. n. n.) shed OMVs both in vitro into culture medium and in vivo in a zebrafish infection model. The main protein constituents of the OMV are IglC, PdpD and PdpA, all known Francisella virulence factors, in addition to the outer membrane protein FopA and the chaperonin GroEL, as analyzed by mass spectrometry. The vesicles, when used as a vaccine, reduced proliferation of the bacterium and protected zebrafish when subsequently challenged with a high dose of F. n. n. without causing adverse effects for the host. Also granulomatous responses were reduced in F. n. n. -challenged zebrafish after OMV vaccination. Taken together, the data support the possible use of OMVs as vaccines against francisellosis in fish...|$|R
40|$|The DA rat {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to induction of arthritis after immunization with homologous type II collagen (CII) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA), resulting in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The DA rat also develops arthritis after injection of FIA alone (oil-induced arthritis (OIA)). This finding allows a direct comparison {{of two different}} models for rheumatoid arthritis; one induced with a defined auto-immunogen and one with a pure adjuvant. Both CIA and OIA develop approximately 2 weeks after induction but OIA is a self-limited acute disease whereas CIA induced with homologous CII follows a chronic disease course. Immunization with CII leads to a strong autoantibody response to CII while injection of FIA leads to no or very limited anti-CII antibody response. The Lewis rat develops neither CIA nor OIA while F 1 (DA x Lewis) rats develop CIA but not OIA. Olive oil or CII emulsified in olive oil does not induce arthritis in DA rats. Pretreatment with CII in olive oil <b>vaccinates</b> <b>against</b> CIA but not OIA whereas pretreatment with FIA <b>vaccinates</b> <b>against</b> OIA but not CIA.
