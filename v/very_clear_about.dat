25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield. Those innocents {{who were}} murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We need to be <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> this. On the streets of London {{there is no such}} thing as a war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Meyers {{writes that}} Hemingway was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> the husband's role, {{because in this}} story he was writing about a {{familiar}} subject—the experiences of his boyhood in Michigan. The young father's role is to [...] "deflate the doctor", who finds victory in slicing open the woman's belly to deliver the infant, {{and to provide a}} counterpoint to the mother's strength and resilience. The father's suicide serves as a symbolic rejection of the white doctor whose skill is necessary, but who brings with him destruction. In her paper [...] "Screaming Through Silence: The Violence of Race in 'Indian Camp'", Amy Strong writes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] is about domination; the husband kills himself at the moment his wife is cut open by a white doctor. She thinks the theme of domination exists on more than one level: Nick is dominated by his father; the white outsiders dominate in the Indian camp; and the white doctor [...] "has cut into the woman, like the early settlers leaving a gash in the tree." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked {{for a couple of months}} to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{unlike the}} {{aforementioned}} organizations, the CI model is attachment to universities or other educational institutions, thus leading to suspicions the institutes are [...] "aimed less at fostering interest in China and Chinese culture itself, and more at ensuring that such interest is guided along lines approved {{of by the}} Chinese party-state." [...] Steven Mosher notes: [...] "Unlike Alliance Francaise, the Confucius Institutes are not independent from their government; unlike the Goethe-Institut establishments, they do not occupy their own premises. Instead, participating universities agree to provide office space in exchange for funding, and to cede academic control to the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party." [...] Martin Davidson, {{chief executive of the}} British Council, criticized comparisons between his institution and CIs. [...] "We are a stand-alone organization operating out of our own premises. They are being embedded in university campuses. The real question has to be one of independence." [...] Davidson said while the Chinese are <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> wanting to combat negative propaganda with positive propaganda, [...] "The danger is more of self-censorship — which is a very subtle thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former IRA member (and Irish Government {{intelligence}} agent) Sean O'Callaghan {{claimed he}} was at an IRA Revolutionary Council meeting in 1983 which was also attended by Adams. O'Callaghan gave his account in testimony to the High Court in Dublin. Former IRA members Anthony McIntyre and Richard O'Rawe have claimed Adams was {{a key figure in}} the IRA. Adams said: [...] "I'm very, <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> my denial of IRA membership but I don't disassociate myself from the IRA." [...] Former IRA member Peter Rogers has alleged that Adams and Martin McGuinness ordered Rogers to transport explosives to Great Britain in 1980, allegations Sinn Féin said were untrue. (Rogers was jailed for the 1980 killing of Detective Garda Seamus Quaid in the Republic of Ireland, and was later released {{under the terms of the}} Good Friday Agreement.) Father Gerry Reynolds, who facilitated secret meetings between SDLP leader John Hume and Adams, has said that asking Adams about his IRA membership is a [...] "stupid question" [...] as the IRA was a secret society and the [...] " [...] of the secret society is that it is secret". Adams described Father Reynolds as a [...] "champion of the peace process" [...] upon his death.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2011 Coulson {{left his}} post, saying {{coverage}} of the phone-hacking scandal was {{making it difficult to}} give his best to the job. In July 2011 he was arrested and questioned by police in connection with further allegations of illegal activities at the News of the World, and released on bail. Despite a call to apologise for hiring Coulson by the leader of the opposition, Cameron defended the appointment, saying that he had taken a conscious choice to give someone who had screwed up a second chance. On 20 July, in a special parliamentary session at the House of Commons, arranged to discuss the News International phone hacking scandal, Cameron said that he [...] "regretted the furore" [...] that had resulted from his appointment of Coulson, and that [...] "with hindsight" [...] he would not have hired him. Coulson was detained and charged with perjury by Strathclyde Police on 30 May 2012. Coulson was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones in June 2014. Prior to the jury handing down their verdict, Cameron issued a [...] "full and frank" [...] apology for hiring him, saying [...] "I am extremely sorry that I employed him. It was the wrong decision and I am <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> that." [...] The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.|$|E

Then, gasping, panting, floundering, and striking when they could, they went swaying towards the door, while Jasper's friends howled encouragingly, and men, attracted by the uproar, ran out of the opposite store. Foot by foot they neared the verandah, and when Leland, gasping with passion, made a supreme effort, they staggered out into it.|$|E

He was quite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in endeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had thought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am far from sure of), I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was free of them.

I never had a historical mind. Let it go. Whichever way it happened I am glad of it, and that is as much enthusiasm as I can get up for a person bearing my name.
