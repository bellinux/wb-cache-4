5000|$|<b>Velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> {{can be used}} to {{calculate}} the basic performance of a turbine stage. Gas exits the stationary turbine nozzle guide vanes at absolute velocity Va1. The rotor rotates at velocity U. Relative to the rotor, the velocity of the gas as it impinges on the rotor entrance is Vr1. The gas is turned by the rotor and exits, relative to the rotor, at velocity Vr2. However, in absolute terms the rotor exit velocity is Va2. The <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> are constructed using these various <b>velocity</b> vectors. <b>Velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> can be constructed at any section through the blading (for example: hub, tip, midsection and so on) but are usually shown at the mean stage radius. Mean performance for the stage can be calculated from the <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles,</b> at this radius, using the Euler equation: ...|$|R

A minimum number of data are required to draw a <b>velocity</b> <b>triangle</b> at a point on blade.

25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{consists}} of much fewer blades i.e., two to six, {{as compared to}} ducted fans. Axial fans operate at high specific speed i.e., high flow rate and low head and hence adding more blades will restrict the high flow rate required for its operation. Due to fewer blades, {{they are unable to}} impose their geometry on the flow, making the rotor geometry and the inlet and outlet <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> meaningless. Also the blades are made very long with varying blade sections along the radius.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedA performance comparison between smooth-cast and rough-cast blades {{was conducted in}} a lowspeed multistage compressor. The purpose was to show that rough-cast blades {{can be used for}} initial performance tests of low-speed compressors. A baseline performance was established with smooth-cast epoxy blades and then compared to rough-cast aluminum blades. The pressure-rise coefficient versus flow coefficient and <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> were used as the measure for comparison between the different blade types. The <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> were constructed and compared across the span (hub-to-tip) of the secondstage. This was done by using two probes that could traverse radially along the blade and sense the flow velocity and angle relative to the compressor axis. Measurements were taken at six different locations from the hub-to-tip of the blade. The performance tests were conducted at four different throttle settings: near stall, open throttle, nominal operating point (NOP), and near the NOP. Results showed that although there were some differences between the smooth-cast and rough-cast blades, the overall performance was very similar. As a result, rough-cast blades could be used for initial performance tests or as the initial stages of a compressor in order to set up the flow for the evaluation of a new stage of smooth blades. The use of rough-cast blades in early stages would save the time and money needed to produce large numbers of high precision smooth-cast blades...|$|R

50|$|In turbomachinery, a <b>{{velocity}}</b> <b>triangle</b> or a velocity diagram is {{a triangle}} representing the various components of velocities {{of the working}} fluid in a turbomachine. Velocity triangles may be drawn for both the inlet and outlet sections of any turbomachine. The vector nature of velocity is utilized in the triangles, and the most basic form of a <b>velocity</b> <b>triangle</b> consists of the tangential velocity, the absolute velocity and the relative velocity of the fluid making up three sides of the triangle.|$|E

50|$|In turbomachinery, {{the slip}} factor {{is a measure}} of the fluid slip in the {{impeller}} of a compressor or a turbine, mostly a centrifugal machine. Fluid slip is the deviation in the angle at which the fluid leaves the impeller from the impeller's blade/vane angle. Being quite small in axial impellers(inlet and outlet flow in same direction), slip is a very important phenomenon in radial impellers and is useful in determining the accurate estimation of work input or the energy transfer between the impeller and the fluid, rise in pressure and the <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> at the impeller exit.|$|R

40|$|Steady flow in axial one-stage {{turbines}} is assessed numerically and experimentally. The simulations {{are performed}} on coarse meshes using a standard numerical approach (3 D, steady state, kε-turbulence model, wall function at solid boundaries). In {{order to allow}} for conclusions drawn from these rapid numerical studies, the approach was compared with an explicit LDA (Laser Doppler anemometry) mapping of the velocity field downstream the rotor on a representative turbine stage. A two-component LDA system allowed for measurements of axial and tangential velocity components at varying depth (radius) in the flow channel, Measurements thus correspond to a full plane at constant axial position in the rotating frame of reference of the rotor. Comparison between LDA velocity mapping and CFD results shows good agreement. A series of subsequent simulations is thus used to judge the impact of varied blade/stage design parameters. Two turbine layouts are defined for identical operating conditions and shaft power. The flow in the unshrouded rotor blade row is analyzed for the influence of varying tip clearance size and the dependency on stage <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles.</b> – Known correlations for tip clearance losses (typically used in mean line predictions) are used, though the blade row geometry considered is beyond the limits the correlations are intended for. The absolute loss level found in CFD simulations differs significantly from what is expected when using loss correlations. Still the variation with tip gap size is predicted well {{by some of the}} investigated models. As dependency of tip clearance losses on stage <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> is considered, none of the tested correlations gives results consistent with the numerical simulations. The use of standard correlations ‘beyond the limits’ is thus considered to introduce high uncertainty. Due to the good consistency between LDA and numerical results, the conclusions are considered to be valid for stage designs similar to the ones analyzed...|$|R

The source terms express the blade-flow interactions and are estimated by calculating the <b>velocity</b> <b>triangles</b> for each blade row. Loss coefficient and deviation models are supplied by empirical correlations and are compared to experimental data in all flow regions.

The stress and displacement {{analysis of the}} rotor blade of any turbo machine {{in the field of}} design played a very important roll. Rotor blade is the very critical component in the field of turbo machines. The major cause of break down is due to different loadings such as fluid or gas forces and centrifugal forces are acting on the rotor blades.
