40|$|Oncogenic Rickets is {{considered}} one of the <b>vitamin</b> <b>D-resistant</b> <b>Rickets</b> caused by mainly benign tumors of mesenchymal origin. These tumors secrete presumably substances of hormone-like effect with act through two main pathophysiologic mechanisms: 1) Impair phosphate reabsorption in renal proximal tubules that leads to inappropriate phosphaturia and hypophosphatemia, 2) Inhibit 25 (OH) D 3 - 1 -alpha-hydroxylase in mitochondria of renal proximal tubules decreasing the 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 serum level. Although phosphate (Jouli solution) and calcitriol or dihydrothachysterol may improve signs and symptoms of the disease, the surgical removal of the tumor remains the only effective and etiology treatment.

Therefore, its homeostasis is finely maintained through the coordination of intestinal absorption, renal reabsorption, and bone resorption.

The TRPV 5 knockout mice exhibit renal leak hypercalciuria and accordingly upregulate their intestinal TRPV 6 expression to compensate for their negative Ca 2 + balance.

Accordingly, no differences were found in serum concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, LH, and FSH or testicular expression of Cyp 19 a 1, Ersα, Cyp 17 a 1, Star, Insl 3, Inhbb, and Amh. However, a significantly lower ERβ expression was found in testis of Vdr(+/-) and Vdr(-/-) mice, conversely epididymal expressions of ERα and the estrogen-target gene Aqp 9 were higher.

40|$|New World {{primates}} (NWP) {{exhibit a}} form of compensated resistance to vitamin D and other steroid hormones, including 17 beta-estradiol. One postulated cause of resistance is that NWP cells overexpress one or more proteins which block hormone action by competing with hormone for its cognate hormone response element. Here we report that both nuclear and postnuclear extracts from NWP, but not Old World primate, cells contained a protein(s) capable of binding directly to the estrogen response element (ERE). This ERE binding protein(s) (ERE-BP) was dissociated from the ERE by excess of either unlabeled ERE or excess of the ERE half-site motif AGGTCAcag.

The relatively low level of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D, even after administration of a massive dose of 1 oOHD 3, indicates that large doses are necessary in these patients. Moreover, the low level of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D before treatment showed a positive correlation with the low level of serum phosphate and TmP/GFR. 2 This finding suggests that massive doses of 1 mOHD 3 are necessary in severe cases.

50|$|This gene {{belongs to}} the {{subfamily}} of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). The hnRNPs are RNA binding proteins and they complex with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). These proteins are associated with pre-mRNAs in the nucleus and appear to influence pre-mRNA processing(reference: Koenig J. nature structural and Molecular Biology 2010: iCLIP) {{and other aspects of}} mRNA metabolism and transport. While all of the hnRNPs are present in the nucleus, some seem to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The hnRNP proteins have distinct nucleic acid binding properties. Transcriptional regulation by hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (calcitriol) involves occupancy of vitamin D response elements (VDREs) by HNRNPC or 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-bound vitamin D receptor (VDR). This relationship is disrupted by elevated HNRNPC, causing a form of hereditary <b>vitamin</b> <b>D-resistant</b> rickets (HVDRR) in both humans and non-human primates. The protein encoded by this gene can act as a tetramer and is involved in the assembly of 40S hnRNP particles. Species-specific tetramerization of HNRNPC subunits is important to its nucleic acid binding, whereby over-expression of major human HNRNPC subunits in mouse osteoblastic cells confers vitamin D resistance. Multiple transcript variants encoding at least two different isoforms have been described for this gene.|$|R
