5|$|As Vega {{had long}} {{been used as a}} {{standard}} star for calibrating telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric. With the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this will allow for improved instrument calibrations.|$|E
5|$|Blazars are {{believed}} to be an active galaxy with a relativistic jet that is pointed in the direction of Earth. A radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets. A unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> of the observer.|$|E
5|$|Initial asymmetries {{have also}} been {{confirmed}} in TypeIa supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity {{of this type of}} supernova depends on the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> However, the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time. Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light.|$|E
40|$|The <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> {{effect in}} LANDSAT 2 imagery was investigated. The LANDSAT {{multispectral}} scanner scans over {{a range of}} <b>view</b> <b>angles</b> of - 5. 78 to 5. 78 degrees. The <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> effect, which is caused by differing <b>view</b> <b>angles,</b> could be studied by comparing data collected at different <b>view</b> <b>angles</b> over a fixed location at a fixed time. Since such LANDSAT data is not available, consecutive day acquisition data were used as a substitute: they were collected over the same geographical location, acquired 24 hours apart, with a <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> change of 7 to 8 degrees at a latitude of 35 to 45 degrees. It is shown that there is approximately a 5 % reduction in the average sensor response on the second-day acquisitions {{as compared with the}} first-day acquisitions, and that the <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> effect differs field to field and crop to crop. On false infrared color pictures the <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> effect causes changes primarily in brightness and to a lesser degree in color (hue and saturation). An implication is that caution must be taken when images with different <b>view</b> <b>angles</b> are combined for classification and a signature extension technique needs to take the <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> effect into account...|$|R

5|$|Some of Escher's many {{tessellation}} drawings {{were inspired}} by conversations with the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter on hyperbolic geometry. Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The Platonic solids—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in Order and Chaos and Four Regular Solids. These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 8.0–9.0 by 4.0–5.5µm, {{and have an}} ellipsoid to oblong to ovoid shape, depending on the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 24–40 by 7–12µm. The cheilochrysocystidia (found on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measuring 30–55 by 4–40µm, with a neck that is 2–5µm wide. Pleurochrysocystidia (on the gill face) are 40–60 by 5–18µm with a 2–4µm-wide neck. Clamp connections are abundant in all tissues of S.caerulea. The fungus produces acanthocytes, which are spiny cells produced on short branches on the mycelium.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on {{the size and shape}} of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiʻiaka preserved the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
30|$|As {{a result}} shown in Tables  4 and 5, {{in the case}} of the small (no) <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> difference, the {{accuracy}} of LB and MT is higher than that of Siamese since leveraging the inter-subject difference is more effective than mitigating the intra-subject difference due to <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> differences in such a case. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} a larger <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> difference, Siamese is better than LB and MT, since mitigating the intra-subject difference due to <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> difference is more effective than leveraging the inter-subject difference.|$|R

40|$|Directional thermal {{radiance}} from vegetation {{depends on}} many factors, including {{the architecture of}} the plant canopy, thermal irradiance, emissivity of the foliage and soil, <b>view</b> <b>angle,</b> slope, and the kinetic temperature distribution within the vegetation-soil system. A one dimensional model, which includes the influence of topography, indicates that thermal emissivity of vegetation canopies may remain constant with <b>view</b> <b>angle,</b> or emissivity may increase or decrease as <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> from nadir increases. Typically, variations of emissivity with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> are less than 0. 01. As <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> increases away from nadir, directional infrared canopy temperature usually decreases but may remain nearly constant or even increase. Variations in directional temperature with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> may be 5 C or more. Model predictions of directional emissivity are compared with field measurements in corn canopies and over a bare soil using a method that requires two infrared thermometers, one sensitive to the 8 to 14 micrometer wavelength band and a second to the 14 to 22 micrometer band. After correction for CO 2 absorption by the atmosphere, a directional canopy emissivity can be obtained as a function of <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> in the 8 to 14 micrometer band to an accuracy of about 0. 005. Modeled and measured canopy emissivities for corn varied slightly with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> (0. 990 at nadir and 0. 982 at 75 deg <b>view</b> zenith <b>angle)</b> and did not appear to vary significantly with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> for the bare soil. Canopy emissivity is generally nearer to unity than leaf emissivity may vary by 0. 02 with wavelength even though leaf emissivity. High spectral resolution, canopy thermal emissivity may vary by 0. 02 with wavelength even though leaf emissivity may vary by 0. 07. The one dimensional model provides reasonably accurate predictions of infrared temperature and can be used to study the dependence of infrared temperature on various plant, soil, and environmental factors...|$|R
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle,</b> which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the feel of a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E
40|$|Background: Linear-array-based photoacoustic {{computed}} tomography (PACT) {{suffers from a}} limited view. Circular scanning does increase the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> but is time-consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to increase the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of linear-array-based PACT without sacrificing imaging speed. Methods: Two planar acoustic reflectors placed at 120 degrees to each other were added to a linear-array-based PACT system. Each reflector redirects originally undetectable photoacoustic waves back to the transducer array elements, and together they triple the original detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of the PACT system. Results: Adding two reflectors increased the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> from 80 to 240 degrees. As a comparison, a single-reflector PACT has a detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of only 160 degrees. A leaf skeleton phantom with a rich vascular network was imaged with the double-reflector PACT, {{and most of its}} features were recovered. Conclusions: The two acoustic reflectors triple the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of a linear-array-based PACT without compromising the original imaging speed. This nearly full-view detection capability produces higher-quality images than single-reflector PACT or conventional PACT without reflectors...|$|R
40|$|The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project cloud {{analysis}} {{has a small}} <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> dependence in its cloud estimate. There is about 10 % more cloudiness reported at 60 o <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> compared to normal views of the same scene. Over the twenty year ISCCP record, more geosynchronous satellites {{have been added to}} the analysis and the mean <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> over the globe has become more vertical. This systematic change in view point convolved with the <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> dependence in cloudiness produces much of the decreasing trend in ISCCP cloud amount, both regionally and globally. An empirical correction can be made to the ISCCP cloudiness time series which makes the data more useful for climate studies. This angular dependence is a real physical phenomena much like bi-directional reflectance for reflected sunlight from different surfaces. It should be incorporated in the conversion of instantaneous cloudiness at a particular <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> to averages over time and over <b>view</b> <b>angle.</b> Finally we discuss the impact on optical depth and radiative transfer in cloud fields...|$|R
