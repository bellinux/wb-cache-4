5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

25|$|Satō's mother lived {{downstairs and}} {{apparently}} had {{no contact with}} her son's captive since he became <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> whenever she tried to go upstairs. However, police believe the mother must have had some knowledge of Ms. Sano's presence; for example, it was alleged that she purchased feminine hygiene products for the victim.|$|E

25|$|Most females visit a nest after {{completing}} a nest and beginning {{work on a}} new one. Nest defense and invasion can become <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> with both bees falling to the ground. Females will lock mandibles when fighting. Though no bees were observed to be injured after a fight took place, fighting may deplete them of physical resources they could use elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The Chandra X-ray Observatory, {{launched}} on July 23, 1999, has been allowing {{the exploration of}} the <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> processes in the universe which produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which gives a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable. It features stars being torn apart by black holes, galactic collisions, and novae, and neutron stars that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.|$|E
25|$|Gerard Soeteman {{also wrote}} {{the script for}} Verhoeven's first American film, Flesh and Blood (1985), which starred Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Verhoeven moved to Hollywood for {{a wider range of}} {{opportunities}} in filmmaking. Working in the U.S. he made a serious change in style, directing big-budget, <b>very</b> <b>violent,</b> special-effects-heavy smashes RoboCop and Total Recall. Both RoboCop and Total Recall won Academy Special Achievement Awards, for Sound Effects Editing and for Visual Effects respectively.|$|E
50|$|The book is <b>very</b> {{graphically}} <b>violent</b> and sexual, {{especially in}} earlier chapters (there are eight in all). The {{story of the}} novella explores {{the nature of human}} desire and the uses and abuses of technology in the satisfaction of desire.|$|R
50|$|There are {{significant}} problems with methamphetamine manufacture and use {{in many communities}} on Sand Mountain, which {{was the subject of}} a recent documentary called Meth Mountain (a one-hour episode of A&E's Intervention).

25|$|The {{relations}} of the royal couple went from bad to worse. Alexandra used her son {{to put pressure on}} her husband and the child witnessed <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> scenes between his parents. Thanks to the intervention of his maternal grandmother, the 4-year-old Crown Prince Alexander was sent to Italy with the Count and Countess of Robilant, friends of the royal couple. The child then grew up in an atmosphere much more stable and loving, with only few visits from his parents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Courtney's Varsity team {{was finally able}} to compete against both Yale and Harvard due to events {{unrelated}} to rowing. After a <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> football game in the fall of 1894, the faculty of Harvard suspended all athletic relationships with Yale, effective {{at the end of the}} 1894-95 school year. This included their annual regatta, which dated to 1852. In the summer of 1896, the first year that Harvard and Yale did not meet due to the ban, Yale sent its Varsity to the Henley Royal Regatta in England.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Phil was calmer than Grant {{but both}} {{brothers}} {{had a sense}} of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the more streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble, although later plotlines drove the character down a darker, more destructive route. Phil can be <b>very</b> <b>violent,</b> but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting others to do his dirty work, amongst other things.|$|E

5000|$|Early Scottish {{football}} sometimes {{erupted into}} <b>very</b> extreme <b>violent</b> outbursts, {{including the use}} of firearms. For example, in 1606 at Lochtoun during a [...] "fute-ball" [...] match some players [...] "fell in contentioun and controversie, ilk anie with otheris, and schot and dilaschit pistolettis and hacquebuttis" [...] It was clearly a passionate and dangerous pastime.|$|R
50|$|The {{relations}} between the Fur Workers Industrial Union and the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada were <b>very</b> bad. <b>Violent</b> clashes often broke out between the two unions at picket lines, at workplaces or {{in the streets of}} the city. Apart from its presence in New York, the union also established a stronghold in Chicago.|$|R
25|$|A {{stallion}} {{will defend}} his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion issues {{a warning to}} the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become <b>very</b> <b>violent,</b> with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes a stallion will lie still {{on the ground as}} if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, will strike and continue the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, and as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he will usually not be challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then the new stallion gradually takes over pushing the old one out without a fight.|$|E
25|$|Oskar McNamara (who played Danny Latimer) was {{the third}} actor to be told who the murderer was. Danny Latimer's death is <b>very</b> <b>violent,</b> which {{required}} telling McNamara about the killer's identity several days in advance so that the actor could prepare and the scene could be choreographed and rehearsed. McNamara's parents worked closely with director Strong to ensure their son's physical and emotional safety. The mother of Adam Wilson (who played Tom Miller) was told the killer's identity several days before {{the release of the}} final three scripts. She declined to tell her son who the murderer was. Wilson learned that his on-screen father was the killer just a few minutes before the scene was shot. Wilson's surprise helped him portray the shock Tom Miller felt at his mother's revelation.|$|E
25|$|ClassesT and L {{could be}} more common {{than all the other}} classes {{combined}} if recent research is accurate. Study of the number of proplyds (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in nebulae from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the galaxy should be several orders of magnitude higher than what was previously speculated. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a protostar, which are <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible to us. Because brown dwarfs can live so long, these smaller bodies accumulate over time.|$|E
50|$|The story {{proceeds}} with <b>very</b> few <b>violent</b> incidents, {{though it}} does climax in a space battle. There is also an enigma - the apparent sighting of a 'beam of light', {{that should not be}} possible on the airless world. This is explained later in the story as a weapons beam that included metal particulates moving at high velocity.|$|R
5000|$|CNN {{reviewer}} Paul Tatara gave {{a highly}} negative {{review of the}} film, dubbing it as [...] "...very <b>violent,</b> <b>very</b> profane, and very bad. There's less killing at your local slaughterhouse, and the dialogue is probably sharper." ...|$|R
50|$|The VSC (Vietnam Solidarity Campaign) led by Tariq Ali mounted several <b>very</b> {{large and}} <b>violent</b> {{demonstration}}s against the Vietnam war in 67/68 {{but the first}} anti Vietnam demonstration was at the American Embassy in London and took place in 1965.|$|R
25|$|On another instance, {{a meeting}} with sharp lances was {{arranged}} to take place near Nantes, {{under the auspices of}} the Constable of France and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter was a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers was slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance without further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir Tristram de la Jaille of Poitou advanced from the ranks and jousted three courses, without hurt. A duel followed between Edward Beauchamp, son of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and the bastard Clarius de Savoye. Clarius was much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. The bastard then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire named Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat with swords and lances was <b>very</b> <b>violent,</b> but neither of the parties was hurt.|$|E
500|$|Maryam Alkhawaja of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights said: [...] "The {{attack was}} <b>very</b> <b>violent,</b> [...] were not showing any mercy." [...] An unnamed injured protester told the local {{independent}} newspaper Al-Wasat he was within {{a group of}} protesters who were awake and that they chanted [...] "peaceful... peaceful" [...] before being attacked by police who reportedly stole his wallet, camera and mobile phone after beating and dragging him with a rope. Another injured protester described how {{women and children were}} running all over the place; even after withdrawing to nearby villages, police still pursued protesters and arrested [...] "large numbers" [...] of them. Other eyewitnesses said police searched the cars parked around Pearl Roundabout, damaging some of them.|$|E
500|$|Bassist Adam Clayton {{said the}} line [...] "He saw the hands that build could also pull down" [...] was a jab at the US government's {{conflicting}} roles in international relations. Two songs from The Joshua Tree, [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared", {{focused on the}} foreign policy of the United States. In describing [...] "Exit", Bono said [...] "It is all very well to address America and the violence that is an aggressive foreign policy but to really understand {{that you have to}} get under the skin of your own darkness, the violence we all contain within us. Violence is something I have quite a bit about. I have a side of me which, in a corner, can be <b>very</b> <b>violent.</b> It's the least attractive thing in anyone and I wanted to own up to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Charlie Rose, co-director Joel Coen acknowledged that [...] "there's {{a lot of violence}} in the book," [...] and considered the violence depicted in the film as [...] "very important to the story". He further added that [...] "we couldn't conceive it, sort of soft pedaling that in the movie, and really doing a thing resembling the book ... it's about a character confronting a <b>very</b> arbitrary <b>violent</b> brutal world, and you have to see that." ...|$|R
25|$|Of little {{strategic}} value, {{the mountainous}} State of Scott {{was not the}} site of any fighting on a major scale during the Civil War, instead seeing mostly guerrilla warfare, bushwhacking, and skirmishing, which was often of a <b>very</b> vicious and <b>violent</b> nature.|$|R
5000|$|Kritika Murari: [...] "The trailer is <b>very</b> {{promising}} and <b>violent.</b> The storyline {{seems to}} be very interesting and different with an intelligent plotline presented the retro style.

500|$|Through a Glass Darkly is a long, complex {{narrative}} that {{features more than}} 60 characters and at least 15 subplots. The title of the novel comes from the Bible verse 1 Corinthians 13. Before she began writing it, Koen envisioned creating {{a story about the}} relationship between a young woman and an older man, a plot element riddled with emotional tension that required much planning and foresight. Koen also sought to create a story that featured issues relevant to contemporary women, such as the non-existence of [...] "legal rights. If a husband wanted to beat his wife to death he could do it, and if her parents didn't care... No birth control. If you had any normal sexual urges you were pregnant all the time, and half the women died in childbirth. Life was <b>very</b> <b>violent</b> and short and I just wanted to show how it was without getting up on a soapbox, so someone reading it would say, 'I'm glad I live now.'" [...] According to Koen, another consistent theme throughout Through a Glass Darkly is how vital family is to our well-being, family in this case being a loose term that does not necessarily equate to being biologically-related. She was also interested in writing how people are connected to each other.|$|E
500|$|Protesters {{demonstrated}} {{their opposition to}} the road's construction by blocking the path of construction equipment, but generally not involving themselves in physical altercations. They were met by security officers from Group 4. In December 1992, in view of a film crew from The Observer, a protester was assaulted by five officers. Another protester, {{according to a report by}} local MP John Denham, was strangled by officers and left unconscious on top of the Down for 30 minutes. Maggie Lambert, then a mature photography student, took numerous photographs of the protest, and challenged an injunction which suggested she had been involved with direct action. While Lord Justice Mann admitted there was no evidence to suggest she had done anything more than take photographs, the injunction was upheld. Protester Rebecca Lush Blum, who had stayed on the down from September to the night of eviction, later claimed [...] "It was a horrific experience and <b>very</b> <b>violent.</b> We were dragged through thorns and we were being kicked and punched and someone pulled out a clump of my hair." [...] In March 1993, Kenneth Carlisle, then Minister for Roads and Traffic, refused to order an inquiry into any wrongdoing or excessive force by security officers, stating it was a matter for the police.|$|E
2500|$|Connolly's bedroom had double windows, which {{directly}} faced St Peter's Primary School {{across the}} street. Now defunct, {{it has been}} converted into living accommodation.
