40|$|Abstract: The {{property}} of Heavy axial forgings {{can be modified}} by the reasonable drawing process with the advantage of dynamic recrystallization. <b>In</b> <b>view</b> of <b>formation,</b> heat transfer, heating generation, dynamic recrystallization a macro-micro coupled process was modeled, and the drawing process of φ 300 mm× 4000 mm axial forging is simulated. It is found that when the cumulative reduction ratio reaches 9 % in the second round, the dynamic recrystallization occurred in the material as it reached a critical strain condition. With the reduction ratio increases, the volume fraction of dynamic recrystallization increases. When the cumulative reduction ratio reaches 60 %, about 67 % of the inner region of the axial forging is modified fully. After the drawing process, the dynamic recrystallization grain size in 60 % of the cross-section area is less than 100 µm, and the grains get refined...|$|R
40|$|A long debated {{but still}} open {{question}} in the game theory literature is that of how to extend the Shapley Value to coalitional games with externalities. While previous work predominantly focused on developing alternative axiomatizations, {{in this article we}} propose a novel approach which centers around the coalition formation process and the underlying probability distribution from which a suitable axiomatization naturally follows. Specifically, we <b>view</b> coalition <b>formation</b> <b>in</b> games with externalities as a discrete-time stochastic process. We focus, in particular, on the Chinese Restaurant Process – a well-known stochastic process from probability theory. We show that reformulating Shapley's coalition formation process as the Chinese Restaurant Process yields in games with externalities a unique value with various desirable properties. We then generalize this result by proving that all values that satisfy the direct translation of Shapley's axioms to games with externalities can be obtained using our approach based on stochastic processes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Earlier 13, 18, 19, the biologically {{plausible}} active vision,model for Multiresolutional Attentional Representation and Recognition (MARR) {{has been}} developed. The model {{is based on}} the scanpath theory of Noton and Stark 17 and provides invariant recognition of gray-level images. In the present paper, the algorithm of automatic image <b>viewing</b> trajectory <b>formation</b> <b>in</b> the MARR model, the results of psychophysical experiments, and possible applications of the model are considered. Algorithm of automatic image viewing trajectory formation is based on imitation of the scanpath formed by operator Several propositions about possible mechanisms for a consecutive selection of fixation points in human visual perception inspired by computer simulation results and known psyhophysical data have been tested and confirmed in our psychophysical experiments. In particular, we have found that gaze switch may be directed (i) to a peripheral part of the vision field which contains an edge oriented orthogonally to the edge in the point of fixation, and (ii) to a peripheral part of the vision field containing crossing edges. Our experimental results have been used to optimize automatic algorithm of image <b>viewing</b> <b>in</b> the MARR model. The modified model demonstrates an ability to recognize complex real world images invariantly with respect to scale, shift, rotation, illumination conditions, and, in part, to point of view and can be used to solve some robot vision tasks...|$|R
