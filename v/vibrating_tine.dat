50|$|Inharmonicity {{refers to}} the {{difference}} between the theoretical and actual frequencies of the harmonics or overtones of a <b>vibrating</b> <b>tine</b> or string. The theoretical frequency of the second harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency, and of the third harmonic is three times the fundamental frequency, and so on. But on metal strings, tines, and reeds, the measured frequencies of those harmonics are slightly higher, and proportionately more so in the higher than in the lower harmonics. A digital emulation of these instruments must recreate this inharmonicity if it is to sound convincing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} testing of the first miniaturised metallic triplebeam tuning fork resonant sensors for use in force, pressure and torque measurement applications. The new devices with 9 mm length <b>vibrating</b> <b>tines</b> have resulted in over a 40 % in size when compared to previously tested resonators. The four fold increase in operating frequency to 26 kHz, with Q factors in air up to 4000, provides additional benefits for resolution, accuracy, range and overload capability. Measurement repeatability of at least 0. 02 % of span levels for torque transducers employing the sensors are quoted. Results of characterisation over the temperature range- 30 o C to + 90 o C are given. 1...|$|R

40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is often the}} most troublesome technical problem to be solved in organic farming, especially in poorly competitive crops like vegetables. A four-year (2000 - 2003) series of trials was established to assess the possibility of adopting an innovative non-chemical weed management system in organic carrot grown on the Fucino plateau, i. e., the most important carrot-growing area in Italy. The system utilized for physical weed control was based first on a false seedbed technique followed by pre-sowing weed removal, performed with a special 2 m wide 6 -row spring-tine harrow. Prior to crop emergence, a pass with a flame weeder equipped with four 50 cm wide-open flame burners was also performed. Post-emergence weed control consisted {{of one or more}} hoeing passes with a purpose-designed 11 -tine precision hoe equipped with spring implements (torsion weeders and <b>vibrating</b> <b>tines),</b> in addition to hand weeding. This innovative system was applied to a novel planting pattern (sowing in ten individual rows within 2 m wide beds) and compared to the standard management system of the area (sowing within 2 m wide beds but in five bands, use of spring-tine harrowing and flame weeding pre-emergence and of traditional hoeing post-emergence). The new system was tested in different commercial farms including both early and late-sown carrot. Assessments included machine operative characteristics, labor time, weed density and biomass, crop root yield and yield quality, and economic data (physical weed control costs and crop gross margin). Compared to the standard system, the innovative system usually resulted in reduced labor time (from 28 to 40 %) and total costs for physical weed control (on average - 416 € ha- 1). Use of the precision hoe resulted in intra-row weed reduction ranging from 65 to 90 %, which also led to a marked reduction in the labor required for hand weeding. In 2001 the two systems did not differ in terms of yield and yield quality, whereas in 2002 and 2003 the innovative system showed a higher mean density of carrot plants (from 28 to 55 %), root yield (from 30 to 42 %), and gross margin (from 40 to 100 %). Carrot yield was higher in farms which adopted an early sowing whereas root commercial quality was somewhat variable between systems and years. In general, results obtained with the innovative management system look very promising...|$|R
40|$|Reduced tillage is {{increasing}} among Swedish farmers, much {{caused by a}} poor profitability in cropping. In many cases the mouldboard plough {{is replaced by a}} shallow tillage implement, often a stubble cultivator. The cultivator has got tines, which consist of a shank and a share. There are many different kind of shares to choose from. To make the decision of the share model easier, a project was performed during the autumn of 2005 where draught requirement and tillage outcomes were studied for different kinds of shares. In a first project, different kinds of shares were tested on one heavy soil (50 % clay) and on one light soil (19 % clay). The tested shares were 80 mm, worned 80 mm, 80 mm winged, 210 mm and sweep. The remaining treatments were a stubble cultivator with <b>vibrating</b> <b>tines</b> and one mouldboard plough. In the second project shares with different width were compared on heavy soil (50 % clay). In all tests the specific (kN/m 2) and total (kN/m) draught requirement was determined. Every test was done with a Massey Ferguson 6290 equipped with a fuel measuring system. A data logger continually registered the PTO-effect, wheel speed, radar speed and engine speed. The drawbar power was calculated by subtracting power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. The draught requirement was calculated by dividing with the actual (radar) speed. The total draught requirement was calculated by dividing the draught with the working width. The actual working depth was measured by the help of a metal frame, with an area of 0, 25 m 2, which was placed in the tilled plot, and in which all of the tilled soil was weighed. By measuring the bulk density the actual working depth could be calculated. When the actual working depth, the working width of the implement and the draught force were known the specific draught requirement could be calculated. From each treatment soil was collected and sieved into six fractions to be able to calculate the total particle surface per kg soil. By doing this a measure of the fraction capacity of the shares could be detected. The energy requirement for fracturing could now also be calculated. The straw remaining on the soil surface was estimated visually and determined by image analysis. Some of the measured draught requirement values were compared with values predicted by models. On the heavy soil the actual working depth became smaller than the pre-set depth for every treatment except for the shallow sweep treatment and the mouldboard ploughed treatment. On the light soil the mouldboard ploughed treatment, the shallow sweep treatment and the 210 mm share treatment had an actual working depth larger than the depth that was pre-set. It was shown that the actual working depth was increasing with an increasing share width. The 80 mm and 210 mm shares had the largest specific draught requirement on the heavy soil. The mouldboard plough and the shallow sweep treatment had the smallest specific draught requirement. On the light soil the worn 80 mm share had the largest specific draught requirement and the shallow sweep treatment had the smallest. The specific draught requirement was increasing with an increasing share width. The mouldboard plough buried the residual best while the shallow sweep left most straw on the soil surface. The correlation between measured and calculated values were generally low. Draught requirement for the mouldboard plough was generally overestimated by the model and values for the cultivator underestimated. The results show that both draught requirement and tillage outcome was very different between the share types. Further research would be valuable for both machinery manufacturers and farmers...|$|R
40|$|These notes {{overview}} {{the spectral}} representation, emphasizing its compactness for describing acoustic signals, e. g., music, and visual patterns, e. g., textures and contours. 1 Sinusoids in Nature We start {{by looking at}} the general class of sinusoidal signals. One of the reasons why this class is relevant in practice is that many physical systems produce signals that are well approximated by sinusoids. As an example, suggested by [1], consider the tuning fork in Figure 1. Figure 1 : Tuning fork. 1 When stroked, the tuning fork produces a sound, a persistent “hum”. Figures 2 and 3 plot this sound, which is usually called a “pure tone”. Is it a coincidence that the (stationary part of the) signal looks like a sinusoid? Figure 2 : Acoustic signal produced by a tuning fork. (From [1].) Figure 3 : Stationary part of the signal in Figure 2, shown at a different scale. Naturally, when stroked, the tuning fork <b>tines</b> <b>vibrate.</b> This vibration, transmitted through the air particles surrounding the fork, produces the audible sound. To derive the way the tuning fork tines (and thus the air particles) vibrate, consider the schematic diagram in Figure 4. It represents the fork after being stroked, i. e., one of the tines is deformed by a given displacement from its equilibrium position. 2 m ✲...|$|R
