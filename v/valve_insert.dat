40|$|<b>Valve</b> seat <b>inserts</b> {{are one of}} {{the vital}} part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. Valve and valve seat embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The <b>valve</b> seat <b>insert</b> avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the valve seat during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a <b>valve</b> seat <b>insert</b> misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method. Eddy current inspection method permit flaw detection in a large variety of conductive materials, either ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic. Simulation to study the change in induced current density and magnetic density around the valve seat and cylinder head due to the magnetic field generated by an exciting coil was conduct using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 4. Based on the simulation result, it is observed that the change in gap width between valve seat and cylinder head will interfere the eddy current path which caused in the change of induced current density and magnetic flux density...|$|R

We present experimental results, and compare them with the predictions of a linear stability analysis of the equations governing the system. Nonlocality is introduced in the system via a lateral transport of a length ∆x of the feedback signal. The value of the transport length {{plays a key role}} in determining the symmetry of the selected pattern in systems with both focusing and defocusing nonlinearity. In the defocusing case, the spatial wavelength of the pattern is also affected by the value of the transport length. c ○ 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved 1...|$|R
40|$|Mild {{traumatic}} hemolysis due {{to heart}} valve prosthesis {{was investigated in}} three groups of patients with different prosthesis device (tilting disc, ball <b>valve)</b> <b>inserted</b> in aortic area, or in mitral area. By routine laboratory tests, an increased but not remarkable erythrocyte destruction was evidenced. On the other hand, the content of membrane sialic acid of the erythrocytes was determined in patient and control groups {{in order to give}} evidence of membrane damage induced by the prosthetic device. The mean value of sialic acid in the patient groups was significantly lower than in controls. These findings may suggest that mechanical damage on the red blood cell (RBC) membrane could be associated with the decrease of the membrane sialic acid content. It is briefly discussed whether the observed low contents of RBC sialic acid may somehow explain the decreased RBC lifespan which is frequently reported in these patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the Grant required investigations of cyclic variations in a homogeneous-charge engine initially with gas combustion and the air from ranging from near quiescent to the incorporation of swirl and tumble by <b>valve</b> <b>inserts.</b> Later experiments were performed with unleaded gasoline. The measurements included local velocity and cylinder pressure through the four strokes of a single-cylinder engine, under motored and firing conditions and with examination of the flame kernel growth by combinations of photography and flame-ionization gauges. In all cases, the measurements of in-cylinder characteristics were linked to performance as {{measured in terms of}} speed and its variability, load and emissions. The experiments progressed to consider deviations from homogeneous charge and included consideration of stratified charge with local injection of a rich mixture {{in the vicinity of the}} spark gap so as to establish a flame kernel which would propagate securely into an overall weak mixture...|$|R
40|$|Some of the mechnical and {{biological}} problems surrounding {{the use of}} fresh allograft inverted aortic valves as mitral valve substitutes are described. Certain aspects of the problem have been studied experimentally. In three sheep `fresh' aortic <b>valve</b> allografts were <b>inserted,</b> using cardiopulmonary bypass, into the main pulmonary artery, and were observed from 5 to 7 months after operation. The animals survived normally. Their normal pulmonary valves remained in situ. The technique is described. At subsequent necropsy, macroscopically the valves {{were found to be}} free from vegetation, and the cusps were pliable and apparently normal. Microscopically, the supporting allograft myocardium showed necrosis and early calcification. The valve cusp showed hyalinization of collagen, although beneath the endocardium this hyalinized collagen contained moderate numbers of fibroblasts with no evidence of proliferation. The endocardium and arterial intima of the allograft showed evidence of ingrowth from adjacent normal host endocardial tissues. The allograft itself was invested in a loose layer of fibro-fatty tissue, which, in view of the necrotic state of the graft myocardium, could well have been a reparative reaction rather than a homograft reaction. It is concluded that, although the cusps could function normally, the necrosis of the myocardium might in time lead to late failure of the graft. Further studies with the <b>valve</b> <b>inserted</b> at mitral level are indicated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{pipeline}} systems used {{to carry}} liquids and gases for the ventilation of buildings, water distributions networks, and the oil and chemical industries are usually monitored by a multiplicity of pressure, ow, and valve position sensors. By comparing the input signal to a valve with the pressure reading from the network using cross-correlation analysis, the technique described in this paper enables a single sensor {{to be used for}} monitoring. Specically, the offset and gradient change of the cross-correlation function show the time delay between the input wave and the acquired output signal. These reections arise from junctions, valves, and terminations, which can be located effectively using the cross-correlation technique. Investigations using a T-shaped pipe network have been conducted with a <b>valve</b> <b>inserted</b> in the pipeline to introduce articial water hammer-type perturbations into the system. Both computational and experimental data are presented and the results are compared with the actual pipe network geometry. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} identify the location of various features of the network from the reections and thus to perform either system characterisation or condition monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} field {{test of a}} novel sensor system based in {{autonomous}} wireless sensors to measure {{the temperature of the}} heat transfer fluid along a borehole heat exchanger (BHE) is presented. The system, by means of two specials <b>valves,</b> <b>inserts</b> and extracts miniaturized wireless sensors inside the pipes of the borehole, which are carried by the thermal fluid. Each sensor is embedded in a small sphere of just 25 mm diameter and 8 gr weight, containing a transceiver, a microcontroller, a temperature sensor and a power supply. A wireless data processing unit transmits to the sensors the acquisition configuration before the measurements, and also downloads the temperature data measured by the sensor along its way through the BHE U-tube. This sensor system is intended to improve the conventional thermal response test (TRT) and it allows the collection of information about the thermal characteristics of the geological structure of subsurface and its influence in borehole thermal behaviour, which in turn, facilitates the implementation of TRTs in a more cost-effective and reliable way...|$|R

30|$|Semi-active {{stiffness}} {{control devices}} are utilized {{to modify the}} stiffness and thus the natural vibration characteristics of the structure {{to which they are}} attached. The system primarily controls the stiffness of a building to establish a non-resonant condition during earthquakes. The semi-active stiffness devices are engaged or released so as to include or not include, respectively, the stiffness of the bracing system of the structure. Normally, the device is composed of a hydraulic cylinder with a normally closed solenoid control <b>valve</b> <b>inserted</b> in the tube connecting the two cylinder chambers. The solenoid valve can either be on or off, thus opening or closing, respectively, the fluid flow path through the tube. When the valve is closed, the fluid cannot flow and effectively locks the beam to the braces below. In contrast, when the valve is open, the fluid flows freely and disengages the stiffness control devices. The system may be regarded as fail-safe {{in the sense that the}} interruption of power causes the semi-active stiffness devices to automatically engage, thus increasing the stiffness of the structure (Kamagata and Kobori 1994; Kobori et al. 1993; Yang et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Twenty-six major {{cardiovascular}} centers {{participated in}} a cooperative study of all cases of in-fective endocarditis occurring during a single calendar year to obtain an overview of infective endocarditis. The {{study was designed to}} learn which patients appear to be at highest risk to develop this infection after palliative or reparative cardiovascular surgery. Of 278 patients developing infective endocarditis during the year at these medical centers, 63 (23 %) had had previous cardiovascular surgery and 215 had not. Seventy percent of the 278 patients had recognized congenital or acquired heart disease before developing the infection. Rheumatic heart disease accounted for over half of the patients with underlying structural heart disease. A majority (55 %) of the 63 patients who had been operated on before developing endocarditis had prosthetic <b>valves</b> <b>inserted.</b> Of those who did not require prosthetic valves, the majority had congenital heart disease with systemic artery-to-pulmonary artery shunts. Although these data were obtained from a selected group of patients, they confirm a significant risk of en-docarditis in patients with prosthetic valves and suggest that in postoperative patients with non-valvular con-genital heart disease, the highest risk appears to be in cyanotic patients with palliative pulmonary artery-to-systemic artery shunts...|$|R

40|$|Homograft valve {{replacement}} of the diseased aortic valve with a homologous aortic <b>valve</b> <b>inserted</b> in the sub-coronary position was first performed in July 1962 (Ross 1962). The procedure of transferring the patients autologous pulmonary valve to the aortic position has been used since 1967 (Ross 1967). The long term performance of homograft vaives has not been regarded as satis facrory in some centres (Copeland 1977, Anderson and Hancock 1977) whereas others have shown {{it to be an}} excellent {{valve replacement}} (Barratt-Boyes 1977; Bodnar et ai 1979). The differing experiences may be the results of alternative methods of steriliza tion, preservation and surgical insertion. This paper presents information on isolated aortic valve replacements with either homograft or autograft valves over a 15 year period. MÀTERIALS AND METHODS Six hundred and fifreen valves have been followed for up to 15 years, and there were 145 freeze dried homografts, 89 frozen homografts, 202 fresh homograks and 179 pulmonary autografts (Table 1). The details of the different steriiization and preserva tion methods and surgical techniques have been outlined (Ross et ai 1979; Bodnar et ai 1979).

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the prevalence of hypertension and the response of blood pressure to operation in 87 patients with lone aortic valve disease who underwent aortic valve replacement. In patients with aortic stenosis alone 26 % were hypertensive pre-operatively (age and sex adjusted blood pressure greater than 160 systolic and or greater than 95 mmHg diastolic) and 24 % were hypertensive post-operatively. In those with aortic regurgitation alone, hypertension was present in 65 % before and 57 % after valve replacement using the same criterion. For combined stenosis and regurgitation, the prevalence was 54 % and 62 %, respectively. The post-operative increase in systolic pressure in patients with aortic stenosis occurred mainly in those {{with a history of}} left ventricular failure. In those with aortic regurgitation or combined stenosis with regurgitation, diastolic pressure rose after valve replacement resulting in a prevalence of diastolic hypertension of 44 % and 35 %, respectively. Blood pressure changes were not predicted by the type of <b>valve</b> <b>inserted</b> nor its size. Our data show that despite severe symptomatic aortic valve disease, systolic hypertension was common in aortic stenosis and diastolic hypertension was found in aortic regurgitation.

40|$|Lawis characterised by a {{fundamental}} gap between its social embeddedness and theapparently formal automatism it operates, which gap is basically bridged by thelaw's ultimate practicality {{under the guise}} of its mere logicity.
