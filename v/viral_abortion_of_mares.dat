The aims of this study were to prove the application of Haemobalans and BF- 15 as adaptogens during late gestation. We examined 60 healthy adult Thoroughbred mares that were divided into four equal groups (n= 15) on the 270 - 300 th days of gestation.

40|$|Larvae of {{the eastern}} tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum, undergo density-dependent {{dispersal}} in response to depleted resources. Because these caterpillars have recently been implicated in <b>abortions</b> <b>of</b> pregnant <b>mares</b> (equine Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome, or MRLS), there is increased interest in managing caterpillar populations, potentially through manipula-tion of caterpillar dispersal behavior. Consequently, we investigated disper-sal patterns of food-deprived eastern tent caterpillars in artificial arenas with respect to distance, direction, and response to visual stimuli. Distance trav-eled is influenced by time of day, and is strongly correlated with time elapsed. Movement is non-random, and correlates closely with {{the position of the}} sun. The pattern is more pronounced with foraging third instars than with penulti-mate fifth instars. Visual cues appear important in caterpillar orientation, and caterpillars are responsive to vertically oriented, black objects.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study haematological and biochemical alterations associated to seropositivity to Leptospira interrogans serovar Bratislava infection in horses with reproductive alterations, such as neonatal deaths, embryonic deaths and <b>abortions.</b> A flock <b>of</b> <b>mares</b> with poor reproductive performance was studied. Eighty-two (58. 6 %) were seropositive (titre 200); 72 of those (87. 8 %) for Bratislava. Slight haematological and biochemical alterations were observed, being more frequent (P< 0. 05) in horses seropositive versus seronegative. In conclusion horses seropositive for Bratislava had no consistent, severe alteration in values for hematology and biochemistry serum. Those findings reinforce this serovar as adapted to the horse and causing only mild symptoms, focused on reproductive problems...|$|R

40|$|Absrrucr. During an {{outbreak}} <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> caused by equine herpesvirus 1, a neurologic disease characterized clinically by dullness and ataxia occurred in several mares. Equine herpesvirus 1 was isolated from brain and lung of two severely affected mares. Histologically, both mares had disseminated meningoencephalomyelitis characterized by necrotizing arteritis, focal malacia in grey and white matter of brain and spinal cord, and accumulation of lymphocytes and neutrophils in paravertebral ganglia. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies occurred in foci of necrosis in thyroid adenomas <b>of</b> both <b>mares.</b> Equine herpesvirus 1, the causative agent <b>of</b> equine <b>viral</b> <b>abortion</b> and equine <b>viral</b> rhinopneumonitis, occurs worldwide [3, 11, 161. Infection of young horses usually {{results in a}} mild respiratory disease, whereas infection <b>of</b> pregnant <b>mares</b> frequently results in abortion at 6 - 10 months. It is espe-cially hazardous in breeding stables where abortion storms may occur.

40|$|Blastic {{transformation}} of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and serum neutralization antibody levels for equine herpesivurs type 1 were measured in 19 mares from three farms {{at the time}} of termination of their pregnancy by normal foaling or <b>viral</b> <b>abortion.</b> The stimulation indexes of lymphocytes obtained from the mares from two farms (Farm 1 and 2) which had virus abortions, ranged from 2. 1 to 10. 8. But {{there was no significant difference}} in stimulation index levels between the aborting and normal foaling mares on these two farms. Equine herpesvirus type 1 was isolated from the mononuclear cells <b>of</b> one <b>mare</b> (No. 5) about two months after she aborted. The stimulation index of lymphocytes from that mare was not significantly different from that <b>of</b> other <b>mares</b> on these farms. Stimulation index of lymphocytes from the mares on one farm (Farm 3) where there was no virus abortion or previous history <b>of</b> virus <b>abortion</b> but were exposed to virus antigen from vaccination, ranged from 1. 6 to 2. 9. The serum neutralization antibody levels were low in most mares ranging from 1 / 4 to 1 / 20 and in three mares these were higher.

40|$|This review {{deals with}} the {{aetiology}} and the diagnosis <b>of</b> bovine <b>viral</b> <b>abortion.</b> While the abortion rates on beef and dairy cattle farms usually do not exceed 10 %, significant economic losses because <b>of</b> <b>abortion</b> storms may be encountered. Determining the cause <b>of</b> <b>abortions</b> is usually a challenge, and it generally remains obscure in more than 50 % of the necropsy submitted foetuses. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine herpesvirus- 1 {{are the most common}} viruses causally associated with bovine abortions in farmed cattle globally. Rift Valley fever virus and bluetongue virus are important insect-transmitted abortogenic viruses. The geographic distribution of these two viruses is primarily dependent on the distribution of the insect vector, but direct transmission is possible. Recent global warming and subsequent insect vector expansion, coupled with the increase in international trade of animals and animal products, have been important factors in recent geographic advances of those two viruses. Bovine herpesviruses- 4 and 5 in cattle, as well as other less frequent vector-borne viruses including epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus, Aino virus, Wesselsbron virus and lumpy skin disease virus, are discussed.

40|$|Equine herpesvirus- 1 (EHV- 1) is an {{important}} cause of upper respiratory tract infection in horses and {{is the leading cause}} <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>abortion</b> in pregnant <b>mares.</b> Commercially available vaccines designed to protect against EHV- 1 infection are commonly used but only elicit a short-lived immune response and are ineffective in preventing <b>viral</b> <b>abortion.</b> Recent studies have shown that EHV- 1 infection induces a multifaceted protective immune response. Elicitation of such protective immunity through vaccination remains {{an important}} goal of EHV- 1 research. Epidermal powder immunization (EPI) is a vaccination technology that delivers inactivated vaccine antigen intradermally in conjunction with trehalose sugar particles, utilizing a helium gas-powered “gun”. This technology has proven successful using a variety of antigens in a number of animal models. In this study, five one-year-old ponies were vaccinated on 3 occasions, 4 weeks apart against EHV- 1 using EPI. Four ponies were untreated and served as controls. Serum and nasal secretion samples were collected from each experimental animal at regular intervals, allowing measurement of EHV-specific antibody in both systemic and mucosal immune compartments. EHV-neutralizing antibody titers in serum were also measured. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected for analysis of vaccine-induced virus-specific cellular immunity. Virus neutralizing antibody was shown to increase in one immunized pony following 3 doses of vaccine. However, no further increases in virus-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were observed in any animals in response to this novel vaccination strategy. Optimization of the intradermal delivery of inactivated EHV- 1 must be carried out prior to the further investigation of EPI technology in horses...|$|R
