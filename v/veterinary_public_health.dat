40|$|The <b>public</b> <b>health</b> {{challenges}} of the 21 st century demand that multidisciplinary groups of professionals work together to address new and re-emerging issues affecting global health and ecologic stability. Urbanization, globalization, climate shift, and terrorism have brought {{the need for a}} more diverse <b>public</b> <b>health</b> workforce to the forefront of public planning (Pappaioanou, 2004). Many emerging health issues are linked to increasing contact between humans and wildlife, intensification and integration of food production, and the expansion of international travel (World Health Organization, 1999). A rise in antimicrobial resistance, the growth of the immunocompromised population, and a changing global environment calls for an integrated response from medical, <b>veterinary,</b> and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> professionals.

40|$|Pork {{safety is}} an {{important}} <b>public</b> <b>health</b> concern in Vietnam and is a shared responsibility among many actors along the pork value chain. We examined the knowledge, perceptions, and practices regarding food safety, disease, and health risk among selected pork value chain actors (slaughterhouse owners and workers, people living around slaughterhouses, pork sellers, consumers, and <b>veterinary</b> and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> staff) in three districts in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam. We randomly selected 52 pork value chain actors to be surveyed through questionnaires, observation checklists, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. Most slaughterhouse workers acquired knowledge and experience of food safety through ''learning by doing'' rather than from training by a <b>veterinary</b> or <b>public</b> <b>health</b> professional. Both slaughterhouse worker and pork seller groups had some accurate perceptions about pig diseases and foodborne diseases; however, misperceptions of risk and, especially, of zoonoses were present. Furthermore, while workers and sellers often use cloths to dry the meat and clean equipment, they did not {{think this was a}} risk for meat contamination. Moreover, when sellers wear protective equipment, such as gloves, masks, or hats, consumers perceive that the sellers may have health issues they are trying to conceal and so consumers avoid buying from them. The perceived freshness of pork, along with trust in the seller and in the pork production process, were strong indicators of consumer preference. And yet, pork value chain actors tend to trust their own individual food safety practices more, rather than the practices of other actors along the chain. <b>Veterinary</b> and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> staff emphasized the gap between regulations and food safety practices. Education and training on food safety risks and proper handling are priorities, along with integrated and intensive efforts to improve food safety among pork value chain actors. Peer Revie...|$|R

40|$|Pig {{production}} {{plays an}} important role in both food supply and economic development in Vietnam. We assessed the food safety awareness and practice of involved key actors along the smallholder pig value chains in Hung Yen, Vietnam using participatory approaches. Data collection included quantitative (checklists, questionnaires) and qualitative (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions-FGD) tools and was done in three districts of Hung Yen. All survey tools were developed and pre-tested. Checklists (n= 22) and questionnaires (n= 12) followed random sampling procedures. The respondents for in-depth interviews (n= 24) were randomly selected, while the participants for FGDs (n= 5) were recruited by convenience. Data collection was done between January and June, 2013. Descriptive statistic was used for quantitative data, while content analysis was used for qualitative data. The outline for data collection for included groups and stakeholders (slaughterhouse workers, pork sellers, <b>veterinary</b> and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> staff, people living around slaughterhouses, pork consumers) was structured around food safety, diseases and health risks. Differences in what some groups found important or unsafe, based on their occupational priorities or labour focus were identified by using ranking tables and analysed accordingly. Analyses show that for slaughterhouse workers and pork sellers the food safety risks were highest and linked to lack of training, or relying only on “learning by doing” an experience provided by other workers or sellers. People living around slaughterhouses expressed concerns about health effects but also pointed out the advantages of their proximity to slaughterhouses, such as job opportunities and easy access to fresh pork. Pork consumer groups were more concerned about sensorial criteria (e. g. freshly looking, bright red colour) and expressed also some awareness on pork quality. <b>Veterinary</b> and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> staff emphasised the gap between existing legislation and food safety practices. Findings provide information on food safety awareness and practices along various actors and stakeholders. There is a need for improved standards, targeted training and collaborative mechanisms between <b>veterinary</b> and <b>public</b> <b>health</b> authorities to better manage the food production chain...|$|R
