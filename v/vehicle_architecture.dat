40|$|The Tsiolkovsky Group is {{a private}} {{academic}} study group, initiated in 2005 {{for the sole purpose}} of directing the discussion, analysis and study of the low Earth orbit propulsion, launch and life support systems needed to enable the future development, exploration and colonization of space. The group has been meeting informally, weekly and monthly, in order to update and integrate the individual study efforts, and to coordinate group efforts, further enabling the scientific, technical and engineering development of rational, affordable and sustainable launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>architectures.</b> The initial formation of this study group was in response to the announcement of Constellation, but the organization can trace its roots back to 1985 and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. For a few years in the early 1980 s, tentative space shuttle and space commercialization efforts briefly flourished under a set of faulty low Earth orbit launcher cost, flight rate and lift capability assumptions, which were becoming apparent shortly before the Challenger disaster in early 1986. Remaining illusions of inexpensive and readily available low Earth orbit space transportation evaporated on January 28, 1986, and the concept of innovative launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>architectures</b> and space development and exploration scenarios became the focus of intense and perpetual debate, deviating remarkably from the initial 1970 s concepts of O’Neill colonies with reusable launc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A novel design methodology, {{associated}} algorithms, {{and tools}} {{for the design}} of complex automotive cyber-physical systems are presented. Rather than supporting the critical path where most resources are spent, we preemptively target the concept design phase that determines 75 % of a vehicle’s cost. In our methodology, the marriage of systems engineering principles with high-level synthesis techniques results in a Functional Modeling Compiler capable of generating high-fidelity simulation models for the design space exploration and validation of multiple cyber-physical (ECUs+Physics) <b>vehicle</b> <b>architectures.</b> Using real-world automotive use-cases, we demonstrate how functional models capturing cyber-physical aspects are synthesized into high-fidelity simulation models.

The structure {{makes it possible to}} compare different hybrid <b>vehicle</b> <b>architectures</b> directly with the capability to study the influence of real-world driver behaviour on energy usage. Three types of HEV architectures, including Mild Parallel, Series, and Power Split, are illustrated to show the feasibility of this modelling technique...|$|R

Since 1989, forward thinking engineering has characterized the history of ANCÆUS and VCS.
