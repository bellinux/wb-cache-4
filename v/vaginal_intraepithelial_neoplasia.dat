50|$|Examples of {{dysplasia}} include epithelial dysplasia of the cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - {{a disorder}} commonly detected by an abnormal pap smear) consisting of an increased population of immature (basal-like) cells which {{are restricted to}} the mucosal surface, and have not invaded through the basement membrane to the deeper soft tissues.

40|$|Two {{cell lines}} derived from <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> (VAINs) expressing human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) 33 (VAIN I, UT-DEC- 1) and 16 (VAIN II, UT-DEC- 2) E 6 -E 7 mRNA were studied in organotypic culture for their keratins and cell cycle regulatory proteins {{in relation to}} replicative aging. Early-passage UT-DEC- 1 and UT-DEC- 2 cells reproduced epithelial patterns consistent with VAIN. Cells from later passages resembled full-thickness <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (UT-DEC- 1) and microinvasive cancer (UT-DEC- 2). The morphological changes were compatible with these cell lines' ability for anchorage-independent growth at later passages. Simple epithelial keratins were aberrantly expressed in both cell lines. K 18 (absent in normal vaginal keratinocytes) and K 17 expression increased in UT-DEC- 1 and UT-DEC- 2 cells at late passages. No marked differences in expression of p 53 (wild type in both cell lines), mdm- 2 or PCNA were detected in parallel with progression. The expression of p 21 WAF 1 /cip 1 localized mostly to {{the upper half of}} the epithelium at early passage and was more intense in the HPV 16 -positive UT-DEC- 2 cell line expressing K 10. In Northern blot analyses, the transcription pattern of the HPV 33 E 6 -E 7 of the UT-DEC- 1 cell line changed during later passages, whereas that of the HPV 16 E 6 -E 7 of the UT-DEC- 2 cell line remained unaltered. The present characterization of the phenotype of these cell lines derived from natural squamous intraepithelial lesions shows an association between simple epithelial-type keratin expression and progressive changes in growth and morphology, but fails to demonstrate consistent changes in the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins studied in parallel with progression...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vaginal</b> {{squamous}} <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (VaIN) is uncommon {{when comparing}} to the cervical or vulval counterparts. Almost all {{are caused by}} infection of human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Traditionally, VaIN was classified into grades I, II, and III, depending {{on the degree of}} involvement of the epithelium by the dysplastic cells. The 2013 Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) Standardization Project working group and the World Health Organization (WHO) 2014 classification recommend that lesions that are considered as condyloma and VaIN I should now be classified as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs). LSIL is a morphological manifestation of transient, usually low-risk HPV infection. VaIN II/III lesions signify persistent infection by high-risk HPV and are considered precancerous; they should now be classified as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). The change in nomenclature reduces the problem of interobserver variability in assessing VaIN II and also classifies lesions into two biological and managerial groups. Histological assessment of problematic HSIL may be supported by using several immunohistochemical stains such as p 16, ki- 67, and ProEx C. Patients with persistent high-risk HPV infection are at an increased risk of recurrence and development into squamous cell carcinoma. Although many studies on HPV-associated lesions were done on the cervix, given the biological similarity between those in the vagina and other lower genital sites, it is conceivable that they can be regarded as closely related lesions even if not a single disease entity. Premalignant glandular lesions of the vagina are rare and a brief account will be given...|$|R
40|$|Background: The vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> {{is divided}} into two groups: usual type and {{differentiated}} type. The differentiated vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> which is frequently seen together with the invasive squamous cell carcinoma can be confused with some benign lesions. To analyse p 16, p 53, and Ki- 67 expression characteristics of different histological types of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> is aimed in this study. Methods: In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of 18 vulvectomy cases with p 16, p 53, and Ki- 67 was performed. Results: Of 18 patient who underwent vulvectomy, 9 had invasive squamous cell carcinoma and 9 vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> 3 additional vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> lesions were found accompanying the invasive squamous cell carcinomas. Mean Ki- 67 PI was 32, 3 % in usual type (human papilloma virus-related) vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> cases (n: 9), and 26, 4 % in differentiated vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> cases (n: 3) (p> 0, 05). Mean p 16 staining degree was 2, 6 for usual type vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias.</b> No p 53 expression was present in squamous cell hyperplasia or lichen sclerosis lesions. Conclusions: Ki- 67 PI does not have significant value in recognizing vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> usual type and differentiated vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> p 53 positivity can be of value in distinguishing especially differentiated type vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> from benign lesions...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{variability}} among histopathologists in diagnosing and grading cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> eight experienced histopathologists based at different hospitals examined {{the same set}} of 100 consecutive colposcopic cervical biopsy specimens and assigned them into one of six diagnostic categories. These were normal squamous epithelium, non-neoplastic squamous proliferations, cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grades I, II, and III, and other. The histopathologists were given currently accepted criteria for diagnosing and grading cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and asked to mark their degree of confidence about their decision on a visual linear analogue scale provided. The degree of agreement between the histopathologists was characterised by kappa statistics, which showed an overall poor agreement (unweighted kappa 0. 358). Agreement between observers was excellent for invasive lesions, moderately good for cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grade III, and poor for cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grades I and II (unweighted kappa 0. 832, 0. 496, 0. 172, and 0. 175, respectively); the kappa value for all grades of cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> taken together was 0. 660. The most important source of disagreement lay in the distinction of reactive squamous proliferations from cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grade I. The histopathologists were confident in diagnosing cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grade III and invasive carcinoma (other) but not as confident in diagnosing cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grades I and II and glandular atypia (other). Experienced histopathologists show considerable interobserver variability in grading cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and more importantly in distinguishing between reactive squamous proliferations and cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grade I.

40|$|Purpose: We {{attempted}} to characterize patients diagnosed with prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> without concurrent cancer on biopsy who had prostate cancer on subsequent biopsy. Materials and Methods: The records of 93 patients with {{low and high}} grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> without concurrent cancer on initial biopsy were analyzed. The relationships among prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grades, patient age, digital rectal examination, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), transrectal ultrasound appearance and final pathological results were investigated. Results: Subsequent carcinoma was found on repeat biopsy in 13. 3 % of patients with low grade and 47. 9 % with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (p < 0. 001). In the former group digital rectal examination, patient age, serum PSA and transrectal ultrasound were not predictive of cancer. Transrectal ultrasound appearance, digital rectal examination and serum PSA were statistically different between high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> with and without subsequent cancer (p < 0. 001, p = 0. 008 and p = 0. 016, respectively, univariate analysis). On multivariate analysis of patients with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> only digital rectal examination and PSA were predictive of subsequent carcinoma. Conclusions: High grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> is a strong predictor of subsequent cancer, especially in men with abnormal digital rectal examination and elevated serum PSA. Patients with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> should undergo repeat biopsy to exclude cancer.

40|$|This review, {{the second}} in The Lancet series in {{prostate}} cancer, follows on from the review on epidemiology and precedes the articles on clinical management and screening, but is relevant to all three. Pathology Relation between prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and cancer High-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> consists of architecturally benign prostatic acini lined by cells {{that seem to be}} malignant. 1, 2 Prostates with carcinoma have more of these foci than do those without carcinoma. 3 Prostate glands with extensive high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> also have more multifocal carcinomas. That carcinomas have zones of high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> from which glands of carcinoma seem to stem is further histological evidence that this neoplasia is a precursor to some prostate carcinomas. 4 High-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> preferentially develops in the peripheral zone of the prostate, which is the site of origin for most adenocarcinomas. 3 Various biomarkers are either expressed in the same high quantities (compared with benign prostate tissue) in both high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and carcinoma or are expressed at levels between those of benign prostate tissue and carcinoma. 3, 5 High-grade <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> seems to be a precursor lesion to many peripheral intermediate to high-grade adenocarcinomas of the prostate, but the lesion is not a necessary precursor because many early cancers do not have adjacent high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Also, low-grade carci-nomas, especially those within the transition zone, are not closely related to high-grade <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{attempted}} {{to evaluate the}} therapeutic effect of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (VaIN) after hysterectomy and to identify factors affecting persistence/recurrence. Methods: Twenty-eight post-hysterectomy patients with various grades of VaIN were enrolled in this study between January 2001 and December 2003. They were managed with intravaginal 50 %TCAonceweekly for 1 – 4 weeks, and all patientswere followed upevery 3 months for at least 1 year. Assessments by Papanicolaou smear and colposcopy were performed, as was biopsy when indicated during the follow-up period. Cox regression {{analysis was used to}} identify independent factors predicting persistence/recurrence. Results: In 20 of 28 patients (71. 4 %) VaINwent into remission. Treatment successwas observed in all 11 patients with VaIN I, whereas only 9 out of 17 patients (53 %) with VaIN II/III went into remission (P = 0. 009). Severity of VaIN was the only significant independent predictor of persist-ence/recurrence (odds ratio = 3. 5; 95 % confidence interval = 1. 1, 11. 6; P = 0. 038). The treat-ment was well tolerated with no major side effects. Conclusions: Based on our findings, 50 % TCA was a potential agent with minimal side effects for low-grade VaIN.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the prophylactic {{efficacy of the}} human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent vaccine in preventing low grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias and anogenital warts (condyloma acuminata). Design: Data from two international, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised efficacy trials of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (protocol 013 (FUTURE I) and protocol 015 (FUTURE II)). The trials were to be 4 years in length, and the results reported are from final study data of 42 months' follow-up. Setting: Primary care centres and university or hospital associated health centres in 24 countries and territories around the world. Participants: 17 622 women aged 16 - 26 years enrolled between December 2001 and May 2003. Major exclusion criteria were lifetime {{number of sexual partners}} (> 4), history of abnormal cervical smear test results, and pregnancy. Intervention: Three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (for serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18) or placebo at day 1, month 2, and month 6. Main outcome measures: Vaccine efficacy against cervical, vulvar, and <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grade I and condyloma in a per protocol susceptible population that included subjects who received all three vaccine doses, tested negative for the relevant vaccine HPV types at day 1 and remained negative through month 7, and had no major protocol violations. Intention to treat, generally HPV naive, and unrestricted susceptible populations were also studied. Results: In the per protocol susceptible population, vaccine efficacy against lesions related to the HPV types in the vaccine was 96 % for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I (95 % confidence interval 91 % to 98 %), 100 % for both vulvar and <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grade I (95 % CIs 74 % to 100 %, 64 % to 100 % respectively), and 99 % for condyloma (96 % to 100 %). Vaccine efficacy against any lesion (regardless of HPV type) in the generally naive population was 30 % (17 % to 41 %), 75 % (22 % to 94 %), and 48 % (10 % to 71 %) for cervical, vulvar, and <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> grade I, respectively, and 83 % (74 % to 89 %) for condyloma. Conclusions: Quadrivalent HPV vaccine provided sustained protection against low grade lesions attributable to vaccine HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18) and a substantial reduction in the burden of these diseases through 42 months of follow-up.

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{performance of}} isolated high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in prostatic biopsies {{has recently been}} questioned, and molecular analysis of high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> has been proposed for improved prediction of prostate cancer. Here, we retrospectively studied the value of isolated high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and the immunohistochemical markers ?-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase, Bcl- 2, annexin II, and Ki- 67 for better risk stratification of high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> in our local Swiss population. From an initial 165 diagnoses of isolated high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> we refuted 61 (37 %) after consensus expert review. We used 30 reviewed high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> cases with simultaneous biopsy prostate cancer as positive controls. Rebiopsies were performed in 66 patients with isolated high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> and the median time interval between initial and repeat biopsy was 3 months. Twenty (30 %) of the rebiopsies were positive for prostate cancer, and 10 (15 %) showed persistent isolated high-grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Another 2 (3 %) of the 66 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer in a second rebiopsy. Mean prostate-specific antigen serum levels did not significantly differ between the 22 patients with prostate cancer and the 44 without prostate cancer in rebiopsies, and the 30 positive control patients, respectively (median values, 8. 1, 7. 7, and 8. 8 ng/mL). None of the immunohistochemical markers, including ?-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase, Bcl- 2, annexin II, and Ki- 67, revealed a statistically significant association with the risk of prostate cancer in repeat biopsies.

40|$|Abstract Background Human {{papillomavirus}} {{is responsible}} {{for a variety of}} diseases including grade 2 and 3 vulvar and <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} assess parts of the burden of the last diseases including treatment costs. The direct medical resource use and cost of surgery associated with neoplasia and related diagnostic procedures (statutory health insurance perspective) were estimated, as were the indirect costs (productivity losses) associated with surgical treatment and related gynaecology visits for diagnostic purposes. Methods Data from 1991 - 2008 were retrospectively collected from patient records of the outpatient unit of the Gynaecological Dysplasia Clinic, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany. Two subgroups of patients were analysed descriptively: women undergoing one surgical procedure related to a diagnosis of vulvar and/or <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> and women undergoing two or more surgical procedures. Target measures were per-capita medical resource consumption, direct medical cost and indirect cost. Results Of the 94 women analysed, 52 underwent one surgical intervention and 42 two or more interventions (mean of 3. 0 interventions during the total period of analysis). Patients undergoing one surgical intervention accrued € 881 in direct costs and € 682 in indirect costs; patients undergoing more than one intervention accrued € 2, 605 in direct costs and € 2, 432 in indirect costs. Conclusions The economic burden on German statutory health insurance funds and society induced by surgical interventions and related diagnostic procedures for grade 2 / 3 vulvar and vaginal neoplasia should not be underrated.

Of 99 patients with <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> 1 for whom follow-up data was available, 62 (73 %) showed spontaneous regression, 17 (20 %) demonstrated persistent low-grade lesion, and 7 (7 %) progressed to <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> 2 / 3. Expressions of p 16 INK 4 a and staining with ProEx C were significantly higher in the progression group than in the regression group. Testing for p 16 INK 4 a and ProEx C was sensitive (86 %) and moderately specific (60 % and 61 %, respectively) in predicting the progression of cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> 1. Human papilloma virus DNA testing was highly sensitive (100 %) but less specific (37 %). In conclusion, this study revealed that p 16 INK 4 a and ProEx C are useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of cervical <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia,</b> and have potential as predictors of progression of low-grade lesions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Objective High-grade <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (vaginal HSIL) {{represents}} an uncommon entity. Here, {{we sought to}} identify predictors for recurrence and risk factor for developing genital cancers after primary treatment for vaginal HSIL. Methods Data of consecutive 5104 women who had human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test were searched for identify women with histological confirmed vaginal HSIL. Disease-free interval {{and the risk of}} developing HPV-related gynecological cancers were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models. Results Overall, 77 patients were included. After a mean (SD) follow-up of 69. 3 (33. 0) months, 11 (14 %) and 4 (5 %) patients experienced vaginal HSIL recurrence and the occurrence of HPV-related gynecological cancers, respectively. Via multivariate analysis factors predicting for vaginal HSIL recurrence were infection from HPV 31 at diagnosis (HR: 5. 0 (95 %CI: 1. 17, 21. 3); pÂ =Â  0. 03) and persistence of HPV infection after treatment (HR: 7. 0 (95 %CI: 1. 54, 31. 6); pÂ =Â  0. 01). Additionally, patients who had LASER ablation experienced a trend toward a lower risk of recurrence in comparison to medical treatment (HR: 0. 20 (95 %CI: 0. 03, 1. 09); pÂ =Â  0. 06). Considering the occurrence of HPV-related gynecological cancers, we observed that no factors independently correlated with this risk; while, a trend towards higher risk was observed for women with HIV infection (HR: 16. 4 (95 %CI: 0. 90, 300. 1); pÂ =Â  0. 06) and persistence of HPV infection (HR: 13. 3 (95 %CI: 0. 76, 230. 2); pÂ =Â  0. 07). Conclusions Patients affected by vaginal HSIL experienced a relatively high risk of recurrence. Persistence of HPV after treatment and pretreatment HPV- 31 infection predicts for high-grade <b>vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> recurrence. Further investigations are warranted in order to corroborate our data...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (VaIN) {{represents}} {{a rare and}} asymptomatic pre-neoplastic lesion. Its natural history and potential evolution into invasive cancer are uncertain. VaIN can occur alone or as a synchronous or metachronous lesion with cervical and vulvar HPV-related intra epithelial or invasive neoplasia. Its association with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is found in 65 % of cases, with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in 10 % of cases, while for others, the association with concomitant cervical or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias is found in 30 - 80 % of cases. VaIN is often asymptomatic and its diagnosis is suspected in cases of abnormal cytology, followed by colposcopy and colposcopically-guided biopsy of suspicious areas. In the past, high-grade VaIN and multifocal VaIN have been treated by radical surgery, such as total or partial upper vaginectomy associated with hysterectomy and radiotherapy. The need to maintain the integrity of reproductive capacity has determined the transition from radical therapies to conservative ones, according to the different patients' characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Vulvar cancer {{represents}} an important medical problem worldwide whose incidence is increasing {{at an alarming}} rate in young females. Several factors have been linked to vulvar cancer development, but its exact pathogenesis remains to be determined. Vulvar tumorigenesis proceeds through intermediate dysplastic lesions, known as vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias,</b> frequently associated with non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus and squamous cell hyperplasia. In this study, the expression of the CDK inhibitor p 27 (Kip 1) and the extent of endogenous oxidative DNA damage were evaluated in vulvar specimens, including normal tissues, lichen sclerosus, squamous cell hyperplasia, vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> and invasive squamous cell carcinomas. We found that p 27 (Kip 1) was constantly expressed in normal vulvar epithelium cells while a progressive significant reduction in the percentage of p 27 (Kip 1) -positive cells was observed in vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> (77 %) and in invasive carcinomas (64 %). Mean percentage of positive cells in invasive carcinomas, but not in vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias,</b> was also significantly lower than squamous cell hyperplasia lesions (78 %) while lichen sclerosus displayed a percentage of positive cells (45 %) significantly lower than both vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> and invasive carcinomas. 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) is considered a sensitive biomarker for oxidative stress. We observed a progressive significant increase in the levels of 8 -OHdG and in the percentage of positive cells from normal vulvar epithelium to vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> (25 %) and to invasive carcinomas (64 %). Squamous cell hyperplasia displayed an intermediate percentage of positive cells comparable to vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> 2 but significantly higher than vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> 1 and lower than invasive carcinomas. Lichen sclerosus staining was significantly lower than carcinomas but higher than vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> and squamous cell hyperplasia. These results demonstrate that expression of p 27 (Kip 1) is downregulated while oxidative DNA damage increases from early non-neoplastic epithelial alterations through vulvar <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasias</b> to invasive vulvar carcinomas. Thus, both parameters might {{play an important role in}} the development of this cancer and their study might contribute to our understanding of human vulvar carcinogenesis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Policlinico Tor Vergata, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy Purpose: We {{evaluated}} {{the association between}} the number of biopsy cores revealing high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> and prostate cancer in an era of extended biopsy protocol. Materials and Methods: From December 2004 to September 2007 patients referred to our clinic with a prostate specific antigen of 4 ng/ml or greater or an abnormal digital rectal examination were scheduled for transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy with a 12 -core template. In patients with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> we proposed a second prostate specific antigen evaluation and a new 12 -core biopsy after 6 months independent of prostate specific antigen. Nonparametric tests were applied for statistical analysis. Results: We evaluated 650 patients. Of the 147 patients (22 %) with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> 117 underwent a second biopsy 6 months later. Patient characteristics (age, prostate specific antigen, free-to-total prostate specific antigen ratio, prostate volume, prostate specific antigen density) were similar at initial and repeat biopsy. On second biopsy 22 patients (18. 8 %) presented with prostate cancer (14 with Gleason score 6, 7 with Gleason score 7 and 1 with a Gleason score 8), 75 showed isolated high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> (64. 2 %) and 20 (17 %) had chronic prostatitis. The number of cores (4 or more) involved with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> on the first biopsy was significantly associated with prostate cancer on the second biopsy (p 0. 001). Prostate specific antigen could not be used to distinguish prostate cancer from benign disease or high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia.</b> Conclusions: The number of cores with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> seems {{to be associated with the}} presence of cancer on second biopsy. A 6 -month biopsy is recommended in patients with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> when 4 or more cores with high grade prostatic <b>intraepithelial</b> <b>neoplasia</b> are detected in the initial biopsy sample independent of prostate specific antigen...|$|R
