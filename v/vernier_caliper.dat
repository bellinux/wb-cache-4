5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>Vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> {{using the}} scale invented by Pierre Vernier ...|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper,</b> {{reading to}} {{thousandths}} of an inch, {{was invented by}} American Joseph R. Brown in 1851. It was the first practical tool for exact measurements that could be sold at a price within the reach of ordinary machinists.|$|E
5000|$|In Romanian, German {{loans are}} {{especially}} found in names for craft items: bormaşină (drill, in German Bohrmaschine), ştecher (plug, Stecker), şurub (screw, Schraube), şubler (<b>vernier</b> <b>caliper,</b> Schublehre), şnur (electric cord, German Schnur is cord in general), {{but there are}} also: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> are rugged {{and have}} long lasting accuracy, are coolant proof, are not {{affected}} by magnetic fields, and are largely shock proof. They may have both centimeter and inch scales. However, <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> require good eyesight or a magnifying glass to read and {{can be difficult to}} read from a distance or from awkward angles. It is relatively easy to misread the last digit. In production environments, reading <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> all day long is error-prone and is annoying to the workers.|$|R
5000|$|Direct reading {{tools such}} as rules, scales, and <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> ...|$|R
50|$|They {{are also}} trained {{to work with}} a wide array of {{precision}} tools, such as <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> micrometers, dial indicators, levels, gauge blocks, and optical and laser alignment tooling.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{existing}} colloquially but not {{in formal}} usage is referring to a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> as a [...] "vernier" [...] or a [...] "pair of verniers". In imprecise colloquial usage, some speakers extend this even to dial calipers, although they involve no vernier scale.|$|E
50|$|Positive {{zero error}} {{refers to the}} fact that when the jaws of the <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> are just closed, the reading is a {{positive}} reading away from the actual reading of 0.00mm. If the reading is 0.10mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm.|$|E
50|$|A caliper must be {{properly}} applied against the part {{in order to}} take the desired measurement. For example, when measuring the thickness of a plate a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> must be held at right angles to the piece. Some practice may be needed to measure round or irregular objects correctly.|$|E
40|$|To enable {{investigation}} of palatal changes in infants who are prematurely born, {{it is necessary}} to first establish a reliable method of measurement of these tiny edentulous palates. This study compared the Olivetti-Inspector machine, <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> and stereophotogrammetry for this purpose. Measurements were taken of 12 palatal casts of four infants at prescribed time intervals during the neonatal period. In each of the three methods, measurements were recorded as variables generated in the X and Z axes of the Cartesian scale in relation to three specified points along the Y axis. The results revealed that all methods were comparable, but the <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> differed significantly from the other two methods in height measurements, (p < 0. 001). It was also found that both the Olivetti-Inspector machine and the <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> consistently underestimated the width, compared with Olivetti-Inspector machine, (p < 0. 05). Stereophotogrammetry was found to be the most consistent method of measuring the configuration of preterm infant palates...|$|R
30|$|N.B: To {{facilitate}} accurate measurement, the caliper {{scale was}} aligned {{parallel to the}} long axis of the foot. The long axis of the foot runs through the second digit. Foot breadth was measured perpendicular to the long axis with <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> as a straight distance between the metatarsal fibulare and metatarsal tibiale, with the foot in a fully stretched position.|$|R
50|$|The vernier scales {{may include}} metric {{measurements}} {{on the lower}} part of the scale and inch measurements on the upper, or vice versa, in countries that use inches. <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> commonly used in industry provide a precision to 0.01 mm (10 micrometres), or one thousandth of an inch. They are available in sizes that can measure up to 72 in.|$|R
50|$|Calibrated {{calipers}} may be mishandled, {{leading to}} loss of zero. When a calipers' jaws are fully closed, it should of course indicate zero. If it does not, {{it must be}} recalibrated or repaired. It might seem that a <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> cannot get out of calibration but a drop or knock can be enough. Digital calipers have zero set buttons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{method to}} use a vernier scale or caliper with zero error {{is to use the}} formula [...] "actual reading = main scale + vernier scale − (zero error)". Zero error may arise due to knocks that cause the {{calibration}} at the 0.00 mm when the jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other. Positive zero error refers to the fact that when the jaws of the <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> are just closed, the reading is a positive reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm. If the reading is 0.10 mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm. Negative zero error refers to the fact that when the jaws of the <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> are just closed, the reading is a negative reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm. If the reading is −0.08 mm, the zero error is referred to as −0.08 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method is}} to read {{the position of the}} pointer directly on the scale. When the pointer is between two markings, the user can mentally interpolate to improve the precision of the reading. This would be a simple calibrated caliper; but the addition of a vernier scale allows more accurate interpolation, and is the universal practice; this is the <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper.</b>|$|E
30|$|The SH, BD and CW {{data for}} each progeny at 4  years of age were {{measured}} using diameter tape and <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> The {{location of the}} BD measurements was on the trunk, 20  cm above the ground. The CW of each seedling was calculated using the mean value of canopy diameter measured along two different orientations: from south to north and from east to west.|$|R
50|$|In machine design, some {{components}} are particularly sensitive to angular errors. For example, if {{the shaft of}} a lathe is angled slightly, the part will have errors in diameter far down the part. <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> are not free from abbe error, while screw gauges are free from abbe error. Abbe error {{is the product of}} the abbe offset and the sine of angular error in the system.|$|R
50|$|A vernier {{throttle}} is a throttle {{often used}} in aircraft. It uses a cable and a screw mechanism to provide the operator precise control over an engine's operation. The concept is similar in use to <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements. Like many other inventions that bear his name, the Vernier throttle {{is based on the}} work of mathematician Pierre Vernier.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{use of the}} <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> is {{to measure}} the {{internal}} and the external diameters of an object. To measure using a vernier scale, the user first reads the finely marked [...] "fixed" [...] scale (in the diagram). This measure is typically {{between two of the}} scale's smallest graduations. The user then reads the finer vernier scale (see diagram), which measures between the smallest graduations on the fixed scale—providing much greater precision.|$|E
5000|$|...  Equipment :- The {{laboratory}} has {{the major}} equipment like Aggregate Impact Test Apparatus, Digital Compression Testing Machine Capacity 2000KN CBR Machine, Speedy Moisture Meter, Permeability Apparatus, Proctor Compaction Apparatus, Rebound Hammer Apparatus, Shrinkage Limit Apparatus, Universal Entractor Frame, Unconfined Compression Test Apparatus, <b>Vernier</b> <b>Caliper</b> Digital, Hot Air Oven Vibrating Table Concrete Cube, Length and Thickness Gauge, Liquid Limit Device, Vicat Apparatus Vibrating Table Cement, Oven Humidity Refrigerated Blain Air Permeability Test Apparatus, Acceleration Curing Tank Apparatus, Consolidation Apparatus Signal Gauge, Electronic Balance 15KG, Industrial Ultrasonic Humidifier.|$|E
50|$|The same {{observations}} and technique apply {{to this type}} of caliper, as for the above inside caliper. With some understanding of their limitations and usage, these instruments can provide a high degree of accuracy and repeatability. They are especially useful when measuring over very large distances, consider if the calipers are used to measure a large diameter pipe. A <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> does not have the depth capacity to straddle this large diameter {{while at the same time}} reach the outermost points of the pipe's diameter. They are made from high carbon steel.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} endowed with many {{teaching}} and experimental instruments, such as desks, chairs, microscopes, <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> and multitesters from the Official Development Assistance Japan. This was the sequence to the Japan's 3rd Program of Secondary Education Equipment for Minority Areas in the People's Republic of China (第三次少数民族地区中学教育器材装备计划) launched by ODA Japan in 1999; the No.1 Senior High School {{was one of}} those to have been endowed, while the equipment was put into service in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Zero {{error is}} defined as such a {{condition}} when a measuring instrument registers a reading when {{there should not be}} any reading. In case of <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> it occurs when a zero on main scale does not coincide with a zero on vernier scale. Rather the zero error may be of two types i.e. when the scale is towards numbers greater than zero it is positive else negative.The method to use a <b>vernier</b> scale or <b>caliper</b> with zero error is to use the formula: actual reading = main scale + vernier scale − (zero error).Zero error may arise due to knocks that cause the calibration at the 0.00 mm when the jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other.|$|R
30|$|Studies {{comparing}} {{the accuracy of}} implant impression techniques with methods such as micrometers, <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> strain gauges, or measuring microscopes could merely carry out two-dimensional measurements [5, 34 – 36]. However, when the measurements are two dimensional only, relevant information is lost. Therefore, CMM {{was used as the}} measuring device in this study because it made three-dimensional evaluation of any distortion possible. When points from different implant casts have a common reference within a coordinate system, the 3 D orientation of analogs can be recorded [37].|$|R
5000|$|For example, a sundial {{may only}} have scale marks {{representing}} {{the hours of}} daylight; {{it would have a}} least count of one hour. A stopwatch used to time a race might resolve down to a hundredth of a second, its least count. The stopwatch is more precise at measuring time intervals than the sundial because it has more [...] "counts" [...] (scale intervals) in each hour of elapsed time.Least count of an instrument is one of the very important tools in order to get accurate readings of instruments like <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> and screw gauge used in various experiments.|$|E
50|$|Wayne A Bolton {{presented}} {{this analysis}} in the year 1958. In 1962, he published another paper which talked about clinical applications of using Bolton Analysis in Orthodontics. He was the graduate of University of Washington's first dental class in 1950 and also the first orthodontic class of 1952. A boley gauge is usually the instrument of choice to measure the widths of each teeth. However, in 1995, Shellhart et al. showed during their study that <b>Vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> {{can also be used}} as an alternative for Bolton Analysis. Many other investigation models have been developed, such as measurement from photocopies and traveling microscope but the studies have produced no results.|$|E
50|$|To {{construct}} a device {{takes more than}} knowledge of circuits, many would urge that the mechanical aspects of cabinets, cases and chassis' are the most time consuming aspects of audio DIY. Drilling, metalworking and physical measurements are critical to constructing almost any DIY audio project, especially speakers. Measuring equipment such as a <b>Vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> is often essential. Woodworking skills are required to construct wooden enclosures (e.g. for speakers), with some enthusiasts going beyond traditional woodworking to CNC lathing, and luxurious veneers and lacquers. Room acoustics solutions are also popular among DIYers, {{as they can be}} made with inexpensive and readily available insulating materials, and can be dimensioned to fit each particular room in a precise and aesthetically pleasing way.|$|E
50|$|A vernier {{thruster}} is {{a rocket}} engine {{used on a}} spacecraft for fine adjustments to the attitude or velocity of a spacecraft. Depending {{on the design of}} a craft's maneuvering and stability systems it may simply be a smaller thruster next to the main propulsion motors, or it may complement larger attitude control motors, or may {{be a part of the}} reaction control system.The name is derived from <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> (named after Pierre Vernier) which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} first case of leucism in the spadenose shark, Scoliodon laticaudus from India. This report {{is based on the}} study of a single {{specimen}} of S. laticaudus caught by a commercial trawler off Mangalore coast. Photographs were taken and measurements recorded using <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> Partial reduction in pigmentation and no other morphometric differences were seen between the specimen studied and other normal spadenose sharks. Conclusion of leucism in the specimen was done based on the partial lack of integumentary pigments and normal eye colour...|$|R
30|$|Routinely cultured {{hepatoma}} {{cells were}} collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS to 2 [*]×[*] 106 cells/mL. A total of 0.2  mL of the prepared cell suspension (4 [*]×[*] 105 HepG 2 cells) was {{injected into the}} right armpit of each nude mouse and tumor growth observed every other day. Typically, subcutaneous foreleg tumors became visible after 5 to 7  days. At this time, tumor sizes were measured with <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers,</b> and the long diameter, short diameter, and height of each tumor were recorded. Treatment started when tumor volumes reached approximately 0.5  cm 3. The mice were randomly divided into the following groups (n[*]=[*] 15): normal control animals (neither photosensitizer nor light treatment), and nanoscale photosensitizer and conventional photosensitizer treatment groups. Each animal in the treatment groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 10  mg photosensitizer per kilogram. Four hours later, animals were irradiated with a 63 -nm laser (500  mW, 10  min). The subcutaneous xenograft tumors were ellipsoid in shape; thus, tumor volumes were calculated using the equation for ellipsoid volume: V[*]=[*]a[*]×[*]b[*]×[*]c[*]×[*]π[*]×[*] 4 / 3 (a: long diameter of the tumor; b: short diameter of the tumor; c: tumor height). After treatment, tumor sizes were measured every other day with <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> Tumor dimensions were determined by averaging three repeated measurements. Lag phases in tumor growth before and after treatment and final mouse survival times were recorded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{method is}} {{so named because}} the idea is {{analogous}} to rotating a spring-loaded <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> around the outside of a convex polygon. Every time one blade of the caliper lies flat against an edge of the polygon, it forms an antipodal pair with the point or edge touching the opposite blade. The complete [...] "rotation" [...] of the caliper around the polygon detects all antipodal pairs; the set of all pairs, viewed as a graph, forms a thrackle. The method of rotating calipers {{can be interpreted as}} the projective dual of a sweep line algorithm in which the sweep is across slopes of lines rather than across - or -coordinates of points.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} {{error is}} not like random error, that can't be removed. Sometimes the removal of instrument errors are very easy, but it is case dependent. In Engineering instruments, like voltmeter or ammeter for example, the instrument error {{is very difficult to}} remove. Ammeter has built in resistance, which can't be removed either way. So the only way is to minimize it. On the other hand, the removal of error of a thermometer is a bit simple. Only the calibration has to be removed and then again calibrate it carefully.Sometimes, the user doesn't care for removal of error from the instrument, else he compensates it in calculation, for example, the zero error in <b>Vernier</b> <b>Caliper</b> is eliminated by proper calculation.|$|E
5000|$|Type I bullets have {{a central}} post and two zinc disks with six slits. Type I {{cartridges}} {{can be found in}} both tan and blue cartridge paper. Type II and III's have a zinc base [...] "plunger" [...] (similar to a flat washer), and one disk without slits. Type II cleaner cartridges can be found in both white and tan cartridge paper. Type III cartridges can be found in red, blue and tan cartridge paper. Type III bullets are also the shorter of the three designed for rifle muskets. The fourth type for the [...] "Coffee Mill" [...] gun which at first looks like the standard Type III is slightly larger in diameter. A <b>vernier</b> <b>caliper</b> would be needed to confirm.|$|E
30|$|Emergence {{percent was}} {{calculated}} by dividing the number of seedlings that emerged {{by the total number}} of seeds planted. For destructive measures, three transplants were harvested at random from each experimental unit plug tray, with the exception of tray edges. Transplant height was measured from the root collar to apical meristem. Leaves were collected, cleaned with tissue paper, and then measured using an LI-COR LI- 3000 leaf area meter (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Transplants were uprooted when the media were moist. Roots were washed and dried with tissue paper before weighing to determine the fresh weight of transplants. Stem diameter was measured below the cotyledon node with <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the laboratory, {{samples of}} L. fortunei were rinsed with running {{water in a}} sieve (containing a 60 -μm wire gauze). Individuals of greater than 1  mm, which {{included}} juveniles and both prereproductive and reproductive adults, were separated with forceps or by hand from sediment particles and then counted, and the shell length was measured (the maximum anterior-posterior axis) with digital <b>Vernier</b> <b>calipers.</b> Sediment particles retained in the sieve were observed, and recruits (of less than 1  mm), i.e., early juveniles, were counted under a binocular magnifying glass. These recruits were ready to attach to a hard substrate {{as evidenced by the}} well-developed foot and the presence of a shell (Cataldo and Boltovskoy 2000).|$|R
30|$|In Table  8, it is {{seen that}} the {{pairwise}} comparison between C 2 and C 3 is 0.000375 which is less than HSD is Eq. (3), whereas the pairwise comparison between C 1 and C 2 is 0.004312 and that between C 1 and C 3 is 0.004687, which are {{greater than that of}} the HSD in Eq. (4), with the difference 0.004687 being the largest. So, it is deduced that the differences are statistically significant. Hence, it is concluded that among all the different causes enumerated in the cause and effect diagram, the most influencing causes are the worn out cutting tool insert, insert setting v-block wear out and non-calibration of the <b>vernier</b> <b>calipers</b> and tool setting mandrel.|$|R
