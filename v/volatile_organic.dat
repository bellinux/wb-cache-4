Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates {{the expression of}} genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid aldehydes and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{modifications}} to the ISS waste water composition, the concentration of <b>volatile</b> <b>organics</b> has significantly increased in the feed to the Water Processor Assembly (WPA).

40|$|The DOE is {{evaluating}} {{what should}} be done with this buried waste. Although the radioactive waste is not particularly mobile unless airborne, some of it was buried with <b>volatile</b> <b>organics</b> and/or other substances that tend to spread easily to surrounding soil or water tables. <b>Volatile</b> <b>organics</b> are hazardous materials (such as trichloroethylene) and require clean-up at certain levels in drinking water. There is concern that the buried <b>volatile</b> <b>organics</b> will spread into the water table and contaminate drinking water. Because of this, the DOE is considering options for handling this buried waste and reducing the risks of spreading or exposure. There are two primary options: containment and stabilization, or retrieval. Containment and stabilization systems would include systems that would leave the waste where it is, but contain and stabilize it so that the radioactive and hazardous materials would not spread to the surrounding soil, water, or air. For example, an in situ vitrification system could be used to melt the waste into a composite glass-like material that would not leach into the surrounding soil, water, or air. Retrieval systems are those that would remove the waste from its burial location for treatment and/or repackaging for long term storage. The objective of this project was to develop and demonstrate remote technologies that would minimize dust generation and the spread of airborne contaminants during buried waste retrieval. Remote technologies are essential for the retrieval of buried waste because they remove workers from the hazardous environment and provide greater automation, reducing the chances of human error. Minimizing dust generation is also essential to increased safety for the workers and the environment during buried waste retrieval. The main contaminants within the waste are micron-sized particles of plutonium and americium oxides, chlorides, and hydroxides, which are easily suspended in air and spread if disturbed...|$|R

40|$|Earth accretes 30 million kg/yr of {{extraterrestrial}} material, {{mostly in}} the form of large micrometeorites (diameter ~ 200 µm). Entry velocities of these particles range from 11. 2 km/s to 70 km/s. Micrometeorites are small enough to ensure that they are completely melted and partially evaporated during atmospheric entry. Such strong heating has typically been inferred to cause complete destruction of the organic content of the particles in this size range. Earlier work by Kress et al. (2002) showed that <b>volatile</b> <b>organics,</b> including CH 4 and small-functionalized polycyclic aromatics, are evolved from flash-heated micrometeorite-analogs. Contribution of ablated organics to atmospheric chemistry depends in part on the rate of compound degradation due to solar Lyman-alpha (lambda = 121. 5 nm). The rate of degradation {{is a function of the}} total amount of planetary atmosphere an organic compound is released under. Results show <b>volatile</b> <b>organics</b> are released between 86 - 122 km for particles entering at an 80 deg angle of entry and initial velocity of 12 km/s.
