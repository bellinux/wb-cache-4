40|$|The {{study on}} the in vitro {{micropropagation}} of Robinia pseudoacacia L. shows {{the possibility of the}} rapid increase of the <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> using organogenesis. The culture system consists of sequential use of three media, namely, the initiation medium (MS medium supplemented with 0. 6 mg · l- 1 6 -BA (6 -benzylamino-purine), 0. 1 mg · l- 1 NAA (naphthalene acetic acid), proliferation medium (1 / 2 MS medium added with 1 mg · l- 1 6 -BA,) and root-induction medium (1 / 2 MS medium fortified with 0. 2 mg · l- 1 NAA). The resulting micropropagated plants, fully acclimatised to an in vivo environment, did not show any visually detectable morphological variation. In addition, we investigated the genetic stability (<b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> to the donor plant) of a sample of 30 plants randomly taken from ca. 1067 micropropagated plants, by using three microsatellites loci Rops 15, Rops 16, Rops 18. Our results suggest that DNA sequence variations may occur in micropropagated plants. Przemysław Szmi...|$|E

[...] 8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tablesBoth {{observations}} and models suggest that large-scale coastal blooms of Alexandrium fundyense in the Gulf of Maine are seeded by deep-bottom cyst accumulation zones (“seed beds”) where cysts germinate from the sediment surface or the overlying near-bottom nepheloid layers at water depths exceeding 100 m. The germling cells and their <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> {{are assumed to}} be subject to mortality while in complete darkness, as they swim to illuminated surface waters. To test the validity of this assumption we conducted laboratory investigations of cyst viability and the survival of the germling cells and their <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> during prolonged exposure to darkness at a temperature of 6 °C, simulating the conditions in deep Gulf of Maine waters. We isolated cysts from bottom sediments collected in the Gulf of Maine under low red light and incubated them in 96 -well tissue culture-plates in culture medium under a 10 : 14 h light:dark cycle and under complete darkness. Cyst viability was high, with excystment frequency reaching 90 % in the illuminated treatment after 30 days and in the dark treatment after 50 days. Average germination rates were 0. 062 and 0. 038 d− 1 for light and dark treatments, respectively. The dark treatment showed an approximately 2 -week time lag in maximum germination rates compared to the light treatment. Survival of germlings was considerably lower in the dark treatment. In the light treatments, 47 % of germinated cysts produced germlings that were able to survive for 7 days and produce <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny,</b> i. e., there were live cells in the well along with an empty cyst at least once during the experiment. In the dark treatments 12 % of the cysts produced germlings that were able to survive for the same length of time. When dark treatments are scaled to take into account non-darkness related mortality, approximately 28 % of the cysts produced germlings that were able to survive for at least 7 days. Even though cysts are able to germinate in darkness, the lack of illumination considerably reduces survival rate of germling cells. In addition to viability of cysts in surface sediments and the near-bottom nepheloid layer, survivability of germling cells and their <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> at aphotic depths is an important consideration in assessing the quantitative role of deep-coastal cyst seed beds in bloom formationE.

40|$|A hammerhead {{ribozyme}} [R(-) ] {{targeting the}} minus strand RNA of {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTVd) and a mutated nonfunctional ribozyme [mR(-) ] were designed, cloned, and transcribed. As predicted, both monomer and dimer transcripts {{of the active}} R(-) ribozyme gene could cleave the PSTVd minus strand dimer RNA into three fragments of 77, 338, and 359 bases in vitro at 25 and 50 °C. The tandem dimer genes of R(-) and mR(-) were subcloned separately into the plant expression vector pROK 2. Transgenic potato plants (cultivar Desirée) were generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Twenty-three of 34 independent transgenic plant lines expressing the active ribozyme R(-) resulted in having high levels of resistance to PSTVd, being free of PSTVd accumulation after challenge inoculation with PSTVd, but the remaining lines showed weaker levels of resistance to PSTVd with low levels of PSTVd accumulation. In contrast, 59 of 60 independent transgenic lines expressing the mutated ribozyme mR(-) were susceptible to PSTVd inoculation and had levels of PSTVd accumulation {{similar to that of the}} control plants transformed with the empty vector. The resistance against PSTVd replication was stably inherited to the <b>vegetative</b> <b>progenies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fast height growth {{selection}} usually {{considered as}} the basic type of Scotch pine breeding strategy. Due to this fact height growth of pine clones usually is taken as the first key feature. In the view of good seed production {{there is only one}} indicator that could be adopted as having summarized effect reflecting the real contribution of a clone to the whole seed orchard yield. This is an average number of full seeds per tree (ramet). This trait is the second most important one after the height growth ability feature. The way of two-trait breeding program with the aforesaid features seemed to be the most suitable for Scotch pine. Main theses of 4 -stages complex assessment procedure have been formulated concerning Scotch pine <b>vegetative</b> <b>progenies</b> grown at seed orchards. It was stated that this system of breeding and genetic assessment is based on correlations found for habitus and reproductive features of Scotch pine clones along with the height growth ability of their seed progenies. In the first stage pine clones meeting the criteria (≥ X + 0. 5 σx) regarding height growth are to be selected. In the second stage, clones with hard tapering stem and crown formed by long and thick branches have to be discarded. At this stage, such feature as «mean diameter of three thickest limbs at the height of 1. 5 – 2. 0 m» became the key factor. Its mean value for selected clones must not be by 1 – 2...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the number of "aberrant plants" showing various {{developmental}} abnormalities in cultivated cauliflowers has dramatically increased, thus hampering the registration of new varieties in some cases. The aberrant phenotype occurred during the cultivation period and in any variety type (pure line or F 1 hybrid). The number of aberrant plants increased considerably from 1994 onwards. The rate of aberrant plants observed among F 1 hybrids in the field was found to vary according to genotype and cultivation area. Besides morphological changes, aberrant phenotypes showed various patterns of evolution, i. e. stable, evolving toward another phenotype or reversing toward normality. <b>Vegetative</b> and seed <b>progenies</b> were obtained in order to investigate the genetic control of these phenotypic variations. Given that the aberrant phenotypes can evolve towards either normality or another abnormality during {{the life cycle of}} the plant and that the aberration capacity and/or the "acquired morphological disorder" can be transmitted to the progeny, an epigenetic hypothesis has been proposed for the determinism of this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Allelic {{assortment}} of Tetrahymena pyriformis makes possible {{the isolation of}} cells which contain both a heterozygous germ line nucleus and a somatic nucleus which expresses phenotypes of only one member of allelic pairs. Cycloheximide-sensitive segregants have been isolated from the <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> of cells heterozygous for a dominant mutation conferring resistance to cycloheximide; such segregants are called functional heterokaryons. Since progeny from crosses of these cells are cycloheximide-resistant, addition of the drug provides positive selection for successful exconjugants. The timing for expression of the new phenotype during conjugation is presented and used to identify {{what appear to be}} immature progeny of round one mating in genomic exclusion. Usefulness of functional heterokaryons in a number of genetic and developmental studies is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcript}} of the PR 1 gene accumulation as an informative marker of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) was analyzed in β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) primed potato in the short-lasting (3 days) and long-lasting (28 days) time periods after induction and in the vegetative descendants of primed plants derived from tubers and from in vitro seedlings. BABA pretreatment resulted either in minimal or no PR 1 gene expression, but sequential treatment with BABA followed by virulent P. infestans provided data on the imprint of post-stress information and its duration until fertilization, {{in the form of}} an enhanced PR 1 transcript accumulation and a transient increase of basal resistance to the late blight disease. The primed state for defense of the susceptible potato cultivar was transmitted to its <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> as a potentiated PR 1 mRNA accumulation following challenge inoculation. However,variation was observed between vegetative accessions of the BABA-primed potato genotype in responsiveness to disease. In contrast to plants derived from tubers, potato propagated through in vitro seedlings largely lost inducible resistance traits, although itretained primed PR 1 gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Two morphogenic pathways, {{indirect}} {{somatic embryogenesis}} and direct somatic embryogenesis, were compared and optimized for the accelerated production of transgenic sugarcane plants. Transgenic plants {{were ready for}} transfer to soil within three months for direct somatic embryogenesis and {{four and a half}} months for indirect somatic embryogenesis from the initiation of cultures. The described protocols allowed reproducible, stable genetic transformation of the commercially important sugarcane cultivar, CP 88 - 1762. Accelerating the production of transgenic sugarcane plants not only saves time and effort, but may also minimize somaclonal variation and improve plant performance. Southern blot analysis revealed simple transgene integration patterns with an average of 3. 64 hybridization products. Neomycin phosphotransferaseII-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that most of the transgenic plants expressed the transgene stably in <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny.</b> Using a minimal, linear expression cassette (MC) without vector backbone sequences for the biolistic gene transfer and reducing the amount of MC to 10 ng per shot may have contributed to simple transgene integration and stable transgene expression. Therefore, the optimized protocols will likely support stable transgene expression and good agronomic performance of transgenic sugarcane plants...|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{effects of}} two tree growth {{regulators}} (TGRs), flurprimidol and paclobutrazol, on eleven species located in Indiana and Louisiana were studied. Five experiments were designed with mature trees, saplings, seedlings, or isolated mitochondria to investigate effects of TGRs on wound healing, cambial growth, <b>vegetative</b> growth of <b>progeny</b> seedlings, and electron transport by leaf mitochondria. Species investigated were: Quercus rubra L., Q. alba L., Q. falcata var. pagodaefolia Elliott, Juglans nigra L., Alnus glutinosa L., Liquidambar styraciflua L., Fraxinus americana L., Pinus strobus L., P. taeda L., Liriodendron tulipifera L., and Platanus occidentalis L. ^ Closure of bark wounds was reduced in paclobutrazol-treated white oak, red oak, sweetgum, black walnut and white ash in Indiana, and sweetgum and cherrybark oak in Louisiana. There {{was no difference}} in bark wound closure between treated and untreated European black alder, yellow poplar, white pine, or American sycamore. Closure of pruning wounds was reduced in white oak, red oak, sweetgum, European black alder, and black walnut in Indiana, and sweetgum and cherrybark oak in Louisiana. The inhibitory effect on closure of both bark and pruning wounds in some species persists at least three or four years. TGRs were transported to developing seeds of silver maple and reduced growth of the progeny when the seeds were collected one month after treatment. The growth of progeny seedlings was enhanced when seeds were collected one year after treatment and was not affected when seeds were collected two years after treatment with TGRs. ^ The effect of paclobutrazol on cambial growth, annual shoot growth, and total tree height growth varied with species and treatment duration. Paclobutrazol reduced cambial growth in white oak, red oak, cherrybark oak, sweetgum, European black alder, and white pine with the effect varying among species, vertical location of the cross-section, and years after treatment. ^ TGRs accumulated in seeds of treated European black alder and silver maple reduced or stimulated electron transport in leaf mitochondria of the progeny seedlings. The inhibition and stimulation effects depending on the number of growing seasons after treatment of the parent trees related to growth responses, indicating another mode of action of TGRs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{time needed}} for potato virus X {{to reach the}} tubers from the inoculated leaf {{depended}} closely on {{the age of the}} potato plant. In young plants the virus could be detected in the tubers after about five days. However in the period of maximum tuber formation, virus translocation occurred only incidentally. The phenomenon of gradually decreased speed of virus translocation was called old-age resistance. It also played a part in infections with aphid-borne viruses such as potato leafroll virus and virus Y. It had practical significance for the production of seed potatoes as it was already noticeable in the period of highest aphid populations. When potato plants were inoculated in an advanced stage of development only part of the <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> got infected. This meant that a plant produced infected and uninfected tubers, and also that a single tuber had infected as well as uninfected parts. The bigger tubers of a primarily infected plant were more often infected than smaller ones. Moreover, the eyes at the top end of the tuber had a greater chance of attracting infection than those occurring close to the heel end. <p/...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{reproduction}} of bacteriophage. The most numerous classes of coliphages, brought together {{on the basis of}} antigenic relatedness and morphologic identity, is the one containing T 2 and T 4. These are among the largest of the viruses. They are tadpole-shaped particles measuring about 0. 1 micron in diameter. The particles are subject to osmotic shock and presumably possess some sort of membrane. The sequence of events occurring during the intracellular existence of phages, such as T 2, is summarized in the chapter. Soon after entering the cell, the resting phage is transformed into vegetative phage. These two forms of virus have no known attribute in common except genetic continuity. Each has one known capacity that is unique; resting phage can infect bacteria, vegetative phage can multiply intracellularly. There is a marked difference between the two forms in sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Multiplication begins some time before the midpoint of the latent period and may be confined to the second quarter. Beginning at the midpoint of the latent period, the <b>vegetative</b> <b>progeny</b> are converted to the resting form at a linear rate. Genetic interaction immediately precedes or is part of this process...|$|E

These grafted trees were planted in 2009 in a clone archive in forest plot 264 j in the Bielsk Forest District. After one year of growth, elm clone survival ranged from 38 % to 100 % (89 % on average). Although all clones were of similar age and were grown under similar conditions, their average height was highly variable and ranged from 99. 0 cm (clone no. 9473 z) to 186. 6 cm (clone no. 9645 z), while average root collar diameter ranged from 8. 4 mm (clone no. 9473 z) to 18. 0 mm (clone no. 9645 z). There were large differences crown architectural among the different clones, and variation in average shape of the crown was high (from 2. 6 in clone no. 9655 to 3. 8 in clone no. 9446 z). Index breeding values determined on the standardized data for height, root collar diameter, crown shape and survival, ranged from - 0. 71 (clone no. 9473 z) to 0. 61 (clone no. 9645 z).
