50|$|A large {{downside}} {{of the volume}} weighting method is its sensitivity to large-scale structures, or parts of the universe with more or less objects than average, such as a star cluster or a void.

This is a particular issue with the faint objects in calculating a luminosity function, as their smaller maximum <b>volume</b> <b>means</b> that a large-scale structure therein will have a large impact.

40|$|Objective—To {{study the}} effects of {{coronary}} artery occlusion on the pressure-volume relations of the right ventricle.  Design—Right ventricular pressure-volume cycles were studied using conductance catheters and micromanometers in 19  subjects undergoing coronary angioplasty in a tertiary referral cardiac centre.  Results—Catheter occlusions of either the left anterior descending coronary artery or the right coronary artery were associated with a decline in stroke work (mean change (SD) : left − 13. 3 (15. 8) %, p =  0. 008; right − 13. 5 (16. 5) %, p =  0. 04). Two patterns of change were evident: an upward shift usually associated with occlusion in the left coronary artery, and a rightward shift in the right coronary artery. In the former there was an increase in maximum ventricular <b>volume</b> (<b>mean</b> change: 3. 0 (2. 7) %, p =  0. 004) and in minimum ventricular <b>volume</b> (<b>mean</b> change: 2. 3 (2. 7) %, p =  0. 01) and a fall in peak pressure (mean change: − 4. 8 (5. 1) %, p =  0. 04). In the latter there was an increase in peak pressure (mean change 9. 9 (16. 3) %, p =  0. 04) and an increase in minimum ventricular <b>volume</b> (<b>mean</b> change 3. 7 (5. 0) %, p =  0. 02) leading to a fall in stroke <b>volume</b> (<b>mean</b> change − 13. 3 (15. 8) %, p =  0. 008).  Conclusions—Occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery or the right coronary artery is associated with a decline in right ventricular work. However, different patterns of change in indices of preload and afterload lead to different effects on overall right ventricular pump function.    Keywords: right ventricle;  pressure-volume relations;  coronary angioplasty;  conductance cathete...|$|R

Individual galaxies, including the Milky Way, have peculiar velocities relative to the average flow.

30|$|Besides {{adsorption}} and desorption process, wellbore storage coefficient, SRV, and bottom-hole pressure {{have significant}} {{effects on the}} well pressure and production performance of multistage fractured horizontal well in shale gas reservoirs. The wellbore storage coefficient mainly affects the early production stage. The SRV has significant effects on the late flow stage in the transient pressure and production rate curves. Larger SRV leads to lower transient pressure at constant production and longer tef at constant flowing pressure for the same reason. That means the development of shale gas reservoirs depends on the stimulated reservoir volume. Large Langmuir <b>volume</b> <b>means</b> the adsorption and desorption abilities are strong, which is important to maintain stable gas production rate in late flow stage. The bottom-hole pressure is also a significant parameter for developing the shale gas reservoirs. In view of the simplification of this model, some further work is required to make the model approximate to the practice.|$|E

30|$|As {{previously}} reported, {{we found}} that protein concentration, pH and temperature {{play a key role}} in achieving maximum SA and LE (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1) when labelling with technetium tricarbonyl. Achieving the optimal conditions however is currently hampered with the commercial IsoLink kit. To overcome this, we prepared modified kits that can produce a [99 mTc(CO) 3]+ solution with radiochemical purity equal to that of the unmodified kits but with higher radioactivity concentration. The lower <b>volume</b> <b>means</b> that the radiolabelled product can conveniently be used for preclinical in vivo studies, making more economical use of both protein and radioactivity. The higher protein and radionuclide concentration leads to a faster labelling reaction, in turn to achieving higher SA and LE in the same incubation time, or a shorter incubation time to reach the same SA and LE. Importantly, it reduces the incubation time, temperature and amount of protein needed to reach 95 % LE (the threshold at which radiochemical purity is typically regarded as adequate for in vivo use) and hence makes it easier to avoid the need for post-labelling purification steps which can waste time and cause losses due to irreversible binding to columns and filters.|$|E
40|$|Dissolved oxygen is an {{influential}} factor of aquatic ecosystem health. Future predictions of oxygen deficits are paramount for maintaining water quality. Oxygen demands depend greatly on a waterbody’s attributes. A large sediment–water interface relative to <b>volume</b> <b>means</b> sediment oxygen demand has greater influence in shallow systems. In shallow, ice-covered waterbodies {{the potential for}} winter anoxia is high. Water quality models offer two options for modelling sediment oxygen demand: a zero-order constant rate, or a sediment diagenesis model. The constant rate is unrepresentative of a real system, yet a diagenesis model is difficult to parameterise and calibrate without data. We use the water quality model CE-QUAL-W 2 to increase the complexity of a zero-order sediment compartment with limited data. We model summer and winter conditions individually to capture decay rates under-ice. Using a semi-automated calibration method, we find an annual pattern in sediment oxygen demand that follows the trend of chlorophyll-a concentrations in a shallow, eutrophic Prairie reservoir. We use chlorophyll-a {{as a proxy for}} estimation of summer oxygen demand and winter decay.

40|$|Before-and-after study {{methodology}} {{was developed}} and applied to evaluating the effect on bicyclists' safety of raising urban bicycle crossings by 4 to 12 cm. In total, 44 junctions were reconstructed in this way in Gothenburg, Sweden. Four of these were studied in detail. Before the implementations, bicyclists were riding either in the roadway or on separate paths parallel to the roadway. The paths then ended with short ramps or curb cuts at each cross street, and bicyclists used nonelevated, marked bicycle crossings, similar to pedestrian crosswalks but delineated by white painted rectangles rather than zebra stripes. The {{results show that the}} paths with raised crossings attracted more than 50 percent more bicyclists and that the safety per bicyclist was improved by approximately 20 percent due to the increase in bicycle flow, and with an additional 10 to 50 percent due to the improved layout. However, the increased bicyclist <b>volume</b> <b>means</b> that the total number of bicycle accidents is expected to increase. Besides accident analysis, the change in risk was estimated using four different methods: surveys of bicyclists and experts, respectively; conflict data; and a quantitative expert model. Using a Bayesian approach for combining the results shows that the most likely effect of raising the bicycle crossing is a risk reduction of around 30 percent, compared with the before situation with a conventional bicycle crossing. Motorists and pedestrians also saw safety benefits from this traffic-calming measure. Upprättat; 1998; 20080704 (andbra...|$|E
