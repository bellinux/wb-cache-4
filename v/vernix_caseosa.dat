The function of vernix has long been debated but no consensus has been reached. We here report a proteome analysis of vernix using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. We have identified 41 proteins, of which 25 are novel to vernix. Notably, 39 % of the identified vernix proteins are components of innate immunity, and 29 % have direct antimicrobial properties. These results form a substantial contribution to the knowledge of vernix composition and demonstrate that antimicrobial protection of the fetus and the newborn child is a major and important function of vernix...|$|R

Case Presentation We discuss three Caucasian patients (aged 32 to 43 years) who presented in our health sector in Sydney with <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> peritonitis. Each had a protracted course with significant comorbidities requiring surgical and medical intervention. This contrasts with other reports suggesting that a rapid resolution can be expected. This cluster may be a consequence of the rising caesarean section rate, a heightened local awareness of the condition and possibly a result of leaving material in the paracolic gutters intraoperatively. Conclusion Our aim is to increase awareness among our obstetric and surgical colleagues of the characteristic clinical presentation and intra-operative findings of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> peritonitis. We also point out that, in contrast to those presented here, not all patients require laparotomy. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> {{protects the}} skin of a human fetus during the last {{trimester}} of pregnancy and of a newborn after the delivery. Besides its cellular and proteinaceous components, an important constituent and functional agent is a complex lipid fraction, implicated in a multitude of salubrious effects of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa.</b> Little is known about how the chemical composition of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> lipids is affected by various biological characteristics of the baby, such as the gestational age, birth weight, and, last but not least, the gender of the newborn. This study reports on the chemical variability of lipids contained in the <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> of twenty newborn girls and boys and shows that the quantitative patterns of the lipids are sex-specific. The specificity of lipids was investigated at the level of fatty acids in the total lipid extracts and intact lipids of several neutral lipid classes. Hydrocarbons, wax esters, cholesteryl esters, diol diesters and triacylglycerols were isolated using optimized semipreparative thin-layer chromatography, and the molecular species within each class were characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Statistical evaluation revealed significant quantitative sex-related differences in the lipid composition of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> among the newborns, pronounced in the two lipid classes associated with the activity of sebaceous glands. Higher proportions of wax esters and triacylglycerols with longer hydrocarbon chains were observed in newborn girls...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> is {{a natural}} biofilm which covers {{the skin of a}} human fetus from the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy. It has hydrating, regenerating and anti-microbial effects. The components responsible for these properties of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> could be used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. For this reason, the total composition is analyzed. The lipid components of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> consist of squalene, wax esters, sterol esters, 1, 2 -diol diesters, triacylglycerides, free fatty acids, fatty alcohols, cholesterol, diacylglycerides, monoacylglyceridesů and phospholipids. This study is focused on structure analysis of the 1, 2 -diol diesters of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa.</b> Conditions were optimized for the HPLC separation. Nova -Pak C 18 column was used and a gradient of acetonitrile:ethyl acetate was chosen as a mobile phase. Before entering the APCI source ammonium formate was added; ammonium adducts [M + 18]+ were formed. Eight scan events was set in MS method. One for the full scan spectrum, second for MS 2 spectrum of the precursor ions and six MS 3 data-dependent spectra. The position of the double bonds of unsaturated 1, 2 -diol diesters was determined by fragmentation of their [M+C 3 H 5 N]+ adducts.

This work summarizes the application of modern analytical methods and instrumentation for identifying and characterizing lipids in <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa.</b> It is shown how I contributed during the Ph. D. studies to the elucidation of the structure and characterization of unknown lipid classes followed by more detailed description of those lipid classes already identified in <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa.</b> An integral part of my work was the application of the method enabling the localization of double bonds developed by our laboratory in triacylglycerols and 1, 2 -diol diesters in <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa.</b> This analytical method is based on the formation of an acetonitrile adduct in an ionization source of a mass spectrometer enabling atmospheric pressure ionization. The complexity of the triacylglycerol class did not allow a complete characterization of the double bonds.

40|$|Fetal magnetocardiography is a {{non-invasive}} technique {{for studying the}} electrical activity of the fetal heart. Fetal magnetocardiograms (fMCG) {{can be used to}} diagnose and classify fetal cardiac arrhythmias reliably. An averaged fMCG shows a QRS-complex, a P-wave, and a T-wave. However, it is still unknown if the currents in the tissues surrounding the fetal heart disturb these features. Furthermore, the measuring technique is not yet optimised for fMCG registrations. Simulation studies may provide guidelines for the design of an appropriate magnetometer system. Therefore, finite-element and boundary-element models were constructed in order to study the possible influence of the volume conductor. Especially, the influence of the layer of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa,</b> a fatty layer that covers the fetus, was investigated. The computations showed that the layer of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> will affect the waveform of the fMCG. The signal processing procedure used is also discussed. It turned out to be difficult to deduce the onset and offset of the T-wave from the resulting averaged signals. Possibly, the QRS-complex does not provide a correct trigger to obtain a distinguishable T-wave in the averaged signal, because the RT-interval may be variable...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHyperbilirubinemia {{continues}} {{to pose a}} significant and common problem in the newborn period. Exposure of the brain {{to high levels of}} unconjugated bilirubin leads to acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, especially in preterm infants. Given the shared embryological origin of the skin (epidermis) and brain, we hypothesized that cutaneous binding of unconjugated bilirubin to skin (i. e., jaundice) might protect the immature brain. Support for this hypothesis requires direct quantification of binding of unconjugated bilirubin to cutaneous structures. Bilirubin binding was tested using a series of in vitro experiments wherein newborn skin and <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> were exposed to physiologically-relevant solutions of bilirubin. Tissue binding was assessed spectrophotometrically and via bilirubin autofluorescence. Study findings indicate the following: (1) unconjugated bilirubin binds quickly and avidly to thin films of vernix caseosa; (2) bilirubin binds to human epidermis in vitro via a mechanism involving dermal diffusion; (3) unconjugated bilirubin localizes to the dermis and epidermis as shown by autofluorescence; and (4) topical application of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> to the epidermis augments bilirubin binding; i. e., increases jaundice. These findings are consistent with a physiological neuroprotective role for the skin in shielding the immature brain from high levels of unconjugated bilirubin. New therapies based on these results are envisioned with the goal of increasing cutaneous bilirubin binding (jaundice) thereby protecting the developing brain and facilitating bilirubin excretion with phototherapy...|$|E
40|$|Wax ester/sterol ester (WE/SE) ratios were {{measured}} in samples of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> lipid obtained from 21 full-term infants. The mean WE/SE ratio was {{twice as high}} in males as in females, suggesting higher average fetal sebum production rates in males, but individual values varied widely and there was considerable overlap between the sexes. Wax esters (a class of lipid produced only by the sebaceous glands) were isolated from 6 of the 21 samples of <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> lipid and analyzed for fatty acid composition. The percentages of iso and anteiso branched saturated fatty acids and of Δ 9 -type monounsaturated fatty acids {{were found to be}} correlated negatively with the WE/SE ratios of the original lipid samples. Values for the percentages of the major Δ 9 -type monounsaturates, plotted as a function of WE/SE ratios, fell near a curve of the shape which would be expected if a limited quantity of Δ 9 -type monounsaturates were available for sebum synthesis, and were diluted with varying amounts of Δ 6 -type monounsaturates, the amount of the Δ 6 -type monounsaturates being proportional to the amount of wax esters synthesized by the sebaceous glands. The results suggested that the rate of sebum production may be the sole determinant of the percentage of Δ 9 -type monounsaturates in sebaceous wax esters and a partial determinant of the percentage of iso and anteiso branched saturates...|$|E

RESULTS Physiological skin changes seen were the commonest neonatal dermatoses, followed by transient non-infective cutaneous changes. Mongolian spot and Epstein pearl were the commonest among the physiological skin changes followed by sebaceous gland hyperplasia, physiological scaling, <b>vernix</b> <b>caseosa,</b> and sucking pads. The commonest transient non-infective cutaneous changes were erythema toxicum neonatorum, milia, transient pustular melanosis, neonatal cephalic pustulosis, eosinophilic pustulosis and infantile acropustulosis.

40|$|<b>Vernix</b> <b>caseosa</b> is a white, creamy, {{naturally}} occurring biofilm covering {{the skin of}} the fetus during the last trimester of pregnancy. Vernix coating on the neonatal skin protects the newborn skin and facilitates extra-uterine adaptation of skin in the first postnatal week if not washed away after birth. It consists of water-containing corneocytes embedded in a lipid matrix. The strategic location of the vernix on the fetal skin surface suggests participation in multiple overlapping functions required at birth, such as barrier to water loss, temperature regulation, and innate immunity. Vernix seems to perform various integral roles during transition of the fetus from intra-uterine to extra-uterine life. It has also found various interesting diagnostic and prognostic implications in this arena. Thus, it continues to be an intriguing topic of interest among the medical fraternity to understand its detailed biology and function in the fetus and also to put its naturally endowed characteristics to use in the adult population...|$|E
