40|$|Despite {{evidence}} of a positive link between depressive symptoms and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> the pathways underlying this longitudinal association remain unknown. Depressive symptoms might drive and reinforce victimization which in turn could provoke individuals to become violent towards others. Thus, we tested whether victimization mediated the link between depressive symptoms and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> using a 6 -year longitudinal study of a community sample of adolescents. The sample included 682 Dutch adolescents (54 % boys) from an ongoing longitudinal study RADAR (Research on Adolescent Development and Relationships). From ages 13 to 18 years, depressive symptoms, victimization experiences, and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> were annually assessed. We conducted longitudinal mediation analyses to test pathways to violence in adolescents with depressive symptoms. Longitudinal analyses revealed that victimization mediated the association between depressive symptoms and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> from early to late adolescence. As part of this, we found that adolescents’ depressive symptoms predicted victimization, and this victimization predicted risk of subsequent <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> In conclusion, links between depressive symptoms and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> are potentially important to understand adolescent development. Reduction of victimization {{is likely to be}} an important target for the prevention of <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in adolescents with depressive symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to: (1) examine whether {{experiencing}} ethnic harassment {{was related to}} <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> among immigrant youths (2) identify the conditions that elevate ethnically harassed youth’s engagement in <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Specifically, current study examined the moderating roles of youth’s ethnic identification, anger regulation, and impulsivity on the association between ethnic harassment and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Participants included 341 first- and second-generation immigrant youth (Mage= 14. 11, SD =. 93; 48 % girls) who were recruited from seven different schools in a mid-size Swedish city. Regression analyses was conducted to test whether ethnic harassment predicted <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{over the course of}} one year after and whether youth’s ethnic identification, anger regulation and impulsive personality trait moderated the association between ethnic harassment and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results showed that when immigrant youth were exposed to ethnic harassment, {{they were more likely to}} display <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> one year later. In addition, the results suggested that immigrant youth who identified themselves with their heritage culture, i. e., high ethnic identification, were more at risk displaying <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in the case of ethnic harassment. Moreover, the results indicated that anger regulation and impulsive personality trait did not moderate the relationship between ethnic harassment and violence...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has substantiated the relationship between alcohol use and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> but little consideration {{has been given to}} implicit interactions between the two. This study examines the implicit attitudes associated with alcoholic drinks and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and their relationship to explicit reports of problematic behaviors associated with alcohol use. Methods: The Go/No-Go Association Task (GNAT; Nosek & Banaji, 2001) was used to test the effect of distracters (noise) on implicit cognitions associated with alcoholic drinks and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Data was collected from 148 students enrolled in a Midwestern university. Results: Irrespective of contextual distractions, participants consistently exhibited negative implicit cognitions associated with <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> However, context impacted the valence of cognitions associated with alcoholic beverages. Implicit cognitions associated with alcoholic beverages were negative when nonalcoholic beverages were used as distracters, but were positive when licit and illicit drugs were used as distracters. Implicit cognitions associated with alcoholic drinks were correlated with implicit cognitions associated with <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> and explicit measures of problem drinking, problem drug-related behaviors, and measures of craving, to name a few. Conclusion: Evaluative context can {{have an effect on the}} expressed appraisal of implicit attitudes. Implications, limitations, and future directions for using the GNAT in addictions research are discussed...|$|R

Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E

40|$|Background: Violence is {{a global}} issue that has {{received}} considerable attention during recent years. Available research has suggested various factors, mostly family and social factors, to possibly affect violence. As previous studies have not {{examined the relationship between}} these factors and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in adolescents, this study aimed to assess the relationship between environmental factors and violence in adolescents. Methods: This descriptive, correlational research used cluster sampling to select 5500 adolescent students from Isfahan Province (Iran). Data were collected through a 21 -item researcher-made questionnaire. The questionnaire was modified according to the relevant experts′ opinions and had Cronbach′s alpha of 0. 82. The collected data were analyzed by applying multiple regression analysis in SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results: Most participants (89. 1 %) lived in urban areas and about half (49. 8 %) of them were female. Linear regression test showed <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> to have significant, inverse relationships with love and affection in the family (b = − 0. 097; P < 0. 001) and watching drama and comedy movies (b = − 0. 128; P < 0. 001 and b = − 0. 032; P = 0. 030, respectively). There were significant, direct relationships between <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in adolescents and aggressive behaviors in the family (b = 0. 099; P < 0. 001) and watching crime, police, and action movies (b = 0. 129; P < 0. 001, detective movies b = 0. 043; P < 0. 001, and b = 0. 061; P < 0. 001, respectively). However, the incidence of <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> was not significantly related with the effects of peers and presence of sports facilities. Conclusions: Our findings confirmed love and affection and healthy pastime (e. g. watching comedy and drama movies) in the family to reduce <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in adolescents. In contrast, aggressive behaviors in the family, watching crime, police, and action movies were found to increase <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in adolescents...|$|R
5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying <b>violent</b> <b>behavior</b> during court appearances.

In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging <b>violent</b> <b>behavior,</b> shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|Moreno González {{was born}} in the ranchería of Guanajuatillo in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico at around 5:00a.m. on 8 March 1970. There are few details of Moreno González's upbringing, but {{religion}} may have {{played an important role in}} his early life. His parents had 13 children (including Moreno González). His father Manuel Moreno was reportedly an alcoholic and had several mistresses, and one day he left his family when Moreno González was still very young, forcing his mother to singlehandedly raise the whole family. With their father gone, Moreno González and his siblings lived under the strict discipline of their mother. According to his autobiography, Moreno González had a love-hate relationship with his mother; as a child, he was beaten by his mother for being troublesome and getting into fights. In one occasion, he recalled that his mother once forced him to make his way back to his house by walking on his knees while keeping his arms stretched like a cross throughout the whole day for stealing an animal. Such treatments helped him develop resentment as to partially explain his <b>violent</b> <b>behavior</b> as an adult, he argued. He admitted, however, that he often got into fist fights with other kids from Guanajuatillo and the surrounding rancherías. Moreno González recalled that he would not always win and that he once got into 10 fights in a single day. His violent reputation as a child helped him earn the nickname El Más Loco ("The Craziest One")—which he held onto for the rest of his life—among his siblings and other kids from the area where he grew up.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{prevalence}} of <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> among homeless and runaway adolescents or the specific behavioral factors that influence <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> across time. In this longitudinal study of 300 homeless and runaway adolescents aged 16 – 19 years at baseline, we use event history analysis to assess the factors associated with acts of violence over three years, controlling for individual propensities and time-varying behaviors. The results indicate that females, non-minorities, and non-heterosexuals were less likely to engage in violence across time. Those who met criteria for substance abuse disorders (i. e. alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse) were {{more likely to engage in}} violence. A history of caretaker abuse was associated with <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> as were street survival strategies such as selling drugs, participating in gang activity, and associating with deviant peers. Simply having spent time directly on the streets at any specific time point also increased the likelihood for violence.

50|$|Other {{researchers}} have found associations between childhood abusive behaviors {{and the appearance of}} <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> in psychotic individuals. This could be a result of their inability to cope with aggression as well as other people, especially when constantly attending to potential threats in their environment.

Other studies have shown that there may only be certain types of delusions that promote any <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> persecutory delusions seem to be one of these.|$|R
40|$|Background: Healthy {{dietary habits}} {{are known as}} a key factor for {{improving}} brain functions and cognitive ability in children and adolescents. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association of healthy food consumption with mental health in Iranian children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the fourth national school-based surveillance survey entitled CASPIAN-IV study. In this study, 14880 children and adolescents aged 6 - 18 years were selected by multistage, cluster sampling method from rural and urban areas. The students and their parents completed two sets of questionnaires. The psychiatric distress included depression, worry, insomnia, anxiety, aggression, confusion, and worthless and the <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> comprised of physical fight, victim and bully. The healthy foods included fresh fruits, dried fruits, vegetables and dairy products. Results: The participants include 13, 486 students from elementary, intermediate and high school degree. The prevalence of psychiatric distress was significantly higher among high school students, while <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors</b> were more prevalent in the middle school students. According to the multivariate model (model IV), the risk of psychiatric distress was significantly lower in students with daily consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables and milk. In addition, those with daily consumption of vegetables and milk had significantly lower risk for <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Conclusion: Consumption of healthy foods may reduce the risk of psychiatric distress and <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Therefore, in addition to its benefits, increasing healthy food consumption among children and adolescents can be useful in preventing mental health disorders...|$|R

Data drawn from a diverse Emergency Department based sample of 1, 050 urban adolescents, combined with tract level data from the state liquor control commission and U. S. Census, were analyzed. Results of multivariate multi‐level regression analysis indicate that alcohol outlet density is significantly related to adolescents' <b>violent</b> <b>behaviors,</b> controlling for demographic characteristics and individual alcohol use.
