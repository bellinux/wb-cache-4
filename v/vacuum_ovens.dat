50|$|Control of {{the wetting}} contact angle {{can often be}} {{achieved}} through the deposition or incorporation of various organic and inorganic molecules onto the surface. This is often achieved {{through the use of}} specialty silane chemicals which can form a SAM (self-assembled monolayers) layer. With the proper selection of the organic molecules with varying molecular structures and amounts of hydrocarbon and/or perfluoronated terminations, the contact angle of the surface can tune. The deposition of these specialty silanes can be achieved in the gas phase {{through the use of a}} specialized <b>vacuum</b> <b>ovens</b> or liquid-phase process. Molecules that can bind more perfluorinated terminations to the surface can results in lowering the surface energy (high water contact angle).|$|E

40|$|This report {{includes}} major {{findings and}} outlook from the transformational electrode drying project performance period from January 6, 2012 to August 1, 2012. Electrode drying before cell assembly is an operational bottleneck in battery manufacturing due to long drying times and batch processing. Water taken up during shipment and other manufacturing steps {{needs to be}} removed before final battery assembly. Conventional <b>vacuum</b> <b>ovens</b> are limited in drying speed due to a temperature threshold needed to avoid damaging polymer components in the composite electrode. Roll to roll operation and alternative treatments can increase the water desorption and removal rate without overheating and damaging other components in the composite electrode, thus considerably reducing drying time and energy use. The objective of this project was {{the development of an}} electrode drying procedure, and the demonstration of processes with no decrease in battery performance. The benchmark for all drying data was an 80 °C vacuum furnace treatment with a residence time of 18 – 22 hours. This report demonstrates an alternative roll to roll drying process with a 500 -fold improvement in drying time down to 2 minutes and consumption of only 30 % of the energy compared to vacuum furnace treatment...|$|E

Total flavonoid content (TFC), total phenolic content (TPC), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity were measured using the spectrophotometric method. Individual phenolic acids and flavonoids, 6 - and 8 -gingerol and shogaol were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method. Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays {{were used for the}} evaluation of antioxidant activities. The highest reduction in moisture content was observed after freeze drying (82. 97 %), followed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying (80. 43 %) and shade drying (72. 65 %). The highest TPC, TFC, and 6 - and 8 -shogaol contents were observed in samples dried by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying method compared to other drying methods. The highest content of 6 - and 8 -gingerol was observed after freeze drying, followed by <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying and shade drying methods. Fresh samples had the highest PPO activity and lowest content of flavonoid and phenolic acid compounds compared to dried samples. Rhizomes dried by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying method represent the highest DPPH (52. 9 %) and FRAP activities (566. 5 μM of Fe (II) /g DM), followed by freeze drying (48. 3 % and 527. 1 μM of Fe (II) /g DM, respectively) and shade drying methods (37. 64 % and 471. 8 μM of Fe (II) /g DM, respectively) with IC 50 values of 27. 2, 29. 1, and 34. 8 μg/mL, respectively.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{has found that}} dried potato samples yielded {{significantly}} higher levels of steroidal alkaloids such as α-solanine and α-chaconine than the corresponding fresh samples, as determined by the UPLC-MS/MS technique. Among the drying techniques used, air drying had the highest effect on steroidal alkaloid contents, followed by freeze drying and <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> drying. There {{was no significant difference between}} the freeze dried and <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> dried samples in their α-chaconine contents. However, freeze dried potato shoots and berries had significantly higher α-solanine contents (825 µg/g dry weight (DW) in shoots and 2453 µg/g DW in berries) than the <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> dried ones (325 µg/g dry weight (DW) in shoots and 2080 µg/g DW in berries).

The steroidal alkaloid contents of the shoots decreased significantly at day 9, and then remained unchanged until day 21. In line with the potato shoots, air dried potato tuber peels also had higher steroidal alkaloid content than the freeze dried and <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> dried samples. However, a significant decrease of steroidal alkaloid content was observed in air dried potato berries, possibly due to degradation during slicing of the whole berries prior to air drying.

30|$|Degradation of PLLA fibres {{in vitro}} were {{investigated}} by Yuan et al. (2002) with fibres incubated in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with pH  7.4 and at 37 ͦC for 35 – 45  weeks. The {{average molecular weight}} of fibres, produced by melt spinning, dropped throughout degradation, with 40 – 60 % reduction {{at the end of}} the incubation period and an increase in crystallinity. Fibres studied by the group were not investigated separately, instead, they were bundled together randomly which may have affected their biodegradation. PBS was changed fortnightly which is an acceptable time frame in accordance with ASTM standards. Prior to measurements of degraded samples, a bundle was removed from PBS, washed with water and dried in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> at 48 ͦC. Water absorbed by the fibres is a potential issue that could affect the results of this scheme. However, authors did not mention duration of this process. Additionally, drying in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>oven</b> is a good methodology to remove excess fluid from the fibres; however, a temperature of 48 ͦC could affect the properties of the fibre, with potential to cause damage to the polymer.
