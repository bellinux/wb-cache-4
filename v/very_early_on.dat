5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on.</b> The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E

5|$|After exiting Cuba {{into the}} Gulf of Mexico, the {{hurricane}} weakened greatly. On October20 it passed {{a short distance}} west of Key West, Florida, and <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> October21 the hurricane moved over Marco Island with winds of 90mph (150km/h). The cyclone weakened further as it turned eastward through the state, deteriorating to tropical storm status as it passed near or over Miami. It accelerated east-northeastward, moving over the Abaco Islands in The Bahamas. Gradually weakening, the storm interacted with an approaching cold front; late on October23 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and shortly thereafter it was absorbed by the front.|$|E
5|$|The {{third part}} of {{qualifying}} determined pole position {{and only the}} two Mercedes drivers set two timed laps. After he clocked in behind both Ferrari drivers in his first run, Rosberg improved to second place on his second time out, {{but was unable to}} challenge teammate Hamilton, who took the fiftieth pole position of his career. Every other driver was limited to only one timed lap and in the end, the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen locked out the second row on the grid ahead of Max Verstappen and Felipe Massa. Sainz and Ricciardo rounded up the top eight on the grid. Therefore, Q3 saw little running with the final positions determined <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> and drivers exiting their cars five minutes before the end of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|A {{precocious}} student, Durkheim {{entered the}} École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year {{was one of}} the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his agrégation in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.|$|E
5|$|Barbara {{strengthened}} into {{a hurricane}} around 1800UTC on May29 while located about 65mi (105km) east-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. At its peak intensity {{as it was}} making landfall, it had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983mbar (hPa; 29.03inHg). With this intensity, Barbara made landfall {{on the coast of}} Tonalá, Chiapas at approximately 1950UTC. This marked both the easternmost and second earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966. As Barbara moved inland within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, rapid dissipation occurred. The cloud tops warmed and Barbara degenerated into a tropical storm at 0000UTC on May30. This was followed by a downgrade to tropical depression nine hours later as Barbara's low-level circulation was disrupted by the mountainous terrain. <b>Very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> May 31, the surface circulation of Barbara soon dissipated about 25mi (40km) north-northwest of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, prior to emerging into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm's associated leftover moisture partially contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca {{tried to}} {{attack from the}} pink jersey group a few times {{at the foot of}} the climb, but Menchov {{answered}} each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he seemed quite fresh for having been climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds at the line, Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> in this stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. He wound up dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.|$|E

5|$|NGC 2770 {{is a type}} SASc {{spiral galaxy}} located about 88 million light–years away that has hosted Type Ib {{supernova}}e: SN 1999eh, SN 2007uy, and SN 2008D. The last of these is famous for being the first supernova detected by the X-rays released <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> in its formation, {{rather than by the}} optical light emitted during later stages, which allowed the first moments of the outburst to be observed. It is possible that NGC 2770's interactions with a suspected companion galaxy may have created the massive stars causing this activity. UGC 4904 is a galaxy located about 77 million light-years from Earth. On 20 October 2004, a supernova impostor was observed by Japanese amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki within the galaxy. Observations of its spectrum suggest that it shed massive amounts of material in a two-year period, transforming from a LBV star to a Wolf–Rayet star, before it was observed erupting as hypernova SN 2006jc on October 11, 2006.|$|E
5|$|With {{continued}} favorable conditions, Carlotta quickly {{developed a}} ragged central dense overcast, or centralized area of convection. An eye feature began developing on June15, and {{later that day}} Carlotta intensified into a hurricane while approaching southwestern Mexico. A Hurricane Hunters flight late on June15 indicated Carlotta was rapidly intensifying, observing winds of 110mph (175km/h) {{in the eye and}} well-established outflow; the crew also observed flight-level winds of 114mph (183km/h). The NHC initially predicted the hurricane would move along the Mexican coast just offshore, which would have allowed Carlotta to maintain much of its intensity. Shortly after its peak, Hurricane Carlotta weakened slightly as to the eye's began to interact with land. The hurricane made landfall near Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, with winds estimated at 105mph (165km/h) and a minimum pressure of , shortly after 0100UTC on June16, becoming the easternmost tropical cyclone in the Eastern Pacific to make landfall at hurricane intensity on record until surpassed by Hurricane Barbara a year later. Carlotta rapidly weakened while moving inland, and it had deteriorated to tropical depression status by 12hours after landfall. Although the cloud pattern became disrupted, the storm maintained a large area of thunderstorms. <b>Very</b> <b>early</b> <b>on</b> June17, the NHC reported that Carlotta had weakened into a post-tropical remnant low; the system still had a broad circulation over southwestern Mexico at the time. Later that day, the low degenerated into a trough along the west coast of Mexico.|$|E
