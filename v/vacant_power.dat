25|$|Bauer would {{continue}} {{with his work}} in 4FW and Pro EVW, but would also branch out into new territories in 2010, with matches in Welsh Wrestling and XWA (professional wrestling). He would also make his first appearance outside of the UK, wrestling for the NCW Cruiser weight Championship in Hamburg, Germany. Bauer would have his last match as 'The Spanish Sensation' Eddie Reyes, in June 2011; at 4FW Steel Cage Warfare, in a loss to Joel Redman. He would change his name to Eddie Ryan, as to represent England in six matches in the United States, including a losing effort for the <b>vacant</b> <b>Power</b> League Wrestling Heavyweight Championship.

50|$|During {{the fall}} of 2007, AzCMF {{confirmed}} {{that there were two}} <b>vacant</b> full <b>power</b> FM frequencies available for use in the Phoenix area - 88.7FM and 90.7FM. The group decided to apply for both FM frequencies. As time went on, the organization’s Board of Directors realized the FCC might take longer than expected to rule on the applications they filed and a long-term project was needed to keep the public and new volunteers engaged.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Brown University {{along with}} the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College {{announced}} that the <b>vacant</b> South Street <b>Power</b> Station would be a redeveloped with student housing, retail, a URI/RIC nursing school, administrative offices, a new parking structure, and additions to the adjacent riverwalk. The project is slated to also include student housing built on a parking lot along Point Street.|$|R
50|$|The company {{houses and}} other {{buildings}} {{such as the}} community hall remained <b>vacant</b> until the <b>power</b> plant {{was taken over by}} SaskPower in 1981. By 1988, all the buildings had been removed or demolished. Except for the two-storey commissary, which now serves as a staff house, all that remains of the settlement of Island Falls are the sidewalks leading to the places where houses once stood.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies (e. g Bruins and Wilke, 1993) it was established that in hierarchically structured groups, power aspirations towards a high power position are stronger {{for the next}} most senior person than for lower positioned others, that, is, support was found for Ng's (1977) bureaucratic rule. In the present study {{the persistence of the}} bureaucratic rule is demonstrated in simulated organizations with different succession rules. In addition, it appeared that when the least powerful member of the organization was assigned to a <b>vacant</b> high <b>power</b> position, members' feelings of injustice were stronger in conditions in which the succession rule had been violated but interestingly, these feelings were not dependent on members' own positions...|$|R
40|$|For over a century, state {{governors}} {{have had}} the power to appoint US Senators to <b>vacant</b> seats, a <b>power</b> which runs against the idea of Senators as being democratic representatives. But do governors appoint those with similar ideologies to themselves? In new research which reviewed senate candidates considered by governors to fill vacancies, Christopher Cooper, H. Gibbs Knotts, and Jordan Ragusa find that while they rarely appoint senators from a different party, they tend to skew towards the middle – appointing those who are closest to the ideology of the state’s median voter...|$|R
5|$|The {{governor}} has a four-year term, commencing {{on the first}} Monday of the January after an election. The Constitution of Utah originally stated that, should the office of governor be <b>vacant,</b> the <b>power</b> be devolved upon the Secretary of State, but the office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1976, and a 1980 constitutional amendment added it to the constitution. If the office of governor becomes vacant {{during the first year}} of the term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor until the next general election; if it becomes vacant after the first year of the term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term. The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. The Governor of Utah was formerly limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws were repealed by the Utah Legislature in 2003; Utah is one of the few states where gubernatorial term limits are not determined by the constitution.|$|R
50|$|In November 2007 Power {{challenged}} former foe Ian Napa for the British {{title that}} he had himself relinquished. Napa had beaten Jason Booth for the <b>vacant</b> version and <b>Power</b> was to be his first defence. Napa ended up winning the rematch in 12 rounds and Power crashed to his third consecutive defeat. On 18 December 2008, after being {{out of the ring}} for over a year, Power travelled to Dublin and lost for the fourth time in a row this time against Gary Davies, who would go on to become a British champion himself, via a 2nd round TKO.|$|R
500|$|Minton's central {{judicial}} {{philosophy was}} to ascertain and uphold the original intent of legislation. He continued {{to take a}} broad view of governmental powers, demonstrated in his dissenting opinion {{in the case of}} Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, which ruled unconstitutional President Truman's wartime seizure of several steel mills to avert a workers' strike. Of all the cases in which Minton was involved, he disagreed most with the Youngstown decision and [...] "went into a tirade" [...] during the conference where the decision was made. He argued that there [...] "could be no <b>vacant</b> spot in <b>power</b> when the security of the nation is at stake." [...] Despite his strong protest, he could not influence the Court to permit the president to seize the plants without congressional approval. Minton joined with Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Stanley Forman Reed in the dissenting opinion that the President had the authority through the war powers clause of the constitution.|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed that indigenous American nations had neither sovereignty {{in international law}} nor title to their territories when Europeans first arrived; North America was legally <b>vacant</b> and European <b>powers</b> could gain title to it simply by discovery, symbolic acts, occupation, or treaties among themselves. It follows, on this view, that current indigenous claims to internal sovereignty or a 2 ̆ 2 third order of government 2 ̆ 2 have no historical basis. This paper argues that this viewpoint is misguided and cannot be justified either by reference to positive international law or basic principles of justice. The author 2 ̆ 7 s view is that indigenous American nations had exclusive title to their territories {{at the time of}} European contact and participated actively in the formation of Canada and the United States. This fact requires us to rewrite our constitutional histories and reconsider the current status of indigenous American nations...|$|R

2500|$|Trade rumors {{involving}} Pippen escalated {{during the}} 1994 off-season. Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager, was reportedly looking to ship Pippen {{off to the}} Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for all-star forward Shawn Kemp, moving Toni Kukoč into Pippen's position as starting small forward with Kemp filling in the <b>vacant</b> starting <b>power</b> forward position in place of Horace Grant, a free agent who left the Bulls for the up-and-coming Orlando Magic during the off-season. [...] In January, when asked by the late Craig Sager {{as to whether he}} thought would be traded, Pippen replied, [...] "I hope I am". However, Pippen would remain a Bull and those rumors were put to rest once it was announced that Michael Jordan would be returning to the Bulls late in the [...] season. The Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the [...] season as they had in the season before. In fact, {{for the first time in}} years they were in danger of missing the playoffs (though much of this may be due to a lack of interior defense and rebounding due to Grant's departure). The Bulls were just 34–31 prior to Jordan's return for the final 17 games, and Jordan led them to a 13–4 record to close the regular season. Still, Pippen finished the [...] season leading the Bulls in every major statistical category—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks—becoming only the second player in NBA history to accomplish this (Dave Cowens did it in it has since been achieved also by Kevin Garnett in , LeBron James in , and Giannis Antetokounmpo in [...] ).|$|R
