40|$|With the {{imminent}} massive scale up of antiretroviral therapy {{in developing countries}} concerns have been raised regarding the spectre of widespread <b>viral</b> drug <b>resistance.</b> These concerns should {{not lead to a}} slowing of the pace at which these life-preserving medications are made available to the millions in need in those countries. With proper HAART regimens and proper adherence, development of drug resistance is not a common event. Increasing simplicity of antiretroviral drug regimens, as well as supportive services, promote adherence and have been shown to lead to extremely high therapeutic success rates in both developed and developing countries. Moreover, the possibility of drug resistance has not discouraged industrialized countries from offering universal access to anti retrovira Is. If anything, the situation in developing countries, where few patients have been previously exposed to suboptimal drug regimens and where a public health approach may be taken to the treatment of HIV infection, is in many respects more favourable to the prevention of widespread <b>viral</b> drug <b>resistance</b> than that in the developed world. This conclusion is underscored by available evidence presented in this supplement.

40|$|The first anti-HIV drug, {{zidovudine}} (AZT), {{was approved}} by the FDA {{a quarter of a century}} ago, in 1985. Currently, anti-HIV drug-combination therapies only target HIV- 1 protease and reverse transcriptase. Unfortunately, most of these molecules present numerous shortcoming; such as <b>viral</b> <b>resistances</b> and adverse effects. In addition, these drugs are involved in later stages of infection. Thus, it is necessary to develop new drugs that are able to block the first steps of viral life cycle. Entry of HIV- 1 is mediated by its two envelope glycoproteins: gp 120 and gp 41. Upon gp 120 binding to cellular receptors, gp 41 undergoes a series of conformational changes from a non-fusogenic to a fusogenic conformation. The fusogenic core of gp 41 is a trimer-of-hairpins structure in which three C-terminal helices pack against a central trimeric-coiled coil formed by three N-terminal helices. The formation of this fusogenic structure brings the viral and cellular membranes close together, a necessary condition for membrane fusion to occur. As gp 120 and gp 41 are attractive targets, the development of entry inhibitors represents an important avenue of anti-HIV drug therapy. The present review will focus on some general considerations about HIV, the main characteristics of gp 120, gp 41 and their inhibitors, with special emphasis on the advances of computational approaches employed in the development of bioactive compounds against HIV- 1 entry process...|$|R

5000|$|Currently, {{there are}} two classes of {{antiviral}} drugs approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza infections. They are the adamantanes and NAIs. The adamantanes only work on influenza A so since 2010 WHO recommended the usage of NAIs for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B infections.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To analyse the {{association}} between the presence of resistance mutations and treatment outcomes. The impact of HIV- 1 drug resistance mutations in African adults on HAART has so far never been reported. METHODS: In 2004 in Abidjan, C?d'Ivoire, 106 adults on HAART had plasma viral load measurements. Patients with detectable <b>viral</b> loads had <b>resistance</b> genotypic tests. Patients were followed until 2006. Main outcomes were serious morbidity and immunological failure (CD 4 cell count < 200 cells/microl). RESULTS: At study entry, the median previous time on HAART was 37 months and the median CD 4 cell count was 266 cells/microl; 58 % of patients had undetectable viral loads, 20 % had detectable viral loads with no major resistance mutations, and 22 % had detectable viral loads {{with one or more}} major mutations. The median change in CD 4 cell count between study entry and study termination was + 129 cells/microl in patients with undetectable viral loads, + 51 cells/microl in those with detectable viral loads with no mutations and + 3 cells/microl in those with detectable <b>viral</b> loads with <b>resistance</b> mutations. Compared with patients with undetectable viral loads, those with detectable <b>viral</b> loads with <b>resistance</b> mutations had adjusted hazard ratios of immunological failure of 4. 32 (95 %CI 1. 38 - 13. 57, P = 0. 01). One patient died. The 18 -month probability of remaining free of morbidity was 0. 79 in patients with undetectable viral loads and 0. 69 in those with resistance mutations (P = 0. 19). CONCLUSION: In this setting with restricted access to second-line HAART, patients with major resistance mutations had higher rates of immunological failure, but most maintained stable CD 4 cell counts and stayed alive for at least 20 months...|$|R

50|$|CCR5 is {{essential}} for the spread of the R5-strain of the HIV-1 virus. Knowledge of the mechanism by which this strain of HIV-1 mediates infection has prompted research into the development of therapeutic interventions to block CCR5 function. A number of new experimental HIV drugs, called CCR5 receptor antagonists, have been designed to interfere with the associative binding between the Gp120 envelope protein and the HIV co-receptor CCR5. These experimental drugs include PRO140 (CytoDyn), Vicriviroc (Phase III trials were cancelled in July 2010) (Schering Plough), Aplaviroc (GW-873140) (GlaxoSmithKline) and Maraviroc (UK-427857) (Pfizer). Maraviroc was approved for use by the FDA in August 2007. It is the only one thus far approved by the FDA for clinical use, thus becoming the first CCR5 inhibitor. A problem of this approach is that, while CCR5 is the major co-receptor by which HIV infects cells, {{it is not the only}} such co-receptor. It is possible that under selective pressure HIV will evolve to use another co-receptor. However, examination of <b>viral</b> <b>resistance</b> to AD101, molecular antagonist of CCR5, indicated that resistant viruses did not switch to another coreceptor (CXCR4) but persisted in using CCR5, either through binding to alternative domains of CCR5, or by binding to the receptor at a higher affinity. However, because there is still another co-receptor available, this indicates that lacking the CCR5 gene doesn't make one immune to the virus; it simply implies that it would be more challenging for the individual to contract it. Also, the virus still has access to the CD4. Unlike CCR5, which the body apparently doesn't really need due to those still living healthy lives even with the lack of/or absence of the gene (as a result of the delta 32 mutation), CD4 is critical in the body's defense system (fighting against infection). Even without the availability of either co-receptors (even CCR5), the virus can still invade cells if gp41 were to go through an alteration (including its cytoplasmic tail), resulting in the independence of CD4 without the need of CCR5 and/or CXCR4 as a doorway.|$|E
