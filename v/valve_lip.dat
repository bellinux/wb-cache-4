40|$|The utriculo-endolymphatic valve was {{discovered}} by Bast in 1928. The function of Bast’s valve is still unclear. By means of orthogonal-plane fluorescence optical sectioning (OPFOS) microscopy 3 D-reconstructions of the valve and its surrounding region are depicted. The shape of the duct at the utricular side {{is that of a}} flattened funnel. In the direction of the endolymphatic duct and sac this funnel runs into a very narrow duct. The valve itself has a rigid ‘arch-like’ configuration. The opposing thin, one cell-layer thick, utricular membrane is highly compliant. We propose that opening and closure of the valve occurs through movement of the flexible base/utricular membrane away from and toward the relatively rigid <b>valve</b> <b>lip...</b>|$|E
30|$|Another {{thing to}} note {{is that there}} is a strain peak on the valve side below the stitch. This point shows the {{influence}} of the corner control point on the <b>valve</b> <b>lip.</b> The control point is fixed while pressure is applied, so there is an increase of strain here due to the control point keeping the valve up. If this stitch boundary condition were applied to a single point rather than through a control point with loading patch, a much higher strain peak would be seen along with excessive localized deformation. Other than the corners, the second highest strain is located at the base of the valve. Like the corner, strains higher than those allowed by the material are found here. It should be noted that the fixed boundary conditions at the base are probably stiffer than the actual valve. One row of sutures holds the valve to the stent, and the suture probably behaves somewhere in between a fixed and a pinned boundary.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The repair and/or {{replacement}} of lock culvert valves {{is an issue}} that many US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) offices are facing, partly because many of the navigation locks have reached or exceeded their design life. Reverse tainter valves are the most common valve type found on navigation locks constructed by the USACE (Pickett and Neilson 1988; Headquarters, USACE 1975). Many existing reverse tainter valves are of double-skin-plate construction, but several projects {{are in the process of}} replacing these valves with new valves of a vertically framed, single-skin design because they are easier to inspect and repair. The geometric and hydraulic parameters describing a reverse tainter valve are shown in Figure 1. Lock culvert flow is controlled by rotating the valve about the trunnion axis. The valve position is listed as the valve opening ratio b/B, where b is the distance from the <b>valve</b> <b>lip</b> to the culvert floor, and B is the culvert height at the valve. Figure 1. Reverse tainter valve parameters...|$|E

A few platelets attach themselves to the <b>valve</b> <b>lips,</b> constricting the opening and causing more platelets and red blood cells to aggregate and coagulate. Coagulation of unmoving blood {{on both sides of the}} blockage may propagate a clot in both directions.|$|R
5000|$|With James's {{childhood}} {{spent as}} a musician in a traveling circus, {{he picked up a}} flamboyant style that utilized such techniques as heavy vibrato, half <b>valve</b> and <b>lip</b> glissandi, <b>valve</b> and <b>lip</b> trills, and <b>valve</b> tremolos. These techniques were popular at the time in what some have called a [...] "hot" [...] jazz style, with James's idol Louis Armstrong providing an example of one who used these techniques, but they later fell out of favor in the 1950s with the advent of [...] "cool" [...] jazz. James's father instituted a rigorous regime of practice for James as a child, and this allowed James to achieve an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range, fingering and tonguing. Growing up in the south, James was also exposed to blues music, which had an influence on his style. As James explained, [...] "I was brought up in Texas with the blues - when I was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call 'barbecue row' I used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their guitars, playing the blues; that's all we knew." [...] Louis Armstrong, after hearing Harry James solo on several numbers while at a Benny Goodman one-nighter with his friend Lionel Hampton, exclaimed to Hampton in the vernacular of the time, [...] "That white boy - he plays like a jig!" ...|$|R
50|$|The gas may be {{introduced}} by a Schrader-type <b>valve,</b> using a <b>lip</b> seal around the rod and forcing it to allow gas in by external overpressure or a shuttling O-ring system. Gas springs of high pressure contain {{a very large}} amount of energy and {{can be used as a}} power pack. In emergency use the gas may {{be introduced}} via a gas generator cell, similar to those used in airbags. Passive heave compensators features large gas springs. The stroke lengths can exceed 6 meter.|$|R
40|$|CDC coryneform group A- 3 {{bacteria}} are rare human pathogens. In this study, six group A- 3 isolates (two from blood, one from cerebrospinal fluid, and one each from homograft <b>valve,</b> <b>lip</b> wound, and pilonidal cyst) {{were compared to}} the type strains of phenotypically related organisms, Cellulomonas fimi, Cellulomonas hominis, Oerskovia turbata, and Sanguibacter suarezii, and characterized by phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genotypic studies. DNA-DNA reassociation analysis identified two genomic groups, and phylogenetic analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence identified the taxonomic positions of these groups to genus level. Two groups were defined, and both were {{more closely related to}} Cellulomonas species: one group of three strains, for which we propose the new species Cellulomonas denverensis sp. nov., with the type strain W 6929 (ATCC BAA- 788 T or DSM 15764 T), was related to C. hominis ATCC 51964 T (98. 5 % 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity), and the second group of three strains was related to C. hominis ATCC 51964 T (99. 8 to 99. 9 % 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The definition of this new Cellulomonas species and the confirmation of three strains as C. hominis serve to further clarify the complex taxonomy of CDC coryneform group A- 3 bacteria and will assist in our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical significance of these microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Labial-lingual double articulations (LLDAs) are speech errors {{involving}} simultaneous <b>valving</b> at the <b>lips</b> {{and in the}} linguapalatal region. This study {{investigates the}} frequency of LLDAs occurring for /p/, /b/, and /m/ targets and describes the linguapalatal contact patterns involved in these abnormal articulations. Design: A retrospective study involving analysis of articulatory data from all speakers with cleft palate recorded at a research center over a 10 -year period. Participants: Twenty-seven speakers aged 5 to 62 years (median 11 years) with compensatory speech errors associated with repaired cleft palate. Measures: The lingual component of LLDAs was identified using electropalatography (EPG). EPG data were recorded simultaneously with acoustic data. Fifteen bilabial targets (/p/, /b/, /m/) per participant were analyzed. LLDAs were identified in cases where complete linguapalatal constriction (as observed from EPG data) occurred throughout the closure phase of bilabial targets. The labial component of LLDAs was identified from clinical observations of the speakers made during productions of bilabial targets. Results: Three speakers (11...|$|R
5000|$|The horn is the third-highest-sounding {{instrument}} in the brass family, below the trumpet and the cornet. Horns are mostly tuned in B or F, {{or a combination}} of both. In some traditions, novice players use a single horn in F, while others prefer the B horn. The F horn is used more commonly than the B horn, especially in school bands. Compared to the other brass instruments in orchestras and concert bands, it has a very different mouthpiece, but has the widest usable range—approximately four octaves, depending on the ability of the player. Sound is produced by vibrating ("buzzing") the player's lips into the mouthpiece of the instrument. Different partials in the harmonic series can be played by adjusting the air pressure and lip tension, while different harmonic series can be accessed by pressing the <b>valves.</b> More <b>lip</b> tension and faster air produces higher notes, less lip tension and slower air produces lower notes. The player can also adjust the pitch of the instrument through the position of their hand in the bell. The right hand, usually cupped at a [...] "three o-clock" [...] position in the bell, can lower the pitch, depending on how far into the bell the player puts it, by as much as a semitone in the instrument's midrange. The horn plays in a higher portion of its overtone series compared to most brass instruments. Its conical bore (as opposed to the cylindrical bore of the trumpet or trombone) is largely responsible for its characteristic tone.|$|R
40|$|In this work, a physics-based {{model of}} a {{trombone}} coupled to a lip reed is presented, with the parameter space explored {{for the purpose of}} real-time sound synthesis. A highly configurable dynamic <b>lip</b> <b>valve</b> model is reviewed and its parameters discussed {{within the context of a}} trombone model. The trombone model is represented as two separate parametric transfer functions, corresponding to tapping a waveguide model at both mouthpiece and bell positions, enabling coupling to the reed model as well as providing the instrument’s produced sound. The trombone model comprises a number of waveguide filter elements— propagation loss, reflection at the mouthpiece, and reflection and transmission at the bell—which may be obtained through theory and measurement. As oscillation of a lip reed is strongly coupled to the bore, and playability strongly dependent on the bore and bell resonances, it is expected that a change in the parameters of one will require adapting the other. Synthesis results, emphasizing both interactivity and high-quality sound production are shown for the trombone in both extended and retracted positions, with several example configurations of the lip reed. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{physical}} model of brass instrument is considered {{in this paper}} : a one degree-of-freedom outward-striking <b>valve</b> for the <b>lips,</b> non-linearly coupled to a modal representation of the air column. It is studied through Linear Stability Analysis (LSA) of the equilibrium solution. This approach provides the threshold blowing pressure value, at which instability occurs, and the instability frequency value. The relevance {{of the results of}} this method is theoretically limited to the neighbourhood of the equilibrium solution. This paper checks the efficiency of LSA to understand the behaviour of the model computed through time-domain simulations. As expected, a good agreement is observed between LSA and numerical simulations of the complete nonlinear model around the oscillation threshold. For blowing pressures far above the oscillation threshold, the picture is more contrasted. In most of the cases tested, a periodic regime coherent with the LSA results is observed, but over-blowing, quasi-periodicity and period-doubling also occur. Interestingly, LSA predicts the production of the pedal note by a trombone, for which only nonlinear hypotheses have been previously proposed. LSA also predicts the production of a saxhorn note which, although known to musicians, has barely been documented...|$|R
40|$|Duckbill-shaped {{elastomer}} valves {{are often}} installed on wastewater effluent diffusers, stormwater outfalls, and industrial flow systems to prevent backflow and sediment/salt water intrusion. Unlike fixed diameter nozzles, the flow from a duckbill valve (DBV) depends {{both on the}} driving pressure {{and the size of}} the valve opening. A nonlinear large deformation finite element analysis of a prototype DBV is reported herein. The elastomer is modeled as a hyperelastic incompressible solid, and the flow inside the DBV, shaped like a converging nozzle, is treated as energy conserving. The deformed valve is computed iteratively from sequential standard large deformation analysis of the internal flow and pressure loading. The calculations show that the <b>valve</b> opening is <b>lip</b> shaped, and the maximum stress occurs around the two sides of the saddle of the DBV; maximum strains are on the order of 5 %. In contrast to the traditional square-root head-discharge dependence, a linear pressure-discharge relation is predicted for a range of elastomer thickness; the jet velocity/valve opening area varies nonlinearly with discharge. The normalized predictions of valve discharge flow and opening area as a function of the driving pressure are in excellent agreement with experimental data. © ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{both the}} voice and musical wind instruments, a <b>valve</b> (vocal folds, <b>lips</b> or reed) lies between an {{upstream}} and downstream duct: trachea and vocal tract for the voice, vocal tract and bore for the instrument. Examining the structural similarities and functional differences gives insight into their operation and the duct-valve interactions. In speech and singing, vocal tract resonances usually determine the spectral envelope, and usually have a smaller influence on the operating frequency. The resonances are important {{not only for the}} phonemic information they produce, but also because of their contribution to voice timbre, loudness and efficiency. The role of the tract resonances is usually different in brass and some woodwind instruments, where they modify and to some extent compete or collaborate with resonances of the instrument to control the vibration of a reed or the player's lips, and/or the spectrum of air flow into the instrument. We give a brief overview of oscillator mechanisms and vocal tract acoustics. We discuss recent and current research on how the acoustical resonances of the vocal tract are involved in singing and the playing of musical wind instruments. Finally we compare techniques used in determining tract resonances and suggest some future developments...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Existing {{fixation}} {{methods of}} automatic speaking valves (ASVs) suffer from shortcomings which partly {{are the result}} of insufficient conformity of the intratracheal fixation method’s shape to the tracheostoma anatomy. However, quantitative data are lacking and will be helpful to analyse solutions for airtight fixation. This article provides such data. Patients and methods: The tracheostoma morphology was measured in computerized tomography scans of 20 laryngectomized patients. Measured were transverse and sagittal diameters, transition angle between skin level and tracheostoma lumen and between the tracheostoma lumen to the trachea, TE valve placement and stoma depth. Results: The mean transverse and sagittal diameters of the stoma at the peristomal lip are 19. 2 [*]mm [standard deviation (SD 5. 2 [*]mm) ] and 17. 6 [*]mm (SD 5. 3 [*]mm), respectively. The mean transition angles are 84. 5 ° (SD 15. 6 °) at skin level and 153. 6 ° (SD 11. 7 °) into the trachea. The mean distance between TE <b>valve</b> and peristomal <b>lip</b> is 13. 5 [*]mm (SD 7. 0 [*]mm). The mean stoma depth is 14. 0 [*]mm (SD 6. 4 [*]mm). Conclusions: Due to the large variation, no ‘average tracheostoma morphology’, suitable for shaping a generic intratracheal fixation device, can be defined. Therefore, providing an airtight fixation in each patient would require a large range of different sizes, customization or a new approach...|$|R
