50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} scenarios in which <b>virtual</b> <b>commerce</b> can play a vital role. For one, traditional learning, usually campus-based, can be augmented by technology, and can allow people to learn at any time, any place. This can be instrumental in providing a customized learning environment that can cater {{to the needs of}} every individual. V-commerce looks to be a key component in the 21st century learning environment. However, many institutions of higher learning have yet to develop the knowledge and competency in <b>virtual</b> <b>commerce.</b> The reason is that for many leaders of institutions of higher learning, the focus is still on basic infrastructure and applications, and they currently do not recognize the value or importance of <b>virtual</b> <b>commerce.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>commerce</b> {{provides}} users {{with a different}} experience {{due to the fact}} that they are not physically present at a store. Creating a web-presence is considered cheap for firms and can allow them to further establish themselves in the physical market or completely replace their physical presence with a virtual one. <b>Virtual</b> <b>commerce</b> can be challenging to businesses that are already established in the real world and need to communicate their brand image or message on a different format. Online brand strength faced skepticism at first but it soon became apparent that users resorted to brands due to the large penetration of different products online. <b>Virtual</b> <b>commerce</b> is oriented around strategy and progress rather than profit since it is considered new territory where firms are trying to establish themselves online. It allows businesses to create products that cater to the demands of customers with help from the increased communication and data collection methods that are available online. Successful v-commerce models have the potential of gaining a competitive advantage and increased exposure. Some businesses choose not to participate in <b>virtual</b> <b>commerce</b> because an online presence does not support the product or service they provide, along with geographic or demographic reasons. Other businesses create an online store that provides a similar experience to that of the physical one, displaying the same products and giving customers a sense of comfort because they can still resort to the physical store for returns or complaints. Businesses that have a physical presence may use v-commerce as a way to experiment or display different products that they would not usually display in-store. This could be because the Internet provides greater geographic and demographic exposure where people with different tastes and incomes shop.|$|E

For example, Starwood Hotels was an early arrival, prototyping a new real-world hotel on the site, while technology companies like IBM are quietly eyeing virtual communities as the building block for next-generation operating systems.

As a result, {{there seems to be}} a growing blur in the distinction between e-Commerce and m-Commerce. In addition, existing definitions for both forms of commerce highlight characteristics (e. g. type of device and activity conducted) that may be applicable to both concepts.

The paper concludes that characteristics of mobility, ubiquity and immediacy provide a clearer and simpler template to distinguish between e-Commerce and m-Commerce...|$|E

The ability to offer vivid and engrossing social interactions with spokes-avatars within 3 D environments is the key advantage of interactive marketing in Second Life. This study particularly focused on the “physical presence ” (i. e., {{the degree to which}} consumers feel as if virtual products and retail settings were real) dimension of interactive brand marketing in 3 D virtual environments and its impact on brand-self connection and consumers’ evaluation of a spokes-avatar’s credibility.

The article critically analyses section 7 (1) of the VAT Act to determine its applicability to transactions occurring in virtual worlds. The benefit of this article will be to highlight the deficiency in the South African VAT Act in dealing with electronic commerce transactions as well as transactions arising in virtual worlds. The study reported here concluded that the South African VAT Act in its current format does not appear to deal with transactions occurring in virtual worlds effectively. Consequently, amendments to existing law should be effected in order to deal effectively with the transactions. [URL]...|$|R

A series of in depth interviews with field experts (study # 1) along with an online questionnaire survey (study # 2) served as the data collection mechanisms of the study. The empirical findings suggest that while the social aspect dimension of V-Commerce limits customization capabilities, it provides several innovative options for manipulating Store Atmosphere. Additionally, {{the results indicate that}} Store Atmosphere attributes can be grouped in three factors with high average scores concerning the importance users attach to them. Specifically, storefront, store theatrics, colors, music and graphics are grouped in Factor # 1 and reflect the “Store’s Appeal”.

More importantly, an assessment framework is proposed to evaluate the learning objectives and learning process of the Second Life project. The assessment framework is composed {{of a variety of}} items, such as reflection essays, chat transcripts, peer evaluations, and a post project survey that measures the learning motive, attitudes, level of difficulty, and the time used to complete the project. The Second Life project was implemented in an MBA-IS course in which thirty-two students were randomly assigned to eight teams. In Second Life, each team managed an avatar and completed a series of business-related activities. The assessment outcomes indicated that students were able to apply what they learned in class into the virtual environment through their exploration and interaction. Students were motivated to learn in the Second Life project and felt that the engaging experiences helped with their learning. On average, students developed a positive attitude toward Second Life and felt that the application was not difficult to use.

40|$|Recently a new {{generation}} of virtual worlds has emerged in which users are provided with open-ended modelling tools with which they can create and modify world content. The result is evolving <b>virtual</b> spaces for <b>commerce,</b> education and social interaction. In general, these virtual worlds are not games and have no concept of winning, however the open-ended modelling capacity is nonetheless compelling. The rising popularity of open-ended virtual worlds suggests that there may also be potential for a {{new generation}} of computer games situated in open-ended environments. A key issue with the development of such games, however, is the design of non-player characters which can respond autonomously to unpredictable, open-ended changes to their environment. This paper considers the impact of open-ended modelling on character development in simulation games. Motivated reinforcement learning using context-free grammars is proposed as a means of representing unpredictable, evolving worlds for character reasoning. This technique is used to design adaptive characters for the Second Life virtual world to create a new kind of open-ended simulation game...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—During {{the past}} decade, online trust and {{reputation}} systems have provided cogent answers to emerging {{challenges in the}} global computing infrastructures relating to computer and network security, electronic <b>commerce,</b> <b>virtual</b> enterprises, social networks and cloud computing. The goal of these systems in such global computing infrastructures is to allow entities to reason about the trustworthiness of other entities and to make autonomous decisions {{on the basis of}} trust. This requires the development of computational trust models that enable entities to reason about trust and to verify the properties of a particular interaction. The robustness of these mechanisms is one of the critical factors required for the success of this technology. In this paper, we briefly present characteristics of existing online trust and reputation models and systems through a multidimensional framework that can serve as a basis to understand {{the current state of the}} art in the area.
