5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance {{is a white}} solid sparingly soluble in water, but <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in concentrated hydrochloric acid. Impure samples appear green due {{to the presence of}} copper(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) sulfate is {{insoluble}} in water, {{like the}} sulfates of other heavy divalent cations. Lead(II) nitrate and lead(II) acetate are <b>very</b> <b>soluble,</b> {{and this is}} exploited in the synthesis of other lead compounds.|$|E
5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make hypochlorites. It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.|$|E
50|$|N-methyltyramine {{hydrogen}} oxalate, C9H13NO.C2H2O4: m.p. 250 °C; <b>very</b> poorly <b>soluble</b> in water.|$|R
50|$|Catechol {{occurs as}} {{feathery}} white crystals that are <b>very</b> rapidly <b>soluble</b> in water.|$|R
25|$|It is <b>very</b> {{slightly}} <b>soluble</b> {{in water}} (about 20mg⋅L−1), but miscible with organic solvents.|$|R
5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is insoluble {{in water}} {{and can be used}} as a qualitative test for the presence of La3+. The heavier halides are all <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> deliquescent compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl3 produces LaOCl.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water.|$|E
50|$|In a bulk powder form, {{it appears}} as a white {{crystalline}} powder, and it is <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in water and soluble in alcohol.|$|R
50|$|Rubidium nitrate {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} powder that is highly soluble in water and <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in acetone. In a flame test, RbNO3 gives a mauve/light purple colour.|$|R
50|$|Tributylamine (TBA) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the molecular formula C12H27N. It is a colorless to yellow, hygroscopic liquid with an amine-like odor which is <b>very</b> poorly <b>soluble</b> in water.|$|R
5|$|The halides ScX3, where X = Cl, Br, or I, are <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, but ScF3 is insoluble. In {{all four}} halides, the {{scandium}} is 6-coordinated. The halides are Lewis acids; for example, ScF3 dissolves {{in a solution}} containing excess fluoride ion to form 3−. The coordination number 6 is typical for Sc(III). In the larger Y3+ and La3+ ions, coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common. Scandium(III) triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
25|$|OsO4 is <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in tert-butyl alcohol. In solution, it {{is readily}} reduced by {{hydrogen}} to osmium metal. The suspended osmium metal {{can be used}} to catalyze hydrogenation {{of a wide variety of}} organic chemicals containing double or triple bonds.|$|E
50|$|Baclofen {{is a white}} (or off-white) mostly odorless {{crystalline}} powder, with {{a molecular}} weight of 213.66 g/mol. It is slightly <b>soluble</b> in water, <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in methanol, and insoluble in chloroform.|$|R
50|$|Citrazinic acid is <b>very</b> {{sparingly}} <b>soluble</b> in water, {{acid and}} methanol but is soluble in basic solutions (e.g. ammonia water). For NMR purposes {{it is also}} sparingly soluble in d6-DMSO (2H, 6.20 ppm).|$|R
5000|$|... 6-APB succinate is {{reported}} to be practically insoluble in CHCl3 as well as <b>very</b> minimally <b>soluble</b> in cold water. A batch seized by the DEA contained a 2:1 ratio of succinate to 6-APB.|$|R
25|$|Biologically active {{isolates}} from Aconitum and Delphinium {{plants are}} classified as norditerpenoid alkaloids, which are further subdivided based on {{the presence or absence}} of the C18 carbonaconitum. Aconitine is a C19-norditerpenoid, based on its presence of this C18 carbonaconitum. It is barely soluble in water, but <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in organic solvents such as chloroform or diethyl ether. Aconitine is also soluble in mixtures of alcohol and water if the concentration of alcohol is high enough.|$|E
25|$|Soda alum, , mainly {{occurs in}} nature as the mineral mendozite. It is <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, and is {{extremely}} difficult to purify. In the preparation of this salt, it is preferable to mix the component solutions in the cold, and to evaporate them at a temperature not exceeding 60°C. 100 parts of water dissolve 110 parts of sodium alum at 0°C, and 51 parts at 16°C. Soda alum is used in the acidulent of food {{as well as in the}} manufacture of baking powder.|$|E
25|$|Water can {{dissolve}} or deform ceramics {{that have}} been low fired, i.e. temperatures around 600°C. Ceramic fired in high temperatures may also be susceptible to water if their mineral particles are soluble in water, for example Gypsum or calcite. Additionally the different compounds in water can flux and react in different ways to different ceramics. In naturally occurring water, carbon dioxide is dissolved and can create a chemical reaction with minerals in clay bodies that may form calcium bicarbonate which is <b>very</b> <b>soluble.</b> Stagnant water is less damaging because the carbon dioxide is not exhausted.|$|E
50|$|Octyl gallate is a {{white powder}} with a {{characteristic}} odor. It is <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in water and soluble in alcohol. Its solubility in lard is 1.1%. Octyl gallate darkens in presence of iron.|$|R
5000|$|... 1-Heptanol is {{an alcohol}} with a seven carbon chain and the {{structural}} formula of CH3(CH2)6OH. It {{is a clear}} colorless liquid that is <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in water, but miscible with ether and ethanol.|$|R
50|$|Tenofovir has {{a melting}} point of 279 C. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate {{is a white}} to off-white {{crystalline}} powder that is soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in water (13.4 mg/ml), and <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in dichloromethane.|$|R
25|$|The {{bio-availability}} {{of essential}} trace elements (in particular selenium) to potentially lethal lows {{has been shown}} to coincide with, and likely have contributed to, at least three mass extinction events in the oceans, i.e. {{at the end of the}} Ordovician, during the Middle and Late Devonian, and at the end of the Triassic. During periods of low oxygen concentrations <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> selenate (Se6+) is converted into much less soluble selenide (Se2+), elemental Se and organo-selenium complexes. Bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1% of the current oceanic concentration, a level that has been proven lethal to many extant organisms.|$|E
25|$|Whilst zinc {{chloride}} is <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water, solutions cannot {{be considered to}} contain simply solvated Zn2+ ions and Cl− ions, ZnClxH2O(4−x) species are also present. · R H2O (R = 1.8, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 6.2) | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry | year = 1989 | volume = 93 | issue = 6 | pages = 2620–2625 | doi = 10.1021/j100343a074 }} Aqueous solutions of ZnCl2 are acidic: a 6M aqueous solution has a pH of 1. The acidity of aqueous ZnCl2 solutions relative to solutions of other Zn2+ salts {{is due to the}} formation of the tetrahedral chloro aqua complexes where the reduction in coordination number from 6 to 4 further reduces the strength of the O–H bonds in the solvated water molecules.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are <b>very</b> <b>soluble.</b> Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group (dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E
50|$|Succinylsulfathiazole is a sulfonamide. It is also spelled as succinylsulphathiazole. It is a {{white or}} yellow-white {{crystalline}} powder. It dissolves in aqueous solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates but is <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in water.|$|R
50|$|Spermaceti is {{insoluble}} in water, <b>very</b> slightly <b>soluble</b> in cold ethanol, but easily {{dissolved in}} ether, chloroform, carbon disulfide, and boiling ethanol. Spermaceti consists principally of cetyl palmitate (the ester of cetyl alcohol and palmitic acid), C15H31COO-C16H33.|$|R
30|$|PFOS and PFOA are weakly lipophilic, <b>very</b> water <b>soluble,</b> and bind {{preferentially}} to proteins. The principle binding {{partner is}} albumin [61, 103]; however, it also binds to β-lipoproteins or fatty acid binding proteins {{in the liver}} [L-FABP] [104].|$|R
25|$|Fermentation {{of sugar}} into alcohol during {{winemaking}} always means that {{carbon dioxide is}} released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> in water (the main constituent of wine), a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In i.a. Champagne production the base wine is usually a blend of wines from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called cuvée. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a secondary fermentation, which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under excess pressure and binds it to the liquid in the sparkling wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead yeast cells form a precipitate called lees, that often helps with appealing aromas to the sparkling wine but looks unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.|$|E
500|$|The Earth's crust {{contains}} 2.27% sodium, {{making it}} the seventh most abundant element on Earth and the fifth most abundant metal, behind aluminium, iron, calcium, and magnesium and ahead of potassium. Sodium's estimated oceanic abundance is 1.08 milligrams per liter. Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some <b>very</b> <b>soluble,</b> such as halite and natron, others much less soluble, such as amphibole and zeolite. [...] The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which {{in the case of}} feldspar is a polysilicate.|$|E
500|$|In aqueous solution, {{tungstate}} {{gives the}} heteropoly acids and polyoxometalate anions under neutral and acidic conditions. As tungstate is progressively treated with acid, it first yields the soluble, metastable [...] "paratungstate A" [...] anion, , which over time converts {{to the less}} soluble [...] "paratungstate B" [...] anion, [...] Further acidification produces the <b>very</b> <b>soluble</b> metatungstate anion, , after which equilibrium is reached. The metatungstate ion exists as a symmetric cluster of twelve tungsten-oxygen octahedra known as the Keggin anion. Many other polyoxometalate anions exist as metastable species. The inclusion of a different atom such as phosphorus {{in place of the}} two central hydrogens in metatungstate produces a wide variety of heteropoly acids, such as phosphotungstic acid H3PW12O40.|$|E
5000|$|A drug like {{fentanyl}} is <b>very</b> fat <b>soluble.</b> Initial doses ‘wear off’ relatively {{quickly because}} the drug redistributes to adipose tissue. However, if the infusion is ongoing then the peripheral compartment (body tissue) {{will have a}} large store of fentanyl ...|$|R
50|$|Rapamycin {{itself is}} not <b>very</b> water <b>soluble</b> and is not very stable, so {{scientists}} developed rapamycin analogs, called rapalogs, to overcome these two problems with rapamycin. These drugs are considered the first generation inhibitors of mTOR. These other inhibitors include everolimus and temsirolimus.|$|R
