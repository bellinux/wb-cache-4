40|$|<b>Versioning</b> file systems {{provide the}} ability to recover {{from a variety of}} failures, {{including}} file corruption, virus and worm infestations, and user mistakes. However, using <b>versions</b> to recover from data-corrupting events requires a human to determine precisely which files and <b>versions</b> to restore. We can create more meaningful <b>versions</b> and enhance the value of those <b>versions</b> by capturing the causal connections among files, facilitating selection and recovery of precisely the right <b>versions</b> after data corrupting events. We determine when to create new <b>versions</b> of files automatically using the causal relationships among files. The literature on <b>versioning</b> file systems usually examines two extremes of possible version-creation algorithms: open-to-close <b>versioning</b> and <b>versioning</b> on every write. We evaluate causal <b>versions</b> of these two algorithms and introduce two additional causality-based algorithms: Cycle-Avoidance and Graph-Finesse. We show that capturing and maintaining causal relationships imposes less than 7 % overhead on a <b>versioning</b> system, providing benefit at low cost. We then show that Cycle-Avoidance provides more meaningful <b>versions</b> of files created during concurrent program execution, with overhead comparable to open/close <b>versioning.</b> Graph-Finesse provides even greater control, frequently at comparable overhead, but sometimes at unacceptable overhead. <b>Versioning</b> on every write is an interesting extreme case, but is far too costly to be useful in practice. ...|$|R

40|$|The GAIA {{framework}} prototype, described herein, {{explores the}} possibilities and problems that arise when combining <b>versioning</b> and open hypermedia paradigms. It will {{be argued that}} it- by adding <b>versioning</b> as a separate service in the hypermedia architecture – is possible to build consistent <b>versioning</b> of both documents and hyperstructure. This approach eases {{some of the problems}} inherent in separating <b>versioning</b> of documents and structure- and even allows <b>versioning</b> to be added to domains that would otherwise be unversioned. A brief introduction is given to research results in the hypermedia <b>versioning</b> field and GAIA is compared with previous attempts at defining hypermedia <b>versioning</b> frameworks. GAIA is capable of multi-level <b>versioning</b> and <b>versioning</b> of structures and supports freezing mechanisms for both documents and hyperstructure. The experiences from GAIA provide an input to new reference architectures for future <b>versioned</b> hypermedia frameworks...|$|R
