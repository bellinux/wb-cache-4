40|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} {{available on the}} oestrous cycle of female southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons). This is mainly due to an extremely poor breeding success in captivity and the difficulty in routine recapturing of these cryptic, semi-fossorial animals in the wild. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise the oestrous cycle of this species by monitoring peripheral plasma concentrations of progesterone and oestradiol, assessing changes in vaginal cytology, pouch condition and the urogenital sinus. Eight adult female wombats were monitored during the breeding season (July–December) over 2 years (2002 – 2003). Samples were collected up to three times a week. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> contained several cell types, categorised by morphology, as either superficial epithelial cells or parabasal–intermediate cells. Leucocytes were also counted. Plasma progesterone profiles showed a mean oestrous cycle length of 36. 33 ± 0. 67 days with a peak progesterone concentration of 139. 53 ± 10. 62 nmol/L. Levels of oestradiol peaked at a mean level of 467. 33 ± 44. 32 pmol/L on average 5 days before a rise in plasma progesterone values. The proportion of epithelial cells in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> varied throughout the cycle, with a high percentage of superficial epithelial cells observed during the follicular phase. During periods when progesterone concentrations were high, a greater percentage of parabasal–intermediate cells was observed.

5000|$|Two 12-week phase 3 {{clinical}} trials were performed for ospemifene. One evaluated {{the effects of}} Ospemifene on vaginal tissue thickness, composition and vaginal pH. The other evaluated the effects of Ospemifene on vaginal tissue and on symptoms of dyspareunia. Between the two trials, 4 signs and symptoms were measured. These included three tissue-related signs, two of which represented histological changes in the vaginal tissue (change in percent parabasal cells and change in percent superficial cells) and the third was [...] "change in vaginal pH". Dyspareunia was evaluated {{in one of the}} trials. It was defined as [...] "change in most bothersome symptom" [...] of discomfort during sexual activity and further limited to symptoms of either vaginal dryness or vaginal pain." [...] Ospemifene produced more changes in vaginal tissue and greater reduction in dyspareunia symptoms than placebo. A dose-response also was observed in the trial; ospemifene 60 mg had greater efficacy than ospemifene 30 mg. Safety was also evaluated in these phase 3 trials. There was a 5.2% increase in the incidence of hot flushes, 1.6% increase in urinary tract infections, and 0.5% increase in the incidence of headache with ospemifene over placebo. [...] One of the phase 3 trials was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 826 post-menopausal women.

40|$|BACKGROUND: After the {{menopause}} decreased {{concentrations of}} oestrogen {{may result in}} insufficient maturation of the vaginal epithelium, {{which can lead to}} a range of vaginal discomforts. This state of vaginal atrophy may be treated with oestrogen replacement treatment. Replens, a non-hormonal alternative to oestrogen replacement treatment {{has been shown to be}} effective in relieving symptoms related to vaginal atrophy in previous studies. AIMS: To study the effect of Replens on the maturation of the vaginal epithelium and morphology of the vaginal cells and to compare the results of a recently developed cytomorphometric method with manual assessment of the degree of maturation in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears.</b> METHODS: <b>Vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> from 38 postmenopausal women suffering from symptoms related to vaginal atrophy were analysed manually and by cytomorphometry. The maturation value (MV) and the percentages of (para) basal, intermediate, and superficial cells (maturation index; MI) were measured by both methods before and after treatment with Replens. Cytomorphometry also measured mean cellular area, mean nuclear area, and mean area ratio. RESULTS: A correlation was shown between the two methods in the assessment of percentages of (para) basal and intermediate cells and MV. Cytomorphometric data showed a significant increase in mean cellular area, indicating a positive effect of Replens on the maturation of the vaginal epithelium. Changes in nuclear area and ratio between nuclear and cellular areas were not significant. Treatment with Replens did not influence MI or MV, as assessed by the two methods. CONCLUSIONS: Replens did have an effect on vaginal morphology. The automated procedure may be useful for the assessment of maturation in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> and is more sensitive to small (subvisual) changes...|$|R

The uniform appearance in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> of cheesy masses of cornified epithelial cells first occurred within 3 days after the onset ofoestrus in oestrous cycles lasting 16 to 20 days (Radford & Watson, 1955).

Study included 245. 048 participants whose VCE (vaginal, cervical, endocervical) smears were examined at Department of clinical cytology of University Hospital Center Osijek from 2003 till 2008. There were 12. 639 (5. 2 %) abnormal findings, and they were divided into three groups: abnormal cells found only in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> (V), abnormal cells found in vaginal and in at least one other smear (V+) and abnormal cells not found in <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> (C/E). These three groups were analysed in respect to cytological differential diagnosis and age of participants. It was estimated how many women could be additionally included in the screening, if <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> would be included in the Pap test only after 50 years of age. In 6. 9 % of cytologically diagnosed lesions abnormal cells were found exclusively in vaginal smears (0. 35 % of all findings). As for squamous cell lesions, 91. 2 % were mild lesions (ASC and LSIL). Invasive squamous cell carcinoma was not diagnosed exclusively by <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> in either woman under 50 years of age, while in women over 50 years of age it was diagnosed in 2. 3 % of cases. Exclusively by <b>vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> was diagnosed 3. 9 % of all AGC and 6. 3 % of adenocarcinoma, while in 85. 0 % of glandular epithelium lesions abnormal cells were not found in vaginal smears.
