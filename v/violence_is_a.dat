The police often torture innocent people until a 'confession' is obtained to save influential and wealthy offenders. G.P.

25|$|The term {{intimate}} partner {{violence is}} often used synonymously with domestic abuse or domestic violence, but it specifically refers to violence occurring within a couple relationship (i.e., marriage, cohabitation, or non-cohabitating intimate partners). To these, the World Health Organization (WHO) adds controlling behaviors {{as a form of}} abuse. Intimate partner violence has been observed in opposite and same-sex relationships, and in the former instance by both men against women and women against men. Family <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> broader term, often used to include child abuse, elder abuse, and other violent acts between family members.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{working as a}} producer, Cale initiated a solo recording career in early 1970. His first album, Vintage <b>Violence,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lushly-produced roots rock effort indebted {{to a range of}} disparate influences, including The Band, Leonard Cohen, The Byrds and Brian Wilson. The more experimental Church of Anthrax (a collaboration with minimal music pioneer Terry Riley) followed in February 1971, although it was actually recorded nearly a year prior to its release. While his classical explorations briefly continued with 1972's The Academy in Peril, he would not compose in the classical mode thereafter until he began working on film soundtracks in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Nonviolence {{also has}} 'active' or 'activist' elements, in that believers accept {{the need for}} nonviolence {{as a means to}} achieve {{political}} and social change. Thus, for example, the Tolstoy and Gandhian non <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of violence, {{but at the same time}} sees nonviolent action (also called civil resistance) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, civil disobedience, nonviolent direct action, and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} (also named domestic abuse, battering, {{or family}} <b>violence)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{pattern of behavior}} which involves violence or other abuse by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. It may be termed intimate partner violence when committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence may also involve violence against children or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. Domestic murders include stoning, bride burning, honor killings, and dowry deaths.|$|E

Domestic violence—acts of physical, psychological, and sexual violence against women—is found across the world and is currently viewed as a hidden epidemic by the World Health Organisation. [...] The effects of domestic violence go beyond the victim; generational and economic effects influence entire societies. Economies of countries where domestic violence is prevalent tend to have lower female labour participation rate, in addition to higher medical expenses and higher rates of disability.|$|E

40|$|Extract] Elizabeth Kolsky's book is {{centred on}} the {{relationship}} between law, violence and the development of the colonial state. It provides a legal, social and political analysis of how the British in India all too readily were able to literally get away with murder. She argues that racial <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> constant and constituent element of British dominance in India, and that regular acts of violence 'simultaneously menaced and maintained British power in India from the late 18 th to the early 20 th centuries. Physical <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> intrinsic feature of imperial rule'...|$|R

Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has described Francis's writing as containing [...] "bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture".

Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away".

500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as {{highlighting}} [...] "the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes," [...] {{as well as for}} its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: [...] "The Strangers, as many horror films do... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One might call the narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Sells, a {{professor}} of Islamic history and literature, posits {{that one of the}} novel's main themes is race betrayal. In Andrić's view, Sells asserts, Slavs are [...] "racially Christian", and the conversion of some to Islam is perceived as a great evil epitomized by the practice of devşirme. The legend of Christian infants being buried alive within a bridge stems from The Building of Skadar, a Serbian epic poem dating back to the Middle Ages. Sells interprets the legend as an allegory for the entrapment of Slav converts to Islam within the structures of an alien religion. He describes Andrić's depiction of Muslim characters as mono-dimensional. Muslim Slavs depicted in the novel, he asserts, fall under three types: [...] "the evil Turk", [...] "the good Turk" [...] and the janissary, who secretly mourns being severed from his Christian brethren. These character depictions, Sells argues, betray Andrić's stereotypical notions of Islam. Ani Kokobobo, {{a professor}} of Slavic studies, believes <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> theme that offers conceptual cohesion to the novel's otherwise fragmented narrative. The most notable depiction of it is the impalement of Radisav of Unište, who attempts to sabotage the construction of the bridge. Several scholars interpret Radisav's impalement as an allegory for the state of Bosnia itself—subjected, vulnerable and fragmented between Christianity and Islam.|$|E
500|$|The {{state of}} Veracruz {{used to be}} {{controlled}} by the Gulf Cartel before business was handed over to Los Zetas, their former allies, when they went to war across northeastern Mexico in early 2010. Since 2011, much of the drug-related <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of the turf wars between Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel, a drug trafficking organization based in western Mexico and headed by Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán, Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. These criminal groups are fighting for Veracruz because of its lucrative smuggling routes for contraband, drug trafficking, and illegal migrants heading to the United States. It has one of Mexico's busiest ports, and officials say {{that there is no way}} they can inspect all of the containers that come in by ship. Corruption is also widespread in Veracruz; investigators have been slow and reluctant to link the Martínez Pérez murder to organized crime. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Veracruz is by [...] "general consensus one of the most politically corrupt [...] ". Mexico was ruled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for 71 years until it lost the presidential seat to the conservative National Action Party (PAN) in 2000. The PRI has long been criticized for being corrupt and allowing the drug trafficking organizations in the country to operate freely if they maintained relative peace. Although the PRI lost the national presidency in 2000, some states remained under the rule of PRI politicians. [...] "Democratic transition never quite reached Veracruz," [...] a state of 8 million people. PRI governors in Veracruz continued to rule with the state with tactics largely abandoned by the PRI at a national level.|$|E
