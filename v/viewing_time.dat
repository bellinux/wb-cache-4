25|$|The DVD release {{includes}} several episode commentaries by Executive Producer Philip Deguere.

This process begins when a user clicks play for a movie and continues throughout the <b>viewing</b> <b>time,</b> allowing for seamless viewing.

500|$|Although not {{the first}} to do so, 24 embraced the concept of real time. This idea started when {{producer}} Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing [...] "24 episodes in a season, with each episode lasting an hour". They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a [...] "race against the clock". Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact time is denoted by the digital clock display {{at the beginning and end}} of each segment. The protocol is that mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen. The story time correlates with elapsed <b>viewing</b> <b>time</b> if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode. In line with the depiction of events in real time, 24 does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first-season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. As a result of the timing nature of the series, a number of visual cues were projected onto the screen.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{nature of}} human time experience has concerned artists, poets, philosophers, and scientists throughout the ages. Any consideration of human action requires awareness of its temporal aspects. However, simply to <b>view</b> <b>time</b> in the same units and dimensions as the physicist employs in describing events robs personal time of its "lived" quality. The use of physical time concepts {{in the description of}} human events is often artificial and misleading. It fails to account for the facts that human time estimates rarely match clock and calendar time; that societies and individuals demonstrate vast differences in their constructions and uses of time; and that temporal perceptions and attitudes change within an individual both during a single day and throughout his life span. The present volume does not <b>view</b> <b>time</b> as something that is sensed {{in the same way that}} one would sense or perceive spatial or sensory stimuli. Rather, it <b>views</b> <b>time</b> as a complex set of personally experienced cognitive constructs used by individuals and cultures to account for the order, the duration, and the organization of events.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how predicting ability in a ball catching task changes with age, and, to explore the predicting abilities of children with the developmental coordination disorder (DCD). There were 157 children between the ages of 5 and 12 participating in the first portion of the study. Of these children, 46 were 5 to 7 years of age and served as controls, in the second portion of the study, for 40 5 to 7 -year old children with DCD. Predicting ability was tested by having the children watch a video of a boy throwing a ball to three locations around them. Each location was seen at four different <b>viewing</b> <b>times</b> for a total of 60 trials. Results for both ANOVAs revealed that as more visual information became available, predictions were more accurate. It was also evident that at the early <b>viewing</b> <b>times</b> younger children did not predict ball flight as well as older groups. Similarly, children with DCD predicted more poorly at most <b>viewing</b> <b>times</b> compared to their non-DCD peers. Similar results were found for gender in the analysis comparing DCD and non-DCD children. At the early time periods males predict more effectively than females. Thus the data point to the instances where experience is a crucial factor in predicting ball flight...|$|R
