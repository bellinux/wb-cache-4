5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the <b>vegetation</b> and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt <b>vegetation,</b> reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the <b>vegetation</b> recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E
40|$|Cross {{sectional}} echocardiography identified <b>vegetations</b> in 45 of 62 (73 %) {{patients who}} had clinical evidence of active infective endocarditis. The sensitivity of this technique in diagnosing <b>vegetations</b> in infective endocarditis was 93 % and the specificity 89 %. The predictive value of a positive test was 96 % and that of a negative test 80 %. <b>Vegetations</b> were detected with a similar frequency on the aortic and mitral valves. The incidence of valvar incompetence, congestive heart failure, {{and the need for}} surgical intervention was similar in the patients with and without <b>vegetations.</b> Embolism occurred in 47 % of those patients with <b>vegetations</b> and in 12 % of those without. The mortality rate was 27 % in those with <b>vegetations,</b> and no patient without <b>vegetations</b> died. Thus cross sectional echocardiography is accurate in diagnosing <b>vegetations</b> in patients with infective endocarditis, and this finding identifies patients at high risk of embolic complications and death...|$|R
40|$|The {{case reports}} of 186 {{intravenous}} drug abusers admitted over a three year period were studied. Nineteen had proven staphylococcal septicaemia. Echocardiography showed tricuspid <b>vegetations</b> in seven and aortic <b>vegetations</b> in two. Eighteen out of 19 had systolic murmurs, {{but only the}} two patients with aortic <b>vegetations</b> had diastolic murmurs. The chest x ray showed opacities in 10 patients (all those with tricuspid <b>vegetations</b> plus three with normal echocardiograms). Four patients died during follow up, including both those with aortic vegetations; both mitral and tricuspid <b>vegetations</b> were found at necropsy in the other two. All remaining patients were alive at one year. The presence of tricuspid <b>vegetations</b> in intravenous drug abusers is associated with opacities on chest x ray, but carries a good short term prognosis. But these results suggest a poor outcome when left sided endocarditis is present in intravenous drug abusers...|$|R

5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible <b>vegetation</b> that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of <b>vegetation</b> where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, <b>vegetation</b> fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the <b>vegetation</b> graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of <b>vegetation.</b> Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little <b>vegetation</b> besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E
5|$|Despite harsh conditions, the <b>vegetation</b> on {{the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, <b>vegetation</b> has become very thick and has {{resulted}} in it becoming {{a breeding ground for}} waterfowl. There is large reed bed in the small lagoon area.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of M-mode echocardiography in identifying <b>vegetations</b> and the clinical relevance {{of such a}} finding were evaluated in 36 patients with bacterial endocarditis, 18 of whom had pre-existing valvar lesions. Of 22 patients with <b>vegetations</b> demonstrated by echocardiography, 21 had major complications of bacterial endocarditis and eight died, whereas only eight of the 14 patients without detectable <b>vegetations</b> had similar complications and only two died. Nine of the 11 patients with pre-existing valvar lesions and echocardiographic evidence of <b>vegetations</b> came to operation or necropsy, and in eight of these the presence of <b>vegetations</b> was confirmed. In the other, none was found at surgery performed after an interval of six months. M-mode echocardiography can reliably detect <b>vegetations</b> in patients with bacterial endocarditis even {{in the presence of}} pre-existing valvar lesions, and may permit the identification of a subset of high risk patients who may need early surgery...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of blood}} monocytes in the {{attachment}} of streptococci to endocardial <b>vegetations</b> {{was investigated in}} an experimental Streptococcus sanguis endocarditis by depletion of blood monocytes with the cytostatic drug VP 16 - 213 alone and combined with anticoagulant treatment with warfarin sodium. The numbers of streptococci in the <b>vegetations</b> of control, monocytopenic, and monocytopenic/anticoagulated rabbits were comparable. In the <b>vegetations</b> streptococci were found mainly in areas free of phagocytic cells. It is concluded that streptococci {{do not have to}} be phagocytosed by monocytes in the circulation before being deposited on the surface of endocardial <b>vegetations.</b> Even the <b>vegetations</b> of intensively anticoagulated/monocytopenic rabbits showed colonies of streptococci embedded in polymerized fibrin and cellular material, this matrix possibly being held together by streptococcal dextran...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To compare transthoracic and transoesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TTE, TOE) {{in patients with}} permanent pacemaker lead infection and to evaluate the safety of medical extraction in cases of large <b>vegetations.</b>  Methods—TTE and TOE were performed in 23  patients with definite pacemaker lead infection. Seventeen patients without previous infection served as a TOE reference for non-infected leads.  Results—TTE was positive in seven cases (30 %) whereas with TOE three different types of <b>vegetations</b> attached to the leads were visualised in 21  of the 23  cases (91 %). Of the 20  patients with <b>vegetations</b> and lead culture, 17  (85 %) had bacteriologically active infection. Left sided valvar endocarditis was diagnosed in two patients. In the control group, strands were visualised by TOE in five patients, and <b>vegetations</b> in none. Medical extraction of <b>vegetations</b> ⩾  10 mm was performed in 12  patients and was successful in nine (75 %) without clinical pulmonary embolism. After 31. 2  (19. 1) months of follow up (mean (SD)), all patients except one were cured of infection; three died from other causes.  Conclusions—Combined with bacteriological data, <b>vegetations</b> seen on TOE strongly suggest pacemaker lead infection. Normal TTE examinations do not exclude this diagnosis because of its poor sensitivity. Medical extraction of even large <b>vegetations</b> appeared to be safe.    Keywords: pacemaker lead infection;  transoesophageal echocardiograph...|$|R

40|$|A {{main feature}} in the {{pathogenesis}} of bacterial endocarditis is the activation of the coagulation system via the extrinsic pathway, resulting {{in the formation of}} infected endocardial <b>vegetations.</b> Earlier studies gave indirect evidence that monocytes {{play an important role in}} the procoagulant response during the course of the disease. In this study, we assessed the role of monocytes more directly. We compared weights and tissue factor activities (TFA) of endocardial <b>vegetations</b> of normal rabbits infected with Streptococcus sanguis with those of rabbits which were treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide (Vepesid; Bristol-Myers Squibb B. V.) to induce a selective monocytopenia. Furthermore, the importance of the presence of bacteria was determined through the influence of antibiotic treatment on TFA, vegetational weight, and infection of the <b>vegetations.</b> The TFA of the <b>vegetations</b> was measured chromogenically by monitoring the factor VII-dependent activation of factor X with an amidolytic assay for factor Xa. We found that the degree of infection and the weight of <b>vegetations</b> of rabbits treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide did not differ from that of untreated rabbits. Their TFA, however, was significantly lower than the TFA of <b>vegetations</b> of rabbits not treated with etoposide. We also found that, as with the monocytopenic rabbits, the weight of the <b>vegetations</b> was not reduced in penicillin G-treated rabbits. The degree of infection and TFA, however, were significantly lower. We conclude that monocytes indeed are involved in the activation of the coagulation system during the course of bacterial endocarditis and that the degree of infection is positively correlated to the TFA of the <b>vegetations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abnormal echocardiographic {{findings}} in seven cases of bioprosthetic valve endocarditis were confirmed in six at operation. The echocardiograms showed three cases with thickening and increased echo intensity (group 1) and four (group 2) in which <b>vegetations</b> were seen initially without {{either of the}} two features in group 1. Two patients in group 1 had <b>vegetations,</b> the causative organism being a streptococcus. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the causative organism in three of the four cases in group 2; in two of these rapidly growing <b>vegetations</b> were detected. The large <b>vegetations</b> obstructed the ostium of the bioprosthetic valve. Thus if <b>vegetations</b> are detected in cases in which staphylococci are the causative bacteria surgery should be performed as soon as possible. In patients who develop a fever after bioprosthetic valve replacement and especially in those with evident bacteraemia echocardiography should be repeated frequently so that lesions may be detected early...|$|R

40|$|In the Dutch {{province}} of Friesland {{large areas of}} Cirsio-Molinietum <b>vegetations</b> still existed {{in the beginning of}} the 20 th century. Embankment of periodically flooded areas, lowering the water table in these new polders and using fertilizer caused a dramatic decline of this area. Nowadays Cirsio-Molinietum <b>vegetations</b> are extremely rare in the Netherlands and probably in the whole of Western Europe. ‘De blauwgraslanden van Akmarijp’, the largest of the remaining Dutch Cirsio-Molinietum <b>vegetations</b> (c. 100 ha), has from the 1950 ’s on been set aside as a nature reserve. The data in this paper show that the well-developed Carex panicea/Cirsium dissectum dominated Cirsio-Molinietum <b>vegetations</b> of the first half of this century have for the greater part changed into Caricion curtonigrae <b>vegetations</b> dominated by Agrostis canina and Carex nigra. The main reason of this change is the continuing lowering of water tables in the surrounding agricultural areas which in the reserve itself causes a continuing peat mineralisation and acidification of the upper peat layer. Conservation measures have been taken or are under consideration in an effort to preserve a fragment of the once abundant Cirsio-Molinietum <b>vegetations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the <b>vegetation</b> {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain <b>vegetation</b> which is {{susceptible}} to damage from summer grazing. The <b>vegetation</b> structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian <b>vegetation</b> once found along much of the creek.

These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E

5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} <b>vegetation</b> in two {{principal}} ways, <b>vegetation</b> {{can influence the}} deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of <b>vegetation.</b> Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects <b>vegetation</b> in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E
