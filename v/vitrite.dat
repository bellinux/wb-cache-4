30|$|Heidaigou coal is a {{low-rank}} {{bituminous coal}} {{with a high}} ash content. The sulfur content is low and dominated by pyritic sulfur. The Al 2 O 3 content is high while SiO 2 is relatively low in the ash. This results a high ash fusion temperature. The mine {{is located at the}} north edge of the carboniferous-permian coal accumulation basin in Northern China. The vitrinite content is lower than the average of the area while the inertinite and liptinite contents are higher (Han 1996). The dominant vitrinite macerals are telocollinite and desmocollinite. A small amount of telinite is also present. The liptinite group is mainly represented by sporinite, which disperses in the desmocollinite and in the matrix of the inertinite in the bedding direction. Fragmental fusinite usually mixes with semifusinite. The main microlithotypes are <b>vitrite,</b> trimacerite and durite while a small amount of clarite, inertrite and vitrinertite are present. <b>Vitrite</b> is usually uniform while trimacerite is fragmental or of lineation shape. Durite is composed of an inertinite matrix and a clastic texture.|$|E
30|$|Petrographic {{study of}} the Karharbari coal shows that these coals are {{vitrinite}} rich, followed by liptinite and inertinite. Secondary liptinite macerals are observed in significant amount. The microlithotype analysis shows the dominance of <b>vitrite</b> followed by vitrinertite, clarite and inertite. The vitrinite reflectance (Ro) and volatile matter (d.a.f) values rank the Karharbari coal as high volatile bituminous ‘C’ to ‘B’. The microscopic constituents of Karharbari coal indicate peat accumulation in the forest mire under fluctuating oxic to anoxic conditions with good tissue preservation.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study an attempt {{has been made to}} carry out the {{detailed}} petrographic characterization of the Karharbari coals of Talcher coalfield and to reconstruct the paleoenvironment conditions of coal formation using macerals and microlithtotypes as a tool. For these purposes a large number of samples were collected following the pillar sampling method and were subjected to detailed petrographic study. The petrographic observation shows that these coals are vitrinite rich followed by the liptinite and inertinite group of macerals. On microlithotype scale, these coals shows the dominance of the <b>vitrite</b> followed by clarite, vitrinertite and inertite. The concentration of liptite, clarodurite, duroclarite and vitrinertoliptite are insignificant. The vitrinite reflectance ranks the Karharbari coal as high volatile bituminous ‘C’ to high volatile ‘B’ bituminous. Coal petrography based depositional models suggest peat accumulation in forested telmatic swamp. Moreover, during the time of their evolution, there were alternate phases of oxic and anoxic moor conditions with good tissue preservation.|$|E
30|$|In the studied coals, <b>vitrite</b> {{range from}} 13.23  % to 81.29  %, mean 40.68  % (13.57  % to 84.90  %, mean 45.42  % on m.m.f. basis); inertite from 3.40  % to 40.99  %, mean 21.14  % (3.55  % to 44.14  %, mean 22.81  % on m.m.f. basis); liptite from nil to 2.18  %, mean 0.44  % (nil to 2.43  %, mean 0.48  % on m.m.f. basis);Clarite range from 1.95  % to 21.44  %, mean 11.95  % (2.71  % to 25.80  %, mean 13.20  %, on m.m.f. basis); Vitrinertite range from 1.27  % to 13.47  % mean 8.28  % (1.57  % to 14.18  % mean 9.03  %, on m.m.f. basis); Durite range from nil to 24.63  %, mean 8.27  % (nil to 32.04  %, mean 8.91  %, on m.m.f. basis); Duroclarite range from nil to 0.58  %, mean 0.12  % (nil to 0.60  %, mean 0.13  %, on m.m.f. basis).

40|$|The {{major oil}} and gas fields in Australia produce from coal measure sediments, in {{contrast}} to the giant oil fields of the Northern Hemisphere which are associated with the marine rocks. The organic matter in the Australian fields is present both as coal seams and fragments of coaly material dispersed through the adjacent sediments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the organic matter in the coal seams and as dispersed fragments is the same, different or systematically related. The type of organic matter in each may indicate that one is better, or the same, as a source for hydrocarbons. The sedimentary sequences examined are those of the Permian- Triassic Cooper Basin, the Permian Pedirka Basin, the Triassic Simpson Desert Basin, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Eromanga Basin, all of which are located in central Australia. In addition, the relationship of organic matter type to the depositional environment for the Permian sequence in the Cooper Basin was investigated. AH of the studies were carried out using reflected and transmitted light microscopic techniques for analyses of the organic matter. Relationships have been found between the maceral types of the dispersed organic matter (DOM) and the maceral and microlithotypecompositions of the associated coals. Exinite (sporinite) DOM correlates with vitrinite and sporinite in the associated coals in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, Exinite (cutinite) DOM correlates negatively with cutinite in the coal in the Simpson Desert Basin, Sporinite DOM correlates with <b>vitrite</b> plus clarite and intermediate, microlithotypes (duroclarite, clarodurite and vitrinertite) in the coals of the Cooper Basin. Vitrinite DOM correlates with vitrinite and the intermediate microlithotypes in associated coal in the Cooper Basin, and with resinite in the coal of the Eromanga Basin, Inertinite DOM, mostly inertodetrinite, correlates with inertodetrinite and durite plus inertite in the associated coals in the Cooper Basin. The microlithotype compositions of coals formed in association with a large lake environment are distinctly different from the microlithotype compositions of coals formed on the lower coastal plain and in areasdominated by coal swamps in the Permian of the Cooper Basin, Channel belt coals are also distinct in type from those of the lower coastal plain, upper coastal plain and areas dominated by coal swamps. Lower coastal plain coals can be differentiated from upper coastal plain coals on the basis of their microlithotype compositions. Those coals with the highest <b>vitrite</b> plus clarite contents have formed in channel belts and associated with large lakes. Coals with the highest durite plus inertite contents have formed in the areas dominated by coal swamps. Given that exinite is the coal maceral richest in hydrogen, and therefore the best material for generating hydrocarbons, the best source rocks in the Permian of the Cooper Basin are those which have formed in the large lake and channel belt environments. If inertinite has the least potential as a source for hydrocarbons, then the sequences in areas dominated by coal swamps have the lowest potential as source rocks for hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|The Early Permian coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from the Vasse Shelf, southern Perth Basin, located approximately 200 km south- west of Perth. The selected coal samples {{for the study}} were also obtained from the Premier Sub-basin of the Collie Basin and the Irwin Sub-basin of the Perth Basin. The Early Permian coal measures are described as the Sue Coal Measures from the Vasse Shelf, the Ewington Coal Measures from the Premier Sub-basin and the coal measures from the Irwin sub-basin are described as the Irwin River Coal Measures. The Vasse Shelf coal is finely banded and the dominant lithotypes are dull and dull banded types, followed by bright banded and banded types, with minor bright types. The variation of dull and bright lithotypes represents fluctuating conditions of water table level during the growth of peat in the swamp. The maceral composition of the coal is predominantly composed of inertinite, followed by vitrinite and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal is characterized by very low to medium semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, supporting the deposition in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub- bituminous to high volatile bituminous of the Australian classification. In terms of microlithotype group, the predominance of inertite over <b>vitrite</b> suggests the coal was formed under drier conditions with high degree of oxidation during its deposition. On the basis of the interpretations of lithotypes, macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements, the depositional environment of the coal is braided and meandering deltaic-river system without any brackish or marine influence. The maceral composition of the Collie coal predominantly consists of inertinite and vitrinite, with low exinite and mineral matter. The very low to low semifusinite ratio and low to medium vitrinite content of ++the coal indicate that the coal was formed under aerobic dry to wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is categorized as sub-bituminous according to the Australian classification. The domination of inertite and durite over <b>vitrite</b> and clarite contents in the coal reflects the deposition under drier conditions with fluctuations in the water table. On the basis of the interpretations of macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements distribution, the depositional environment of the coal is lacustrine, braided to meandering fluvial system, without the influence of any marine influx. The maceral composition of the Irwin River coal consists predominantly of vitrinite and inertinite, and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal has very low semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, suggesting the coal was deposited in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub-bituminous of the Australian classification. The predominance of <b>vitrite</b> and clarite over inertite and durite contents in the coal indicates that the coal was formed in wetter conditions and in high water covers with a low degree of oxidation. Based on macerals and microlithotypes contents, the depositional environment of the coal is braided fluvial to deltaic, which is in accordance with the interpreted non- marine and mixed marine environment of deposition in the sub-basin. The petrological comparisons of Vasse Shelf, Collie and Irwin River coals show that the average vitrinite content of the Irwin River coal is highest (49. 1 %) and of the Collie coal is lowest (37. 3 %) of the three. The inertinite content is highest in Collie coal (49. 1 %), followed by Vasse Shelf (46. 4 %) and Irwin River (39. 2 %) coals. The exinite content is low in Irwin River coal (6. 3 %) as compared with Vasse Shelf (9. 0 °/,) and Collie (8. 3 %) coals. The mineral matter content ++is relatively low for all the three coals. The rank of the Vasse Shelf coal is high as compared with the Collie and Irwin River coals, either due to tectonic uplift after the deposition in post-Permian in the southern Perth Basin, or due to the average depth of burial over Vasse Shelf which is much greater than that of Collie and Irwin River coals. The comparisons of the coal from Western Australia with the selected Gondwana coals show that the predominance of inertinite over vitrinite occurs in the Western Australian coals (Vasse Shelf and Collie Basin). On the other hand, the Brazilian, eastern Australian, Indian and Western Australian (Irwin Sub-basin) coals are dominated by vitrinite over inertinite. The exinite content is highest in the Indian coals and lowest in the eastern Australian coals. The mineral matter content is highest in the Brazilian and Indian coals, and lowest in Western Australian (Vasse Shelf) and eastern Australian (Sydney Basin) coals. The rank of the coals ranges from sub- bituminous to medium volatile bituminous according to the Australian classification...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that typical coalbed gases (methane and carbon dioxide) are sorbed (both adsorbed and absorbed) {{in the coal}} matrix causing it to swell and resulting in local stress and strain variations in a coalbed confined under overburden pressure. The swelling, interactions of gases within the coal matrix and the resultant changes in the permeability, sorption, gas flow mechanics in the reservoir, and stress state of the coal can impact a number of reservoir-related factors. These include effective production of coalbed methane, degasification of future mining areas by drilling horizontal and vertical degasification wells, injection of CO 2 as an enhanced coalbed methane recovery technique, and concurrent CO 2 sequestration. Such information can also provide {{an understanding of the}} mechanisms behind gas outbursts in underground coal mines. The spatiotemporal volumetric strains in a consolidated Pittsburgh seam coal sample were evaluated while both confining pressure and carbon dioxide (C 02) pore pressure were increased to keep a constant positive effective stress on the sample. The changes intemal to the sample were evaluated by maps of density and atomic number determined by dual-energy X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT). Early-time images, as soon as CO 2 was introduced, were also used to calculate the macro porosity in the coal sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photographic images of the polished section of the coal sample at X-ray CT image location were used to identify the microlitho types and microstructures. The CO 2 sorption-associated swelling and volumetric strains in consolidated coal under constant effective stress are heterogeneous processes depending on the litho types present. In the time scale of the experiment, <b>vitrite</b> showed the highest degree of swelling due to dissolution of CO 2, while the clay (kaolinite) and inertite region was compressed in response. The volumetric strains associated with swelling and compression were between 21 15...|$|E
40|$|The Early Jurassic coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from CRA Exploration Pty Ltd. (CRAE), drilled in the Gairdner and Mintaja Blocks, Gairdner Range of the Hill River Area, northern Perth Basin, Western Australia. The area is located approximately 280 km north of Perth. The coal measures subcrop in a half- graben bounded by the Lesueur-Peron Fault in the west, and the Warradarge Fault in the east. The coal occurs within the shallow sequence of the Cattamarra Member which is also described as the Cattamarra Coal Measures of the Cockleshell Gully Formation. Six sub-seams of seam G, namely G 1 to G 6, from the six drill cores, were examined for petrological and geochemical investigation. The coal predominantly comprises of banded, dull banded, and dull lithotypes, with minor bright banded, bright and fusainous types. Based on maceral analyses, the dominant maceral groups are vitrinite and inertinite, whilst the exinite and mineral matter are in minor contents. The vitrinite content has a range between 47. 2 % to 73. 0 %, and it is composed mainly of telocollinite and desmocollinite. The inertinite is dominated by semifusinite, fusinite, and inertodetrinite, {{and it has a}} range from 10. 4 % to 24. 8 %. The exinite group varies between 7. 2 % to 20. 8 % in content, and it is represented by sporinite, cutinite, alginite and resinite. The mineral matter dominated by clays and pyrite, ranges between 4. 5 % to 20. 6 %. The microlithotype analyses shows that the <b>vitrite</b> plus clarite content varies from 47. 0 % to 70. 0 %, intermediates between 8. 0 % to 26. 0 %, whilst inertite plus durite content is relatively low, varying from 6. 55 % to 14. 0 %. The maximum reflectance of vitrinite has a value between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 %, which represents rank at sub-bituminous level based on the Australian rank values and corresponding to the sub-bituminous A and B rank of the ASTM classification and to the metalignitous type of the Pareek classification. On the basis of carbon and hydrogen content, the coal is categorised as per-hydrous meta- to ortho-lignitous type. The trace elements As, B, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, V, Y, Zn, and Zr, are spectrographically analysed in the coal ash. The B content in the coal supports the presence of marine influence during peat deposition in the basin. On the basis of lithotype, maceral, microlithotype, trace element distribution, pyrite and total sulphur in the coal, the depositional environment for coal and the coal measures, is interpreted as an upper to lower delta type within a regressive phase of marine transgression...|$|E
