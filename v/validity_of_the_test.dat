25|$|Although the Exner Scoring System (developed {{since the}} 1960s) {{claims to have}} {{addressed}} and often refuted many criticisms of the original testing system with an extensive body of research, some researchers continue to raise questions. The areas of dispute include the objectivity of testers, inter-rater reliability, the verifiability and general <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> bias of the test's pathology scales towards greater numbers of responses, {{the limited number of}} psychological conditions which it accurately diagnoses, the inability to replicate the test's norms, its use in court-ordered evaluations, and the proliferation of the ten inkblot images, potentially invalidating the test for those who have been exposed to them.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with any}} use of {{mathematical}} models, {{it is important}} to assess the fit of the data to the model. [...] If item misfit with any model is diagnosed as due to poor item quality, for example confusing distractors in a multiple-choice test, then the items may be removed from that test form and rewritten or replaced in future test forms. If, however, a large number of misfitting items occur with no apparent reason for the misfit, the construct <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> will need to be reconsidered and the test specifications may need to be rewritten. Thus, misfit provides invaluable diagnostic tools for test developers, allowing the hypotheses upon which test specifications are based to be empirically tested against data.|$|E
2500|$|The {{testing for}} vWD can be {{influenced}} by laboratory procedures. Numerous variables exist in the testing procedure that may affect the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> results and {{may result in a}} missed or erroneous diagnosis. The chance of procedural errors are typically greatest during the preanalytical phase (during [...] collecting storage and transportation of the specimen) especially when the testing is contracted to an outside facility and the specimen is frozen and transported long distances. Diagnostic errors are not uncommon, and the rate of testing proficiency varies amongst laboratories, with error rates ranging from 7 to 22% in some studies to as high as 60% in cases of misclassification of vWD subtype. To increase the probability of a proper diagnosis, testing should be done at a facility with immediate on-site processing in a specialized coagulation laboratory.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, BAC may be {{measured}} by police using three methods - blood, breath, or urine. For law enforcement purposes, breath is the preferred method, since results are available almost instantaneously. <b>The</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> equipment/methods and mathematical relationships for <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> breath and blood alcohol have been criticized. Improper testing and equipment calibration is often used in defense of a DUI or DWI.

5000|$|Some {{people use}} the term face {{validity}} to refer only to the validity of a test to observers who are not expert in testing methodologies. For instance, if a test is designed to measure whether children are good spellers, and parents are asked whether the test is a good test, this measures the face <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> If an expert is asked instead, some people would argue that this does not measure face validity. This distinction seems too careful for most applications. Generally, face validity means that the test [...] "looks like" [...] it will work, as opposed to [...] "has been shown to work".|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, a {{legal case}} on the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> oath reached the state Court of Appeals in Columbia. Attorney Robert Barnwell Rhett, of Beaufort, argued for the test oath {{with the support of}} state Governor Robert Y. Hayne. In opposition, the Unionist Petigru was joined by {{business}} attorney Abram Blanding of Columbia, and Thomas Smith Grimké of Charleston. The June 2nd, 1834 decision from the three judges fell 2 to 1 for the Unionists. [...] "Nullifiers" [...] immediately called for the impeachment of the two jurists. [...] "Nullifier" [...] legislators responded to the decision by calling for a constitutional amendment to legalize the test oath and assert the primacy of allegiance to South Carolina.

5000|$|Face {{validity}} is {{the extent}} to which a test is subjectively viewed as covering the concept it purports to measure. It refers to the transparency or relevance of a test as it appears to test participants. In other words, a test can be said to have face validity if it [...] "looks like" [...] it is going to measure what it is supposed to measure. For instance, if a test is prepared to measure whether students can perform multiplication, and the people to whom it is shown all agree that it looks like a good test of multiplication ability, this demonstrates face <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> Face validity is often contrasted with content validity and construct validity.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article.

The study also examined the face validity, reliability and predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> achievement <b>tests</b> administered at Zonguldak Karaelmas University Preparatory School. The instruments employed in this study were two questionnaires and C- (beginner) level students’ test scores. First, instructors and students were given questionnaires to define <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> face <b>validity</b> and reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> achievement <b>tests.</b> Second, <b>the</b> correlations between students’ first term averages, second term averages, cumulative averages and the end-of-course assessment scores were examined to find <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> predictive <b>validity.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> data revealed that face validity does not contradict with more objective measures of tests, such as reliability and predictive validity. However, face validity and reliability analyses revealed some important weaknesses in <b>the</b> local <b>testing</b> system.
