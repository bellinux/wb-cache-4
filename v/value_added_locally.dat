40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} structural changes {{on the distribution of}} net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and the difference between net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and agricultural income over time. We present and discuss the changes in the distribution of net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> (land, labor, capital, and farm income) over time. Net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> by U.

The inequality (dispersion) of net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> increased over time. The increased inequality in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> represented both increases in regional dispersion in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and increases in the average inequality in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in each region. Thus, the net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is becoming less alike across the United States.

This article examines current literature on <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statements in two areas: {{the usefulness of the}} <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement in South Africa and the relevance of social accounting theories in explaining its continued disclosure in South African listed companies’ annual reports. It also reports the results of a questionnaire survey addressed to preparers of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statements. The research studies examined in the literature review indicate that legitimacy theory is more likely to provide an explanation for the disclosure of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statements in annual reports in South Africa. The results of the empirical survey indicate {{that the majority of the}} respondents are of the opinion that it is desirable to prepare a <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement, but that it is not used in the majority of companies. Furthermore, the reasons advanced by the preparers for the desirability of the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement provide some evidence that legitimacy theory may be behind the propensity of companies to publish a <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement.

Three methods of calculating real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> are considered; the Laspeyres double-deflation method recommended by the Utzired Nations System of Nation Accounts, the commonly used single-deflation method, and the double-deflation Divisia method. Actual data are employed to clarify and illustrate the issues involved, and the paper concludes with a recommenda-tion for an appropriate index to use when calculating industry real <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Real <b>value</b> <b>added</b> is the key to understanding the contribution of the primary inputs, the economies of scale, and technical change in the production process.

This paper studies the impact of financial bootstrapping on the level of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> at particular points in time and growth in <b>value</b> <b>added</b> across time. We use a longitudinal database comprising data from both questionnaires and financial accounts of 214 new ventures.

We use the Theil Measure of Inequality (TMI) to compare and explain changes in 1) the between and within-region distribution of net <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> and 2) changes {{in the distribution of}} factor shares of net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in Canada and in the U.

Results show that in Canada (1960 - 2000), net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> has become somewhat more equally distributed relative to the number of farms per province, but has varied widely from 1972 - 1988. Between-region inequality in net <b>value</b> <b>added</b> accounted for from 0. 5 to 85. 5 percent of this inequality from 1960 - 2000. In the U. S.

In addition research investigating the predictive ability of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> information has been conducted in the USA since 1990, even though the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement has not been published there. The research reported in this paper sets out to establish whether the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement is a disclosure worth considering by companies around the world, by investigating the South African experience with the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement. The social accounting theories of organisational legitimacy and political costs were found to be best suited to explain why the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement is published. Surveys among the companies publishing the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement indicated that management had the employees in mind when they published this information. However, a survey among users has indicated that very little use has been made of the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement. The main reason for this seems to be that the unregulated nature of the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement allows for inconsistencies in disclosures, which eventually caused users to suspect bias in the reports. The USA evidence that the information has additional predictive power is not confirmed by a South African study, and is complicated by the limited additional information contained in the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement. The South African experience with the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> statement does not make a convincing case for publication.

In addition, we analyze the geography of <b>value</b> <b>added</b> in each case. We also study how the exchange rate fluctuations affect {{the distribution of the}} <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Our results show that the researched company creates 36 % of the total <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> when the bicycle is made in its plant. The manufacturing creates 16 % of the total <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> The researched company creates 27 - 28 % of the total <b>value</b> <b>added,</b> when the production is outsourced. The <b>value</b> <b>added</b> share of Finland is 67 %, when the bicycle is produced in Finland, and 58 - 59 %, if the production is outsourced. In conclusion, the results show that outsourcing offshore is financially beneficial for the researched company and that the Finnish economy suffers from the production transfer. Furthermore, the results suggest that transferring the production away from Asia is financially and otherwise justifiable - however, the production is transferred to the Baltic countries instead of Finland. Our findings support the view that, while the low <b>value</b> <b>added</b> activities and processes are outsourced, the high <b>value</b> <b>added</b> activities are still positioned to Finland, since the outsourcing partners create only 2 % of the total <b>value</b> <b>added...</b>|$|R

40|$|As {{domestic}} exports usually require imported inputs, {{the value}} of exports differs from the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in exports. The higher the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in exports, the higher the domestic national income created by exports will be. In this case, exports will expand the domestic market. Therefore, exports will push economic growth in two ways: through their direct effect on aggregate demand, and through their effect on the domestic market. For these reasons, the estimate {{of the magnitude of}} the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in exports helps explain the capacity of exports to lead economic growth. Domestic exports may be classified as direct and indirect exports. Direct exports are the goods sold to other countries; indirect exports are the domestically produced inputs incorporated in direct exports. The distinction between direct and indirect exports leads to a distinction between direct and indirect domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in exports. The income of the factors directly involved in the production of exports constitutes direct domestic value added; the income contained in domestically produced inputs incorporated into exports constitutes the indirect domestic <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Therefore, the magnitude of indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> depends on the density of the domestic intersectorial linkages. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an estimation of the domestic indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in Mexico's manufacturing exports in two ways. The first derives from the fact that a direct exporting sector may be the vehicle through which other sectors export in an indirect way; this leads us to estimate the indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in exports by sector of origin. The second refers to the destination of this indirect <b>value</b> <b>added</b> - that is, to the direct exporting sectors in which the <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in indirect exports of each sector appears. Based on the input-output table for Mexico (National Institute of Statistics and Geography-INEGI 2008), we estimate the domestic <b>value</b> <b>added</b> contained in inputs used to produce Mexican manufacturing exports.
