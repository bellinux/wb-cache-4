25|$|Although not {{themselves}} sources of law, Anglo-Saxon charters are a most valuable historical source for tracing the actual legal {{practices of the}} various Anglo-Saxon communities. A charter was a written document from a king or other authority confirming a grant either of land or some other <b>valuable</b> <b>right.</b> Their prevalence in the Anglo-Saxon state {{is a sign of}} sophistication. They were frequently appealed to and relied upon in litigation. Making grants and confirming those made by others was a major way in which Anglo-Saxon kings demonstrated their authority.|$|E
60|$|As Redclyffe gave vent to this doctrine, {{which was}} not {{naturally}} his, but which had been the inculcation of a life, hitherto devoted to politics, {{he was surprised to}} find how strongly sensible he became of the ugliness and indefensibleness of what he said. He {{felt as if he were}} speaking under the eye of Omniscience, and as if every word he said were weighed, and its emptiness detected, by an unfailing intelligence. He had thought that he had volumes to say about the necessity of consenting not to do right in all matters minutely, for the sake of getting out an available and <b>valuable</b> <b>right</b> as the whole; but there was something that seemed to tie his tongue. Could it be the quiet gaze of this old man, so unpretending, so humble, so simple in aspect? He could not tell, only that he faltered, and finally left his speech in the midst.|$|E

I have inspired confidence in a man of wealth and position. You seem to think this perfectly natural--do you? Well, I don't know. I don't know why I have; but it is a fact.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to create a}} manual for people who account for <b>valuable</b> <b>rights</b> and {{research}} and development in accordance with Czech legislation. The first part defines the terms intangible assets, fixed assets, research and development, <b>valuable</b> <b>rights,</b> capital improvements and goodwill. The second part specifies <b>valuable</b> <b>rights,</b> especially copyrights, patents, utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, know-how and domain names. This part is also focused on a valuation in owner's accounting, market valuation and valuation during business combinations, accounting for acquisition, amortization and decommissioning of <b>valuable</b> <b>rights.</b> The thesis mentions basic differences between accounting and tax legislation and between Czech and international accounting standards. The third part deals with research and development. Research and development is the driving force of the civilization and progress of whole society. It is evaluated most frequently by yield-based valuation methods, exceptionally by market or cost-based methods. It is supported by the state through grants, subsidies or tax reliefs. It is amortized by time or performance-based methods. The practical part deals with accounting for research and development and <b>valuable</b> <b>rights</b> in corporation when launching a new product...|$|R

An answer deduced from the decided cases is not in all respects as certain and satisfactory as one might anticipate. Perhaps it is not too much to say that the answer is problematical.

5000|$|As fiefs were {{originally}} granted by William the Conqueror {{as a reward}} for past service, there was no logical reason in feudal terms why the tenant's heir should take up the fief without himself having provided the king with some similar valuable past service. The payment of a fine for such [...] "relief" [...] can thus be seen within the logic of feudalism as payment in-lieu of such past service. Thus the right to inherit a fief was akin to a pre-emption right: the king would re-grant the fief to the heir in priority to a third party, so long as the heir paid his fine. This was a <b>valuable</b> <b>right</b> as the heir was more expert in the exploitation of the fief in question than of any other comparable estate of land, for example he was aware through experience of its optimal cropping rotation based on its differing soil-types and micro-climates, and he had available a local work-force loyal to his family.|$|E

For most of that time he held two prebends of St. Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton: rural Hatherton, near Cannock, and Monmore, which included the growing town of Bilston. At Badger, communion was celebrated only five times a year. In 1780, after the death of Hartshorn, Browne had Dr. James Chelsum, a minor scholar, installed. Two years later, Chelsum added to his benefice at Badger the rectory of Droxford in Hampshire, and a chaplaincy at Lathbury in Buckinghamshire. He also took on numerous preaching posts, publishing his sermons. Although Browne must initially have trusted Chelsum, he clearly became disenchanted and arranged for his departure in 1795. Chelsum retained his other benefices until he died insane in 1801.
