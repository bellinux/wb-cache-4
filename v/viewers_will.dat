25|$|One's first {{impressions}} {{are affected by}} {{whether he or she}} is alone or with any number of people. Joint experiences are more globally processed (see global precedence for more on processing), as in collectivist cultures. Global processing emphasizes {{first impressions}} more because the collective first impression tends to remain stable over time. Solo experiences tend to facilitate local processing, causing the viewer to take a more critical look at the target. Thus, individuals {{are more likely to have}} negative first impressions than groups of two or more viewers of the same target. At the same time, individuals are more likely to experience an upward trend over the course of a series of impressions, e.g. individual <b>viewers</b> <b>will</b> like the final episode of a TV season more than the first even if it is really the same quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{life of a}} CFL is {{significantly}} shorter if it is turned on and off frequently. In {{the case of a}} 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan of some CFLs may be reduced to that of incandescent light bulbs. The U.S. Energy Star program suggests that fluorescent lamps be left on when leaving a room for less than 15 minutes to mitigate this problem. CFLs produce less light later in their lives than when they are new. The light output decay is exponential, with the fastest losses being soon after the lamp is first used. By the end of their lives, CFLs can be expected to produce 70–80% of their original light output. The response of the human eye to light is logarithmic. That is, while the human eye is highly sensitive to changes in the intensity of faint light sources, it is less sensitive to changes in the intensity of brighter light sources since the pupils compensate by dilating or constricting. So, presuming the illumination provided by the lamp was ample at the beginning of its life, and the light output of a bulb gradually decreases by 25%, <b>viewers</b> <b>will</b> perceive a much smaller change in light intensity.|$|E

After airing the special, Wham City featured the skit for their comedy tour of New York City. Resnick informed Network Awesome that they will probably not produce any more fake infomercials, and that O'Brien {{is working with the}} network to create something that <b>viewers</b> <b>will</b> [...] "stumble on unintentionally." ...|$|E
500|$|Series {{producer}} Richard Stokes {{believes that}} the series' popularity {{stems from the fact}} the hospital setting presents numerous plotline opportunities, explaining: [...] "You have licence to create life-and-death situations every week, something you cannot do in any other set piece. The interaction of the characters can be sexy and social issues also permeate the writing. But, basically, hospital drama is successful because the <b>viewers</b> <b>will</b> forgive all the yukky bits for the wonder of a life saved." [...] The focus of the series has developed since its conception, expanding to cover extra wards, including a gynaecology ward, an acute assessment unit and a maternity ward. When the maternity ward and a special care baby unit were introduced during series four, Young explained that new wards were necessary to allow the crew to rotate sets, maximising filming potential.|$|E

50|$|Imagine {{that the}} true {{rotation}} of a four-spoke wheel is clockwise. The first instance of visibility of the wheel may occur when one spoke is at 12 o'clock. If {{by the time the}} next instance of visibility occurs, the spoke previously at 9 o'clock has moved into the 12-o'clock position, then a <b>viewer</b> <b>will</b> perceive the wheel to be stationary. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 11:30 position, then a <b>viewer</b> <b>will</b> perceive the wheel to be rotating backwards. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 12:30 position, then a <b>viewer</b> <b>will</b> perceive the wheel to be rotating forwards, however more slowly than the wheel is actually rotating. The effect relies on a motion perception property called beta movement: motion is seen between two objects in different positions in the visual field at different times providing the objects are similar (which is true of spoked wheels—each spoke is essentially identical to the others) and providing the objects are close (which is true of the originally 9-o'clock spoke in the second instant—it is closer to 12 o'clock than the originally 12-o'clock spoke).|$|R

We're delighted to welcome the Ferreiras to Albert Square and I'm sure the <b>viewers</b> <b>will</b> be too." [...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. I thought we were short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted.

Through the use of prismatic photography, the [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] segment also shows Harrison's [...] "image refracted as if seen through a fly's eye", according to author Alan Clayson, who describes the scene as mirroring [...] "the requisite misty atmosphere" [...] suggested by the recording. In its preview of Magical Mystery Tour in 1967, the NME highlighted the segment {{as one of the}} film's [...] "extremely clever" [...] musical sequences, saying: [...] "For 'Blue Jay Way' George is seen sitting cross-legged in a sweating mist which materialises into a variety of shapes and patterns.

500|$|The {{visual effects}} were {{done by the}} Vancouver-based Image Engine.

Savela intended the visual effects to top the minute-long sequence of the Horizon missiles firing to the Asuran homeworld in the season three finale [...] "First Strike". The sequence was reportedly so complicated {{that for the first time}} in the series, models were used to physically map out the action before creating the initial animatics. Gero later stated that the episode had a battle sequence that [...] "we will not be able to top. It is the greatest special effects sequence that the show has ever done."

500|$|It Takes a Church has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, {{arguing that it}} may even attract a secular audience: [...] "Even secular <b>viewers</b> <b>will</b> be curious to see which one Angela picks, and they’ll get a glimpse into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, will watch It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series [...] "utterly frivolous," [...] and called into question the [...] "state of America's spiritual health" [...] after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a {{not much more than}} a [...] "desperate" [...] effort to find something the conservative Christian audience will watch.

We go more into the relationships, how it affects people around". Steele backed this up, saying [...] "We wanted gay to be part of Chris's character, not Chris to be the gay character. He's not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like to play up. He's on the basketball team, he's had a girlfriend for a time, and I think the show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|E
500|$|Michael Dunne {{analyzed}} the episode {{in his book}} American Film Musical Themes and Forms, and gave examples from it while explaining that singing and dancing performances are generally not seen as acceptable in the television medium. He notes that Homer calls singing [...] "fruity" [...] and [...] "the lowest form of communication" [...] during the episode. However, Dunne also notes the fact that Homer himself sings [...] "his objection that musicals are fake and phony". Dunne describes the frame narrative as establishing Marge as [...] "more favorably disposed toward musicals than the males in her house". Dunne concluded that [...] "musicals {{come out on top}} in this episode, but the victory is marginal at best". Of the episode itself, Dunne wrote that [...] "the parodies contained in the show demonstrate that its creators are familiar enough with various forms of musical performance to echo them and confident enough that their <b>viewers</b> <b>will</b> catch the references".|$|E
