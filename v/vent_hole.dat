500|$|About 07:40, Tecumseh {{attempted}} to close with the Tennessee by {{passing through the}} minefield, but struck a [...] "torpedo" [...] and capsized within 90 seconds. Manhattan continued to engage the fort until all but the last pair of wooden ships had cleared the obstacles. She closed {{to a range of}} about [...] from the Confederate ironclad and began firing with her one operable gun; a flake of iron had fallen into the <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> of one of her guns and was jammed in place. One of her shots hit the Tennessee and broke the armor and its wooden backing so that daylight was visible through the side of the casemate. The shot failed to penetrate, and netting laid {{on the inside of the}} backing caught all of the splinters so that no one was injured. During the battle Manhattan fired a total of 11 shots, six at Tennessee and five at Fort Morgan. Nicholson claimed four hits, including the shot that broke the Tennessees steering chains and another that jammed her stern gun port shutter in the closed position. The monitor was hit nine times during the battle, but sustained no significant damage or casualties.|$|E

60|$|A tin vessel of {{the shape}} {{shown in the}} sketch, and {{large enough to hold}} a quart, is, I believe, the easiest to carry, the cleanest, and the most durable of small water-vessels. The curve in its shape is to allow of its {{accommodating}} itself {{to the back of the}} man who carries it. The tin loops at its sides are to admit the strap by which it is to be slung, and which passes through the loops underneath the bottom of the vessel, so that the weight may rest directly upon the strap. Lastly, the vessel has a pipette for drinking through, and a larger hole by which it is to be filled, and which at other times is stopped with a cork or wooden plug. When drinking out of the pipette, the cork must be loosened in order to admit air, like a <b>vent</b> <b>hole.</b> Macintosh bags, for wine or water, are very convenient to carry and they will remain water-tight for a long period when fairly used. (Mem.--Oil and grease are as fatal to macintosh as they are to iron rust.) But the taste that these vessels impart to their contents is abominable, not only at first but for a very long time; in two-thirds of them it is never to be got rid of. Never believe shopkeepers in an india-rubber shop, in their assurances to the contrary; they are incompetent to judge aright, for their senses seem vitiated by the air they live in. The best shape for a small macintosh water-vessel has yet to be determined. Several alpine men use them; and their most recent patterns may probably best be seen at Carter's, Alpine Outfitter, Oxford Street. A flask of dressed hide (pig, goat, or dog) with a wooden nozzle, and a wooden plug to fit into it, is very good. Canvas bags, smeared with grease on the outside, will become nearly waterproof after a short soaking. A strong glass flask may be made out of a soda-water bottle; it should have raw hide shrunk upon it to preserve it from sharp taps Likely to make a crack. Calabashes and other gourds, cocoa-nuts and ostrich eggs, are all of them excellent for flasks. The Bushmen of South Africa make great use of ostrich shells as water-vessels. They have stations at many places in the desert, where they bury these shells filled with water, corked with grass, and occasionally waxed over. They thus go without hesitation over wide tracts, for their sense of locality is so strong that they never fear to forget the spot in which they have dug their hiding-place.|$|E

For comb-style helmets, the crest, which has <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> incorporated into the design, is also fixed by prongs or simply glued into place at the top end of the comb. For all helmet styles, two <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> are punched {{on both sides of the}} helmet and fitted with black metal grommets, making a total of four <b>vent</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Polypropylene {{is one of}} the {{thermoplastic}} {{that can}} be used undergo thermoforming process. Thermoforming process is a process that changes form of thermoplastic sheet from flat surface to dimensional shape. There are three types of thermoforming process. In this project, vacuum process had been chosen to change the shape of flat thermoplastic sheet. Thermoplastic can be formed any shape by undergo heating process using specific heat temperature and its can return to the solid shape upon cooling. Polypropylene (PP) had been choose to be main raw material to form plastic container. The properties of PP sheet are lower density, higher softening point depend on thickness and good resist to fatigue issue. Therefore, the main objective on this project is to prepare plastic container using own fabricated thermoforming machine. Preparation of the design container, design and fabricate mould is the main important process to form a good container. Temperature and number of <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> are the parameter that had been set to know the different of each container. The result shows that temperature 155 °C is an ideal temperature for 0. 5 mm PP sheet and 4 <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> will get a good appearance result than 1 <b>vent</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|R

With the help of SAM treatment, the operating voltage is lowered from 30 volts to 13 volts. The load deflection method is then used to measure the effective thickness of the composite diaphragm. The flexible parylene diaphragm can be deflected up to 100 μm when 150 Torr of pressure is applied. The result is fitted into a theoretical model and yields an effective thickness of 5. 9 μm, which is agreeable with the actual thickness of 5. 6 μm, thus proves the functionality of the device...|$|R
