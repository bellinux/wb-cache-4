40|$|Abstract How does {{describing}} a previously <b>viewed</b> <b>picture</b> affect our memory for it? Does verbalisation affect our eye movements {{even when the}} picture has disappeared? When viewing a photograph, the sequences of eye movements we make (‘scanpaths’) are influenced by both bottom-up visual saliency and top-down cognitive knowledge. Recognition memory is enhanced and the similarity of scanpaths at encoding and recognition is greater for domain-specific pictures. A similarity in scanpaths is also observed during imagery but to a greatly reduced degree. This study explored whether scanpath similarity could be improved by verbalising one’s memory of the picture and whether the previously observed domain-specific advantage was still present when no bottom-up information was available. Specialists and controls were shown a set of photographs, and after each one had to either visualise it or describe it from memory. The stimuli were complex scenes, half of which contained a domain-specific object. Recognition accuracy was increased by post-stimulus verbalisation, and specialists demonstrated an advantage for stimuli that contained domain-relevant information. Saliency influenced both verbal feedback and eye movements but was moderated by domain expertise. Scanpaths were more similar when pictures were described compared to when imagined, and specialists produced more simila...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{suffering}} from obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) {{are characterized by}} dysregulated neuronal processing of disorder-specific and also unspecific affective stimuli. In the present study, we investigated whether generic fear-inducing, disgust-inducing, and neutral stimuli can be decoded from brain patterns of single fMRI time samples of individual OCD patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, we tested whether differences in the underlying encoding provide information to classify subjects into groups (OCD patients or healthy controls). Two pattern classification analyses were conducted. In analysis 1, we used a classifier to decode the category of a currently <b>viewed</b> <b>picture</b> from extended fMRI patterns of single time samples (TR = 3 s) in individual subjects for several pairs of categories. In analysis 2, we used a searchlight approach to predict subjects' diagnostic status based on local brain patterns. In analysis 1, we obtained significant accuracies for the separation of fear-eliciting from neutral pictures in OCD patients and healthy controls. Separation of disgust-inducing from neutral pictures was significant in healthy controls. In analysis 2, we identified diagnostic information {{for the presence of}} OCD in the orbitofrontal cortex, and in the caudate nucleus. Accuracy obtained in these regions was 100 % (p < 10 − 6). To summarize our findings, by using multivariate pattern classification techniques we were able to identify neurobiological markers providing reliable diagnostic information about OCD. The classifier-based fMRI paradigms proposed here might be integrated in future diagnostic procedures and treatment concepts...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the role of picture books in cultivation of reading culture among Nigerian children and the implications for developing leadership qualities. Reading has been {{recognized as one of}} the most valuable legacy that can be handed down to children. This study placed emphasis on early introduction of children to reading using picture books. It <b>viewed</b> <b>picture</b> books as powerful, and compelling tools which have inviting influence on children, thus, making them want to read more than they would ordinarily do. The study further posited that picture books can assist children develop socially, personally, intellectually, culturally and aesthetically. Factors militating against the use of picture books for the promotion of reading culture in Nigeria were identified as poor implementation of government policies, high cost of publishing, ignorance on the part of parents about the value of picture books, lack of enabling environment for publishers to publish quality picture books, lack of available libraries in Nigeria’s nursery and primary schools among others. Recommendations include: that the Government should lead the reading promotion and awareness campaign, that government should reduce or remove import duties on printed materials, professional librarians should advocate for libraries and lead a campaign against nursery and primary schools that do not have libraries. Lastly, picture books should be used to teach children acceptable values of our society, while at the same time teaching against unacceptable or unwanted values in the societ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} how visual food cues are {{encoded in}} reward related brain areas and whether this encoding might provide information {{to differentiate between}} patients suffering from eating disorders [binge-eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN) ], overweight controls (C-OW), and normal-weight controls (C-NW). Participants passively viewed pictures of food stimuli and neutral stimuli in a cue reactivity design. Two classification analyses were conducted. First, we used multivariate pattern recognition techniques to decode the category of a currently <b>viewed</b> <b>picture</b> from local brain activity patterns. In the second analysis, we applied an ensemble classifier to predict the clinical status of subjects (BED, BN, C-OW, and C-NW) based on food-related brain response patterns. The left insular cortex separated between food and neutral contents in all four groups. Patterns in the right insular cortex provided a maximum diagnostic accuracy for the separation of BED patients and C-NW (86 % accuracy, P < 10 − 5, 82 % sensitivity, and 90 % specificity) as well as BN patients and C-NW (78 % accuracy, P = 0. 001, 86 % sensitivity, and 70 % specificity). The right ventral striatum separated maximally between BED patients and C-OW (71 % accuracy, P = 0. 013, 59 % sensitivity, and 82 % specificity). The right lateral orbitofrontal cortex separated maximally between BN patients and C-OW (86 % accuracy, P < 10 − 4, 79 % sensitivity, and 94 % specificity). The best differential diagnostic separation between BED and BN patients was obtained in the left ventral striatum (84 % accuracy, P < 10 − 3, 82 % sensitivity, and 86 % specificity). Our results indicate that pattern recognition techniques are able {{to contribute to a}} reliable differential diagnosis of BN and BED...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive biases in {{attention}} to emotional stimuli in an ethnically diverse sample of dysphoric and non-dysphoric college students were explored. The present study advanced the literature by using ecologically valid eye movement data to assess attention. We hypothesized that dysphoric participants would orient their {{attention to}}ward sad faces {{more quickly than}} the students without dysphoria. We also hypothesized that the dysphoric participants would sustain their attention on sad faces longer than the non-dysphoric participants. Caucasian and Latino undergraduate students were categorized into dysphoric (n = 30) and non-dysphoric (n = 36 based depressive symptom endorsement on the BDI-II (non-dysphoric: BDI-II ≤ 6, dysphoric: BDI-II ≥ 14). Eye movements were recorded with an eye-tracking device while the students <b>viewed</b> <b>picture</b> pairs of faces expressing sadness, happiness, or no emotion. The task consisted of 48 face pairs presented twice {{for a total of}} 96 trials. Consistent with the literature, dysphoric participants showed a negative bias in duration when sad faces were paired with neutral faces, but not when they were paired to happy faces. Dysphoric participants were not more likely to initially orient toward sad faces and when they did, latency was not significantly shorter to the sad face than to the other faces. Furthermore, depressive symptom scores were not associated with attentional biases for the dysphoric participants. Taken together, {{these findings are consistent with}} literature suggesting dysphoria and depression are characterized by elaboration of mood-congruent stimuli at later stages of information processing. However, the context in which the negative stimuli is presented is important. The elaboration of mood congruent stimuli was only evident in the context of a paired neutral stimuli; a paired positive stimuli did not support this elaboration effect. Additionally, symptom severity on the BDI-II did not influence the elaboration bias dysphoric participants exhibited. These findings have significant implications for the treatment and prevention of depression. PsychologyMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|The {{early stages}} of a new romantic {{relationship}} are characterized by intense feelings of euphoria, well-being, and preoccupation with the romantic partner. Neuroimaging research has linked those feelings to activation of reward systems in the human brain. The results of those studies may be relevant to pain management in humans, as basic animal {{research has shown that}} pharmacologic activation of reward systems can substantially reduce pain. Indeed, <b>viewing</b> <b>pictures</b> of a romantic partner was recently demonstrated to reduce experimental thermal pain. We hypothesized that pain relief evoked by <b>viewing</b> <b>pictures</b> of a romantic partner would be associated with neural activations in reward-processing centers. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined fifteen individuals {{in the first nine months}} of a new, romantic relationship. Participants completed three tasks under periods of moderate and high thermal pain: 1) <b>viewing</b> <b>pictures</b> of their romantic partner, 2) <b>viewing</b> <b>pictures</b> of an equally attractive and familiar acquaintance, and 3) a wordassociation distraction task previously demonstrated to reduce pain. The partner and distraction tasks both significantly reduced self-reported pain, although only the partner task was associated with activation of reward systems. Greater analgesia while <b>viewing</b> <b>pictures</b> of a romantic partner was associated with increased activity in several reward-processing regions, including the caudate head, nucleus accumbens, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex – regions not associated with distraction-induced analgesia. The results suggest that the activation of neural rewar...|$|R

When viewed at this distance, the distortion effects created by the angle {{of view of the}} capture are apparent. However, theoretically, if one <b>views</b> <b>pictures</b> exhibiting extension (wide angle) distortion at a closer distance, thus widening the angle of view of the presentation, then the phenomenon abates. Similarly, <b>viewing</b> <b>pictures</b> exhibiting compression (telephoto) distortion from a greater distance, thus narrowing the angle of view of the presentation, reduces the effect. In both cases, at some critical distance, the apparent distortion disappears completely.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of mental images involves processes that overlap with perception {{and the extent}} of this overlap may contribute to reality monitoring errors (i. e., images misremembered as actual events). We hypothesised that mental images would be more confused with having actually seen a pictured object than would alternative representations, such as verbal descriptions. We also investigated whether affective reactions to images were greater than to verbal descriptions, and whether emotionality was associated with more or less reality monitoring confusion. In two experiments signal detection analysis revealed that mental images {{were more likely to be}} confused with <b>viewed</b> <b>pictures</b> than were verbal descriptions. There was a general response bias to endorse all emotionally negative items, but accuracy of discrimination between imagery and <b>viewed</b> <b>pictures</b> was not significantly influenced by emotional valence. In a third experiment we found that accuracy of reality monitoring depended on encoding: images were more accurately discriminated from <b>viewed</b> <b>pictures</b> when rated for affect than for size.

40|$|Here {{we tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that entrepreneurs' emotional experience and brain responses toward their own firm resemble those of parents toward their own children. Using fMRI, we measured the brain activity while male entrepreneurs <b>viewed</b> <b>pictures</b> {{of their own and}} of a familiar firm, and while fathers <b>viewed</b> <b>pictures</b> of their own and of a familiar child. The entrepreneurs who self-rated as being very closely attached with their venture showed a similar suppression of activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as fathers during <b>viewing</b> <b>pictures</b> of their own children versus familiar children. In addition, individual differences in the confidence trait influenced the neural encoding of both paternal and entrepreneurial processing. For underconfident fathers, a picture of one's own child was associated with stronger activation and for overconfident fathers with weaker activation in the amygdala and in caudate nucleus, a brain structure associated with processing of rewards. Similar association with activation, yet more widespread in the emotional processing network, was observed in entrepreneurs suggesting a similar neural basis for increased sensitivity to threats and potential risks concerning one's venture and child. In conclusion, both entrepreneurial and parental love seem to be supported by brain structures associated with reward and emotional processing as well as social understanding...|$|R
