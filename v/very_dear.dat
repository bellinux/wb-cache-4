Now at the beach house, Peter and Walter search for and retrieve a device that can seal shut the doorway into the other universe.

5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with tears in his eyes asked him why he alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E

When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) arrives on scene, she concludes {{that he was dead}} before the car hit him, having been thrown off the bridge above the road.

25|$|A {{retreating}} Siraj-ud-Daulah met the British at Plassey. He {{had to make}} camp 27 {{miles away}} from Murshidabad. On 23 June 1757 Siraj-ud-Daulah called on Mir Jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of Mir Mardan who was a <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> companion of Siraj in battles. The Nawab asked for help from Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar advised Siraj to retreat for that day. The Nawab made the blunder in giving the order to stop the fight. Following his command, the soldiers of the Nawab were returning to their camps. At that time, Robert Clive attacked the soldiers with his army. At such a sudden attack, the army of Siraj became indisciplined and {{could think of no}} way to fight. So all fled away in such a situation. Betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Krishna Chandra, Omichund etc., he lost the battle and had to escape. He went first to Murshidabad and then to Patna by boat, but was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar's soldiers.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} Friday after the siege, Uthman {{addressed}} the congregation in the mosque. After praising God and blessing and wishing peace on Muhammad, Uthman invited {{the attention of}} the people to the commandment in the Quran requiring the people to obey God, His Apostle, and those in authority among them. He observed that the Muslims had been enjoined to settle all matters by mutual consultation. He said that he had kept the doors of consultation wide open. All the allegations that had been levelled against him had been duly explained by him and shown to be false. He had expressed his readiness to solve the legitimate grievances of the people, if any. He observed that under the circumstances it was uncharitable {{on the part of some}} persons to create disturbances in Mecca. He said that he was not afraid of death, but he did not want the Muslims to be guilty of bloodshed. To him the solidarity of the Muslim community was <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> and in order to prevent dissension among the Muslims he had instructed his supporters to refrain from violence. He wanted the people to be afraid of God and not to indulge in activities subversive of Islam. He pointed out that the foreign powers smarting under their defeat inflicted by the Muslim arms had sponsored some conspiracies to subvert Islam. He warned the people not to play in the hands of the enemies of Islam. He appealed to the rebels to retire from Madina. He wanted the people of Madina to support the cause of truth and justice and withhold their support from the rebels bent on mischief.|$|E

The six were honored on November 19, 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, [...] "They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor them, and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them." [...] Clark was present.

500|$|After Jean's {{version of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{rejected}} by her record company, she was upset that Beyoncé recorded and released the ballad. Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that Jean was first informed that Beyoncé recorded the song by a stranger. The Daily Telegraph reported that Beyoncé's father and then-manager Mathew Knowles pursued the publishing rights of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] after realizing that it {{had the potential to}} become a big hit. Jean used her Myspace account to express her frustration: [...] "I have been reading some of these comments and {{to set the record straight}} from the horse's mouth – IF I WERE A BOY is my song; YES, I wrote this song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> to me. You can hear the original version on my myspace site." [...] Friedman later reported that Beyoncé and Jean had come to terms. The deal included a promise that Beyoncé would record a duet with Jean for her debut album.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1894, Grove {{retired from}} the Royal College of Music. Parry was chosen to succeed him, and {{although}} Stanford wholeheartedly congratulated his friend on his appointment, their relations soon deteriorated. Stanford {{was known as a}} hot-tempered and quarrelsome man. Grove had written of a board meeting at the Royal College [...] "where somehow the spirit of the d----l himself had been working in Stanford all the time – as it sometimes does, making him so nasty and quarrelsome and contradictious as no one but he can be! He is a most remarkably clever and able fellow, full of resource and power – no doubt of that – but one has to purchase it often at a <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> price." [...] Parry suffered worse at Stanford's hands with frequent rows, deeply upsetting to the highly strung Parry. Some of their rows were caused by Stanford's reluctance to accept the authority of his old friend and protégé, but on other occasions Parry seriously provoked Stanford, notably in 1895 when he reduced the funding for Stanford's orchestral classes.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The Sun that he was [...] "so proud of [...] lyrically" [...] and thought the song [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] contained the best lyrics he had ever written. Taylor explained that it was [...] "very easy" [...] for him to focus on the [...] "more serious lyrics, like a love song <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> to [...] heart" [...] but stated that [...] "Wrestlers" [...] was [...] "equally as important and feels like a very different style of music than we have ever got down on record before." [...] He discussed [...] "Wrestlers" [...] in the band's interview with The Sun, explaining that the song is [...] "musically and lyrically quite direct" [...] because [...] "it doesn't have thousands of layers", in contrast to the song [...] "Bendable Poseable". The concept of the song [...] "Wrestlers", originates from a text message from James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. After Doyle toured with Murphy, Murphy sent a text message that said, [...] "Sorry you can't have Al back, I'll wrestle you for him. And I'll beat you because I'm bigger and stronger than you." [...] Goddard explained that [...] "the words in that song are about wrestling", and the band [...] "have no doubt" [...] that Murphy would defeat them in a wrestling fight.|$|E

Sometime in the late 1950s her neighbors had her institutionalized. Her <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> friend Jehanne Bietry Salinger said about the matter, [...] "some so-called 'do-gooders' went to her studio, found it disorganized, and had Henrietta committed to an asylum.

These strategies included expanding his contacts with Rossini to secure his growing friendship by continuing to see him on numerous occasions to seek his advice, noting [...] "I have always adored Rossini, and I succeeded, and happily... tamed Rossini's hatred, I no longer was frightened and finished that work of mine which won me so much honour". In a series of letters to Florimo throughoutthe year, he wrote of Rossini's increasing support, even love: [...] "I hear that he speaks well of me" [...] (4 September 1834); [...] "...if I have Rossini's protection, I'll be situated very well" [...] (4 November); [...] "The most beautiful is that Rossini loves me very, very, very much" [...] (18 November); and [...] "...my <b>very</b> <b>dear</b> Rossini who now loves me as a son" [...] (21 January 1835, following the dress rehearsal).|$|E
