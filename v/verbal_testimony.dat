The British tanks were between [...] and [...] away from the German line of advance, whereas the Canadian squadron was around [...] away. Reid argues that due to the Canadians' proximity to the Germans, and the firing angle, their troops more than likely can be credited with the destruction of Wittmann's tank. Reid also relies on H. Holfinger's account of the engagement to support his thesis Holfinger was in a Tiger approximately 250 meters behind Wittmann and he indicates that Wittmann's Tiger was destroyed at 12h55. Ekin's crew was credited with the destruction of 3 Tigers, at 12h40, 12h47 and 12h52, Wittmann's tank being probably the one destroyed at 12h47.

It has a huge scope for the discipline of communication too. This article presents an appraisal of oral tradition as a means of communication from one generation to another. While doing so, it deals with following issues: Can history be narrated based on oral traditions just as it is done with ‘written documents’? Are the oral traditions only the sources of historiography or do they have other implications too? It also discusses whether oral traditions can be taken as valid historical sources, and, if not, whether there are means for testing its reliability. The oral tradition Vansina (1965) has defined oral traditions as “documents of the present ” also inheriting “a message from the past. ” For Turner (1986), it is one of branchs of literary studies which reaches back far enough in time to invite a consideration of that crucial period in human prehistory when biological evolution overlapped with cultural evolution (p. 68).

Amnesty International's Medical Examination Group in the Netherlands (AI-MEG) has, {{for more than a}} decade, been photographing torture scars to supplement the testimonies of asylum seekers who have been denied refuge. AI-MEG only intervenes at this point, when asylum seekers face extradition. Proving allegations of torture is of vital importance, as asylum seekers face rising anti-immigrant sentiment in European countries. All victims examined by AI-MEG present a combination of mental, physical and emotional scars. We summarize five cases where AI-MEG used photography in their medical examinations, and consider the ethical role physicians play in helping asylum seekers obtain refuge. Though photographs cannot capture all forms of trauma, as visual documents, they are a compelling form of concrete evidence of torture. In this way, photographs complement <b>verbal</b> <b>testimonies</b> and help doctors and immigration authorities to see and understand physical scars left by various forms of torture. AI-MEG explains in medical terms the connections between the visible late sequelae of torture and victims' testimonies. They then assess whether or not the physical scars are consistent with the forms of torture recounted by victims, using the terminology of the Istanbul Protocol (1999), the United Nations-adopted manual of guidelines that explains how to document torture.

A análise do currículo assentado no lúdico como atividade importante para o letramento pode representar a possibilidade de integração de crianças de 6 anos e a superação dos desalinhos curriculares no âmbito da política pública de ampliação do ensino fundamental. A investigação, de caráter qualitativo, pautou-se em dados do acompanhamento das cinco turmas de primeiro ano do ensino fundamental de nove anos do período de 2006 a 2010, com análise do plano de ensino, registros de desempenho das crianças, entrevistas com pais, depoimentos orais de crianças, registros da professora e relatórios da brinquedoteca. Os dados indicam que o currículo implementado, em seus aspectos estruturais e pedagógicos, atende as necessidades das crianças, ajusta-se às concepções de atividade, mediações e uso de jogos imaginários com apoio de signos e artefatos.

40|$|The First World War is a {{recurrent}} {{theme in the}} work of the contemporary poet Thomas Kling, whose texts engage with this harrowing period of European history through a wide range of personal and official, <b>verbal</b> and visual <b>testimonies.</b> Kling is particularly interested in the role of the Great War as the first modern 'media war' whose depiction in the photography and film has shaped its perception by historical witnesses and present-day viewers alike. However, Kling's primary interest is not in the media as a source of accurate historical evidence; rather, he is interested in the deeply precarious, even paradoxical relationship between the technical media and personal memory. Although film and photography provide tangible testimonies of the past, they also symbolize the irreducible gaps between past and present, between official war propaganda and personal experience. Kling's poems highlight the failure of film and photography to capture an accurate image of the War, its chaos and destruction. The technological limitations of the media, however, have their parallel in the failings of human memory where personal trauma and collective repression likewise prevent any wholly successful engagement with the past.

40|$|Esta dissertação procura {{investigar}} os desdobramentos temáticos existentes na obra da Legião Urbana, assim como o processo de recepção pelo público da banda brasiliense. Com esses objetivos, a pesquisa realiza um debate acadêmico, recorrendo inclusive a uma parcela da literatura que investiga o rock nacional dos anos 80 e que credita a repercussão do estilo, somente, a produtores e gravadoras. Essas análises de cunho mercadológico, estético e jornalístico interpretam o movimento roqueiro de forma estática, sem maleabilidade e tensões, sendo que os agentes supracitados, supostamente, teriam mantido as bandas totalmente submissas às suas pretensões. Sob esse ponto de vista, os grupos de rock não teriam oferecido nenhuma resistência às imposições advindas daqueles agentes. Nos estudos realizados sob essa perspectiva, ao público que se identificou com o estilo é atribuído papel secundário no processo de difusão da música elétrica. Todavia, a presente dissertação, possuindo em seu horizonte os objetivos citados, bem como os pressupostos teóricos dos estudos culturais, vai em busca de outras interpretações. Para tanto, discute-se a participação de alguns movimentos juvenis em torno do rock, ao longo da segunda metade do século XX, sendo que tal diálogo é considerado necessário haja vista a associação do estilo musical com a juventude, que foi inerente à trajetória de Renato Russo, em Brasília, onde seus contatos com a cultura punk, seu círculo social e a formação de bandas de garagem culminaram no surgimento da Legião Urbana. Posteriormente, a pesquisa analisa a experiência do grupo dentro do mercado fonográfico e da mídia, observando as tensões que a banda foi obrigada a enfrentar para manter-se ativa no mercado de bens culturais. Após esse percurso inicial, a dissertação busca uma interpretação, entre várias possíveis, no que tange às continuidades e mutações que existiram na discografia do grupo produzida em estúdio. Essa, ao exclamar fragmentos da visão de mundo de Renato Russo, com forte direcionamento à juventude de seu tempo, permite à pesquisa discutir o consumo e a recepção de suas canções, por uma parcela de seu público, em meio a um conjunto de possibilidades oferecidas no cotidiano. As fontes utilizadas são entrevistas de Renato Russo, músicas e imagens contidas em todos os álbuns gravados em estúdio e depoimentos orais dos sujeitos que eram jovens durante os anos 80 e 90 e que acompanharam a carreira dos jovens de Brasília. O lavor com essa diversidade de fontes, além de problematizar a rigidez imposta por parte da literatura do rock nacional, abre caminho para algumas vias interpretativas, seja para a análise da obra da Legião Urbana, seja para exame dos processos de recepção e consumo realizados pelo seu públicoThe present dissertation {{attempts to}} investigate the thematic deployments within Legião Urbana&# 8223;s work, {{as well as the}} process of reception of this work, by the public of this Brasilia&# 8223;s band. With such aims, the research creates an academic discussion, gathering information also from the existing literature investigating the Brazilian rock and roll of the 80 &# 8223;s, which, in fact, attributes the repercussion of this style to producers and recording companies. Such analysis, of a merchandised, aesthetical and journalistic nature, interpret the rock and roll movement in a static way, with no malleability or stresses, as if the above referred agents would have maintained the bands fully submitted to their intentions. Under such point-of-view, rock and roll groups would have offered no resistance to the impositions of those agents. In the studies performed under such perspective, a secondary role is attributed to the public who identified itself with the style, in the process of electronic music diffusion. However, the present dissertation, guided by the previously mentioned aims, and also by the theoretical assumptions of the cultural studies, goes after other interpretations. For this, it will discuss the participation of some youth movements in rock and roll issues, throughout {{the second half of the}} 20 th Century - this being a necessary dialogue, face to the association of this musical style and the youth, an inherent factor to Renato Russo&# 8223;s trajectory, in Brasília, where his contacts with the punk culture, his social circle and the creation of garage bands have led to the arising of Legião Urbana. Subsequently, the research analyzes the experience of the Group within the phonographic market and the media, observing the stresses that the band was forced to cope, in order to keep active within the cultural assets market. After this initial path, the dissertation tries an interpretation, among different possible ones, regarding to the continuities and changes occurred in the studio discography of the group. This interpretation, by exposing fragments of Renato Russo&# 8223;s vision of the world, strongly addressed to the youth of his time, enables to discuss the consumption and reception of his songs by a parcel of his public, in middle of a bunch of possibilities in place, in the daily existence of the band. The sources used by the research are Renato Russo&# 8223;s interviews, songs, and images contained in all the studio albums, plus <b>verbal</b> <b>testimonies</b> of people who were young in the 80 &# 8223;s and 90 &# 8223;s, and who have followed the career of these young men from Brasília. The work with such diversity of sources, besides to question the stiffness imposed by part of the literature about the Brazilian rock and roll, opens new ways to some interpretative paths, whether for an analysis of Legião Urbana&# 8223;s work, or to analyze the reception and consumption processes, by their publi...|$|R

Each case study involved the <b>verbal</b> and written <b>testimony</b> of each adult daughter woven into a story followed by a clinical analysis.

Each of the respondents expressed an understanding of the generational patterns present in their cognitive, affective, and interactional styles. Respondents reported a perception that the parent who demonstrated the most warmth and sensitivity was the one most emulated. ^ This study is important because it highlights the emotional and relational processes undertaken by adult daughters as they make decisions about staying connected to and differentiating from their mothers. Identification of these themes should be of interest to both practitioners and researchers constructing clinical interventions and research plans. ...|$|R
