50|$|The {{clouded monitor}} (Varanus nebulosus) is {{a species of}} monitor lizard, native to Burma, Thailand and Indochina to West Malaysia, Singapore, Java, and Sumatra. They are {{excellent}} tree climbers. It belongs to the subgenus Empagusia along with the Bengal monitor, the Dumeril's monitor and other monitor lizards. It had previously been listed as a subspecies of <b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> by some herpetologists. It is a diurnal monitor.|$|R
50|$|The faunal {{study by}} UNDP covered the herpetofaunal group. 14 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles have been recorded here; the list includes Indian python (Python molurus) an endangered species, Indian flap-shelled turtle (Lissemys punctata) of vulnerable category and muggar (Crocodylus palustris) and <b>Varanus</b> (<b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis)</b> of endangered category. Threats faced by these species have been noted as water shortage, traffic, and hunting by snake charmers.|$|R
50|$|The species {{ranges from}} Iran to Java, {{among the most}} widely {{distributed}} of varanid lizards. It is found in river valleys in eastern Iran, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Burma. The subspecies <b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> nebulosus, the clouded monitor, occurs in southern Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java and the Sunda Islands. They have not been confirmed on Sumatra, and {{have been found to}} be absent from the Andaman Islands.|$|R

Of fishes barbs (Barbus spp.), giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy), snakeheads (Channa spp.), catfish (Siluriformes) and exotic tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) are predominant in the reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the Western tambourine, it {{consists}} of a circular frame made of the wood of the jackfruit tree, between 7 and 9 inches in width and 2 to 4 inches in depth. It is covered on one side with a drumhead made of monitor lizard skin (specifically the Bengal monitor, <b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis,</b> now an endangered species in India), while {{the other side is}} left open. The frame has a single slit which contain three to four small metal discs (often old coins) that jingle when the kanjira is played.|$|R
50|$|Bundala harbors {{various forms}} of fishes {{including}} salt water dispersants Anguilla bicolor, marine forms Ambassis gymnocephalus, brackish water forms Chanos chanos and freshwater forms Channa striata. Bundala's herpetofauna includes two endemic species, a toad and a snake, Bufo atukoralei and Xenochrophis asperrimus.

50|$|The Bengal monitor (<b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis)</b> or common Indian monitor, is {{a monitor}} lizard found widely {{distributed}} over the Indian Subcontinent, {{as well as}} parts of Southeast Asia and West Asia. This large lizard is mainly terrestrial, and its length can range from about 61 to 175 cm {{from the tip of}} the snout {{to the end of the}} tail. Young monitors may be more arboreal, but adults mainly hunt on the ground, preying mainly on arthropods, but also taking small terrestrial vertebrates, ground birds, eggs and fish. Although large monitors have few predators apart from humans who hunt them for meat, younger individuals are hunted by many predators.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the public attitudes toward monitor lizards in the human-dominated ecosystems of sub-tropical Bangladesh. In this regard, a total of 100 participants between the age of 15 - 65 {{were randomly selected from}} five different parts (20 participants from each part) of Bangladesh. Based on participants’ opinion, <b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> is mostly known (58 ± 2. 20) and Varanus salvator is the least known (22 ± 3. 48) species among three monitor lizard species found in Bangladesh. Surprisingly, most of the participants (77 ± 0. 50) mentioned that monitor lizards are snakes. Though all the monitor lizards found in Bangladesh are non-venomous, a significant proportion (63 ± 1. 53) of the participants believe that monitor lizards are venomous and can attack and bite people. The participants' viewpoint throughout the country regarding the above-mentioned issues, however, were somewhat similar (χ 2 test, p> 0. 05). Despite their negative perception, most of the participants (71 ± 1. 27) agreed that monitor lizards play vital role in our ecosystems. The populations of monitor lizards are declining day by day at an alarming rate. Most of the participants (32 ± 0. 50) mentioned that retribution killing is the primary cause of the decline of monitor lizards. The highest proportion (56 ± 1. 35) of participants believe that there are no alternatives of awareness raising among local residents if we are to conserve monitor lizards in their natural environment that is shared by people...|$|R

40|$|Skeletal {{remains of}} a new early Miocene (Ottnangian, MN 4 mammal zone) monitor lizard, Varanus mokrensis sp. nov., are {{described}} from two karst fissures in the Mokrá-Western Quarry (1 / 2001 Turtle Joint; 2 / 2003 Reptile Joint), Czech Republic, providing the first documented example of a European varanid for which osteological data permit a well-supported assignment to the genus Varanus. The new species is morphologically similar to the Recent Indo-Asiatic varanids of the <b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis</b> group. It differs from all other Varanus species {{on the basis of}} a single autapomorphy and a combination of 11 characters. As a distinguishing feature of V. mokrensis, the parietal and squamosal processes of the postorbitofrontal form a narrowly acute angle. The teeth show distinct, smooth cutting edges along the mesial and distal margins of the apical portion of their crowns. This feature is not observed in most extant Asiatic Varanus species and may represent a plesiomorphic condition. The results of parsimony phylogenetic analyses, with and without character reweighting, reveal poor resolution within Varanus. A Bayesian analysis shows V. mokrensis to be closely related to extant representatives of the Indo-Asiatic Varanus clade, with close affinities to the V. bengalensis species group. The topology of the Bayesian tree supports the hypothesis that Miocene monitors from Mokrá are representatives of a lineage that is ancestral to the well-defined clade of extant African varanids, including the early Miocene V. rusingensis. In addition, our results support a Eurasian origin for the varanid clade. The extant African Varanus species probably originated in the late Oligocene. The radiation of African varanids probably occurred during the late Oligocene to early Miocene time interval. The occurrence of Varanus in the early Miocene of Mokrá-Western Quarry corresponds to the warm phase of the Miocene Climatic Optimum. Remains of a diverse aquatic and heliophobe amphibian fauna at the 2 / 2003 Reptile Joint site indicate more humid conditions than those at the 1 / 2001 Turtle Joint site...|$|R
40|$|The Open-billed stork, Anastomus oscitans in the Raiganj {{wildlife}} sanctuary, {{preferred the}} core region than buffer {{region of the}} sanctuary for nesting as though core region was relatively undisturbed and rich in food for stork. In two breeding seasons, the fledgling success was greater at the nests that were located in the core region than in the buffer region of the sanctuary. The availability of food in the nearby areas and protection from the predators were the main factors for rising storks’ population. The Open-billed stork built more nest in the year 2008 than in the year 2007. They selected 599 trees for nesting of which 249 trees were Lagerstroemia spaciosa in the year 2007 which increased to 615 trees for nesting of which 280 trees were Lagerstroemia speciosa in the year 2008. The percentage of unhatched eggs, damaged eggs by predation, storm and heavy rain was higher in the year 2007 than in the year 2008. The nestlings death mainly caused by storm and heavy rain, by dropping dur-ing first flight and by predation. The main natural predators of the species in the sanctuary were House crow (Corvus splendens) and Bengal monitor (<b>Varanus</b> <b>bengalensis).</b> The overall hatching success and fledging suc-cess were 91. 71 % and 83. 96 % in the year 2007 which increased to 94. 86 % and 87. 95 % in the year 2008 respec-tively. The breeding behavior of Open-billed stork was disturbed by visitors and villagers activities and by vehi-cles during breeding season in the sanctuary. The villagers also invaded to collect fire wood into the buffer region as well as core region of the sanctuary during breeding season. As though the Open-billed stork can tolerate this type of disturbances, so they can breed in the sanctuary. But disturbed birds may show increased failure rates despite their lack of immediate behavioural responses to human pressure. The number of stork population was increased from 44816 to 58920 in the year 2007 and 2008 in the Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary. It {{may be due to}} the availability of nesting trees, nesting materials, availability of safe nesting zone and availability of food of this particular bird species. But proper management should be taken to increase their successful breeding...|$|R
5000|$|However, in 1927, C. Boden Kloss {{wrote to}} the {{magazine}} Cat Gossip regarding hybrids between wild and domestic cats in Malaya: [...] "I {{have never heard of}} hybrids between bengalensis (the Leopard Cat) and domestic cats.

40|$|We report {{construction}} of second-generation integrated genetic linkage and radiation hybrid (RH) maps {{in the domestic}} cat (Felis catus) that exhibit {{a high level of}} marker concordance and provide near-full genome coverage. A total of 864 markers, including 585 coding loci (type I markers) and 279 polymorphic microsatellite loci (type II markers), are now mapped in the cat genome. We generated the genetic linkage map utilizing a multigeneration interspecies backcross pedigree between the domestic cat and the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus <b>bengalensis).</b> Eighty-one type <b>I</b> markers were integrated with 247 type II markers from a first-generation map to generate a map of 328 loci (320 autosomal and 8 X-linked) distributed in 47 linkage groups, with an average intermarker spacing of 8 cM. Genome coverage spans approximately 2, 650 cM, allowing an estimate for the genetic length of the sex-averaged map as 3, 300 cM. The 834 -locus second-generation domestic cat RH map was generated from the incorporation of 579 type I and 255 type II loci. Type I markers were added using targeted selection to cover either genomic regions underrepresented in the first-generation map or to refine breakpoints in human/feline synteny. The integrated linkage and RH maps reveal approximately 110 conserved segments ordered between the human and feline genomes, and provide extensive anchored reference marker homologues that connect to the more gene dense human and mouse sequence maps, suitable for positional cloning applications...|$|R
