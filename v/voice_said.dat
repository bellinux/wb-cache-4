[...] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer said that [...] "those who want something more substantial from a movie than a vid-game script with centerfold appeal will not find it in this noisy, bone-crushing survivalist flick."

It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency." ...|$|E

[...] Robert Christgau from The Village <b>Voice</b> <b>said</b> it has [...] "four groundbreaking masterworks" [...] in [...] "I Ain't No Joke", [...] "I Know You Got Soul", [...] "Paid in Full", and [...] "Eric B.

[...] Sean Fennessey of The Village <b>Voice</b> <b>said,</b> that Ready, featured Songz's [...] "re-imagining the notion of flow—if not melody—just as his hero Kelly did 15 years ago." [...] Andrew Rennie of Now Magazine said the production had a 1980s soundtrack vibe. According to Mark Edward Nero of About.com, [...] "I Need A Girl" [...] contains familiar qualities of Songz's breakout hit [...] "Can't Help but Wait", also produced by Stargate. The song is lyrically about finding and pleasing the right woman. The song has also been described to be a mix of Usher and Justin Timberlake ...|$|E

[...] DJBooth said that there was [...] "no reason to doubt that this track will become a mainstream smash." [...] Shaheem Reid of MTV News said, [...] "It's not a record that will kill the clubs, but when you just want to listen to superb lyricism and enthralling harmony, it's a must have."

The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a <b>voice</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hi, this is Madonna.

In one New York Times review, Sean Wilsey called Fun Home [...] "a pioneering work, pushing two genres (comics and memoir) in multiple new directions" [...] and [...] "a comic book for lovers of words". Jill Soloway, {{writing in the}} Los Angeles Times, praised the work overall but commented that Bechdel's reference-heavy prose is at times [...] "a little opaque". [...] Similarly, a reviewer in [...] The Tyee felt that [...] "the narrator's insistence on linking her story to those of various Greek myths, American novels and classic plays" [...] was [...] "forced" [...] and [...] "heavy-handed". By contrast, the Seattle Times reviewer wrote positively of the book's use of literary reference, calling it [...] "staggeringly literate". The Village <b>Voice</b> <b>said</b> that Fun Home [...] "shows how powerfully—and economically—the medium can portray autobiographical narrative.
