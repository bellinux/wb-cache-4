30|$|Conclusions Transport <b>ventilators</b> {{differ in}} {{accuracy}} of delivering tidal volume demonstrating better performance in turbine equipped models. Oxygen supply by cylinder was of limited influence in two gas-driven <b>ventilators</b> only. Two of three turbine equipped transport <b>ventilators</b> (Hamilton C 1 & C 2) tested showed accuracy comparable to ICU <b>ventilators</b> and therefore {{are suitable for}} critical care transport. The use of many gas-driven <b>ventilators</b> in critical care transport should be questioned considering their inaccurate performance.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{new generations}} of {{intensive}} care <b>ventilators</b> {{tend to be}} more innovative and sophisticated than previous ones, but little is known about their respective performance for delivering pressure support ventilation (PSV) and how they compare to previous generations. DESIGN: Active lung model bench test. APPARATUS: Twenty-two commercially available <b>ventilators</b> classified into three categories: new generation <b>ventilators</b> (after 1993, n= 7), previous generation (before 1993, n= 6), and recent piston or turbine-based <b>ventilators</b> (n= 9). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: During PSV, the unloading efficacy of the assistance depends on the <b>ventilator's</b> ability to meet inspiratory flow demand. Three levels of flow (0. 1 l/s, 0. 6 l/s, and 1. 2 l/s) were used to simulate inspiratory demand and the net area of the inspiratory airway pressure-time trace was calculated over the first 0. 3 s, 0. 5 s, and 1 s (Area (0. 3), Area (0. 5), and Area (tot)) with three levels of PSV (5 cmH(2) O, 10 cmH(2) O, and 15 cmH(2) O). To assess the respective role of pressure support delivery and triggering function, triggering sensitivity was assessed independently by measuring the time delay (TD (tg)) and the pressure fall (Delta Paw (tg)) with two levels of inspiratory drive. All the new generation <b>ventilators</b> exhibited significantly better results than most of the previous generation <b>ventilators</b> regarding Area (0. 3) and TD (tg), indicating large improvements in terms of triggering and pressurisation. CONCLUSION: Regarding PSV and trigger performance, the new generation <b>ventilators</b> - but also some piston and turbine-based <b>ventilators</b> - outperform most of previous generation <b>ventilators...</b>|$|R

5|$|Szent István {{differed}} from her half-sisters mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft {{arrangement of the}} other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge to the after funnel and on which several searchlights were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified <b>ventilator</b> trunk {{in front of the}} mainmast. She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical <b>ventilator.</b> Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E

5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a <b>ventilator.</b> It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E

5|$|Laubenstein {{developed}} appendicitis in 1984 and {{was afraid}} to undergo surgery {{because of the risk}} that general anesthesia would pose to her lungs, already compromised from polio. After the operation, her surgeons had trouble weaning her off the <b>ventilator</b> and she suffered a psychotic breakdown requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital; the psychiatrists theorized that her hallucinations were caused by hypoxia from the anesthesia. In 1990, she fell ill with a combination of asthma, gastroenteritis and respiratory failure, though she continued to work. She started taking corticosteroids for her respiratory problems—which were exacerbated by allergies to her two pet cats—and was unable to wean herself off them despite experiencing side effects.|$|E
30|$|Introduction There is {{an ongoing}} {{development}} of home-care turbine-powered <b>ventilators.</b> These {{can be used in}} the intermediate care environment at the hospital. The capability for these home-care <b>ventilators</b> to deliver adequate FIO 2 is an important endpoint for patient’s safety.

A total of 15lead discs were recovered, some of which were inscribed with crosses. Two of these were found in graves, but the purpose of the discs has not been reliably explained. The other lead artefacts from this period were associated with the structure of the buildings and include fragments of kame (the lead used in leaded windows), <b>ventilator</b> grills, and water pipes. Leather fragments almost all came from shoes, and included an almost complete child's shoe dating from the late 16th or the 17thcentury.

25|$|The {{design of}} the modern positive-pressure <b>ventilators</b> were based mainly on {{technical}} developments by the military during World War II to supply oxygen to fighter pilots in high altitude. Such <b>ventilators</b> replaced the iron lungs as safe endotracheal tubes with high-volume/low-pressure cuffs were developed. The popularity of positive-pressure <b>ventilators</b> rose during the polio epidemic in the 1950s in Scandinavia and the United States and {{was the beginning of}} modern ventilation therapy. Positive pressure through manual supply of 50% oxygen through a tracheostomy tube led to a reduced mortality rate among patients with polio and respiratory paralysis. However, because of the sheer amount of man-power required for such manual intervention, mechanical positive-pressure <b>ventilators</b> became increasingly popular.|$|R
