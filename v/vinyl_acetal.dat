50|$|DAINV {{reactions}} {{have been}} utilized for {{the synthesis of}} several natural products, including (-)-CC-1065, a parent compound in the Duocarmycin series, which found use as an anticancer treatment. Several drug candidates in this series have progress into clinical trials. The DAINV reaction was used to synthesise the PDE-I and PDE-II sections of (-)-CC-1065. The first reaction in the sequence is a DAINV reaction between the tetrazine and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetal,</b> followed by a retro-Diels-Alder reaction to afford a 1,2-diazine product. After several more steps, an intramolecular DAINV reaction occurs, followed again by a retro Diels-Alder in situ, to afford an indoline product. This indoline is a converted into either PDE-I or PDE-II in a few synthetic steps.|$|E
40|$|Poly(ortho ester) s, POEs, {{are well}} {{established}} as displaying surface eroding properties and hence present unique opportunities for controlled release and tissue engineering applications. Their development and wide spread investigation has however been severely limited by challenging synthetic requirements via unstable intermediates {{and is therefore}} highly irreproducible. Herein, we present the first catalytic method for the synthesis of POEs using air and moisture stable <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetal</b> precursors. The synthesis {{of a range of}} POE structures is demonstrated including those that are extremely hard to achieve by other synthetic methodologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the application of this chemistry to efficiently install functional groups via ortho ester linkages to an aliphatic polycarbonate...|$|E
40|$|Vinyl alcohol {{has been}} {{generated}} by hydrolysis of methoxy(vinyloxy) methyl chloroacetate and acetate (1 and 3), bis(vinyloxy) methyl dichloroacetate and trichloroacetate (7 and 6), dimethyl vinyl orthoformate (4), dimethyl vinyl orthoacetate (5), and ketene methyl <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetal</b> (8) in aqueous [2 H 3]acetonitrile or aqueous [2 H 7]dimethylformamide. It {{was characterized by}} 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy and by conversion into acetaldehyde. On replacement of OH by OD the 13 C NMR spectrum shows isotope shifts of − 0. 12 and − 0. 09 ppm for the α - and β -carbons under conditions where no such shifts were detectable for the corresponding carbons of ethyl vinyl ether. Vinyl alcohol with an OH group was generated under conditions of slow hydroxyl-proton exchange with 8 as the precursor in CD 3 COCD 3 (99 v %) /H 2 O (1 v %) at − 10 °C and the following coupling constants were evaluated: 3 J trans = + 14. 0, 3 J cis = + 6. 3, 2 J gem = − 0. 8, 3 J (HOC α H) = + 9. 8, 4 J (HOC β H anti) = + 0. 4, | 4 J (HOC β H syn) | < 0. 2 Hz. Under the conditions used vinyl alcohol was converted into acetaldehyde ca 100 times faster than ethyl vinyl ether but could nevertheless be kept in solution for several hours below ca − 10 °C. The postulated intermediate, methyl vinyl hemiorthoformate, could not be detected in the hydrolysis of 1, 3, and 4 nor could methyl vinyl hemiorthoacetate be detected in the hydrolysis of 5 and 8. However divinyl hemiorthoformate was easily detected in the hydrolysis of 6 and 7. It was concluded that this resulted from the weaker "push" of the vinyloxy group which remained attached to the pro-acyl carbon atom compared to a methoxyl group...|$|E
50|$|The dienophiles used in inverse {{electron}} demand Diels-Alder reactions are, {{unlike in}} the standard DA, very electron rich, containing one or more electron donating groups. This results in higher orbital energies, and thus more orbital overlap with the LUMO of the diene. Common classes of dieneophiles for DAINV reaction include vinyl ethers and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetals,</b> imine, enamines, alkynes and highly strained olefins.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} the {{replacement}} of the carbonyl oxygen in VEC additive by =C(CN) 2 in the analogous dicyano ketene <b>vinyl</b> ethylene <b>acetal</b> (DCKVEA) on the electrochemical reduction profile is significant. Yet, the additives were proven, through IR spectroscopy supported by DFT computations, by applying EELS techniques and performing synthesis of a reduction product, to reduce in a similar way. Interestingly, the reduction-induced capacities were found to be quite different and can be explained either by the different properties of the SEI, from lithium carbonate and its malononitrile homologue, or by thedifferent abilities of the two additives to solvate Li+...|$|R
40|$|Part I {{describes}} {{the construction of}} the major carbon framework of olivin, the aglycone of a number of antitumor antibiotics collectively known as the olivomycins. A palladium(O) mediated cross-coupling of a metallated ethyl vinyl ether unit and an enol triflate derived from a readily available carbohydrate was accomplished. In this first key step, most of the carbon and oxygen atoms of the side chain and A ring of the aglycone were assembled {{in the form of a}} diene. The second key step was the Diels-Alder cycloaddition of the complex carbohydrate substituted diene to a highly functionalized naphthoquinone. The resulting cycloadduct, which was formed with complete regiochemical control, has all of the necessary functionality intact for eventual conversion to olivin;Part II describes a direct and operationally convenient synthesis of the DCB ring subunit of aklavinone, the aglycone of the potent cytostatic agent aclacinomycin A. The synthesis begins with a Diels-Alder reaction between 1 -trimethylsilyoxybutadiene and 2 -cyano- 5 -methoxy- 3 -phenylthio- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone. Oxidation of the Diels-Alder adduct produced a novel blocked anthraquinone tautomer. The blocked anthraquinone was converted to the DCB subunit of aklavinone by conjugate addition of a mixed ketene acetal, selective mercaptan oxidation, and elimination of benzenesulfenic acid and hydrocyanic acid. The three rings of the aklavinone precursor were constructed in high yield and with complete stereochemical control;Part III describes successful syntheses of nanaomycin A and deoxyfrenolicin, important members of the naphtho 2, 3 -c pyran- 5, 10 -quinone class of antibiotics. In addition, synthetic efforts toward the more complex members, griseusins A and B, are described. A key step in the syntheses of the two former members is a tandem Diels-Alder-retro-Claisen reaction between 3 -acyl- 5 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinones and mixed <b>vinyl</b> ketene <b>acetals.</b> The resulting 2, 3 -dihydro-naphtho 1, 2 -b furans are oxidized in high yield to intermediate 3 -acyl- 2 -(2 -hydroxyalkyl) substituted naphthoquinones which spontaneously form hemiketals. Finally, the hemiketals were stereospecifically reduced to afford advanced intermediates in previously published syntheses of nanaomycin A and deoxyfrenolicin...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 of this {{dissertation}} describes synthetic efforts {{culminating in}} the first total synthesis and complete stereochemical assignment of (+) -zampanolide (3), the non-naturally-occurring antipode of a potent cytotoxic marine macrolide. ^ Retrosynthetically, initial disconnections of zampanolide at the amide and N-acyl hemiaminal linkages gave rise to hexa- 2 (Z), 4 (E) -dienoic acid chloride (fragment D) and α-alkoxy acid 135. Further simplification of 135 at the indicated locations led to fragments C(3 – 8) A, C(9 – 17) B, and (C 18 – 20) C, {{all of which were}} prepared in multi-gram quantities. *^ The total synthesis of (+) - 3 owes the success to the following cornerstone strategies: (1) The stereocontrolled assembly of fragment (−) -B via the modified Petasis-Ferrier rearrangement of <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetal</b> (+) - 63 and subsequent elaboration of the derived pyranone (+) - 86. (2) The rapid and highly convergent assembly of macrocycle (+) - 131 via the efficient coupling of fragments (+) -A, (−) -B, and (+) -C. (3) Installation of the C(20) N-acyl hemiaminal moiety via a stereospecific Curtius rearrangement of α-alkoxy acid (−) - 135 to carbamate (−) - 136. *^ Since the final step in the synthesis of (+) -zampanolide (3) inevitably led to erosion of stereogenicity at C(20), we were unable to assign the relative and absolute configuration at that center with certainty. However, successful PMB reprotection experiments of (+) - 3 and (+) -C(20) - epi- 3, in conjunction with UV spectroscopic data, eventually enabled us to tentatively assign the configuration at C(20) as R. ^ Chapter 2 of this thesis describes the first total synthesis and complete stereochemical assignment of a related cytotoxic macrolide, (+) -dactylolide (153). The structural similarity between the two natural products enabled us to exploit vinyl bromide (−) -AB, the intermediate from the total synthesis of (+) -zampanolide (3), as the point of departure and complete the total synthesis of (+) -dactylolide (153) in only 9 steps. *^ Our speculation that (+) -dactylolide (153) is either a biosynthetic precursor of (+) -zampanolide (3) [if the latter does exist in nature?] or a degradation product thereof led us to investigate the possibility of a direct conversion of (+) - 3 to (+) - 153. To our delight, the desired transformation was cleanly achieved via thermolysis of (+) -zampanolide (3) in benzene at 85 °C. ^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|E
