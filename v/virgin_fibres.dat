This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually deinked (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the pulp may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards. Health risks have been associated with using recycled material in direct food contact. Swiss studies have shown that recycled material can contain significant portions of mineral oil, which may migrate into packed foods. Mineral oil levels of up to 19.4 mg/kg were found in rice packed in recycled board.|$|E

In particular, the use of recycled plastic fibres has become increasingly attractive due to their low cost and sustainability.

(2) Did consumers consider a recycled paper scoop as an acceptable replacement for the current plastic measuring scoop? The implementation of a recycled paper scoop would reduce packaging waste by approximately 20 % by weight and a significant source reduction through decreased consumption of raw materials. Additionally, it would provide a substantial cost savings of approximately $ 30 M USD annually. The recycled paper scoop consisted of 50 % of post industrial (external) recycled fibres, 40 % of post consumer recycled fibres and 10 % of <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> and internal waste sources.

However, wide adoption of {{recycled plastic}} fibres by construction industries {{has not yet been}} seen due to limited data available on their durability, mechanical properties and performance in concrete. This paper reports findings from a laboratory study on the alkali resistance and performance of recycled polypropylene (PP) fibres in the 25 MPa and 40 MPa concretes, used for footpaths and precast panels, respectively. The recycled PP fibre was proven to have very good alkali resistance in the concrete and other alkaline environments. The recycled PP fibre showed excellent post-cracking performance in concrete, bringing in significant ductility. In the 40 MPa concrete the effectiveness of reinforcement of PP fibres depended on their Young's modulus and tensile strength in the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) test. Since the recycled PP fibre was found to have lower tensile strength but higher Young's modulus than those of <b>virgin</b> PP <b>fibre,</b> the recycled PP fibre produced similar or slightly lower reinforcement than that of <b>virgin</b> PP <b>fibre.</b> In the 25 MPa concrete, the Young's modulus of fibres was more effective on their reinforcement than the tensile strength, thus the recycled PP fibre produced better reinforcement than that of <b>virgin</b> PP <b>fibre...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{environmental}} impact of four alternatives for reinforcing 100 m² of concrete footpath (Functional Unit, FU) by using cradle to gate life cycle assessment (LCA), based on the Australian context. Specifically, the four options considered are a) producing steel reinforcing mesh (SRM), b) producing <b>virgin</b> polypropylene (PP) <b>fibre,</b> c) recycling industrial PP waste and d) recycling domestic PP waste. The FU yields 364 kg of SRM (in a) and 40 kg of PP fibres (in b, c and d), necessary to achieve the same degree of reinforcing in concrete. All the activities required to produce these materials are considered in the study, namely manufacturing and transportation, and also recycling and reprocessing in the case of industrial and domestic recycled PP waste fibres. These processes are individually analysed and quantified in terms of material consumption, water use, and emissions into the environment. This allows for the impacts from producing recycled fibres to be compared with those from producing <b>virgin</b> PP <b>fibre</b> and SRM, which are traditionally used. The LCA results show that industrial recycled PP fibre offers important environmental benefits over <b>virgin</b> PP <b>fibre.</b> Specifically, the industrial recycled PP fibrecan save 50 % of CO₂ equivalent, 65 % of PO₄ equivalent, 29 % of water and 78 % of oil equivalent, compared to the <b>virgin</b> PP <b>fibre.</b> When compared to the SRM, the industrial recycled PP fibre can save 93 % of CO₂ equivalent, 97 % of PO₄ equivalent, 99 % of water and 91 % of oil equivalent.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the characterisation and reuse of fibres recovered from end of life thermoset composites by fluidised bed thermal processing. Emphasis is placed on the properties of recovered glass fibres and their reuse in a dough moulding compound and a tissue product. The need for a recycling process is demonstrated by a survey of the market for thermoset composites with particular consideration given to the potential growth in automotive applications. A study of processes developed to recycle such materials and the effect on the structural properties of composites containing such recyclate shows that a process capable of generating recyclate of greater value is required, particularly for the case of contaminated materials. A review of investigations into the effect of prior heat treatment on the mechanical properties of glass fibres shows that their strength will be reduced by a deterioration of the fibre surface during fluidised bed thermal recovery but that their stiffness is likely to be unaffected. The implications of these effects on possible applications for the recovered fibres are described. Tests are reported on the structural properties of laminates containing heat treated glass cloth which show that there is a strength reduction which is both time and temperature dependent but that modulus is not significantly affected. Strength loss increases with up to 20 minutes heating but then remains constant. In some cases the strength loss can be reduced by resizing the cloth. Measurement of the properties of fibres recovered using the fluidised bed process shows that the recovered fibre strength decreases with increasing processing temperature. Glass and carbon fibres recovered at 450 °C retain approximately 50 % and 80 % of their virgin strengths respectively. The Young's modulus of the recovered fibres is shown to be largely unaffected by the process for both glass and carbon fibres. Investigation of the lengths of the recovered glass fibres by image analysis techniques suggests that their distribution depends on the structure of the composite and the method of size reduction. A weighted mean fibre length of 3. 5 mm to 5. 5 mm is possible with the apparatus described in this thesis. The reduced reinforcement potential of the recovered fibres is confirmed by experiment. Recovered glass fibres are used to displace <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> in a dough moulding compound. At replacement levels of up to 50 % there is no significant effect on the mechanical properties of a compression moulded plate. Above this level, tensile, flexural and impact strengths are reduced and with complete replacement the reduction is by approximately 40 %, 50 % and 70 % respectively. These results are confirmed on a pilot plant scale. Recovered glass fibres can be successfully incorporated with <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> into a veil. Replacement of <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> reduces both wet and dry strength because the recovered fibres are both shorter and weaker. The permeability of the veil is found to depend on its porosity and not its recovered fibre content. The experimental veils can be used to protect and improve the surfaces of mouldings...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the potential use of recycled glass fibre composite materials as a replacement for virgin reinforcing materials in new thermoset composites. Specifically the closed-loop mechanical recycling of composites used heavily in the automotive sector known as dough and sheet moulding composites, DMC and SMC respectively, are investigated. The recycling of glass reinforced thermoset polymer composite materials has been an area of investigation for many years and composites used in the automotive industry are of particular interest due to legislative and social pressures on the industry. The mechanical recycling process and then collection of useful fibrous grades of recycled materials, recyclate, by a novel air separation technique were investigated first. The properties of these recyclate fibres were characterised and compared directly with the properties of <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres</b> they were to be used to replace. Single fibre tensile tests were employed to compare the strengths of the fibres and single fibre pull-out tests were used to investigate the strength of the interface between the fibres and a polyester matrix. These tests showed the recyclate fibres to be weaker and have a poorer interface with the polyester matrix than the <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres.</b> Understanding the properties of the recyclate materials meant their reformulation into new composites could be carefully considered for the production of new high performance materials. Two grades of the collected recyclate materials were then reformulated in to new DMC and SMC composites, replacing percentages of the <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibre</b> reinforcement. The mechanical properties of the resulting manufactured composites were characterised throughout for direct comparison against one another and an unmodified control material, using both three-point flexural tests and Charpy impact tests. Through the modification of existing manufacturing techniques and the development of novel production equipment it has been possible to successfully manufacture both DMC and SMC composites with the recyclate materials used to replace <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres.</b> <b>Virgin</b> glass <b>fibres</b> have successfully been replaced by recyclate materials without disrupting standard production techniques and with minimal reduction of the mechanical properties of the resulting composites.

It has been shown that the recyclate materials should be considered and treated as a distinct reinforcing ingredient, separately from the remaining <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Four recycling cases, including mechanical recycling, semi-mechanical recycling, back-to-oligomer recycling and back-to-monomer recycling were analysed. Three allocation methods are applied for open-loop recycling, i. e. the “cut-off” approach, the “waste valuation” approach and the “system expansion” approach. Nine environmental impact indicators were analysed, i. e. non-renewable energy use (NREU), global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation. The LCA results are compared with <b>virgin</b> PET <b>fibre</b> and other commodity fibre products, i. e. cotton, viscose, PP (polypropylene) and PLA (polylactic acid).

The solid residues produced - char covered carbon fibres - were characterized by SEM and XPS. The optimum time for the gasification of the char covering the fibres was determined in a combined thermolysis/gasification assay.

The review also focuses on the reuse of valuable products recovered by different techniques, in particular the way that fibres have been reincorporated into new materials or applications and the main technological issues encountered. Recycled glass fibres can replace small amounts of <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> in products but not at high enough concentrations to make their recycling economically and environmentally viable, if for example, thermolysis or solvolysis is used. Reclaimed carbon fibres from high-technology applications cannot be reincorporated in the same applications from which they were recovered, so new appropriate applications have to be developed in order to reuse the fibres. Materials incorporating recycled fibres exhibit specific mechanical properties because of the particular characteristics imparted by the fibres. The development of specific standards is therefore necessary, as well as efforts in the development of solutions that enable reusers to benefit from their reinforcement potential. The recovery and reuse of valuable products from resins are also considered, but also the development of recyclable thermoset resins.

40|$|For {{ecological}} purposes, cardboard {{packaging material}} is largely produced using recycled paper. Swiss {{studies have shown}} that cardboard boxes made from recycled material can contain significant portions of mineral oil. The mineral oils stem from printing ink which is commonly used in newspaper printing. If foods such as rice are packaged in such cardboard boxes, it is possible that increased amounts of mineral oils can migrate from the cardboard to the foodstuff. Due to the large portion of mineral oil fractions with short chain and aromatic hydrocarbons, such contaminations of foodstuffs are adverse. Short chain hydrocarbons are more easily taken up by the body. Frequent intake of such contaminated foodstuffs can thus lead to exceedances of the toxicological limit values. Animal {{studies have shown that}} mineral oil mixtures with low viscosity are stored in the body and can lead to accumulations and damage in the liver, heart valves and lymph nodes. As a result of this data, the Federal Insti-tute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in its assessment {{came to the conclusion that}} there is an ur-gent need to minimise the migration of mineral oils to foodstuffs. In order to reduce this substance migration, the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV) has asked BfR to recommend possible courses of action. For foodstuffs that are especially prone to contamination with mineral oils, BfR provides the op-tion to use inner bags in order to prevent substance migration from the cardboard box. An additional option for these foodstuffs is the use of cardboard made from <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres.</b> Further options to be investigated include changing the composition of printing inks used in newspa-per printing and to refrain from using mineral oils that are cause for health concern. This suggestion is further supported by the fact that the uptake of mineral oils from printing inks can also occur through skin contact...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{mechanical}} properties of virgin and recycled woven carbon fibre prepreg {{and goes on}} to assess the potential for recycled carbon fibre reinforced plastic (rCFRP) to be used in high performance energy absorption structures. Three sets of material were examined: fresh containing <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> and resin, aged which was an out of life but otherwise identical roll and recycled which contained recycled fibre and new resin. The compressive strength and modulus of rCFRP were approximately 94 % of the values for fresh material. This correlated directly with the results from impact testing where rCFRP conical impact structures were found to have a specific energy absorption of 32. 7. kJ/kg versus 34. 8. kJ/kg for fresh material. The tensile and flexural strength of rCFRP were 65 % of the value for fresh material. Tensile and flexural moduli of rCFRP were within 90 % of fresh material and ILSS of rCFRP was 75 % that of fresh. Overall rCFRP has been proved to remain a highly satisfactory engineering material. This is a significant finding as it proves that carbon fibre can be recycled and reused in high performance applications. This has significant implications for use of carbon fibre in the automotive industry where End of Life Vehicle (ELV) legislation requires 85 % of materials to be recyclable. This work opens the door to significantly expanded use of carbon fibre in the automotive industry. Of equal significance is the finding that the mechanical properties of fresh and aged carbon fibre were all within ± 6 % of one another. This highlights an opportunity to understand resin system life in more detail in order to prevent the creation of composite waste at source. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This Reference Document on best {{available}} techniques in the {{pulp and paper industry}} reflects the information exchange carried out according to Article 16 (2) of Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC. The document has to be seen {{in the light of the}} preface, which describes the objectives of the document and its use. Paper is essentially a sheet of fibres with a number of added chemicals that affect the properties and quality of the sheet. Besides fibres and chemicals, manufacturing of pulp and paper requires a large amount of process water and energy in the form of steam and electric power. Consequently, the main environmental issues associated with pulp and paper production are emissions to water, emissions to air, and energy consumption. Waste is expected to become a gradually increasing environmental issue of concern. Pulp for papermaking may be produced from <b>virgin</b> <b>fibre</b> by chemical or mechanical means or may be produced by the re-pulping of recovered paper. A paper mill may simply reconstitute pulp made elsewhere or may be integrated with the pulping operations on the same site. This document covers the relevant environmental aspects of pulp and papermaking from various fibrous materials in integrated and non-integrated pulp and paper mills. Non-integrated pul...|$|R
40|$|Star Paper Mills {{is among}} the 15 largest virgin fibers paper mills in India. It has a good rapport in National and International market and {{has a long history}} of more than 70 years (since 1938). The {{industry}} is engaged not only in making of different kinds of papers e. g. <b>Virgin</b> <b>fibre</b> paper, cultural papers etc. using wood pulp as raw material from Eucalyptus, Bamboo, Poplar and other fibrous species but also engaged in implementing and promoting agroforestry and social forestry programme on large scale in different districts of Western Uttar Pradesh (India). Under its agroforestry programme around 3 crores seedlings were raised and distributed among the farmers. Star Paper Mills also provides good quality seeds of Eucalyptus and Bamboo, pesticides, micronutrients, manual of guidance etc. free of cost to the farmers for developing Kisan nurseries. 224 nurseries have been developed and 43. 7 million seedlings distributed amongst farmers during 2008 - 2009 in adjoining districts. We have thus contributed to green an area of around 68688 ha. Now our programme envisages raising of 40 million seedlings every year through Kisan Nurseries. Star has also successfully developed infrastructure to develop superior clones of Eucalyptus and Poplar of high yield and their propagation technology o...|$|R
