40|$|The {{results of}} {{detailed}} seismic investigations {{during the period}} 1961 to 1964 are described. Accurate data of focus location for Kamchatka and the Commander Islands are cited. The majority of earthquakes {{are located in the}} Pacific focal zone and the others are found in such remarkable tectonic regions as the east Kamchatka ranges, the continental slope of the Commander Islands, etc. The focal zone seismic activity decreases with increasing depth. The seismic activity at a depth of 250 km is 100 times less than the activity at a depth of 0 – 20 km. Kamchatka earthquake locations in relation to the Kuril-Kamchatka Island arc and deep water trench are approximately the same as those of the south Kuril Island earthquakes. The Kamchatka active <b>volcano</b> <b>belt</b> coincides with the region of earthquakes having focal depths of 100 – 200 km, especially between 125 and 175 km. S-wave screening in the magma chambers under the volcanoes is observed. The Avacha volcanic cluster magma chamber at a depth of 20 – 80 km has the form of a column, 25 km in diameter. P-wave velocity in the upper mantle under the Pacific Ocean and between the Aleutian trench and the Kuril-Kamchatka trench is about 8. 2 km/sec, and under Kamchatka 7. 7 km/sec. Local velocity decreases to basaltic range (Vp = 72 km/sec) in the upper mantle at a depth near 70 km under the east Kamchatka active <b>volcano</b> <b>belt...</b>|$|E
40|$|Tectonic and {{sedimentary}} mélanges, rocks with block-in-matrix fabric {{often referred}} to as ‘chaotic’, are widespread in the circum-Mediterranean collisional orogenic belts as well as in submerged Mediterranean Arcs. These rock types have been defined originally as ‘Argille scagliose’ (Bianconi, 1840) and ‘olistostromes’ (Flores, 1955, 1959) in the outcrops of the Apennine chain (Italy). Both terminology and concepts have undergone a rather complex evolution through time owing to the gradual recognition of similar chaotic bodies in all the circum-Mediterranean orogenic belts. Submarine mud volcanoes of the Mediterranean region, also composed by block-in-matrix, more commonly referred to as mud breccias, have a much younger history. These mud breccias were discovered in 1981 and, since then, a growing number of sea-going geophysical and geological expeditions have allowed the recognition of a major mud <b>volcano</b> <b>belt</b> in the Eastern Mediterranean and of a number of mud diapirs and mud volcano fields from the Black Sea to the Gulf of Cadiz. Structural, textural and genetic similarities between the mud breccias of the Mediterranean mud volcanoes and the olistostromes and Argille scagliose of the Apennines were noted from the very beginning, but the matter has not been the focus of any detailed study. In this paper, the use of the terms in the geological literature is analysed, the distribution of these rock units in the Mediterranean region explored and the assumed genetic processes are identified in order to formulate a common genetic model that {{can be applied to the}} evolution of the circum-Mediterranean sedimentary basins...|$|E
40|$|Fresh {{two-dimensional}} {{group and}} phase-velocity distribution {{maps of the}} Philippine Sea and surrounding areas are constructed using the tomographic inversion of more than 2500 Rayleigh-wave dispersion curves in the 20 - to 120 -sec period range. The results show that, for the periods used, both the group and phase-velocity variation patterns {{are very close to}} the geological and topographic features and are also consistent with previous studies of magnetic anomalies and evolutionary history of the Philippine Basin. On average, the periods of the peak group-velocity for the West Philippine Basin and the Oki-Daito ridge are about 40 and 32 sec for the Parece Vela and Shikoku basins. This implies that the lithosphere of the western Philippine Sea Basin is thicker, which is related to plate cooling and seafloor age. For most of the examined periods, the high velocity symmetry of {{the two sides of the}} Central Basin Ridge in the West Philippine Basin coincides well with the evolutionary history of the Philippine Sea Basin, and may be taken as additional evidence confirming the existence of the ridge. The group and phase-velocity distributions for periods longer than 80 sec are smooth throughout the whole Philippine Sea Basin, which implies that the upper mantle beneath the Philippine Sea Basin is nearly homogeneous at depths of 100 - 200 km. Moreover, the group and phase velocities in the region of the East <b>Volcano</b> <b>Belt</b> and Active Marginal Basin remain almost constant in the 36 - to 80 -sec period range, which indicates that the boundary between the lithosphere and asthenosphere is probably not obvious in this area...|$|E

25|$|The Chilcotin Group is a north-south {{range of}} volcanoes in {{southern}} British Columbia running {{parallel to the}} Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The majority of the eruptions in this belt happened either 6–10 million years ago (Miocene) or 2–3 million years ago (Pliocene), although with some slightly more recent eruptions (in the Pleistocene).

50|$|The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is the {{northern}} {{extension of the}} Cascade Arc.

The eruption styles within the belt range from effusive to explosive, with compositions from basalt to rhyolite. Due to repeated continental and alpine glaciations, many of the volcanic deposits in the belt reflect complex interactions between magma composition, topography, and changing ice configurations. Four <b>volcanoes</b> within the <b>belt</b> appear related to seismic activity since 1975, including: Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi and Mount Cayley.|$|R

5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi <b>Belt,</b> <b>volcanoes</b> in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are.

25|$|Volcanic {{activity}} of the main-arc began {{at the southern end}} of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt about 29million years ago during the middle Oligocene epoch.

The northward younging of Pemberton Belt volcanism indicates that a slab window edge was moving northward under British Columbia between at least the onset of arc volcanism 29million years ago and eruption of the northernmost volcano 6.8million years ago. The extensive Masset Formation on Haida Gwaii has been suggested by some scientists to be a northern extension of the Pemberton Volcanic Belt. However, the geochemistry and physical volcanology of the Masset Formation indicates that it formed in a rifting environment in contrast to other Pemberton Belt features.|$|R

50|$|The Andean Volcanic Belt {{is a major}} {{volcanic}} belt {{along the}} Andean cordillera in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.

The <b>volcanoes</b> of the <b>belt</b> are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences within volcanic zones and even between neighboring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for calc-alkalic and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of mid-ocean ridges and seamount chains apart from a large range on crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the {{evolution}} of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the links between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface temperatures. Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the control of CO 2 concentrations over geological timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. We estimate CO 2 concentrations of more than 2, 000 p. p. m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and ®nd an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO 2 outgassing from ocean ridges, <b>volcanoes</b> and metamorphic <b>belts</b> and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO 2 concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p. p. m. and were more stable than before, although transient intervals of CO 2 reduction may have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago...|$|R
