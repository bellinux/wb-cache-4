Two main indices are used: mean family size ("genetic fitness") and the complement of the extinction probability of the line ("evolutionary fitness"), both of which suppose a steady state. Point- and interval-estimates (the latter derived by an extension of Stigler's method) are furnished. It is estimated that the probability a new mutant gene will persist is one in four for Gardner syndrome, one in 20 for familial polyposis coli, and 0 for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. There is evidence of bimodality in family size, suggesting <b>voluntary</b> <b>infertility</b> in a proportion of subjects. The data confirm our provisional working assumption that most families are completed by the time women are in their mid- 40 's and men in their mid- 50 's...|$|E
