40|$|Quinoa (Chenopodium quinua Willd.) {{was first}} domesticated in Andean {{countries}} over 5 000 years ago. Following the Spanish conquest, quinoa was rejected and scorned as "Indian food". Its potential was rediscovered {{during the second}} half of the twentieth century and, since then, the number of countries growing quinoa has risen from 6 to 13, while 23 other countries are in the process of actively experimenting before launching field production in the near future. Another 20 countries are planning to plant quinoa for the first time in 2014. The organization of research has had a powerful impact, creating links and strategic partnerships between countries as is the case of the worldwide CIP/DANIDA programme in the 1990 s or, more recently, with trials conducted by the European project SWUP-MED around the Mediterranean Sea. By networking researchers around the world, countries form partnerships based on affinities. One example is the United Kingdom which has established special contacts with India, Australia, China and Nepal. Today, experimentation centres are to be found in new countries that did not previously import quinoa. Although most publications of scientific findings are based on studies carried out in the Andean countries (Bolivia and Peru in particular), research is spreading around the world with studies conducted in new areas such as virology, dietetics, or quinoa processing for uses other than food. South American countries must now face global competition for the enhancement of quinoa varieties and must reflect upon possible competition between countries to access new markets. This is why some of them have already adopted the plant <b>variety</b> <b>certificate</b> (COV) system to protect their improved varieties, or they are in the process of applying for certificates. This paves the way for the conservation of plant genetic resources through recognition of local farmers' varieties and their use in future enhancement programmes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

50|$|Plant <b>variety</b> <b>certificates</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with plant patents. The Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) and the Plant Patent Act of 1930 provide protection based on different types of plant reproductive strategies. The PVPA, which authorizes plant <b>variety</b> protection <b>certificates,</b> protects sexually reproduced and tuber propagated plants, whereas the Plant Patent Act, which authorizes plant patents, is limited to asexually reproduced plants, excluding tuber propagated plants. However, the same plant may be protected under both the Plant Variety Protection Act and the Plant Patent Act of 1930. The most appropriate means of protection may be decided by the applicant based on the applicant's business requirements.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{an empirical}} {{assessment of the}} incentive effects of plant variety protection regimes in the generation of crop variety innovations. A duration model of plant <b>variety</b> protection <b>certificates</b> is used to infer the private appropriability of returns from agricultural crop variety innovations in the UK over the period 1965 - 2000. The results suggest that plant variety protection provides only modest appropriability of returns to innovators of agricultural crop varieties. The val- ue distribution of plant <b>variety</b> protection <b>certificates</b> is highly skewed with {{a large proportion of}} innovations providing virtually no returns to innovators. Increasing competition from newer varieties appears to have accelerated the turnover of varie- ties reducing appropriability further. Plant variety protection emerges as a relatively weak instrument of protection...|$|R

50|$|A plant {{may also}} be {{eligible}} for protection under the Patent Act of 1952, as long as patentability requirements are met.

The landmark Supreme Court decision of Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), suggested the possibility of securing utility patents on plants previously thought eligible solely for protection under the PVPA. Two decades later, in the 2001 decision of J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v.
