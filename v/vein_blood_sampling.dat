However, release of cortisol by 11 beta-HSD 1 from adipose tissue {{and its effect}} on portal vein cortisol concentrations have not been quantified in vivo.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the value of}} pancreatic stone protein in predicting sepsis-related postoperative complications and death in the ICU. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of postoperative patients admitted to the ICU. Blood samples for analysis were taken within 3 hours from admission to the ICU including pancreatic stone protein, white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6, and procalcitonin. The Mannheim Peritonitis Index and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II clinical scores were also determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to {{determine the}} diagnostic accuracy and independent predictors {{of death in the}} ICU [Clinicaltrials. gov, NCT 01465711]. SETTING: An adult medical-surgical ICU in a teaching hospital in Germany. PATIENTS: Ninety-one consecutive postoperative patients with proven diagnosis of secondary peritonitis admitted to the ICU were included in the study from August 17, 2007, to February 8, 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Peripheral <b>vein</b> <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated that pancreatic stone protein has the highest diagnostic accuracy for complications and is the best predictor for death in the ICU.

By multivariate analysis, pancreatic stone protein was the only independent predictor of death.

40|$|An {{acute phase}} {{response}} was previously found in cows at parturition, {{which might be}} associated with uterine cytokine release. Five late pregnant cows were implanted with vascular catheters in both the maternal aorta and uterine <b>vein.</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>samples</b> were taken to study temporal relationships between changing plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the periparturient acute phase response following prostaglandin (PG) -induced luteolysis at Day 275 of gestation. The plasma levels of three proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), as well as progesterone (P 4), PGFM and serum amyloid A (SAA) were measured every 4 h between PG induction and expulsion of the calf. In the arterial plasma, progesterone levels dropped to baseline levels within 10 h following PG treatment, indicative of complete luteolysis. Contrary to expectations, the uterine vein samples showed lower proinflammatory cytokine levels compared with the maternal aorta values. A classical acute phase response, as assessed by SAA, was observed during the expulsive stage, but not during luteolysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this pilot {{study was to examine}} {{differences}} in gene expressions by cDNA microarray analysis of hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS) patients. <b>Vein</b> <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were collected and total RNA was extracted. All <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained in the morning in one visit after a standard light breakfast. We performed microarray analysis with the labeled cDNA prepared by reverse transcription from RNA samples, using the Human CHIP version 1 (DNA Chip Research Inc, Yokohama, Japan). There are 2, 976 genes on the chip, and these genes were selected from a cDNA library prepared with human peripheral white blood cells (WBC). Different gene levels between the HAVS patients and controls, and between groups of HAVS with different levels of symptoms, were indicated by the randomized variance model. The most up-regulated genes were analyzed for their possible functions and association with the occurrence of HAVS. From the results of this pilot study, although the results were obtained a limited number of subjects, it would appear that cDNA microarray analysis of HAVS patients has potential as a new objective method of HAVS diagnosis. Further research is needed to examine the gene expression with increased numbers of patients at different stages of HAVS.
