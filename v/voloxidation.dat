In one experiment in the USA, fresh fuel which had not been allowed to decay was reprocessed (the Green run http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7296321 http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/381/3733.html http://archive.tri-cityherald.com/thyroid/history.html) to investigate {{the effects of a}} large iodine release from the reprocessing of short cooled fuel.

The tests examined the effects of temperature and of the rate of oxygen supply on the release of gaseous and semivolatile fission products, while the fuel fragments were tumbled at 12 rpm during <b>voloxidation</b> - the high-temperature oxidation of UO{sub 2 } to U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }.

40|$|<b>Voloxidation</b> is a {{potential}} head-end process used prior to aqueous or pyrochemical spent-oxide-fuel treatment. The spent oxide fuel is heated to an elevated temperature in oxygen or air to promote separation of the fuel from the cladding as well as volatize the fission products. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) have been collaborating on <b>voloxidation</b> research through a joint International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (I-NERI). A new furnace and off-gas trapping system (OTS) with enhanced capability was necessary to perform further testing. The design criteria for the OTS were jointly agreed upon by INL and KAERI. First, the equipment must accommodate the use of spent nuclear fuel and be capable of operating in the Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF) at the INL. This primarily means the furnace and OTS must be remotely operational and maintainable. The system requires special filters and distinctive temperature zones so that the fission products can be uniquely captured. The OTS must be sealed to maximize the amount of fission products captured. Finally, to accommodate the largest range of operating conditions, the OTS must be capable of handling high temperatures and various oxidizing environments. The constructed system utilizes a vertical split-tube furnace with four independently controlled zones. One zone is capable of reaching 1200 °C to promote the release of volatile fission products. The three additional zones that capture fission products can be controlled to operate between 100 - 1100 °C. A {{detailed description of the}} OTS will be presented as well as some initial background information on high temperature seal options...|$|E
40|$|The {{head-end}} {{processing of}} the Coupled-End-to-End (CETE) Demonstration includes fuel receipt, fuel disassembly, exposure of fuel (e. g., by segmenting the fuel pins), <b>voloxidation</b> {{of the fuel}} to separate tritium, and fuel dissolution. All of these processing steps {{with the exception of}} the dissolution step will be accomplished in the Irradiated Fuels Examination Laboratory (IFEL) (Building 3525). The final headend step will be performed in the Radiochemical Engineering Development Center (Building 7920). The primary purpose of the fuel dissolution step is to prepare the solid fuel for subsequent liquid separations steps. This is accomplished by dissolving the fuel solids using nitric acid. During the dissolution process gases are evolved. Oxides of nitrogen are the primary off-gas components generated by the reactions of nitric acid and the fuel oxides however, during the dissolution and sparging of the resulting solution, iodine, C- 14 as carbon dioxide, xenon, and krypton gasses are also released to the off-gas stream. The Dissolver Off-gas treatment rack provides a means of trapping these volatile fission products and other gases via various trapping media. Specifically the rack will recover iodine on a solid sorbent bed, scrub NOx in a water/acid column, scrub CO{sub 2 } in a caustic scrubber column, remove moisture with solid sorbent drier beds and recover Xe and Kr using solid absorbent beds. The primary purpose of this experimental rack and the off-gas rack associated with the <b>voloxidation</b> equipment located at IFEL is to close the material balances around the volatile gases and to provide an understanding of the impacts of specific processing conditions on the fractions of the volatile components released from the various head-end processing steps...|$|E
40|$|About 50 % of the tritium {{put through}} an LWR {{reprocessing}} plant is obtained as tritium-bearing water, HTO. Gaseous tritium, HT, has a radiotoxicity which is by 4 {{orders of magnitude}} {{lower than that of}} HTO. A possibility for the removal of HTO could therefore be its conversion into the gas phase with subsequent emission of the HT into the atmosphere. However, model computations which are, in part, supported by experimental data reveal that the radiation exposure caused by HT release is only by about one order of magnitude below that caused by HTO. This is being attributed to the relatively quick reoxidation of HT by soil bacteria. Two alternatives for producing HT from HTO (electrolysis; <b>voloxidation</b> with subsequent electrolysis) are presented and compared with the reference process of deep-well injection of HTO. The authors {{come to the conclusion that}} tritium removal by HT release into the atmosphere cannot be recommended at present under either radiological or economic aspects...|$|E

No significant technical problems were encountered in batch-dissolving of either form. Dissolution rates were well-controlled in all tests. Significant characteristics of U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 } dissolution that differed from UO{sub 2 } dissolution included: (1) reduced tritium and ruthenium ({sup 106 }Ru) concentrations in product solutions, (2) increased insoluble noble metal fission product residue (about 2. 2 X greater), and (3) increased insoluble plutonium in the fission product residue.

40|$|AbstractRepository {{programs}} {{throughout the}} world have been slowed by the need for increased local public involvement in the siting and licensing process. The result has been an increase in the dry storage of used fuel at reactor sites and the potential that such storage may be extended for many decades, even centuries. While there are sound technical reasons to believe that dry storage can be conducted safely, there are increasing concerns that the ultimate transfer to either a future repository or a centralized separations plant may result in fractured cladding and serious handling issues, including criticality concerns. These concerns would be increased for higher burn-up fuels. Currently, various chemical pre-treatment processes under R&D for application to commercial used oxide fuel have been investigated at the laboratory scale as methods to simplify and increase the safety of the remaining stages of conventional solvent extraction processing. This includes advanced decladding methods and various oxidation/reduction processes designed to release volatile and semi-volatile fission products, produce finely divided uranium oxide powder, and ameliorate the subsequent nitric acid dissolution step. The paper examines the potential for combining several chemical and physical pre-treatment steps to minimize long-term concerns about safe transport of used fuel, possibly providing another option for future nuclear waste management. Laboratory data from both cold and hot testing will provide the basis for the evaluation. An example of a potential pre-treatment process includes shearing, advanced <b>voloxidation</b> and off-gas treatment, the possible mixing of the resulting uranium oxide with a secondary oxide, and densification and recanning in nitric acid-soluble storage containers for extended time periods. Chemical decladding may be feasible to replace shearing. Zirconium recycle may also be feasible, significantly reducing high level waste quantities.

40|$|The Epsilon-metal ({var_epsilon}-metal) {{phase was}} {{selected}} in FY 2009 {{as a potential}} waste form to for immobilizing the noble metals found in the undissolved solids + aqueous stream, and the soluble Tc from ion-exchange process, each resulting from proposed aqueous reprocessing. {var_epsilon}-metal phase is observed in used nuclear fuel and the natural reactors of Oklobono in Gabon, where the long-term corrosion behavior was demonstrated. This makes {var_epsilon}-metal a very attractive waste form. Last fiscal year, {var_epsilon}-metal was successfully fabricated by combining the five-metals, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd and Re (surrogate for Tc), into pellets followed by consolidation with an arc melter. The arc melter produced fully dense samples with the epsilon structure. However, some chemistry differences were observed in the microstructure that resulted in regions rich in Re and Mo, and others rich in Pd, while Ru and Rh remained fairly constant throughout. This year, thermal stability (air), and corrosion testing of the samples fabricated by arc melting were the main focus for experimental work. Thermal stability was measured with a differential scanning calorimeter - thermogravimetric analyzer, by both ramp heating as well as step heating. There is clear evidence during the ramp heating experiment of an exothermic event + a weight loss peak both beginning at {approx} 700 C. Step heating showed an oxidation event at {approx} 690 C with minimal weight gain that occurs just before the weight loss event at 700 C. The conclusion being that the e-metal begins to oxidize and then become volatile. These findings are useful for considering the effects of <b>voloxidation</b> process. Three different pellets were subjected to electrochemical testing to study the corrosion behavior of the epsilon-metal phase in various conditions, namely acidic, basic, saline, and inert. Test was done according to an interim procedure developed for the alloy metal waste form. First an open circuit potential was measured, followed by linear polarization sweeps. The linear polarization sweep range was the Tafel equation was fit to the linear polarization sweep data to determine the corrosion rate of each pellet in each test solution. The average calculated corrosion rates of the three pellets according to solution conditions were: - 1. 91 x 10 {sup - 4 } mm/yr (0. 001 M NaOH), - 1. 48 x 10 {sup - 3 } mm/yr (0. 01 M NaCl), - 8. 77 x 10 {sup - 4 } mm/yr (0. 001 M H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }), - 2. 09 x 10 {sup - 3 } mm/yr (0. 001 M NaOH + 0. 01 M NaCl), and - 1. 54 x 10 {sup - 3 } mm/yr (0. 001 M H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } + 0. 01 M NaCl). Three single-pass flow through (SPFT) test were conducted at a flow rate of 10 ml/day, at 90 C, and pH of 2. 5, 7. 0, and 9. 0 for up to 322 days. Results of the tests indicate that dissolution rates were 5 x 10 {sup - 4 } g m{sup 2 } d{sup - 1 } at pH 9. 0, 1. 2 x 10 {sup - 4 } g m{sup - 2 } d{sup - 1 } at pH 7. 0, and 2 x 10 {sup - 4 } g m{sup - 2 } d{sup - 1 } at pH 2. 5. The sample used for the pH 7. 0 SPFT test contains extra Re compared to samples used for the other two SPFT test, which came from a single pellet. The corrosion data measured this year indicate that the {var_epsilon}-metal phase is chemically durable. The two chemically different phases, but structurally the same, behave differently during dissolution according to the microstructure changes observed in both the electrochemical and in SPFT test. Characterization of the test specimens after testing suggests that the dissolution is complex and involves oxidative dissolution followed by precipitation of both oxide and metallic phases.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of the {{non-uniform}} nuclide composition in spent fuel on material accountancy in the pyroprocess. High-fidelity depletion simulations are performed using the Monte Carlo code SERPENT in order to determine nuclide composition as a function of axial and radial position within fuel rods and assemblies, and burnup. For improved accuracy, the simulations use short burnups step (25 days or less), Xe-equilibrium treatment (to avoid oscillations over burnup steps), axial moderator temperature distribution, and 30 axial meshes. Analytical solutions of the simplified depletion equations are built to understand the axial non-uniformity of nuclide composition in spent fuel. The cosine shape of axial neutron flux distribution dominates the axial non-uniformity of the nuclide composition. Combined cross sections and time also generate axial non-uniformity, as the exponential term in the analytical solution consists of the neutron flux, cross section and time. The axial concentration distribution for a nuclide having the small cross section gets steeper than that for another nuclide having the great cross section because the axial flux is weighted by the cross section in the exponential term in the analytical solution. Similarly, the non-uniformity becomes flatter as increasing burnup, because the time term in the exponential increases. Based on the developed numerical recipes and decoupling of the results between the axial distributions and the predetermined representative radial distributions by matching the axial height, the axial and radial composition distributions for representative spent nuclear fuel assemblies, the Type- 0, - 1, and - 2 assemblies after 1, 2, and 3 depletion cycles, is obtained. These data are appropriately modified to depict processing for materials in the head-end process of pyroprocess that is chopping, <b>voloxidation</b> and granulation. The expectation and standard deviation of the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio by the single granule sampling calculated by the central limit theorem and the Geary-Hinkley transformation. Then, the uncertainty propagation through the key-pyroprocess is conducted to analyze the Material Unaccounted For (MUF), which is a random variable defined as a receipt minus a shipment of a process, in the system. Finally, the Type-I error for the Pu MUF is evaluated for spent fuel assemblies with respect the size of granules and powders which are the key parameters to evaluate the uncertainty in determining ratio by sampling. The main observations of this calculation are the following: (1) the probabilities of Type-I error for the Pu MUF are occasionally greater than 5 % when the size of powder particles and granules are large and small; (2) the possibility of Type-I error greater than 5 % increases by increasing the depletion period, because the increasing production of Pu and 244 Cm with increasing burnup propagates the uncertainty through the system; (3) the major contributor to the uncertainty of ratio is the non-uniformity of 244 Cm; (4) Pu generation in the Type- 2 spent fuel assemblies is greater that in the others due to higher gadolinia bearing fuel (GBF) loading in the assembly, therefore, the area indicating the probability of Type-I error {{greater than or equal to}} 5 % is the widest among the figures for the Type- 0 and - 1 spent fuel assemblies. The random variable, LOPu, is defined for evaluating the non-detection probability at each Key Measurement Point (KMP) as the original Pu mass minus the Pu mass after a missing scenario. A number of assemblies for the LOPu to be 8 kg is considered in this calculation. The probability of detection for the 8 kg LOPu is evaluated with respect the size of granule and powder using the event tree analysis and the hypothesis testing method. We can observe there are possible cases showing the probability of detection for the 8 kg LOPu less than 95 %. In order to enhance the detection rate, a new Material Balance Area (MBA) model is defined for the key-pyroprocess. The probabilities of detection for all spent fuel types based on the new MBA model are greater than 99 %. Furthermore, it is observed that the probability of detection significantly increases by increasing granule sample sizes to evaluate the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio before the key-pyroprocess. Based on these observations, even though the Pu material accountability in pyroprocess is affected by the non-uniformity of nuclide composition when the Pu-to- 244 Cm-ratio method is being applied, that is surmounted by decreasing the uncertainty of measured ratio by increasing sample sizes and modifying the MBAs and KMPs...|$|E
