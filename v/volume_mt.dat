40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively measure {{magnetization}} transfer (MT) parameters, {{along with}} established atrophy parameters, {{in patients with}} Alzheimer disease (AD) and in age- and sex-matched control subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants provided informed consent, and additional assent was obtained from next of kin of all patients with AD. The study {{was approved by the}} local ethics committee. Fourteen patients with AD (seven men; mean age, 67. 2 years+/- 6. 5 [standard deviation]) and 14 control subjects (nine men; mean age, 65. 5 years+/- 9. 4) underwent volumetric T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance and MT imaging. Whole-brain and total hippocampal volumes were adjusted for total intracranial <b>volume.</b> <b>MT</b> images were processed to derive four fundamental parameters in the hippocampal region by using the two-pool model of the MT phenomenon. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between volumetric and MT parameters and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) results. Logistic regression models were used to investigate whether combinations of parameters associated with MMSE could help provide better group discrimination. RESULTS: Patients with AD had significantly reduced whole-brain (P=. 001) and total hippocampal (P<. 001) volumes compared with those of control subjects. Two MT parameters were significantly reduced in the hippocampal region of patients: 1 /(RAT 2 A) [...] that is, ratio of relaxation times of free proton pool, where RA equals 1 /T 1 A and is the inverse of the longitudinal relaxation time of the free proton pool (P=. 01) [...] and f*b, which equals fb/[RA(1 -fb) ], where fb is the restricted proton fraction (P<. 001). Among patients with AD, whole-brain volume and hippocampal were correlated with MMSE results. When both parameters were included in a logistic regression model, only hippocampal was significantly associated with case-control status (P=. 03). CONCLUSION: Certain MT parameters may serve as useful biomarkers of AD...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} effect of doxycycline treatment on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarker of cartilage volume loss, and on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in a guinea pig osteoarthritis model. Guinea pigs (9 months old) were dosed with vehicle or doxycycline, 0. 6, 3. 0 mg/kg/day for 66 days. Fat-suppressed 3 D gradient-echo MRI of the left knee was acquired pre- and post dosing. Change in medial tibial plateau (MTP) cartilage <b>volume</b> (<b>MT.</b> VC) was determined using image analysis. At termination, MTP cartilage was removed from knees and proteolytic MMP activity determined using a fluorescent peptide substrate assay. Vehicle-treated animals lost 20. 5 % (95 % CI mean 25. 6 – 15. 1) MT. VC. The doxycycline (0. 6 mg/kg/day) group lost 8. 6 % (P < 0. 05, 95 % CI 20. 6 to − 5. 3) whilst the 3. 0 mg/kg/day group lost 10. 0 % (P < 0. 05, 95 % CI 13. 9 – 6. 0 %). Endogenous levels of active MMPs were below limits of detection in all samples. However, doxycycline treatment ablated amino phenyl mercuric acid activated MMP- 13 and MMP- 8 levels, reduced MMP- 9 levels by 65 % and MMP- 1 levels by 24 %. Doxycycline treatment resulted in partial protection from MT. VC loss and was associated with complete reduction in MMP- 13 and MMP- 8, and partial reduction in MMP- 9 activity. These data imply a role of MMPs in cartilage degeneration but incomplete protection suggests that additional doxycycline insensitive mechanisms are important in this model. The protective effect of doxycycline correlates with the clinical finding of lessened joint space narrowing, strengthens the utility of this animal model in identifying disease-modifying osteoarthritic drugs and supports the use of MRI biomarkers of cartilage loss...|$|E

This preliminary study quantifies maxillary sinus MT in children with surgically repaired unilateral CLP. We hypothesize that maxillary sinus MT is increased in children with CLP relative to controls. We define "MT" as {{the difference between the}} entire maxillary sinus volume and airspace volume. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of 8 - 14 yr. old age- and sex-matched unilateral CLP patients (n = 10) and controls (n = 10) were obtained (IRB approval # 1210009813). Both maxillary sinus and airspace surface areas (SAs) were measured on each individual CBCT slice in coronal view. SA measurements were summed and multiplied by voxel size (0. 4 mm) to obtain a volume. Paired t-tests determined whether maxillary sinus volume, air <b>volume,</b> <b>MT</b> (i. e. maxillary sinus volume – airspace volume), and percentage of MT (i. e. MT/maxillary size x 100) differed. A p-value of ≤ 0. 05 was considered significant. Intra-class correlation assessed reliability and was high (0. 99). Significant differences were found for several measurements: Maxillary airspace (non-cleft side vs. right side control p-value = 0. 002; cleft-side vs. left side control p-value = 0. 004), MT (cleft-side vs. left side p-value = 0. 009), and percentage of MT (non-cleft side vs. right side control p-value = 0. 002, cleft-side vs. left side control p-value = 0. 002). Maxillary airspace was decreased by 30 % (non-cleft side) and by 33 % (cleft side). Percentage of average MT was 40 % (non-cleft side) and 42 % (cleft side) of CLP patients, but only 9 % (left and right side) in controls. Surgically repaired CLP patients exhibit decreased maxillary airspace and increased MT relative to controls.

BACKGROUND: WS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes premature aging. The CNS involvement in this disease is still debated. METHODS: Two siblings who showed signs of neurological involvement underwent MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. Also, on conventional T 1 -weighted MR images, measurements of total brain volume were performed. RESULTS: Conventional MR images of both WS patients did not show abnormalities on visual inspection. However, both WS patients showed significantly lower values of normalized total brain <b>volume</b> and <b>MT</b> ratio in the white matter than age-matched normal controls. Also, proton MRSI showed significantly lower values of central brain NAA/Cr in WS patients than in normal controls.

METHODS: Asymptomatic first-degree relatives of sporadic (sMS, n = 152) and familial MS (fMS, n = 88) and healthy volunteers (NC, n = 56) underwent brain MRI and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging on a mobile MR scan. On MR examinations, we visually assessed white matter (WM) lesions and quantified WM lesion volumes, brain <b>volumes,</b> and <b>MT</b> ratio (MTr) in lesions and normal-appearing WM (NAWM). RESULTS: A lesional MR pattern {{similar to that of}} MS patients was found in 4 % sMS and 10 % fMS. In these WM lesions, MTr was lower (p < 0. 0001) than in the WM of NC. In contrast, {{there was no difference in}} NAWM-MTr and brain volume values between the three groups. INTERPRETATION: Focal brain abnormalities indistinguishable from those of MS occur in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of MS patients. These are twice more frequent in fMS than in sMS but do not lead to the widespread tissue damage commonly found in MS patients.

It is also known that a CYP 2 C 9 mutation (* 2 or * 3) reduces phenytoin metabolism by 25 – 50 % and can increase the risk of phenytoin-related side effects. We examined the influence of CYP 2 C 9 polymorphisms on total cerebellar volume and cerebellar gray and white matter volumes in patients with epilepsy taking phenytoin. MethodsFor the genotyping, 100 adult patients with documented epilepsy who had been taking phenytoin for > 1 year were selected. From this group, we randomly selected 19 mutant individuals (MT group; CYP 2 C 9 * 2 and * 3) for a whole-brain volume measurement using MRI and 19 wild-type individuals (group WT; CYP 2 C 9 * 1) with similar clinical and demographic characteristics to those in the MT group for comparison.

40|$|Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} {{pathological process}} that is thought to begin years prior to observable symptom onset. The hippocampus appears to be particularly vulnerable to the underlying brain pathology of AD. Hippocampal volume is a sensitive measure in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD, but less is known {{regarding the use of}} hippocampal volume in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD who eventually decline. The inconsistent findings may, in part, be due to the chosen method of hippocampal segmentation. FreeSurfer (FS) and manual tracings (MT) are two common segmentation techniques that have unique costs and benefits. The present study directly compared hippocampal volumes generated by FS and MT in a longitudinal design assessing cognitively healthy elders, with varying degree of risk for AD, over a 4. 5 -year period. After 4. 5 years, 15 participants demonstrated cognitive decline, while 45 remained stable. The results suggest FS consistently produced larger hippocampal <b>volumes</b> than <b>MT,</b> but neither method distinguished between groups at baseline. Longitudinally, individuals who declined experienced a more progressive pattern of atrophy compared to those who remained stable. These data suggest that hippocampal volume over time may be a useful variable in determining cognitive change over time, with the addition of other known risk factors, such as genetic risk. This study also suggests that in presymptomatic individuals, MT may not provide added benefit over the use of the more cost-effective FS...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{improve the}} {{characterization}} of asymptomatic subjects with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition named as "radiologically isolated syndrome" (RIS). METHODS: Quantitative MRI metrics such as brain volumes and magnetization transfer (MT) were assessed in 19 subjects previously classified as RIS, 20 demographically-matched relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 20 healthy controls (HC). Specific measures were: white matter (WM) lesion volumes (LV), total and regional brain <b>volumes,</b> and <b>MT</b> ratio (MTr) in lesions, normal-appearing WM (NAWM) and cortex. RESULTS: LV was similar in RIS and RRMS, without differences in distribution and frequency at lesion mapping. Brain volumes were similarly lower in RRMS and RIS than in HC (p< 0. 001). Lesional-MTr was lower in RRMS than in RIS (p =  0. 048); NAWM-MTr and cortical-MTr were similar in RIS and HC and lower (p< 0. 01) in RRMS. These values were particularly lower in RRMS than in RIS in the sensorimotor and memory networks. A {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} showed that 13 / 19 RIS had ≥ 70 % probability of being classified as RRMS {{on the basis of their}} brain volume and lesional-MTr values. CONCLUSIONS: Macroscopic brain damage was similar in RIS and RRMS. However, the subtle tissue damage detected by MTr was milder in RIS than in RRMS in clinically relevant brain regions, suggesting an explanation for the lack of clinical manifestations of subjects with RIS. This new approach could be useful for narrowing down the RIS individuals with a high risk of progression to MS...|$|R

BACKGROUND: The definition of B-MS is controversial. Recent data suggest that neuropsychological tests and MRI measures can provide valuable information for a more correct definition and interpretation of B-MS. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with B-MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] or = 15 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment using the Rao's Brief Repeatable Neuropsychological Battery and the Stroop Test. At that time, conventional brain MRI and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging was performed. White matter lesion load, global and regional brain <b>volumes,</b> and <b>MT</b> ratio in lesions and normal-appearing brain were measured. After a mean follow-up of 5 years, patients still having an EDSS score or = 4. 0 were defined as no longer benign (NLB). RESULTS: At end of follow-up, 29 % of patients were classified as NLB. Male gender (hazard ratio [HR] = 2. 9; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2 - 7. 5; p = 0. 02), number of neuropsychological tests failed (HR = 1. 4; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 1. 7; p = 0. 003), and T 1 -weighted lesions (HR = 1. 3; 95 % CI 1. 1 - 1. 5; p = 0. 002) were related to NLB status.

OBJECTIVES: To assess, by using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) metrics, differences in tissue damage between B-MS patients after dividing them into two groups {{on the basis of their}} cognitive performance. METHODS: Forty-seven B-MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale score /= 15 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment through the Rao Brief Repeatable Battery and the Stroop Test. At that time, B-MS patients underwent conventional brain MR and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. White matter lesion load, global and regional brain <b>volumes,</b> and <b>MT</b> ratio (MTr) in lesions and normal-appearing brain were measured. Quantitative MR measures were compared in cognitively impaired (CI-MS) and cognitively preserved (CP-MS) patients and in 24 demographically matched healthy controls. Test performance was correlated with MR changes in specific cortical regions. RESULTS: Eleven patients were classified as CI-MS, and 36 were classified as CP-MS. Both T 2 -weighted and T 1 -weighted lesion loads were higher (p = 0. 05 and 0. 001) in CI-MS than in CP-MS patients. Furthermore, CI-MS patients were characterized by more pronounced decrease in neocortical volume (p = 0. 005) and cortical MTr (p = 0. 02) values than CP-MS patients.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of hazard arising from volcanic eruptions {{is a research}} topic {{of great interest to}} New Zealand, given the number and location of active and dormant volcanoes. Probabilistic temporal models are required to handle the stochastic nature of observed records. Such models are usually assembled using point process techniques or renewal theory and most are purely temporal {{in the sense that they}} only consider the distribution of event or inter-event times as predictors of further volcanic activity. I demonstrate using a high-resolution eruption record from Mt Taranaki (New Zealand) how geochemical data can be incorporated, using a proportional hazards type approach, to improve the performance of current renewal-type models. Probabilistic forecasting relies on the accuracy and completeness of historical eruption records. This poses the question of how to establish a detailed record of past volcanic events. Multiple sites are needed to build a composite tephra record, but correctly merging them by recognizing events in common and site-speci c gaps remains complex. I present an automated procedure for matching tephra sequences, using stochastic local optimization techniques. Implausible matches are eliminated through careful reasoning, while heuristically searching over the remaining alternatives. Possible matches are veri ed using known tephra compositions and stratigraphic constraints. The method is applied to match tephra records from ve long sediment cores in Auckland, New Zealand. The correlated record compiled is statistically more likely than previously published arrangements from this area. In addition to the matching of tephras found in the Auckland region, the algorithm is applied to stratigraphic records obtained from Mt Taranaki. With more detailed geochemical information available, matches are constrained further by considering principle component analysis of titanomagnetite compositional data. Finally, after combining the amalgamated record of Mt Taranaki events with point thickness measurements, the eruptive <b>volume</b> of <b>Mt</b> Taranaki events is estimated. Utilizing isopach maps and individual point observations a model is formulated, in a Bayesian framework, for the thicknesses of tephra deposits as a function of the distance and angular direction of each location.

40|$|Abstract. The microtubule-depolymerizing drug Nocodazole {{has been}} used to {{experimentally}} manipulate the form of PC 12 neurites. Both time-lapse photography and serial electron microscopy demonstrate that microtubule depolymerization leads to varicosity formation due to a clustering of membranous organelles in young neurites (nerve growth factor activated within 7 d). Neurites that have been nerve growth factor activated 7 or more d before Nocodazole application are resistant to microtubule depolymerization. These data and data from previous papers has been combined in an attempt to predict quantitatively the volume and the shape of a neurite. The relationship is described mathematically by Vn = 4. 52 Vo + 0. 0054 MT/, where Vn is local neurite volume, Vo is organelle <b>volume,</b> and MT/is <b>MT</b> length (the constant, 0. 0054 is lxm 2), and 4. 52 is the obligatory volume constant derived from serial electron microscopic studies.

This study examined associations among IMAT content, IMCL saturation, and fasting glucose concentration in middle-aged and older adults with overweight or obesity. MethodsSeventy-five subjects (26 males, 49 females) were recruited and thigh muscle and IMAT were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Vastus lateralis tissue was acquired from a subset of nine subjects and IMCL content and saturation were assessed using nonlinear dual complex microscopy. ResultsThe characteristics of the 75 subjects were as follows: age 59 ± 11 years, body mass index 30 ± 5 kg/m 2, fasting glucose concentration 5. 2 ± 0. 5 mmol/L, fasting insulin concentration 12. 2 ± 7. 3 µU/mL, fasting homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 2. 9 ± 2. 0 (mean±SD).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{patients}} with subacute {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI), the motor system undergoes progressive structural changes rostral to the lesion, which are associated with motor outcome. The {{extent to which the}} sensory system is affected and how this relates to sensory outcome are uncertain. METHODS: Changes in the sensory system were prospectively followed by applying a comprehensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol to 14 {{patients with}} subacute traumatic SCI at baseline, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months after injury, combined with a full neurological examination and comprehensive pain assessment. Eighteen controls underwent the same MRI protocol. T 1 -weighted volumes, myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer saturation (MT), and longitudinal relaxation rate (R 1) mapping provided data on spinal cord and brain morphometry and microstructure. Regression analysis assessed the relationship between MRI readouts and sensory outcomes. RESULTS: At 12 months from baseline, sensory scores were unchanged and below-level neuropathic pain became prominent. Compared with controls, patients showed progressive degenerative changes in cervical cord and brain morphometry across the sensory system. At 12 months, MT and R 1 were reduced in areas of structural decline. Sensory scores at 12 months correlated with rate of change in cord area and brain <b>volume</b> and decreased <b>MT</b> in the spinal cord at 12 months. INTERPRETATION: This study has demonstrated progressive atrophic and microstructural changes across the sensory system with a close relation to sensory outcome. Structural MRI protocols remote from the site of lesion provide new insights into neuronal degeneration underpinning sensory disturbance and have potential as responsive biomarkers of rehabilitation and treatment interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background—Mitochondria are {{key players}} in the {{development}} and progression of heart failure (HF). Mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction leads to diminished energy production and increased cell death contributing to the progression of left ventricular failure. The fundamental mechanisms that underlie mt dysfunction in HF have not been fully elucidated. Methods and Results—To characterize mt morphology, biogenesis, and genomic integrity in human HF, we investigated left ventricular tissue from nonfailing hearts and end-stage ischemic (ICM) or dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathic hearts. Although mt dysfunction was present in both types of cardiomyopathy, mt were smaller and increased in number in DCM compared with ICM or nonfailing hearts. <b>mt</b> <b>volume</b> density and mtDNA copy number was increased by ≈ 2 -fold (P< 0. 001) in DCM hearts in comparison with ICM hearts. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the expression of mtDNA-encoded genes in DCM versus no change in ICM. mtDNA repair and antioxidant genes were reduced in failing hearts, suggestive of a defective repair and protection system, which may account for the 4. 1 -fold increase in mtDNA deletion mutations in DCM (P< 0. 05 versus nonfailing hearts, P< 0. 05 versus ICM). Conclusions—In DCM, mt dysfunction is associated with mtDNA damage and deletions, which could be a consequence of mutating stress coupled with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α–dependent stimulus for mt biogenesis. However, this maladaptive compensatory response contributes to additional oxidative damage. Thus, our findings support further investigations into novel mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for mt dysfunction in DCM. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{overexploitation}} in global fisheries is well-recognized. However, published assessment of fisheries spatio-temporal trends {{at the national}} scale is lacking for many high biodiversity developing countries, which is problematic since fisheries management is often implemented at the local or national levels. Here, we present the long-term spatio-temporal trends of Philippine fisheries production based on the landed national fish catch data (1980 - 2012) and fishers’ interviews. We found that the total Philippine fish catch <b>volume</b> (Metric Tons <b>MT)</b> of most capture fisheries throughout the country has either stagnated or declined {{over the last three}} decades. The decline is even more prominent when evaluating fisheries trends at the provincial level, suggesting spatial serial depletion of the country’s fisheries. In contrast, the total Philippine fish catch value (US Dollars US$ or Philippine Pesos PHP) has continued to increase over time, despite the declining fish catch volume. However, local municipal fishers are experiencing both low fish catch and income, contributing to observable poverty in many coastal communities in the Philippines. The various stakeholders of Philippine fisheries need to recognize the depleted state of Philippine fisheries, and learn from various experiences of collapsed and recovered fisheries from around the world, in order to recover the Philippines’ capture fisheries. Lessons from the literature on collapsed fisheries offer the following options for recovery: (1) regulate or reduce fisheries exploitation and other human activities impacting the fisheries to allow fisheries to rebuild or recover, (2) enforce effective networks of marine reserves, (3) engage fishers, consumers, and other stakeholders in fisheries management, (4) improve fisheries science, monitoring, and management capacities, and (5) provide alternative livelihood, skills, and improved education to fishers and their families...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} in-vivo {{characterization of}} subcortical brain structures is essential {{not only to}} understand the basic organizational principles of the healthy brain {{but also for the}} study of the involvement of the basal ganglia in brain disorders. The particular tissue properties of basal ganglia - most importantly their high iron content, strongly affect the contrast of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, hampering the accurate automated assessment of these regions. This technical challenge explains the substantial controversy in the literature about the magnitude, directionality and neurobiological interpretation of basal ganglia structural changes estimated from MRI and computational anatomy techniques. My scientific project addresses the pertinent need for accurate automated delineation of basal ganglia using two complementary strategies: ?	Empirical testing of the utility of novel imaging protocols to provide superior contrast in the basal ganglia and to quantify brain tissue properties; ?	Improvement of the algorithms for the reliable automated detection of basal ganglia and thalamus Previous research demonstrated that MRI protocols based on magnetization transfer (MT) saturation maps provide optimal grey-white matter contrast in subcortical structures compared with the widely used Tl-weighted (Tlw) images (Helms et al., 2009). Under the assumption of a direct impact of brain tissue properties on MR contrast my first study addressed the question of the mechanisms underlying the regional specificities effect of the basal ganglia. I used established whole-brain voxel-based methods to test for grey matter <b>volume</b> differences between <b>MT</b> and Tlw imaging protocols with an emphasis on subcortical structures. I applied a regression model to explain the observed grey matter differences from the regionally specific impact of brain tissue properties on the MR contrast. The results of my first project prompted further methodological developments to create adequate priors for the basal ganglia and thalamus allowing optimal automated delineation of these structures in a probabilistic tissue classification framework. I established a standardized workflow for manual labelling of the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellar dentate to create new tissue probability maps from quantitative MR maps featuring optimal grey-white matter contrast in subcortical areas. The validation step of the new tissue priors included a comparison of the classification performance with the existing probability maps. In my third project I continued investigating the factors impacting automated brain tissue classification that result in interpretational shortcomings when using Tlw MRI data in the framework of computational anatomy. While the intensity in Tlw images is predominantl...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany {{countries}} receive {{shipments of}} bulk cereals from primary producers. There is {{a volume of}} work that is on-going that seeks to arrive at appropriate standards {{for the quality of}} the shipments and the means to assess the shipments as they are out-loaded. Of concern are mycotoxin and heavy metal levels, pesticide and herbicide residue levels and contamination by GMOs. As the ability to quantify these contaminants improves through improved analytical techniques, the sampling methodologies applied to the shipments must also keep pace to ensure that the uncertainties attached to the sampling procedures do not overwhelm the analytical uncertainties. There is a need to understand and quantify sampling uncertainties under varying conditions of contamination. The analysis required is statistical and is challenging as the nature of the distribution of contaminants within a shipment is not well understood; very limited data exists. Limited work has been undertaken to quantify the variability of the contaminant concentrations in the flow of grain coming from a ship and the impact that this has on the variance of sampling. Relatively recent work by Paoletti et al. provides some insight into the variation in GMO concentrations in soybeans on cargo out-turn. Paoletti et al. analysed the data using correlogram analysis with the objective of quantifying the sampling uncertainty (variance) that attaches to the final cargo analysis, but this is only one possible means of quantifying sampling uncertainty. It is possible that in many cases the levels of contamination passing the sampler on out-loading are essentially random, negating the value of variographic quantitation of the sampling variance. GMOs and mycotoxins appear to have a highly heterogeneous distribution in a cargo depending on how the ship was loaded (the grain may have come from more than one terminal and set of storage silos) and mycotoxin growth may have occurred in transit. This paper examines a statistical model based on random contamination {{that can be used to}} calculate the sampling uncertainty arising from primary sampling of a cargo; it deals with what is thought to be a worst case scenario. The determination of the sampling variance is treated both analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation. The latter approach provides the entire sampling distribution and not just the sampling variance. The sampling procedure is based on rules provided by the Canadian Grain Commission and the levels of contamination considered are those relating to allowable levels of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat. The results of the calculations indicate that at a loading rate of 1000 tonnes per hour, primary sample increment masses of 10. 6 kg, a 2000 tonne lot and a primary composite sample mass of 1900 kg, the relative standard deviation is about 1. 05 (105 %) and the distribution of the mycotoxin (MT) level in the primary composite samples is highly skewed. This result applies to a mean MT level of 2 ng g- 1. The rate of false negative results under these conditions is estimated to be 16. 2 %. The corresponding contamination is based on initial average concentrations of MT of 4000 ng g- 1 within average spherical volumes of 0. 3 m diameter which are then diluted by a factor of two each time they pass through a handling stage; four stages of handling are assumed. The Monte Carlo calculations allow for variation in the initial <b>volume</b> of the <b>MT</b> bearing grain, the average concentration and the dilution factor. The Monte Carlo studies seek to show the effect of variation in the sampling frequency while maintaining a primary composite sample mass of 1900 kg. The overall results are presented in terms of operational characteristic curves that relate only to the sampling uncertainties in the primary sampling of the grain. We conclude that cross-stream sampling in intrinsically unsuited to sampling for mycotoxins and that better sampling methods and equipment are needed to control sampling uncertainties. At the same time, it is shown that some combination of cross-cutting sampling conditions may, for a given shipment mass and MT content, yield acceptable sampling performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} model for condensation of sulfuric acid aerosol given an initial concentration and/or source of gaseous sulfur trioxide (e. g. fuming from oleum). The model includes the thermochemical effects on aerosol condensation and air parcel buoyancy. Condensation is assumed to occur heterogeneously onto a preexisting background aerosol distribution. The model development is both a revisiting of research initially presented at the Fall 2001 American Geophysical Union Meeting [1] and a further extension to provide new capabilities for current atmospheric dispersion modeling efforts [2]. Sulfuric acid {{is one of the}} most widely used of all industrial chemicals. In 1992, world consumption of sulfuric acid was 145 million metric tons, with 42. 4 Mt (mega-tons) consumed in the United States [10]. In 2001, of 37. 5 Mt consumed in the U. S., 74 % went into producing phosphate fertilizers [11]. Another significant use is in mining industries. Lawuyi and Fingas [7] estimate that, in 1996, 68 % of use was for fertilizers and 5. 8 % was for mining. They note that H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } use has been and should continue to be very stable. In the United States, the elimination of MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) and the use of ethanol for gasoline production are further increasing the demand for petroleum alkylate. Alkylate producers have a choice of either a hydrofluoric acid or sulfuric acid process. Both processes are widely used today. Concerns, however, over the safety or potential regulation of hydrofluoric acid are likely to result in most of the growth being for the sulfuric acid process, further increasing demand [11]. The implication of sulfuric acid being a pervasive industrial chemical is that transport is also pervasive. Often, this is in the form of oleum tankers, having around 30 % free sulfur trioxide. Although sulfuric acid itself is not a volatile substance, fuming sulfuric acid (referred to as oleum) is [7], the volatile product being sulfur trioxide. Sulfate aerosols and mist may form in the atmosphere on tank rupture. From chemical spill data from 1990 - 1996, Lawuyi 02 and Fingas [7] prioritize sulfuric acid as sixth most serious. During this period, they note 155 spills totaling 13 Mt, out of a supply <b>volume</b> of 3700 <b>Mt.</b> Lawuyi and Fingas [7] summarize information on three major sulfuric acid spills. On 12 February 1984, 93 tons of sulfuric acid were spilled when 14 railroad cars derailed near MacTier, Parry Sound, Ontario. On 13 December 1978, 51 railroad cars derailed near Springhill, Nova Scotia. One car, containing 93 % sulfuric acid, ruptured, spilling nearly its entire contents. In July 1993, 20 to 50 tons of fuming sulfuric acid spilled at the General Chemical Corp. plant in Richmond, California, a major industrial center near San Francisco. The release occurred when oleum was being loaded into a nonfuming acid railroad tank car that contained only a rupture disk as a safety device. The tank car was overheated and this rupture disk blew. The resulting cloud of sulfuric acid drifted northeast with prevailing winds over a number of populated areas. More than 3, 000 people subsequently sought medical attention for burning eyes, coughing, headaches, and nausea. Almost all were treated and released on the day of the spill. By the day after the release, another 5, 000 people had sought medical attention. The spill forced the closure of five freeways in the region as well as some Bay Area Rapid Transit System stations. Apart from corrosive toxicity, there is the additional hazard that the reactions of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid vapors with water are extremely exothermic [10, 11]. While the vapors are intrinsically denser than air, there is thus the likelihood of strong, warming-induced buoyancy from reactions with ambient water vapor, water-containing aerosol droplets, and wet environmental surface. Nordin [12] relates just such an occurrence following the Richmond, CA spill, with the plume observed to rise to 300 m. For all practical purposes, sulfur trioxide was the constituent released from the heated tank car. The behavior of the resulting plume suggested that initially sulfur trioxide behaved as a dense gas, but the chemical reacted with air humidity, producing sulfuric acid and heat. The heat caused the plume to rise. Eventually the plume cooled, resulting in sulfuric acid descending towards people on the ground. This kind of behavior is not accounted for in the popular gas dispersion models. In the presence of complex terrain, such heat induced buoyancy could enable a sulfur trioxide cloud to leap local drainage boundaries with a single bound. Unless there were insufficient water/humidity to fully react with the SO{sub 3 } and H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } on the first ascent, no secondary bounds would be expected, the cloud then behaving as a heavy tracer until sufficiently diluted...|$|R
