This in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air travel demand, plunging once profitable operations, including Pan Am's prime transatlantic routes, into steep losses. These unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to Pan Am, which was {{still reeling from the}} 1988 Lockerbie disaster. To shore up its finances, Pan Am sold most of its routes serving London Heathrow – arguably Pan Am's most important international destination – to United Airlines. This left Pan Am with only two daily London flights, serving Detroit and Miami, which used Gatwick as their London terminal {{from the start of the}} 1990/91 winter timetable. Further asset disposals included Pan Am's sale of its IGS routes to Berlin to Lufthansa for $150million, which became effective at the same time and brought the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> disposals to $1.2billion.

Its activities were much like a very simplified form of banking, although with less than half the leverage of a traditional bank and without any exposure to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk. However, due to the impact on the financial markets stemming from the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States of America, on the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> backed securities generally, despite Sigma having no exposure to US subprime mortgages, there was a [...] "run" [...] by short term lenders to all non-banks. This resulted in forced selling by many investors at the same time causing the value of Sigma’s assets to fall short of the amount it needed to pay the secured creditors. Following an auction in December 2008 the values achieved fell far short of the amounts required to satisfy the secured creditors, let alone the unsecured creditors. All of Sigma’s assets were secured under a security trust deed (STD) in favour of those creditors investing in and through Sigma.|$|E
