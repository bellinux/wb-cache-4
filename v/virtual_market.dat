2500|$|The {{release of}} Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft in 2004 and its {{subsequent}} huge success {{across the globe}} has forced both MMORPGs and their secondary markets into mainstream consciousness, and many new market places have opened up during this time. A search for WoW Gold on Google will show a multitude of sites (more than 90 sponsored results [...] ) from which Gold can be purchased. Real money commerce in a <b>virtual</b> <b>market</b> has grown to become a multibillion-dollar industry. In 2001, EverQuest players Brock Pierce and Alan Debonneville founded Internet Gaming Entertainment Ltd (IGE), a company that offered not only the virtual commodities in exchange for real money but also provided professional customer service. [...] IGE had a trained staff that would handle financial issues, customer inquiries and technical support to ensure that gamers are satisfied with each real money purchase. It also {{took advantage of the}} global reach of synthetic worlds by setting up a shop in Hong Kong where a small army of technically savvy but low wage workers could field orders, load up avatars, retrieve store goods and deliver them wherever necessary. This lucrative market has opened a whole new type of economy where the border between the real and the virtual is obscure.|$|E
50|$|The {{software}} {{creates an}} agent-based {{model for a}} particular stock, consisting of a population of trader agents and a <b>virtual</b> <b>market.</b> Each agent represents a virtual trader/investor and has its own trading rule and funds. The model is then evolved step by step in the following way: At every step a new (historical) real market price is imported. All agents evaluate their trading rule and place orders on the <b>virtual</b> <b>market.</b> The <b>virtual</b> <b>market</b> then determines the clearing price and executes all matching orders. The clearing price is taken as the forecast for the next step real market price. (So the <b>virtual</b> <b>market</b> serves as a one-step-ahead prediction market for the real market). This process is repeated for every new received real market price. Meanwhile, the trading rules evolve through a special adaptive form of genetic programming. The forecasts are thus based {{on the behavior of}} the entire market instead of only on the best performing trading rule. This intends to increase the robustness of the model and its ability to adapt to changing market circumstances.|$|E

The new companies usually offer lower rates to attract virtual sellers thereby multiplying the number of options for virtual buyers. This project presents an exploratory study of the final value available to sellers on two different auction sites, eBay and Yahoo! Auctions. Specifically, the study aims at finding whether or not the leading Internet auction site provides a better opportunity for sellers to extract more consumer surplus by selling goods for higher prices. The statistical analysis shows that in the leading site (eBay) the number of bids placed is greater, the average final price offered is higher, and the average final value is higher than in the competing site (Yahoo!).

To overcome these limitations {{a new type of}} test <b>markets,</b> so called <b>Virtual</b> Test <b>Markets,</b> was devised. <b>Virtual</b> Test <b>Markets</b> are computer simulations of consumers, companies and the market environment.
