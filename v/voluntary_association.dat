40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the key question: can <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> enhance democracy? It tests critical claims made by Habermas {{and others that}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> {{have the potential to}} reinvigorate a public sphere in a state of atrophy. The thesis outlines the major theoretical arguments pertaining to these areas and then presents the results of empirical work within voluntary organisations. Specifically the thesis: Critically {{examines the}} concept of the public sphere, being a sphere between the state and civil society and investigates why theorists have advocated <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations,</b> claimed to be the core institutions of civil society, as sites where democratic ideals can be secured; Goes on to examine the concept of civil society and reviews the recent literature that has attempted to define and analyse the role of <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> in contemporary society; Tests empirically the normative ideals that have been advocated on behalf of <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> through the presentation of data obtained using qualitative methodology. The analysis of the data collected during interviews with key employees and members of six <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> in Melbourne, Australia allows for a more informed knowledge regarding the key concepts and themes of the thesis. The thesis ends by directly addressing the following points: whether or not the public sphere {{is in a state of}} atrophy; the particular nature of <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> contemporary engagement in the public sphere; and whether <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> can indeed, be sites where democracy can be enhanced and democratic ideals be secured. It is concluded that <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> operate within Habermasian public spheres, counterspheres, and postmodern public spheres and that unitary notions of the public sphere, such as those Habermas proposes, do not adequately explain <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> engagement in the public sphere. Accordingly, it is concluded that <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> have the potential to invigorate public spheres, though not in ways that many theorists writing on the subject suggest...|$|R

5|$|Serjeant's Inn was an Inn of Court {{restricted}} to Serjeants-at-Law. It operated from three locations, one in Holborn, known as Scroope's Inn, which was abandoned by 1498 {{for the one}} in Fleet Street, which was pulled down during the 18th century, and one on Chancery Lane, pulled down in 1877. The Inn was a <b>voluntary</b> <b>association,</b> and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they were not required to. There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants, even including members of the judiciary, and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court. Unlike the Inns of Court, Serjeant's Inn was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen's club.|$|E
5|$|George VI's reign saw the {{acceleration}} of {{the dissolution of the}} British Empire. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate sovereign states. The process of transformation from an empire to a <b>voluntary</b> <b>association</b> of independent states, known as the Commonwealth, gathered pace after the Second World War. During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India, and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations and recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth; he remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.|$|E

25|$|Spencer's {{association}} with Social Darwinism might have its origin {{in a specific}} interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result {{in the death of}} a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both <b>voluntary</b> <b>association</b> and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would be wise to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, 11 of the {{remaining}} 12 republics—all except Georgia—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new <b>voluntary</b> <b>association,</b> the Commonwealth of Independent States. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't {{been taken over by}} Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A constitutional crisis dissolved into violence in Moscow as the Russian Army was called in to reestablish order.|$|E

25|$|A benefit society, fraternal benefit {{society or}} fraternal benefit order is a society, an {{organization}} or a <b>voluntary</b> <b>association</b> formed to provide mutual aid, benefit, for instance insurance for relief from sundry difficulties. Such organizations may be formally organized with charters and established customs, or may arise ad hoc to meet {{unique needs of}} a particular time and place. Many major financial institutions existing today, particularly some insurance companies, mutual savings banks, and credit unions, trace their origins back to benefit societies, as can many modern fraternal organizations and fraternal orders which are now viewed as being primarily social; the modern legal system essentially requires all such organizations of appreciable size to incorporate as one of these forms or another to continue to exist on an ongoing basis.|$|E
25|$|Cheshire {{never had}} a {{classical}} presbytery, and had been dependent on the Manchester classis for many important functions. A <b>voluntary</b> <b>association</b> was proposed by a meeting of Cheshire ministers at Wilmslow on 14 September 1653, making it contemporary with the association founded by Baxter in Worcestershire. Its establishment was agreed {{at a meeting in}} Knutsford the following month. Like Baxter's movement, it was intended to carry some of the ordaining and disciplinary functions left in abeyance by the collapse of the national Presbyterian project in 1648. The workings and extent of the association are unclear but Fisher was closely associated with the leading figures in it and his judgement respected by them. In November 1656 Henry Newcome, one of the founders, had the opportunity of taking up the incumbency of Julian's church in Shrewsbury after losing a valuable post in Manchester. Baxter wrote a detailed and encouraging letter to him, but at the end deferred to Fisher's closer knowledge.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of time the city of Celle has {{expanded}} towards the actual air base, a development which occurred at other military airfields too. Since the inception of the air base the attitude of the public towards the military and its training facilities has changed significantly. The first complaints about aircraft noise were published in the local newspapers shortly after the German Army Aviation Corps took control of the air base. The complaints reached a climax in 1965 when plans were made public to have a second runway, leading from the northeast to the southwest, built at Celle Air Base and to have a wing of strike fighters stationed at the airfield. Residents, mostly from Wietzenbruch, founded a <b>voluntary</b> <b>association</b> and petitioned the federal parliament. The plans were abandoned and after the Federal Ministry had given assurances that only helicopters would be stationed at Celle Air Base the association dissolved. The noise produced by the helicopters, however, remained a subject of contention in local newspapers.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth of}} the British Empire in the 19th century, to its {{territorial}} peak in the 1920s, saw Britain acquire nearly {{one quarter of the}} world's land mass, including territories with large indigenous populations in Asia and Africa. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, the larger settler colonies– in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa– first became self-governing colonies and then achieved independence in all matters except foreign policy, defence and trade. Separate self-governing colonies federated to become Canada (in 1867), Australia (in 1901), South Africa (in 1910), and Rhodesia (in 1965). These and other large self-governing colonies had become known as Dominions by the 1920s. The Dominions achieved almost full independence with the Statute of Westminster (1931).Through a process of decolonisation following the Second World War, most of the British colonies in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean gained independence. Some colonies became Commonwealth realms, retaining the British monarch as their own head of state. Most former colonies and protectorates became member states of the Commonwealth of Nations, a non-political, <b>voluntary</b> <b>association</b> of equal members, comprising a population of around 2.2billion people.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of his}} presidency, Hoover opposed congressional {{proposals}} to provide federal relief, and he feared that Congress would impose a federal relief program that would infringe on the prerogatives {{of state and local}} governments and philanthropic organizations. Hoover created the National Credit Corporation, a <b>voluntary</b> <b>association</b> of bankers, but the organization did not manage to save banks or ease credit as Hoover had hoped it would. As the Great Depression continued, Hoover finally heeded calls for more direct federal intervention, though he vetoed {{a bill that would have}} allowed direct federal lending to individuals. In January 1932, Hoover signed a bill creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). The RFC's initial goal was to provide government-secured loans to financial institutions, railroads, and local governments to continue relief programs. The RFC saved numerous businesses from failure, but it failed to stimulate commercial lending as Hoover had hoped, partly because it was run by conservative bankers unwilling to make riskier loans. The RFC would be adopted by Roosevelt and greatly expanded as part of his New Deal. With the RFC failing to stem the economic crisis, Hoover signed the Emergency Relief and Construction Act, a major public works bill, in July 1932.|$|E

Two are due to self-selection effects (pools of democracy), and two are due to socialization effects (schools of democracy). Our analyses offer little support for the idea of <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> playing a major role in political socialization processes: our latent growth curve models showed no or very little increase of political discussion, interest, efficacy, and action among those who became actively involved in <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations.</b> In contrast, we found convincing evidence for our pools-of-democracy hypotheses, and the self-selection {{turns out to be a}} double-edged sword: politically engaged citizens are more likely to join <b>voluntary</b> <b>associations</b> and less likely to leave them. These findings challenge the conclusions of many studies based on cross-sectional data...|$|R
