40|$|In {{the context}} of web service {{procurement}} (WSP), temporal–awareness refers to managing service demands and offers which are subject to <b>validity</b> <b>periods,</b> i. e. their evaluation depends not only on quality of service (QoS) values but also on time. For example, the QoS of some web services can be considered critical in working hours (9 : 00 to 17 : 00 from Monday to Friday) and irrelevant at any other moment. Until now, the expressiveness of such temporal–aware specifications has been quite limited. As far as we know, most proposals have considered <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> to be composed of a single temporal interval. Other proposals, which could allow more expressive time–dependent specifications, have not performed a detailed study about all the underlying complexities of such approach, {{in spite of the}} fact that dealing with complex expressions on temporality is not a trivial task at all. As a matter of fact, it requires a special design of the so–called procurement tasks (consistency and conformance checking, and optimal selection). In this paper, we present a constraint–based approach to temporal–aware WSP. Using constraints allows a great deal of expressiveness, so that not only demands and offers can be assigned <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> but also their conditions can be assigned (possibly multiple) validity temporal subintervals. Apart from revising the semantics of procurement tasks, which we previously presented in the first edition of the ICSOC conferences, we also introduce the notion of the covering set of a demand, a topic which is closely related to temporality.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} for the conventional X. 509 Public Key Infrastructures (PKI). Our goal {{is to reduce the}} effort to handle sig-natures in the long term. The novelty is that a Root CA reissues subordinate certificates of final users, but adjusting <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> to exclude the periods after a revocation. The Root CA also authenticates timestamps. The result is the cleaned PKI, which is simpler than the conventional PKI because: a) there is no revocation; b) there is no intermediary Certification Authority; c) signatures are trustworthy as long as the used cryptographic algorithms remain secure. As benefits, we reduce the need of timestamps and consequently the demand for storage space and processing time to use signed documents. 1...|$|R
