40|$|General Information Thick {{pieces of}} wood, such as logs or boards, cannot be {{bleached}} satisfactorily {{all the way}} through. Wood should be made into the furniture or other find product, and then the surface bleached if desired Woods differ in {{the ease with which}} they can be bleached. Oak, birch, mahogany, ash, maple, beech, and walnut can be bleached fairly easily gum, tupelo, pine, and poplar are said {{to be very difficult to}} bleach satisfactorily. If <b>varnish,</b> <b>stain,</b> or other finishing material is present on wood surface that is to be bleached, it must be removed completely before bleaching is started. Even waxy materials left on the wood by varnish removers may interfere with the action of bleaching chemicals. A final sanding before bleaching is desirable in such cases. Where stain has penetrated into the wood, scraping or sanding until all of the stained wood has been removed is usually necessary. The wood bleaches may not bleach the dyes or pigments used in wood stains. Many bleaching chemicals are injurious to the skin and eyes. Goggles, heavy rubber gloves, and aprons should be worn when handling and applying wood bleaches, particularly those containing hydrogen peroxide or sodium hydroxide. Reasons for Bleaching Woods such as walnut or mahogany, which are naturally dark in color, may be bleached to a lighter color or even to white, and light-colored woods may be made lighter, in conformity with the vogue for light-colored, or blond, furniture. 1 Only a Iimited amount of experimental work on the bleaching of wood has been done at the Forest Products Laboratory. The information presented here is based chiefly on the published literature and on materiaI suppIied by makers and users of wood bleaches. This Researc...|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{is considered the}} most damaging radiation to wood, affecting its properties and especially its color. The application of finishing products such as <b>varnishes,</b> <b>stains</b> and inks can minimize the action of this radiation. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ultraviolet radiation, through artificially accelerated aging, on the color of freijó wood (Cordia goeldiana Huber) treated with “polisten” and sealer (nitrocellulose), by means of spectrocolorimetric tracking. The samples of wood were subjected to cycles of ultraviolet radiation in a photochemical reactor for 84 and 168 hours. The colorimetric parameters (L*, a*, b*, C, h*) were measured {{before and after the}} treatments. The treatment with “polisten” offered greater protection against ultraviolet radiation, yielding greater stability to the parameters. The treatment with sealer led to a greater change in color after the simulation of aging in the photochemical reactor. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEvidence that {{painters}} {{may be at}} {{risk for}} lung cancer comes mainly from analyses on job titles rather than on specific exposures found in the environments of painters. METHODS: In the context of two large population-based case-control studies of lung cancer carried out in Montreal, we were able to assess possible relationships between lung cancer and the occupation of painter as well as exposure to paints, <b>varnishes</b> and <b>stains.</b> Interviews for study I were conducted in 1979 - 1986 (857 cases, 533 population controls, 1349 cancer controls) and interviews for study II were conducted in 1996 - 2001 (765 cases and 899 controls). Detailed lifetime job histories were elicited; a team of hygienists and chemists evaluated the evidence of exposure to many occupational substances including paint-related substances. The relative risk of lung cancer was estimated, adjusting for several potential confounders, including smoking, in a three-variable parameterisation. RESULTS: In analyses pooling the two studies, painters had an OR of lung cancer of 1. 3 (95 % CI 0. 9 to 2. 2). Regarding exposures, ORs were: for wood <b>varnishes</b> and <b>stains,</b> 1. 6 (95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 3); for wood and gypsum paints, 1. 3 (95 % CI 0. 9 to 1. 7); and for metal coatings, 1. 1 (95 % CI 0. 8 to 1. 6). Small numbers hampered evaluation of dose-response relationships. CONCLUSIONS: While our results cannot exclude chance or residual confounding by smoking or concomitant occupational exposures, they provide further evidence that some exposures in paint-related occupations, most notably wood <b>varnishes</b> and <b>stains,</b> increase the risk of lung cancer...|$|R

40|$|Background: One of the {{orthodontic}} treatment problems, which causes marginal gaps and microleakage between tooth and composite is microleakage of composite bonding of orthodontic brackets. The microleakage formation permitting {{the passage of}} bacteria and oral fluids, which may cause white spot lesions under the brackets surface area. This is a clinical problem during {{orthodontic treatment}}. Few {{studies have been conducted}} in this area. The aim of this study was comparison of microleakage of composite silorane base and methacrylate base composite in orthodontic brackets. Methods: Thirty human premolar were collected and divided into 2 groups. In group 1, 15 orthodontic brackets were bonded using silorane base composite, in group 2, 15 orthodontic brackets were bonded using methacrylate base composite. Then the teeth were kept in water and thermo cycled(500 ×, 5 - 55 °C). Specimens were further sealed with nail <b>varnish,</b> <b>stained</b> with 5 % basic fuchsin for 24 hours. Then, all teeth sectioned and dye penetration rate were examined by an esteriomicroscope, and scored 0 to 3 for marginal microleakage for the bracket- adhesive and adhesive-enamel interfaces. The data collected analyzed with SPSS 16 software, and fisher exact and Mann Whitney tests. Results: Microleakage values were lower in silorane composite than in the methacrylate group, and this difference was found to be statistically significant(P-value = 0. 03). Also, the rate of microleakage between adhesive-bracket than adhesive-enamel interface was meaningful(P-value= 0. 025). Conclusions: The results of the current relealed that silorane-bass silorane-base composite provided low microleakage for orthodontic brackets, for this reason, it could be used it for bonding brackets...|$|R

They are cut to similar lengths and can be <b>stained,</b> <b>varnished,</b> or simply used as is. They are then nailed down to wooden beams or bigger pieces of bamboo stems.

2500|$|The palaces {{and noble}} {{home of the}} Aztecs had ornate furniture. Entire pieces of {{hardwoods}} would be carved into benches and tables, and other items. Furniture was inlaid with gold and some covered in animal skins. [...] A kind of shellac or lacquer existed in pre-Hispanic Mexico and was used in many ceramics. The Mendocino Codex mentions {{it as a kind}} of waterproof oil extracted from a worm called “axe” and mixed with oil from the prickly poppy seed or Mexican sage seed and pigments, which resulted in a paint. After the Conquest, the Spanish demanded European style furniture, which was usually made by indigenous craftsmen. As colonial Mexico was Spain’s gateway to Asia, oriental techniques such as parquetry and other types of inlay became common as well.
