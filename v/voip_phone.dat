5|$|In 2006, Cisco Systems and Apple {{negotiated}} over allowing Apple {{rights to}} use Cisco's Linksys iPhone trademark, but the negotiations stalled when Cisco {{pushed for the}} two products to be interoperable. Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo, Cisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's iPhone name infringed on Cisco's iPhone trademark. Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} likelihood of confusion between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a <b>VoIP</b> <b>phone.</b> Bloomberg reported Cisco's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Lanka Government Network (LGN) is {{the common}} {{infrastructure}} and the link that provides secure and reliable connections between government entities and e-government initiatives. E-mails and <b>VoIP</b> <b>phones</b> are the main facilities provided by Lanka government Network. It {{is obvious that the}} Colombo district is the pioneer of e-government implementation in Sri Lankan divisional administration due to its superior leadership and readiness to practice e-government initiatives. Though ICTA has provided LGN facilities, some observations and survey reports reveal that these facilities have not been fully utilized. The technology acceptance of the staff officers is determined {{for the purposes of this}} study through the usage of Lanka Government Network. The main objective of this research is to determine the present usage level and the difficulties in usage of LGN e-mails and <b>VoIP</b> <b>phones.</b> The research is focused on strategies for motivating LGN usage. In the Literature review the relationship among ICT usage, Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness and the skills and knowledge of the officers has been discussed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Information was gathered using questionnaires and interviews, from a sample of sixty staff officers covering each divisional secretariat of the Colombo District. Questionnaires were distributed to forty five subjects to determine the usage level, ease of use, frequency usage and reasons for not using e-mails and <b>VoIP</b> <b>phones.</b> Fifteen officers were interviewed separately to find out the reasons why they have never used the above facilities and their requirements by way of facilities and training. It was concluded that the low usage of <b>VoIP</b> <b>phones</b> indicates that it is not a satisfactory device for communication. It was felt by the majority of the staff officers that it would be easier to use the LGN e-mails. Most of the officers are qualified in ICDL. The staff officers feel positively about the Ease of Use of LGN e-mails, but frequency usage of LGN e-mails and <b>VoIP</b> <b>phones</b> are at a disheartening rate...|$|R
