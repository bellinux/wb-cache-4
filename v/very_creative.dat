[...] Author Dean Rhys Morgan in Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes discusses how Jackson was [...] "transformed from a former child star into an assured fashion forward figure with her trendsetting big hair and severe all black ensemble.

500|$|Molina {{is known}} for his in-game pitch-calling skills, and {{pitchers}} rarely reject signs that he shows for the next pitch.

[...] But at the same time, they tend to just follow him. [...] We do put them in Yadi's hands." [...] Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs and gestures to align them with his pitch calling. [...] La Russa commented that [...] "it's not just instinct. [...] It's sense, based on how a hitter's standing, how he responds to the pitch or two before, and he's <b>very</b> <b>creative</b> in how he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing what his pitcher can do." ...|$|E

500|$|The band found Danesmoate {{to have a}} <b>very</b> <b>creative</b> atmosphere, but {{according}} to the Edge, they [...] "just couldn't settle in". The large drawing room, with a tall ceiling and wooden floors, created an [...] "ear-splitting" [...] drum sound that caused issues for the group. Lanois had a higher opinion of the house, saying: [...] "It was loud, but it was really good loud, real dense, very musical. In my opinion it was the most rock and roll room of the lot." [...] According to him, [...] "the Danesmoate sessions were the backbone of the tonality of the record—we got a lot of the drums done in there." [...] He thought that the house sounded better than Slane Castle, and he was particularly impressed with the drawing room's [...] "low mid-range ... where the music lives", a property that he believes was {{a major factor in the}} success of The Joshua Tree.|$|E
500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can do things with the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is <b>very</b> <b>creative</b> going forward {{and is going to}} be one hell of a player. I was delighted to secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", as well as being able to unlock defences. Byrom has called himself [...] "a good passer of the ball", as well as being able to [...] "chip in with a few goals and generally get the team ticking over". In March 2010, following Stevenage's 3–0 win against Crawley Town, a game in which Byrom scored a goal from just inside Crawley's half, Westley said that Byrom has the [...] "ability to score spectacular goals".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dialogue sessions, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide [...] "a fresh pair of ears". [...] Thomas's background was in music, rather than engineering. [...] He had worked with Beatles producer George Martin, and was acquainted with Pink Floyd's manager Steve O'Rourke. [...] All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "clean" [...] mix which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more [...] "echoey" [...] mix. [...] Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating [...] "There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. [...] In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. [...] It was a <b>very</b> <b>creative</b> atmosphere. [...] A lot of fun." [...] Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas's intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. [...] Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on [...] "Us and Them". [...] He was also present for the recording of [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] (although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry).

[...] They remarked that the episode shows a [...] "high degree of professionalism and skill: good writing, good acting, great direction (no surprise, really, with Don Leaver at the helm), and, in particular, a fine lead.
