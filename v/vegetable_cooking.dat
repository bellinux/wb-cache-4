Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research was to develop a rapid optical sensing method based on fluorescence quenching of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) for identification of adulterated <b>vegetable</b> <b>cooking</b> oils. High quality hydrophilic photoluminescent nanoparticles were synthesized by encapsulating hydrophobic QDs into the micellar structure of an amphiphilic surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) via phase transfer method. TEM, AFM, and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the prepared CTAB-coated QDs. Oil samples were first captured into the core of the two-layer-structural micelle and then the fluorescence of CTAB-coated QDs, working as fluorescence probes, was selectively quenched by components of the adulterated oils. Heavy metal ions and free radicals were presumed to be main quenchers. After quenching for 1 min, fluorescence intensity was measured and converted to quenching percentage to determine the adulteration concentration. The results showed that in comparison with oil-soluble QDs, water-soluble CTAB-coated QDs had a greater ability to identify oil adulteration. A good quantitative relationship between quenching percentage and adulteration concentration (y = 5. 96 x + 14. 99; R- 2 = 0. 94) was obtained. The sensitive, simple and low-cost sensing method did not require sample pretreatment and could detect refined used oils at 0. 4 % or higher concentrations in soybean oil within 2 min, showing great potentials for rapid screening of used oils and quantitative analysis of used oil adulteration in field.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to provide an {{environmental}} assessment of a diesel engine by analyzing the emissions of CO, CO 2 and NOx that result from the combustion process, as well as analyzing technical performance related to consumption {{and the development of}} power and torque in a laboratory test rig.

The intention of this work is to evaluate the best method for the production of biodiesel in reference to an analysis of the peculiar features of this process of procurement and control of the physical environmental variables that may result in better performance of the engine under the conditions of the use of biodiesel blends with commercial diesel. The use of cooking oil as a raw material for biodiesel production has proven to be of significant value as compared to other raw material choices of various origins such as the oilseed crop since cooking oil is available in large quantities without any defined application.

To acquire data for training and testing the proposed ANN, a two cylinders, four-stroke diesel engine was fuelled with waste <b>vegetable</b> <b>cooking</b> biodiesel and diesel fuel blends and operated at different engine speeds. The properties of biodiesel produced from waste vegetable oil was measured based on ASTM standards. The experimental results revealed that blends of waste vegetable oil methyl ester with diesel fuel provide better engine performance and improved emission characteristics.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{studies the}} characteristics of diesel engine using biodiesel (UCME) product from waste <b>vegetable</b> <b>cooking</b> oil which was collected from restaurants. WCO biodiesel {{is one of the}} promising alternative fuels for diesel engine due to its low cost and similarity of its properties to diesel fuel. This biofuel was prepared by Transesterification method which was used to obtain renewable fuel from WCO. The Transesterification used Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst and Methanol as solvent. The performance characteristics of UCME were obtained by combustion blends of biodiesel (B 2 %, B 5 %, B 7 % and B 10 %) in one cylinder direct injection C. I. engine operating at 3000 rpm. The biodiesel was blended with pure diesel to reduce UCME high viscosity which restricts their direct use in diesel engine. The fuel properties and the combustion characteristics of UCME are found to be close to that of diesel. A minor decrease in thermal efficiency (especially for blends B 2 and B 5) was observed. Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Unburnt Hydrocarbon (HC), Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) emissions of biodiesel blends was found to be higher than that of diesel whereas Oxygen (O 2) emission was found less. The use of Transesterified used cooking oil and its blends as fuel for diesel engines will reduce dependence on fossil fuels and also decrease considerably the environmental pollutio...|$|E

The exposed rats for 30 and 60 days to cotton oil fumes showed {{a significant increase in the}} lung and liver malondialdehyde levels which accompanied with a significant decrease in glutathione content. Also, there was a significant decrease in lung and liver superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione s-transferase activities. As well as, there was a significant decrease in serum amino acids levels, lung and liver nucleic acids and total proteins. These changes were obviously after 60 days than that of 30 days of exposure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the possible mechanism that is involved in the blood pressureraising effect of heated vegetable oils. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 11 groups; the control group was fed with rat chow, and the other groups were fed with chow that was mixed with 15 % weight/weight palm or soy oils, which were either in a fresh form or heated once, twice, five, or ten times. Blood pressures were measured at the baseline and throughout the 24 -week study. Plasma nitric oxide levels were assessed prior to treatment and at the end of the study. Following 24 weeks, the rats were sacrificed to investigate their vascular reactivity using the thoracic aorta. RESULTS: Palm and soy oils had no detrimental effects on blood pressure, and they significantly elevated the nitric oxide contents and reduced the contractile responses to phenylephrine. However, trials using palm and soy oils that were repeatedly heated showed an increase in blood pressure, enhanced phenylephrine-induced contractions, reduced acetylcholine- and sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxations relative to the control and rats that were fed fresh vegetable oils. CONCLUSIONS: The blood pressure-raising effect of the heated <b>vegetable</b> <b>cooking</b> oils is associated with increased vascular reactivity and a reduction in nitric oxide levels. The chronic consumption of heated vegetable oils leads to disturbances in endogenous vascular regulatory substances, such as nitric oxide. The thermal oxidation of the cooking oils promotes the generation of free radicals and may play an important contributory role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in rats...|$|E

The main causes of foodborne illness are bacterial (66 %), chemical (26 %), viral (4 %) and parasitic (4 %). Intoxication and Infection The two most common types of food-borne illness are intoxication and infection. Intoxication occurs when toxins produced by the pathogen cause food poisoning. Infection is caused by the ingestion of food containing pathogens. Some people develop symptoms after ingesting a pathogen, while others never know that they are suffering from food-borne illness. The people that are most at risk are those with compromised immune systems. For these individuals, an incident of food-borne illness can be life threatening.
