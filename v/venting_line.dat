40|$|One of the {{key areas}} {{in the design of}} {{advanced}} nuclear reactors is to develop a reliable Passive Containment Cooling System (PCCS). The purpose of the current work is to better understand the condensation phenomena in PCCS for the downward co-current flow of a steam/air mixture through condenser tube bundles during the three PCCS operational modes, namely the bypass mode, the cyclic venting mode and the long-term cooling mode. ^ A series of unique separate-effect PCCS test data were obtained for condensation heat transfer in the PCCS heat exchangers of the PUMA (Purdue University Multidimensional Integral Test Assembly) facility under a task sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Test conditions includes bypass mode, cyclic venting mode and long term mode, covering a wide range of Loss of Coolant Accident(LOCA) conditions with a parameters of pressure, mass flow rate, noncondensable(NC) gases, and PCCS pool water level. The parametric effect studies and a further validation of the PUMA-PCCS separate effect test data were performed. ^ The evaluation of a best estimate system code (RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3) was performed by using unique PUMA-PCCS separate effects data and PUMA-Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) integral test (1998). Through a sensitivity studies of nodalization method and physical models on the MSLB test simulations, deficiencies in RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3 code were found as follows: (1) over prediction of heat removal rate by condensation models, (2) overestimation of SP heat transfer through the horizontal <b>venting</b> <b>line</b> and thermal stratification distortion, (3) underestimation of NC gas effects in PCCS by the distortion of cyclic venting phenomena and (4) overestimation of the DW and SP wall condensation. The improvement for the code calculation predictions could be obtained by removing the RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3 code deficient factors in the PUMA MSLB integral test simulation. ^ The unique PCCS NC gas venting visualizations were obtained according to various PCCS inlet NC gas conditions. Through the local control volume analysis on the NC gas venting phenomena, the NC gas mass flow rate was obtained in the long term mode and the cyclic venting effects on the PCCS heat removal rate were analyzed. In addition, the estimation of mass and energy transfer through PCCS cyclic venting phenomena was studied by using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code simulation (FLUENT). ...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{rupture disk}} <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> areas for {{two-phase}} flow are currently overestimated. As a consequence, the dischargeable {{mass flow rate}} is partially much higher than necessary often leading to malfunctions in downstream retention systems and increased environmental loads. For two-phase gas/liquid flow there is no standardized sizing procedure available. Hence, the homogeneous non-equilibrium model HNE-DS is transferred from sizing safety valves to a procedure for sizing rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>lines.</b> Thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects like boiling delay are considered. The extend method is called HNE-CSE method. Characteristic numbers of rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>lines</b> like the resistance coefficient K-g are typically measured under laboratory, subcritical conditions with incompressible fluids, i. e. liquids or gases at very low velocities. In contrast, the flow typically encountered in an industrial rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> is a compressible gas or two-phase gas/liquid flow under critical flow conditions. The sizing of a rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> based on characteristics for incompressible fluids is therefore a challenge.

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing Space Shuttle-based refilling of helium using superfluid helium on-orbit transfer (SHOOT). All the critical components of SHOOT {{need to be}} developed through ground-based tests. The helium dewar is one of these components. The Dewar consists of a vacuum vessel enclosing a superinsulated tank. The space between the vacuum vessel and the liquid tank is considered a common vacuum space. In the event that the vacuum is lost, the heat transfers to the dewar and the pressure inside the dewar increases rapidly, resulting in rupture of the dewar due to excessive pressure. Therefore, an emergency <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> is required for release of helium to prevent the dewar from rupturing. The study describes a numerical model for blow-down analysis in an emergency.

40|$|Table 1 {{indicates}} that the stiffest line is the cryogenic <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> while the most flexible line is the 6 inch insulating vacuum line. The table also shows that the four remaining lines are roughly of the same stiffness. This follows closely {{with the experience of}} installing the U-tubes in the assembly hall. The <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> was by far the stiffest, while the other lines are comparitively more flexible. However, the value for the LAr line is misleading. It is as flexible as the other 1 1 / 2 x 3 lines. Using this as a basis, the collision hall connections should be slightly more stiff, but not appreciably. The <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> represents the only anticipated 'difficulty'. Provided that the building piping is constructed to reasonable tolerances, there should be no need to modify the existing U-tubes for use in the Collision hall. The analysis makes many assumptions which are not completely valid. For example, the inner line is much more flexible than the table indicates. Thus the analysis should not be taken as an absolute measure of the amount of force necessary to deflect the lines. The analysis does provide a means of comparison between individual lines and between the assembly hall and collision hall. The last column in tables 1 and 2 indicate which lines are the stiffest comparatively. In addition, by comparing the stiffness of each line in the collision hall with the corresponding line in the assembly hall, a qualitative assesment can be made as to whether the lines in the collision hall are flexible enough...|$|R

40|$|Compressors {{are used}} {{throughout}} the natural gas industry to move natural gas from production and processing sites to customer distribution systems. Compressors must periodically be taken off-line for maintenance, operational stand-by, or emergency shut down testing, and as a result, methane may be released to the atmosphere {{from a number of}} sources. When compressor units are shut down, typically the high pressure gas remaining within the compressors and associated piping between isolation valves is vented to the atmosphere (â€˜blowdownâ€™) or to a flare. In addition to blowdown emissions, a depressurized system may continue to leak gas from faulty or improperly sealed unit isolation valves. Natural Gas STAR Partners have found that simple changes in operating practices and in the design of blowdown systems can save money and significantly reduce methane emissions by keeping systems fully or partially pressurized during shutdown. Though pressurized systems may also leak from the closed blowdown valve and from reciprocating compressor rod packing, total emissions can be significantly reduced. Four options for reducing emissions when taking compressors off-line are discussed in this paper. These include: ï¿½ï¿½Keeping compressors pressurized when off-line. ï¿½ï¿½Connecting blowdown <b>vent</b> <b>lines</b> to the fuel gas system and recovering all, or a portion, of the vented gas to the fuel gas system. ï¿½ï¿½Installing static seals on compressor rod packing. ï¿½ï¿½Installing ejectors on compressor blowdown <b>vent</b> <b>lines.</b> Keeping compressors fully pressurized when off-line achieves immediate paybackâ€”there are no capital costs and emissions are avoided by reducing the net leakage rate.

When the Atlas was assembled at Convair, workmen attached a helium <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> to a port {{near the bottom of the}} RP-1 tank, below the anti-slosh baffles. On the Atlas B missiles, the vernier helium tank was mounted in a higher location resulting in a different fuel tank attachment point above the baffles. Helium pressure gas from the vernier propellant tanks leaked into the sustainer RP-1 turbopump, leading to cavitation which caused propellant unloading, pump overspeed, and rupture of the propellant lines. This then caused the fire that led to vehicle destruction. It was not clear whether the fire had been started by rupture of a LOX duct due to sudden pressure change from the helium venting or rubbing of the turbopump blades against the metal casing due to overspeed caused by the pump running without propellant in it. The accident was ultimately ruled to be the result of poor engineering judgement in attaching the vernier helium <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> to the bottom of the RP-1 tank.|$|R
