40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that, assuming urea distribution volume (V) remains constant for 1 month, ionic dialysance (ID) allows the dialysis dose {{to be calculated}} {{without the need for}} blood sampling. The aim of this multicenter study was to verify whether the assumption of a constant V can be extended to 1 year. In clinically stable patients receiving thrice-weekly hemodialysis at 13 dialysis centers, V and Kt/V were assessed during three dialysis sessions at baseline and 1 year later using ID as dialyzer urea clearance and the single-pool urea kinetic model. Baseline albumin, hemoglobin, and C reactive protein were prespecified covariates for predicting the change in V over time. Of the 52 enrolled patients, 40 (25 males; age 63. 0 ± 13. 5 years) completed the study. Baseline end-dialysis body weight (62. 4 ± 13. 7 kg) showed a non-significant 1 % reduction during follow-up (- 0. 6 ± 2. 8 kg; P= 0. 175), whereas V significantly decreased from 29. 0 ± 6. 8 to 27. 4 ± 6. 0 l (- 1. 6 ± 3. 0 l or 4. 5 %; P= 0. 002). The reduction in V was greater when baseline albumin was lower (P= 0. 001) and baseline V was higher (P= 0. 005). The single-pool Kt/V calculated using baseline V underestimated the actual value by 0. 07 ± 0. 16 (P= 0. 008). The slight underestimate of Kt/V during follow-up suggests that annual <b>V</b> <b>evaluations</b> may be sufficient for dialysis dose quantification as the only risk is underestimating the actually delivered dialysis dose. However, the relationship between baseline albumin and the reduction in V over time may have nutritional value, and suggests more frequent <b>V</b> <b>evaluations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Studies in {{the field}} of {{molecular}} nutrition and food research often aim at identifying effects of bioactive ingredients on living organisms. When data from human studies are difficult to obtain, effects are often studied in relevant animal or cellular in vitro models. This poses the need for adequate extrapolation from the in vitro to the in vivo situation, from high-dose levels to realistic low-dose levels and from experimental animals to humans. Furthermore, effects of genetic polymorphisms or lifestyle factors may have to be taken into account. Physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modeling provides a means to support these kinds of extrapolations. The present paper illustrates the basic concepts of PBK modeling. PBK modeling includes six steps: (i) definition of the conceptual model, (ii) translation into a mathematical model, (iii) defining parameter values, (iv) solving the equations, (<b>v)</b> <b>evaluation</b> of model performance and (vi) making predictions. The paper provides an overview of these basic steps and presents examples to illustrate how PBK modeling can be applied.

40|$|Objectives Work-related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders (MSD) are highly prevalent {{and put a}} large burden on (working) society. Primary prevention of work-related MSD focuses often on physical risk factors (such as manual lifting and awkward postures) but has not been too successful in reducing the MSD burden. This may partly be caused by insufficient knowledge of etiological mechanisms and/or a lack of adequately feasible interventions (theory failure and program failure, respectively), possibly due to limited integration of research disciplines. A research framework could link research disciplines thereby strengthening {{the development and implementation}} of preventive interventions. Our objective was to define and describe such a framework for multi-disciplinary research on work-related MSD prevention. Methods We described a framework for MSD prevention research, partly based on frameworks from other research fields (ie, sports injury prevention and public health). Results The framework is composed of a repeated sequence of six steps comprising the assessment of (i) incidence and severity of MSD, (ii) risk factors for MSD, and (iii) underlying mechanisms; and the (iv) development, (<b>v)</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and (vi) implementation of preventive intervention(s). Conclusions In the present framework for optimal work-related MSD prevention, research disciplines are linked.

40|$|One goal of {{educational}} design {{research is to}} provide guidelines for the design process. This paper reports on our on-going work {{on the development of}} such guidelines by evaluating the design procedure of a pre-service chemistry teacher education course on models and visualization. In the design of the course, the concept maps were utilized as interactive road maps for coordination and documentation of the co-operative development of the design solution. Description of the roles and collaboration between the evelopers in the design process are presented as a design narrative based on the analysis of semi-structure interviews of three course developers. The valuated design process had six phases: (i) establishing goals for the design procedure, (ii) evaluation of the initial design solutions, (iii) collaborative construction of the design solution, (iv) implementation of the design solution, (<b>v)</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the design solution, and (vi) evaluation of the design procedure. During the course, the concept map created during the co-operative construction of the design solution was used as a summary of the objectives of the course, management tool, and description of the design process.
