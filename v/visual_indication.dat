5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct vantage point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on vantage points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or <b>visual</b> <b>indication.</b>|$|E

50|$|Dead Nation lacked online {{voice chat}} upon release, but an update {{released}} on March 10, 2011 added this feature. The update also included laser sight upgrades for guns and display improvements including <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> when the rush meter fills and when players take damage.|$|R
25|$|The towers {{stand outside}} {{the width of}} the aisles, but screen two chapels located {{immediately}} behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create an appearance of strength. The windows of the lower storey are smaller than those of the side walls and are deeply recessed, a <b>visual</b> <b>indication</b> of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.|$|E
25|$|Quantitative symbols give a <b>visual</b> <b>indication</b> of the {{magnitude}} of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon’s magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. Choropleth maps portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.|$|E
25|$|In {{vehicles}} {{with a separate}} left and right green turn signal tell-tale on the dashboard, both left and right indicators may flash to provide <b>visual</b> <b>indication</b> of the hazard flashers' operation. In {{vehicles with}} a single green turn signal tell-tale on the dashboard, a separate red tell-tale must be provided for hazard flasher indication. Because the hazard flasher function operates the vehicle's left and right turn signals, a left or a right turn signal function may not be provided while the hazard flashers are operating, although the vehicle may activate the indicator {{and return to the}} hazard flashing phase once the indicator is deactivated.|$|E
5000|$|However, Christof Rolker {{and others}} have found that Canon Law sources provide {{evidence}} of alternative perspectives, based upon prevailing <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> {{and the performance of}} gendered roles.

50|$|Since about 2000 {{nearly all}} {{avalanche}} rescue transceivers use digital displays to give <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> of direction and distance to victims. Most users find these beacons easier to use, {{but to be}} effective still requires considerable practice by the user. Beacons are the primary rescue tool for companion rescue and are considered active devices because the user must learn to use and care for their device.|$|R
5000|$|In Ireland, vehicle {{registration}} plates (commonly known as [...] "number plates") are the <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> of motor {{vehicle registration}} - officially termed [...] "index marks" [...] - {{which it has}} been mandatory since 1903 to display on most motor vehicles used on public roads in Ireland. The alphanumeric marks (or [...] "registration numbers") themselves are issued by the local authority in which a vehicle is second registered.|$|R
25|$|Another room, {{designed}} by Michael Inchbald, where QE2s advanced interior design was demonstrated {{was the first}} class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the ceiling height, created an impression of airy openness above {{to deal with the}} otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend into the ceiling and to lose the <b>visual</b> <b>indication</b> of low ceiling height that straight columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Michael Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The indirect lighting from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.|$|E
25|$|Some timpani are {{equipped}} with tuning gauges, which provide a <b>visual</b> <b>indication</b> of the pitch. They are physically connected either to the counterhoop, {{in which case the}} gauge indicates how far the counterhoop is pushed down, or the pedal, in which case the gauge indicates the position of the pedal. These gauges are accurate when used correctly. However, when the instrument is disturbed in some fashion (transported, for example), the overall pitch can change, thus the markers on the gauges may not remain reliable unless they have been adjusted immediately preceding the performance. The pitch can also be changed by room temperature and humidity. This effect also occurs due to changes in weather, especially if an outdoor performance is to take place. Gauges are especially useful when performing music that involves fast tuning changes that do not allow the timpanist to listen to the new pitch before playing it. Even when gauges are available, good timpanists will check their intonation by ear before playing. Occasionally, timpanists use the pedals to retune while playing.|$|E
2500|$|Partch's {{notation}} is an obstacle, as it mixes {{a sort of}} tablature with {{indications of}} pitch ratios. [...] This {{makes it difficult for}} those trained in traditional Western notation, and gives no <b>visual</b> <b>indication</b> as to what the music is intended to sound like.|$|E
2500|$|Captain Nowroz [...] "decided {{that since}} patchy fog shifts quickly {{he would make}} an {{approach}} {{with a view to}} landing at Gatwick". The accident report stated that because he was relying principally on <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> as he came in to land, he may have been distracted from his flight-deck duties; and patchy fog in otherwise clear conditions has been known to severely affect the sighting of visual references, sometimes leading to [...] "disastrous errors of judgment".|$|R
50|$|One {{product made}} by Bendix was a Land Mine Detecting {{set for the}} US Army and US Air Force in July 1952.

2500|$|Power {{reverse gear}} was fitted {{slowly to the}} entire class per an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the task being {{complete}} by the early 1930s.

2500|$|Near railway lines, {{on which}} [...] "fog working" [...] was implemented, loud explosions {{similar to the}} report of a shotgun were a common feature. The explosions were made by [...] "detonators" [...] – a form of large {{percussion}} cap placed on the track and activated by the wheels of trains.

40|$|The current {{generation}} of civil air transport aircraft presents significant advanced intelligent warning systems {{as compared to the}} earlier technologies. One of the important aspects of these developments is the centralized alerting and monitoring system that displays the information directly to pilots. Despite these advances, there are still areas where substantial improvements might be made on the existing warning systems. This report addresses a brief review on the existing intelligent warning system in the aircrafts and related issues. A novel approach (Flight Guardian) is introduced that amalgamate a number of methods to produce an intelligent warning system. The main purpose of the Flight Guardian (FG) is the development of a regular monitoring platform for an aircraft that provides flight-deck awareness robustly. The FG system is able to intelligently alarm in terms of voice activated prompts and <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> in the hazardous and emergency situations. The FG is capable of monitoring and interpreting the continuous stream of video data from aircraft cockpit retrieved by the camera devices. In abnormal conditions, FG provides the spoken and <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> by diagnosing the cause of hazardous situation which help to mitigate the human pilot mistakes...|$|R
50|$|A {{train driver}} failing {{to respond to}} a signal's {{indication}} can be disastrous. As a result, various auxiliary safety systems have been devised. Any such system requires installation of some degree of trainborne equipment. Some systems only intervene {{in the event of a}} signal being passed at danger (SPAD). Others include audible and/or <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> inside the driver's cab to supplement the lineside signals. Automatic brake application occurs if the driver should fail to acknowledge a warning. Some systems act intermittently (at each signal), but the most sophisticated systems provide continuous supervision.|$|R
50|$|Despite the 100 and 105 bodies {{being very}} similar, {{there are some}} {{exterior}} <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> between both models. The most obvious is {{the front end of}} the vehicle often appearing lower than the rear on the 100 models, due to the IFS. The other indicator is the design of the wheels. The 100 models have almost flat wheel designs, while the 105 models have dished wheels. This difference allows both versions to retain similar wheel tracks, despite the 100 having a relatively wider axle track to allow for the IFS system.|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a system}} for deriving direct digital indications of frequency and phase difference between two incoming pulse trains adaptable for collision avoidance systems or the like. A pair of radar beams are directed toward a target and corresponding beams returning therefrom are detected. A digital difference circuit forms a pulse train from the Doppler shift frequencies of each beam pair having a repetition rate functionally related to the difference in magnitude of the shift frequencies. Pulses from the pulse train are counted {{as a function of}} time. <b>Visual</b> <b>indications</b> thereof on display are correlative to target position relative to beams...|$|R
50|$|The WAF {{is found}} in {{greatest}} concentration {{in close proximity to}} the bulk phase of hydrocarbons, the progress of which is often limited by physical containment measures such as booms. The dissolved components of petroleum mixtures such as crude oil can become subject to the transport mechanisms of the bulk aqueous phase. Source identification of these can therefore become problematic without the <b>visual</b> <b>indications</b> usually expected with petroleum hydrocarbon spills. However, after relatively short periods of exposure, the chemical profile of the original oils is still largely intact, allowing chemical analysis to provide identification and discriminate between different petroleum sources.|$|R
