25|$|The {{increase}} of sugars in the grapes {{comes from the}} storage of carbohydrates in the roots and trunk of the grapevines {{as well as through}} the process of photosynthesis. Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transferred from the leaves to the berries as it is broken down into glucose and fructose molecules. The rate of this build up will depend on several factors including the climate (such as a string of cloudy weather which prohibits sunlight from reaching the vine) as well as the potential yield size of grape clusters and young <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> which compete for the resources of the mother grapevine. As the concentration of sugars build up, the concentration of acids decrease due, in part, to simple dilution but also to the consumption of acids in the process of plant respiration. The decrease in free acids, as well as the buildup of potassium, triggers a rise in the pH level of the grape juice.|$|R
50|$|Phototropism is {{the growth}} of an {{organism}} which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light. Phototropism {{is one of the}} many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism, while growth away from light is called negative phototropism (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth. Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism, although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction.|$|R

In the present study, the metabolism of exogenous [2 H]-ent-kaurenoic acid (KA) and [14 C]-gibberellin A 12 -aldehyde (GA 12 -aldehyde) was compared in thermo- and noninduced plants.

The apparent site of perception of thermoinductive temperatures was further localized to the <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> (apex and immature leaves) by controlling the temperature of the <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> independently {{of the rest of the}} plant. Furthermore, excised apices regenerated flowering plants in organ culture only if they were subjected to a 4 week cold treatment. Grafting experiments also support the notion that the <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> or the apex is the site of perception of thermoinductive temperatures: noninduced <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> grafted onto bolting donors remained as vegetative rosettes. Paradoxically, it was found that the cells of the <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> are not the only ones capable of being thermoinduced. Shoots regenerated from leaf cuttings excised from thermoinduced plants exhibited all signs of reproductive development, while regenerated shoots from control leaves developed into vegetative rosettes. It is suggested that many cell types are capable of being thermoinduced and that the <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> may appear to be the site of perception of thermoinductive temperatures because structures associated with reproductive development originate from this tissue...|$|R
40|$|Vernalization of Thlaspi arvense L. {{results in}} the {{alteration}} of gibberellin (GA) metabolism such that the metabolism and turnover of the GA precursor ent-kaur- 16 -en- 19 -oic acid (kaurenoic acid) is dramatically increased. This cold-induced change in GA metabolism is restricted to the <b>shoot</b> <b>tip,</b> the site of perception of cold in this species (J. P. Hazebroek, J. D. Metzger [1990] Plant Physiol 94 : 157 - 165). In the present report additional biochemical information {{about the nature of}} this low-temperature-regulated process is provided. The endogenous levels of kaurenoic acid in leaves and <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> of plants were estimated by combined gas chromatography-chemical ionization mass spectrometry at various times after 4 weeks of vernalization at 6 [deg]C. The endogenous levels in <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> declined 10 -fold by 2 d after the plants were returned to 21 [deg]C; this decline continued such that there was nearly 50 -fold less kaurenoic acid by 10 d after the end of vernalization. No effect of vernalization on the endogenous levels of kaurenoic acid in leaves was observed. An in vitro enzyme assay was developed to monitor changes in the ability of tissues to convert kaurenoic acid to ent- 7 [alpha]-hydroxykaur- 16 -en- 19 -oic acid (7 -OH kaurenoic acid). The activity of this enzyme rapidly increased in microsomal extracts from <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> following the end of vernalization. No thermoinduced increase in activity was observed in leaves. The enzymic oxidation of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenol was also induced in <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> by vernalization. However, this reaction {{does not appear to be}} rate limiting for GA biosynthesis, because substantial amounts of kaurenoic acid accumulated in noninduced <b>shoot</b> <b>tips.</b> These results corroborate our hypothesis that the conversion of kaurenoic acid to 7 -OH kaurenoic acid is the primary step in GA metabolism regulated by vernalization in Thlaspi <b>shoot</b> <b>tips...</b>|$|R
40|$|Harpagophytum procumbens DC (Pedaliaceae), {{also known}} as the Kalahari devil's claw, is an {{important}} medicinal plant in southern Africa. An in vitro regeneration protocol has been achieved via <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> cultures. Single node segments and <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> were cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with various BA concentrations in combination with NAA. All media tested induced axillary buds, <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> growth and root formation. Shoot length decreased with an increase in BA concentration. Maximal shoot length was obtained in MS medium with no hormone supplement, and average shoot number ranged between 1. 5 – 2. 2 shoots/explant. Addition of NAA improved growth of the cultures but induced callus formation...|$|R

In comparison to this, 'normal' vines were characterized by: coloration of <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> and leaves was very weak; dense prostrate hairs occurred (instead of erect hairs); all leaves were 3 -lobed.

A study was {{conducted}} to determine the effect of biweekly <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> harvests on the growth and yield of Georgia Jet sweet potato grown in the greenhouse using the nutrient film technique (NFT). The nutrient solution consisted of a modified half Hoagland solution. Biweekly <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> harvests, beginning 42 days after planting, provided substantial amounts of vegetable greens and did not affect the fresh and dry foliage weights or the storage root number and fresh and dry storage root weights at final harvest.

40|$|<b>Shoot</b> <b>tips</b> of in vitro-grown plantlets of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), {{representing}} {{a wide range}} of germplasm, were cryopreserved as follows: precultured for 3 days, cryoprotected and dehydrated for 1 h, then frozen in liquid nitrogen using a six-step protocol. After 3 h in liquid nitrogen, the <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> were removed, rapidly warmed, and recultured sequentially in three recovery media. After 2 weeks, the regeneration of frozen <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> was completed. Genotypes with a low response were identified. Their response was attributed to the effects of pre- and post-freezing steps. Refining the methodology led to a consistent 50 - 70 percent plant recovery. (RA) Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|As the {{increase}} of chrysanthemum demand on chrysanthemum increases in Korea, the production of high quality chrysanthemum is needed. Chrysanthemum stunt viroid (CSVd) {{is one of the}} important viroid, which infects chrysanthemum and induces diseases that affects the decrease of quality and yield. To solve this problem, we used different size of meristem of chrysanthemum ‘Ency’ for <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> culture and also that of combined with heat treatment at 37 οC. The efficiency of CSVd elimination was influenced by the size of <b>shoot</b> <b>tip.</b> The small-sized of meristems with 1 or 2 leaf primodia were regenerated into the highest number of CSVd-free plantlets. By RT-PCR, the 214 -bp band corresponding to CSVd was not detected in 22. 2 % {{of the total number of}} tested regenerants from <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> with 2 leaf primordia. While, <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> culture combined with heat treatment of one-month-old in vitro shoots was not effective for CSVd-elimination.
