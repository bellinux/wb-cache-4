40|$|Gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) are {{important}} pests of many horticultural crops. They {{are difficult to}} control by conventional means as the larvae develop in galls surrounded by plant tissue. Gravid females need to locate suitable host plant material on which to lay their eggs and there is good evidence that host-produced odour cues are involved. Gall midge pheromones are now available commercially; these attract males to allow monitoring in the field. However there are currently no lures available to attract females. This work aims to develop lures, {{for up to three}} gall midge species, which attract gravid females and can be used to monitor females in the field. Three species of gall midges were investigated: the raspberry cane midge, Resseliella theobaldi (Barnes), the blackcurrant <b>leaf</b> <b>midge,</b> Dasineura tetensi (Rübsaamen), and the apple <b>leaf</b> <b>midge,</b> Dasineura mali (Kiefer). Field studies showed gravid raspberry cane midge females are attracted to split canes for oviposition. Chemicals were identified using solid phase microextraction (SPME) which were present only or in much larger quantities after canes split. A lure based on these chemicals was tested in the field with different trap types but no significant attraction was seen to the lures of either male or female raspberry cane <b>midges.</b> Blackcurrant <b>leaf</b> <b>midge</b> females lay their eggs on blackcurrant shoots. A suite of volatiles was identified using SPME which were produced by blackcurrant shoots. Bioassay work was carried out in a four-way olfactometer and a wind tunnel to assess female attraction to shoot material but no attraction was seen in either experiment. Solutions containing natural volatile extracts were obtained using entrainment onto Porapak resin. The effect of these chemicals on female blackcurrant <b>leaf</b> <b>midge</b> antennae was assessed using electroantennography (EAG) but there were not enough responses to conclude that any compound was EAG-active. Apple <b>leaf</b> <b>midges</b> lay their eggs on apple leaf shoots. A suite of chemicals was identified which are produced by apple shoots. EAG runs were carried out on female midges with both natural and synthetic solutions but numbers of responses were low and {{it was not possible to}} conclude that any of the compounds were definitively EAG active...|$|R

Aromatherapy for horses is becoming popular with owners however there are few published studies on equine response to essential oil odours. The study aimed to identify which essential oils were attractive to horses. The study comprised 10 horses, (5) geldings, (5) mares of mixed breed. Nine organic essential oils plus a control (no oil) were presented in a repeated measures experimental design. Oils were applied to cotton wool and gauze and hung either side of the stable door. Presentation of oils was randomised using a 10 x 10 Latin Square design. Oils were presented in pairs for 120 seconds with a 5 minute interval between tests. Horses were exposed to 5 paired presentations on day 1 and the experiment was repeated on day 2. Behaviour was recorded on videotape for 120 seconds. Continuous focal sampling was used to analyse behaviour based on an ethogram using Observer 5. 0 ® software. The time the horses spent investigating each individual test substance was recorded. Range 169. 2 seconds (<b>Violet</b> <b>Leaf)</b> to 35. 4 seconds (control). Kendall’s W coefficient of concordance compared agreement in duration of interest between the horses. The mean ranked duration of investigation was significant (W= 0. 272, n= 10, p= < 0. 05).

40|$|Catches {{of apple}} <b>leaf</b> <b>midge,</b> Dasineura mali, in sex {{pheromone}} traps and subsequent galling damage to shoots over four successive midge generations per season were investigated during 2004 and 2005 in apple orchards in Kent, south eastern England, Trentino, northern Italy and South Island, New Zealand. The orchards were newly planted or established, had widely varying apple <b>leaf</b> <b>midge</b> populations and {{were subjected to}} different pesticide management regimes. The Julian date of the peak catch of midges in the sex pheromone traps increased approximately linearly with increasing generation number. There was also a strong increasing relationship between the Julian date of peak catch and increasing absolute value of latitude. A linear relationship was fitted {{within the range of}} 41 - 51 degrees latitude included. Strong linear relationships on log-log transformed scales were found between the total and peak numbers of midges caught per generation and the populations of galls that developed subsequently. The best fit of log 10 (total galls/ha)  =  2. 138  + log 10 (total no. midges caught/generation) was obtained for the first and second generations. The relationship indicates that each male midge caught in a trap for a particular generation corresponds to approximately 137 galls being formed per hectare subsequently for that generation, providing that there are sufficient shoots and tender young leaves present to accommodate them. Clearly the proportion of shoots and leaves galled per hectare will depend on the numbers of shoots and leaves present in the particular orchard but knowledge of these parameters should allow simple estimates to be made. The regressions were significantly weakened when the third and especially the fourth generations were included, largely because of gall saturation or because tree growth had ceased. The relationships were not significantly affected by pesticide management regime, orchard age or country of location. In a further study, a good correspondence was found between pheromone trap catches and the percentage of shoots infested with eggs of D. mali for the first and second generation in an experimental orchard in Kent during 2006. The results indicate that the sex pheromone traps are effective for monitoring the flight activity of successive generations of D. mali, can be used to predict the severity of galling attacks to shoots and are likely to be useful for timing insecticide sprays...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNatural {{extracts}} used in fine fragrances (alcoholic perfumes) {{are rare}} and precious. As such, they represent an interesting target for fraudulent practices called adulterations. Absolutes, important {{materials used in}} the creation of perfumes, are obtained by organic solvent extraction of raw plant materials. Because the nonvolatile part of these natural extracts is not normalized and scarcely reported, highlighting potential adulterations present in this fraction appears highly challenging. For the first time, we investigated the use of nontargeted UHPLC-ToFMS metabolomics for this purpose, considering Viola odorata l., a plant largely used in the perfume industry, as a model. Significant differences in the metabolic fingerprints of the <b>violet</b> <b>leaf</b> absolutes were evidenced according to geographical locations, and/or adulterations. Additionally, markers of the geographical origin were detected through their molecular weight/most probable molecular formula and retention time, while adulterations were statistically validated. In this study, we thus clearly demonstrated the efficiency of UHPLC-ToFMS-based metabolomics in accelerating both the identification of the origin of raw materials as well as the search for potential adulterations in absolutes, natural products of high added value...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that midge sex pheromones could be chemically more diverse in structure {{than previously thought}} was tested {{in the context of}} four midge species of importance to UK horticulture: pear <b>leaf</b> <b>midge,</b> Dasineura pyri; pear midge, Contarinia pyrivora; blackcurrant midge, D. tetensi; and blackberry midge, D. plicatrix. The major component of the pheromone of D. pyri was identified as (2 R, 13 R, 8 Z) - 2, 13 -diacetoxy- 8 -heptadecene. Four isomers were separated by HPLC and in field tests the first eluting isomer only was attractive to male midges. Analysis of volatile collections from female C. pyrivora showed two consistent responses from male midges and they were identified as 2, 7 -diacetoxyundecane and 7 -acetoxyundecane- 2 -one. The field testing with isomers of 2, 7 -diacetoxyundecane separated by HPLC revealed that the first and the third eluting isomers were attractive. The racemic 7 -acetoxyundecane- 2 -one was active as well as the first eluting isomer from HPLC. Two EAG active components were detected in D. tetensi female volatile collections. The major component was identified as (Z) - 2, 12 -diacetoxy- 8 -heptadecene and after separation of stereoisomers by HPLC the third eluting isomer has shown to be attractive to male D. tetensi in the field. The structure for the minor component was proposed as a keto-acetate homologue of the corresponding major component. Preliminary work carried out on identification of the female sex pheromone of D. plicatrix indicated two responses from conspecific males. These were shown to be 15 -carbon acetates with the acetate function at C- 2, probably with two and one double bonds respectively. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Leaf discs of Saintpaulia ionantha x confusa hybrids (African Violets) were cultured and {{transferred}} between hormonal free medium (MS basal medium) and shoot-inducing medium (SIM) {{to determine whether}} there is a window of competence in shoot regeneration. The results showed that cultured cells were not responsive to shoot-inducing signals (i. e. not competent) until 3 - 5 days after explant isolation but the ability to regenerate shoots was not lost in surviving cells/tissues cultured on basal medium. Light microscopic observations found that first periclinal divisions of epidermal cells occurred at 3 - 5 days on SIM. Meristemoids were then formed from the derivatives of the original epidermal cells. It is proposed that cellular competence for shoot regeneration is acquired in culture. The pre-competent period consists of a resting phase and a "dedifferentiation" phase in which epidermal cells divide periclinally to form "dedifferentiated" cells which are the true target cells for shoot induction. Mutagenic treatments and propagation of a chimeral African Violet cultivar were carried out to study cell origin of adventitious shoots in African <b>Violet</b> <b>leaf</b> culture. The results suggest that adventitious shoots may originate from either multiple cells or single cells. The multiple cell origin is in contrast to the hypothesis of exclusively single cell origin for adventitious shoots proposed in several studies. Several factors were studied to identify the source of variations in shoot regeneration among individual explants and to define conditions favourable for shoot regeneration in African Violet in vitro culture. These factors include donor plant growth temperature, the presence of light and the quality of light in culture, the role of chlorophyll in cultured tissues, position of explants in leaves, age of explant materials, source and type of explants, wounding and leaf disc orientation on media. It was found that the presence of light in culture, age of leaf explants, source (in vitro cultured vs pot plant) and type (leaf vs petiole) of explants, wounding and leaf disc orientation on media all had a statistically significant effect on shoot production...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{the female}} sex pheromone {{of the apple}} <b>leaf</b> <b>midge,</b> Dasineura mali (Kieffer (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), was identified by us as (Z) - 13 -acetoxy- 8 -heptadecen- 2 -one. Only one enantiomer of the chiral compound was attractive to male midges but the racemic mixture was equally attractive. A series of replicated field experiments was carried out during 2004 – 2006 to develop an optimised pheromone trap system for monitoring populations of D. mali in commercial orchards. With rubber septa dispensers numbers of midges caught increased with increase in loading of pheromone over the range tested from 1 mg to 100 mg and a loading of 3 mg {{was found to be}} suitable for pest monitoring purposes. Polyethylene vial dispensers were unattractive during these tests. Release rate studies in the laboratory showed reasonably uniform release of pheromone from the septa for at least 574 days at 27 C and 8 km/h wind speed. With the vials there was a delay of 10 days before the start of release of pheromone under these conditions. Funnel, bottle, Petri dish, delta and dish traps all caught midges, those with the larger catching surfaces being more sensitive. In practice, it was concluded that the standard delta trap is the best design for use by growers. The colour of the trap had no effect on attractiveness to D. mali males, but catches of non-target arthropods in red, green an black traps were significantly lower than in white, yellow or blue traps. The red traps are recommended for use by growers. Numbers of male midges caught were greatest in traps at ground level and decreased strongly with increasing height of trap deployment. A standard deployment height of 0. 5 m was chosen. Males were attracted to traps over a distance of at least 50 m from an infested orchard. They showed a strong diurnal pattern of flight activity. Numbers caught rose steeply in the morning starting at 07 : 00 h (2 h after dawn), reached a peak at 09 : 00 h and steadily declined throughout the day thereafter. Conversely, numbers of ovipositing females were very low at 09 : 00 h but increased steadily, reaching a peak at 11 : 00 – 12 : 00 h and declining thereafter...|$|R
40|$|Habituation to sex pheromones {{is one of}} the key {{mechanisms}} in mating disruption, an insect control tactic. Male moths often show reduced sexual response after pre-exposure to female sex pheromone. Mating disruption is relatively rare in insect orders other than Lepidoptera. As a positive control we confirmed habituation in a moth (Epiphyas postvittana) using 24 h pre-exposure to sex pheromone to reduce subsequent activation behaviour. We then tested the impact of pre-exposure to sex or trail pheromone on subsequent behavioural response with insects from three other orders. Similar pre-exposure for 24 h to either sex pheromone (Pseudococcus calceolariae (Homoptera) and apple <b>leaf</b> curling <b>midge</b> Dasineura mali (Diptera), or trail pheromone of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera)), followed by behavioural assay in clean air provided no evidence of habituation after pre-exposure in these latter cases. The moths alone were affected by pre-exposure to pheromone. For pests without habituation, sustained attraction to a point source may make lure and kill more economical. Improved knowledge of behavioural processes should lead to better success in pest management and mechanisms should be investigated further to inform studies and practical efforts generally enhancing effectiveness of pheromone-based management...|$|R

A HVP foi testada neste estudo usando Bauhinia brevipes (Fabaceae) como planta hospedeira de uma galha foliar induzida por Asphondylia microcapillata (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) por três anos consecutivos. Ramos foram coletados das mesmas 80 plantas entre 2001 e 2003 e o tamanho do ramo, número de ramos galhados e sadios, número de galhas e fatores de mortalidade foram registrados. Aproximadamente 600 galhas de A. microcapillata foram coletadas em 5. 800 ramos de B. brevipes. Ramos médios suportaram entre 46 % e 70 % do total de galhas, e a taxa de sobrevivência das galhas foi maior em 2002 e 2003. Uma diminuição da taxa de parasitismo associada com um aumento da taxa de predação de galhas resultou em uma sobrevivência similar em todos os anos (x = 22, 7 %). A abundância de galhas variou entre os anos (122 em 2001, 114 em 2002 e 359 e 2003).
