40|$|In {{this chapter}} we revisit some portal {{research}} we conducted in Bangladesh and in Australia, {{the data collection}} of which was conducted in the early 2000 s. We then investigate the evolution of these different types of web portal and how they compare ten years later. The concept of a web portal {{has been around for}} some time, but {{in the last few years}} the portal concept has gained considerably in importance as new types of portal are developed and new uses found for portal technology. This chapter begins with a brief classification of the types of portals in use today. Developed and developing countries experience different problems in making use of e-commerce and see the advantages and problems of using portals rather differently. In the chapter we examine and compare case studies of a Horizontal Business-Business Industry Portal in Melbourne, Australia, and a <b>Vertical</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>Portal</b> in Dhaka, Bangladesh. ...|$|E

40|$|Various initiatives, {{promoted}} by {{public and private}} organizations, attempt to overcome the difficulties hindering the actual use of Web technologies by {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). Among such initiatives, the design and implementation of <b>industry</b> <b>portals</b> are deemed to be an earlier step toward e-business by SMEs. There has been a proliferation of portals, especially in traditional sectors, created with the purpose to facilitate the communication by SMEs with their trading partner, to favor information sharing, improve the efficiency of individual firms and supply chains, and promote innovation. While there are interesting examples of successful <b>industry</b> <b>portals,</b> several others failed.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyse how <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> {{linkages}} may work as channels for ex-ternalities. We test for activity based externalities stemming from output growth and output level in vertically linked industries. Moreover, by comparing results on localised inter-industry externalities {{as well as}} significance of local sales linkages, we try to reveal the strength of self-reinforcing ag-glomeration forces. A number of Norwegian maritime transport and services sectors are analysed. The results are promising {{in the sense that}} the model allows us to distinguish empirically between different sources of externalities, and unveils the extent to which <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> linkages give rise to self-reinforcing agglomeration.
