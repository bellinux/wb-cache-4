The aerodynamic excitation phenomenon was not studied in this research. Furthermore, the turbine blades studied in this research had the characteristics of being unshrouded, uncooled and used mainly in small to medium sized turbomachineries. This thesis consists of four main subjects. The first subject, composed of an analysis of experimental results, was done to ex tract damping values of the turbine blades as well as resonances. The damping values extracted from the experimental data were used to determine analytical <b>vibratory</b> <b>stresses</b> with FLARES. Furthermore, the resonances were identified during the data reduction and therefore, the experimental <b>vibratory</b> <b>stresses</b> were extracted. These values were later used to correlate the analytical <b>vibratory</b> <b>stresses</b> predicted using FLARES.

5000|$|Further, {{there is}} a strong {{economic}} incentive to use <b>vibratory</b> <b>stress</b> relief on large workpieces, since stress relief using a furnace (thermal stress relief or TSR) is highly energy-intensive; consuming much natural gas, and hence, producing much CO2. The cost of TSR is approximately proportional to a metal component’s weight or overall size, estimated to be $2,500 USD for the structure pictured, plus transportation costs, which might involve special transport permits, to and from a furnace. VSR Treatment would cost a company owning appropriate equipment less than 15% as much ( [...] ≈ $400 [...] ) as TSR Treatment, chiefly amortization of equipment investment plus labor, and a modest amount of electrical consumption, and treatment would take less than two hours, with no transport required. However, the lack of independent data to show that this technique is effective may mean that even that lesser investment is not of any value, so use of VSR should evaluated very carefully before proceeding.|$|E

40|$|HCF of {{turbomachinery}} blading is {{a significant}} design problem because fatigue failures can result from resonant vibratory stresses sustained over a relatively short time.

Hence, stress-range diagrams are used to quantify the allowable <b>vibratory</b> <b>stress</b> amplitudes to avoid fatigue damage. Advanced turbomachinery blading is designed to have high steady stress levels. Thus, HCF occurs because of high mean stress- low amplitude vibratory loading of the airfoils.

40|$|Rotor blade scaling is {{a method}} aimed at {{reducing}} the computational domain in turbomachinery simulations by changing the number of blades such that the blade-to-vane ratio in the scaled geometry {{is equal to the}} ratio of two small integers (e. g., 1 / 1, 1 / 2, 1 / 3, 2 / 3, 3 / 4 etc.), but without changing the airfoil shape. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the quantitative effects that rotor blade scaling has on the numerical simulations of a representative single-stage gas turbine, with particular focus on parameters that influence <b>vibratory</b> <b>stresses</b> on the rotor blades. Simulations were conducted using the commercial software FLUENT 6. 3. 26. Results from an unsealed case were compared to LDV measurements and to two scaled cases. Average computing times for the three cases confirmed that the cases with the smallest computational domain were the most efficient. The present results demonstrate that blade scaling affects significantly the magnitude of unsteady pressure fluctuations, which influence the level of <b>vibratory</b> <b>stresses</b> on the blades. Moreover, scaling has been found to affect the size of blade wakes and the magnitude of losses in the blade wakes. As the rotor blade size increased pressure fluctuations on the surface of the rotor blade increased. Pressure fluctuations on the surface of the stator vane decreased as the blade to vane ratio more closely approached an integer number. These results suggest that, in numerical simulations of gas turbine operation, scaling should be kept to very low levels to avoid strong departures from the predicted performance of the unsealed geometry.
