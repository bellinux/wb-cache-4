5|$|The Mk. IV was {{a complex}} lash-up of systems, known collectively in the RAF as the Airborne Radio Installation 5003 (ARI 5003). Individual parts {{included}} the R3066 or R3102 receiver, T3065 transmitter, Modulator Type 20, Transmitter Aerial Type 19, Elevation Aerial Type 25, Azimuth Aerial Type 21 and 25, Impedance Matching Unit Type 35, <b>Voltage</b> <b>Control</b> Panel Type 3, and Indicator Unit Type 20 or 48.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

25|$|The ‘system gain’ is an {{important}} source of reactive power in the above power balance equation, which is generated by the capacitative nature of the transmission network itself. By making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases, the system gain can be maximized early on, helping to secure the system for the whole day. To balance the equation some pre-fault reactive generator use will be required. Other sources of reactive power that will also be used include shunt capacitors, shunt reactors, static VAR compensators and <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> circuits.|$|E
25|$|In 1959–1960, Harald Bode {{developed}} a modular synthesizer and sound processor, and in 1961, {{he wrote a}} paper exploring the concept of self-contained portable modular synthesizer using newly emerging transistor technology. He also served as AES session chairman on music and electronic for the fall conventions in 1962 and 1964. His ideas were adopted by Donald Buchla and Robert Moog in the United States, and Paolo Ketoff et al. in Italy {{at about the same}} time: among them, Moog is known as the first synthesizer designer to popularize the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> technique in analog electronic musical instruments.|$|E
500|$|The 147 is the [...] "universal" [...] {{version of}} the 122, {{designed}} for many organs, and has a different amplifier input and motor speed control, but is otherwise identical. The signal input is unbalanced, allowing a simpler connection to organs that have a built-in speaker system, such as the Hammond A100, or a Wurlitzer. The motor speed switching uses a separate AC signal, rather than the DC <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122's lower susceptibility to induced noise, and a delay between operation of the speed control and the actual change in speed. As with the 122 and 142, the 145 {{is identical to the}} 147, except that it is housed in a [...] cabinet, and thus slightly easier to move. As with the 122, Hammond-Suzuki manufactures a modern replacement, the 147A. The model X-77, released in 1968, was designed to accompany Hammond's new tonewheel / transistor organ, the X-66. It contained seven different tab controls and six speakers. It has a completely different interface from other Leslies, using a 12-pin amphenol connector.|$|E

40|$|A general {{phase lock}} loop may be modeled as a {{reference}} signal and a feedback signal driving a phase detector logic network (A).

2500|$|A simple voltage/current {{regulator}} can be {{made from}} a resistor in series with a diode (or series of diodes).

2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938. The conductor rails were fed direct, without any distribution. Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the positive outer rail set [...] from the running rail. The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets. The driving positions controlled all the motors on the train by the means of a low <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> signal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The OTA {{is a basic}} {{building}} blocks found in many analog circuits such as data converter’s (ADC &DAC) and Gm-C filters.
