25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s single-hose {{regulators}} {{started to take}} over as the standard, and this complicated the buddy breathing procedure. The single hose exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>position</b> {{at the bottom of}} most DVs made it necessary to offset the recipient to the right side when face to face, or to the left when side by side. The standard procedure of continuous exhalation during ascent to avoid lung over-pressure injury could leave the diver with insufficient air to clear the regulator, so it was necessary to hold the DV in a way that did not obstruct the recipient from accessing the purge button, as the single hose would not normally free flow when raised above the head. The increasing popularity of the buoyancy compensator was another complication, as it is necessary to periodically vent it during an ascent to avoid a runaway expansion of the contents and an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This requires the use of one hand. the other is needed to control the regulator and hold on to the other diver, a moderately complex set of simultaneous tasks. It is possible to coordinate these activities, but this requires greater skill than with the original procedure, and therefore more intensive training to perform reliably. Since running out of air was becoming less common, the procedure was practiced less often, and skills generally deteriorated. The use of a secondary (octopus) second stage or a bailout cylinder removes the necessity for this complex and relatively stressful procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Suppose {{the initial}} {{operating}} point D (...) at some rpm N. On decreasing the flow- rate at same rpm along the characteristic curve by partial {{closing of the}} valve, the pressure in the pipe increases which will be taken care by increase in input pressure at the compressor. Further increase in pressure till point P (surge point), compressor pressure will increase. Further moving towards left keeping rpm constant, pressure in pipe will increase but compressor pressure will decrease leading to back air-flow towards the compressor. Due to this back flow, pressure in pipe will decrease because this unequal pressure condition cannot stay {{for a long period}} of time. Though <b>valve</b> <b>position</b> is set for lower flow rate say point G but compressor will work according to normal stable operation point say E, so path E-F-P-G-E will be followed leading to breakdown of flow, hence pressure in the compressor falls further to point H (...) [...] This increase and decrease of pressure in pipe will occur repeatedly in pipe and compressor following the cycle E-F-P-G-H-E also known as the surge cycle.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to define several methods that enable to {{estimate}} the heat exchanged in the different components of an air handling unit (AHU), and propose control strategy optimizations. The AHU studied is a part of a low energy office building located in Norway. The focus is especially made on its rotary heat recovery system, its heating/cooling coil and its heating coil. The data of one month recorded by the building energy management system (BEMS) have been used. The heat exchanged estimation methods presented in this paper are based on heat balances, <b>valve</b> <b>positions</b> and heat exchangers number of transfer unit (NTU). Comparison of the results obtained with the different methods outlined a poor quality of the <b>valves</b> <b>positions</b> signals. This fact has also been confirmed using a statistical method, the principal component analysis (PCA). Because of this issue, the methods proposed have not been validated. Regarding control strategy optimization, the use of a heat exchanged estimation method is required. The estimation method based on NTU has been used as reference, since this method does not use the <b>valves</b> <b>positions</b> signals. The goals of control strategy optimization are to reduce the energy costs and the CO 2 emission. The proposed improvements are based on a new distribution between components of input heat, regarding the specific energy cost and CO 2 emission of components. The tested optimizations gave better results that the current control strategy, but since the method used as reference has not been validated, these conclusions have to be confirmed after a resolution of the <b>valves</b> <b>positions</b> signals problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Positioning</b> of <b>valves</b> is {{a real-life}} issue in Water Distribution Systemdesignand,currently,itisusuallyaddressedbyhandbyhydraulic engineers, or {{by means of}} genetic algorithms, that give no {{assurance}} of optimality. Since a given valves placement identifies a sectorization of the WDS in several isolable portions, the <b>valves</b> <b>positioning</b> problem {{can be seen as}} a variant of the well known graph partitioning, which is a hard combinatorial problem. [2] showed recently that Computational Logic can provide technologies and techniques that can be exploited to model and achieve the optimal partition of the water network (i. e., the optimal <b>positioning</b> of <b>valves).</b> In particular, they tackled the optimization of the <b>valves</b> <b>positioning</b> through a two player game model, giving a Constraint Logic Programming formalization to solve it effectively. The aim of this paper, instead, istoinvestigatethepotential ofAnswerSetProgramming in this practical application; evaluation is in terms both of language expressivityandsolvingefficiency.

50|$|Gate valves are {{actuated}} by a threaded stem which {{connects the}} actuator (e.g. handwheel or motor) to the gate. They are characterised as having either a rising or a nonrising stem, {{depending on which}} end of the stem is threaded. Rising stems are fixed to the gate and rise and lower together as the valve is operated, providing a visual indication of <b>valve</b> <b>position.</b> The actuator {{takes the form of}} a nut which is rotated around the threaded stem to move it. Nonrising stem valves are fixed to, and rotate with, the actuator, and are threaded into the gate. They may have a pointer threaded onto the upper end of the stem to indicate <b>valve</b> <b>position,</b> since the gate's motion is concealed inside the valve. Nonrising stems are used underground or where vertical space is limited.|$|E
50|$|The limit {{switches}} signal when an end {{position has been}} reached. The torque switching measures the torque present in the valve.

40|$|Transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (T-AVI) has shown good results in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. Throughout {{the whole process}} of T-AVI, different imaging modalities are indispensable. Preoperatively, multislice computed tomography, angiography and transesophageal echo (TEE) are utilized for patient selection, valve selection, approach selection and the planning of implant placement. Intraoperatively, angiography and TEE are used for controlling placement of the guidewire and <b>valve</b> <b>positioning.</b> Quality control and follow-up require TEE imaging and can require additional CT or angiography studies. In {{the first half of this}} paper, we discuss the applicability of different imaging modalities for T-AVI in the light of the current best practice. In the second half of this paper, we present an overview on research projects in medical engineering which aim at development of image-based methods for increasing patient safety during T-AVI. Template-based implantation planning, as it is applied in dental, orthopedic and other surgical disciplines, is proposed as an aid during implant selection in order to help reduce the incidence of complications such as atrioventricular node block and paravalvular leaks. Current research tries to apply state-of-the-art engineering techniques, such as computational fluid dynamics to optimize <b>valve</b> selection and <b>positioning.</b> For intraoperative assistance during <b>valve</b> <b>positioning,</b> real-time image processing methods are proposed to track target landmarks and the stented valve...|$|R
50|$|A {{low voltage}} {{is used to}} control the servo valve.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{function of}} the PU Valve was to provide thrust variations {{in order to maximize}} payload. The second stage, for example, operated with the PU valve in the closed position for more than 70% of the firing duration. This <b>valve</b> <b>position</b> provided 225000 lbf kN of thrust at a 5.5:1 propellant (oxidizer to fuel by weight) mixture ratio (when the PU valve was fully open, the mixture ratio was 4.5:1 and the thrust level was 175000 lbf kN). During the latter portion of the flight, the PU <b>valve</b> <b>position</b> was varied to provide simultaneous emptying of the propellant tanks. The third stage also operated at the high-thrust level {{for the majority of the}} burning time in order to realize the high thrust benefits. The exact period of time at which the engine operated with the PU valve closed varied with individual mission requirements and propellant tanking levels.|$|E
