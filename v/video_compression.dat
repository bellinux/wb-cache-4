25|$|After subsampling, each channel must {{be split}} into 8×8 blocks. Depending on chroma subsampling, this yields Minimum Coded Unit (MCU) blocks of size 8×8 (4:4:4– no subsampling), 16×8 (4:2:2), or most {{commonly}} 16×16 (4:2:0). In <b>video</b> <b>compression</b> MCUs are called macroblocks.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented of <b>video</b> data <b>compression</b> applied to microgravity space experiments using High Resolution High Frame Rate Video Technology (HHVT). An extensive survey of methods of <b>video</b> data <b>compression,</b> {{described in the}} open literature, was conducted. The survey examines compression methods employing digital computing. The results of the survey are presented. They include a description of each method and assessment of image degradation and video data parameters.

25|$|KVCD (K <b>Video</b> <b>Compression</b> Dynamics) is an XVCD variant that {{requires}} the use of a proprietary quantization matrix, available for non-commercial use. KVCD is notable because the specification recommends a non-standard resolution of 528x480 or 528x576. KVCDs encoded at this resolution are only playable by computers with CD-ROM drives, and a small number of DVD players.|$|E
25|$|QuickTime 3.0 {{added support}} for {{graphics}} importer components that could read images from GIF, JPEG, TIFF and other file formats, and video output components which served primarily to export movie data via FireWire. Apple also licensed several third-party technologies {{for inclusion in}} QuickTime 3.0, including the Sorenson Video codec for advanced <b>video</b> <b>compression,</b> the QDesign Music codec for substantial audio compression, and the complete Roland Sound Canvas instrument set and GS Format extensions for improved playback of MIDI music files. It also added video effects which programmers could apply in real-time to video tracks. Some of these effects would even respond to mouse clicks by the user, {{as part of the}} new movie interaction support (known as wired movies).|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Nintendo {{released}} the Nintendo 3DS, {{based upon a}} glasses-free stereoscopic 3D display. In February 2012, Nintendo acquired Mobiclip, a France-based research and development company specialized in highly optimized software technologies such as <b>video</b> <b>compression.</b> The company's name was later changed to Nintendo European Research & Development. During {{the fourth quarter of}} 2012, Nintendo {{released the}} Wii U. It sold slower than expected, despite being the first eighth generation console. By September 2013, however, sales had rebounded. Intending to broaden the 3DS market, Nintendo released 2013's cost-reduced Nintendo 2DS. The 2DS is compatible with but lacks the 3DS's more expensive but cosmetic autostereoscopic 3D feature. Nintendo also released the Wii Mini, a cheaper and non-networked redesign of the Wii.|$|E
25|$|The GameCube {{introduced}} a proprietary miniDVD optical disc format as the storage medium for the console, capable of storing up to 1.5GB of data. The technology {{was designed by}} Matsushita Electric Industrial (now Panasonic Corporation) which utilizes a proprietary copy-protection scheme – different from the Content Scramble System (CSS) found in standard DVDs – to prevent unauthorized reproduction. The Famicom Data Recorder, Famicom Disk System, SNES-CD, and 64DD had explored various complementary storage technologies, but the GameCube was Nintendo's first console {{to move away from}} cartridge-based media altogether. The GameCube's 1.5GB mini-disc have sufficient room for most games, although a few games require an extra disc, higher <b>video</b> <b>compression,</b> or removal of content present in versions on other consoles. By comparison, the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, also sixth-generation consoles, both use 8.5GB Dual-Layer DVDs.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} criticized {{for the lack of}} {{downloadable}} content beyond the existing Death Magnetic album, and its price was also called into question, costing the same as World Tour but with fewer songs. The career mode's [...] "cartoon storyline" [...] describing the player's Metallica's-wannabe band was seen as being out of place in the game and was considered as the game's [...] "biggest weakness". Chris Roper of IGN noted that the PlayStation 2 version of the game suffers from several graphical problems, including poor <b>video</b> <b>compression,</b> the inability to read or zoom in on handwritten tour and lyric sheets, and some stuttering on the display on the note highway, and considers it the weakest release across all the game's platforms. Roper also cites <b>video</b> <b>compression</b> and problems with viewing the extras in the Wii version.|$|E
40|$|A {{strategy}} for computing upper code-length limits of AC Huffman codes for an 8 x 8 block in JPEG Baseline coding is developed. The method {{is based on}} a geometric interpretation of the DCT, and the calculated limits are as close as 14 % to the maximum code-lengths. The proposed strategy can be adapted to other transform coding methods, e. g., MPEG 2 and 4 <b>video</b> <b>compressions,</b> to calculate close upper code length limits for the respective processing blocks.

40|$|Abstract—Motion {{estimation}} is {{the most}} computationally intensive part in video processing. Many fast motion estimation algorithms have been proposed to decrease the computational complexity by {{reducing the number of}} candidate motion vectors. However, these studies are for fast search algorithms themselves while almost image and <b>video</b> <b>compressions</b> are operated with software based. Therefore, the timing constraints for running these motion estimation algorithms not only challenge for the video codec but also overwhelm for some of processors. In this paper, the performance of motion estimation is enhanced by using Intel's Streaming SIM...|$|R
500|$|Given {{the large}} number of FMV games and Genesis ports, the Sega CD's game library has been criticized for its lack of depth. Full motion video quality was {{substandard}} on the Sega CD due to poor <b>video</b> <b>compression</b> software and the system's limited color palette, and the concept never caught on with the public. According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, [...] "Sega CD could only put up 32 colors at a time, so you had this horrible grainy look to the images," [...] though the system was able to put up 64 colors at one time. Likewise, most Genesis ports for the Sega CD featured additional full motion video sequences, extra levels, and enhanced audio, but were otherwise identical to their Genesis release. The video quality in these sequences has also been criticized as comparable to an old VHS tape.|$|E
500|$|In digital {{television}} broadcasting, {{there are three}} competing standards {{that are likely to}} be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for <b>video</b> <b>compression.</b> ATSC uses Dolby Digital AC-3 for audio compression, ISDB uses Advanced Audio Coding (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2. The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the Digital Audio Broadcasting standard (also known as the Eureka 147 standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt HD Radio. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as in-band on-channel transmission that allows digital information to [...] "piggyback" [...] on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.|$|E
500|$|After {{its release}} on DVD in 2012, the season {{received}} positive critical attention, although many reviewers initially expressed their unhappiness that the set was not initially released as a Blu-ray edition. Wired wrote positively of the set, and applauded the release's bonus features. R.L. Shaffer of IGN awarded the set a 7 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] release. He called the show a [...] "rare treat", but {{was critical of}} the release's packaging, noting that [...] "a few too many episodes are crammed onto the discs, leaving little room for these transfers to breathe" [...] and that the <b>video</b> <b>compression</b> left something to be desired. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk [...] "highly recommended" [...] the set, and wrote that the series is [...] "bursting with imagination, sweetness, and a ridiculous sense of humor". Foster was particularly pleased with the characters, citing Ricardio and Marceline as highlights of the season. Furthermore, he wrote that [...] "even the worst episode in this —and I'm hard-pressed to pick one—is beautifully designed and packs at least one or two killer gags." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} an {{extension}} of the watermarking scheme, based on key sequence, proposed by Lin et al. is presented. This new scheme is designed taking into account the temporal modifications of the MPEG- 2, MPEG- 4 part 2 and MPEG 4 Part 10 compressions. Besides the redundancy control of Lin is modified and the characteristics extraction process is improved. In this way, a better performance, up to 40 % in the BCR (bit correct ratio) measure is gained. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better performance against MPEG <b>video</b> <b>compressions</b> than Lin’s scheme. 1...|$|R

500|$|YouTube {{originally}} offered videos at {{only one}} quality level, displayed at {{a resolution of}} 320×240 pixels using the Sorenson Spark codec (a variant of H.263), with mono MP3 audio. In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP format on mobile phones. In March 2008, a high-quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480×360 pixels. In November 2008, 720p HD support was added. At {{the time of the}} 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a [...] aspect ratio to a widescreen [...] With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as its default <b>video</b> <b>compression</b> format. In November 2009, 1080p HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in 4K format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096×3072 pixels. In June 2015, support for 8K resolution was added, with the videos playing at 7680×4320 pixels. In November 2016, support for HDR video was added which can be encoded with Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) or Perceptual Quantizer (PQ). HDR video can be encoded with the Rec. 2020 color space.|$|E

[...] Well-known titles include the critically acclaimed Sonic CD and , as well as the controversial Night Trap, which resulted in Congressional hearings on video game violence. [...] The Sega CD also received enhanced ports of games from the Genesis, including Batman Returns and Ecco the Dolphin. [...] Included in this library are six games which, while receiving individual Sega CD releases, also received separate versions that utilized both the Sega CD and Sega 32X add-ons. [...] In particular, Sonic CD has been noted for its excellent graphics and new time travel elements without changing the traditional Sonic formula. [...] However, given the large amount of FMV games and Genesis ports, the Sega CD's game library has been criticized for its lack of depth.
