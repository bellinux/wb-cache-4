5|$|Connectivity to the Game Boy Advance was {{discussed}} {{as an opportunity}} among the developers, but they eventually agreed that Double Dash!! was not suited to these connectivity ideas and decided to exclude it.

Therefore, gameplay features like the ability to escape the banana were removed; the staff wanted both <b>veteran</b> <b>and</b> novice players to enjoy themselves.|$|E

5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, <b>veteran</b> <b>and</b> elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the Levée en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E
5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli <b>veteran,</b> <b>and</b> wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E

Sorkin responded that Cleveland had not contributed significantly, and that writing credits were simply rotated among the staff writers. The argument ended amicably, with Sorkin apologizing for belittling Cleveland's effort and the two writers expressing their admiration for each other.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated in {{his efforts}} to {{intercept}} the convoy at anchor, Willaumez determined to meet it at sea, sailing to the Bahama Banks. There he waited for the convoy, seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron, including neutral vessels, in case they revealed his position. For several weeks Willaumez's lookouts saw nothing, the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron. During the night of 31 July, bored with waiting for the convoy, Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron, acting without orders or even notifying his admiral. When dawn broke on 1 August, Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of <b>Vétéran</b> <b>and,</b> assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated, began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander.|$|E

Due to fear of repercussion and mistrust of superiors and government healthcare agencies, <b>veterans</b> <b>and</b> soldiers often seek care in civilian healthcare agencies. The Emergency Department (ED) nurse is often the first contact with this unique population and their healthcare needs. ED nurses often lack knowledge of military cultural competence, military experiences and occupation, and the relationship of this experience to illness and disease. Collaboration with ED nurses increased the understanding of military culture, the relationship of military experiences to health status, and increased satisfaction of <b>veterans</b> <b>and</b> soldiers of a rural healthcare agency.
