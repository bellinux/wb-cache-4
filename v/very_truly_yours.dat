6000|$|DEAR MR. CHATTO, - I have {{an offer}} of 25 pounds for OTTO from America. I {{do not know if}} you mean to have the American rights; from the nature of the contract, I think not; but if you {{understood}} that you were to sell the sheets, I will either hand over the bargain to you, or finish it myself and hand you over the money if you are pleased with the amount. You see, I leave this quite in your hands. To parody an old Scotch story of servant and master: [...] if you don't know that you have a good author, I know that I have a good publisher. Your fair, open, and handsome dealings are a good point in my life, and do more for my crazy health than has yet been done by any doctor. - <b>Very</b> <b>truly</b> <b>yours,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|When I sent you, a {{few weeks}} ago, the Tale of 'Peter Bell', you asked [...] "why THE WAGGONER was not added?"--To say the truth,--from the higher tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not {{accompany}} it without disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, THE WAGGONER was read to you in manuscript; and, as you have remembered {{it for so long}} a time, I am the more encouraged to hope, that, since the localities on which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you, it may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in some measure the cause of its present appearance, you must allow me the gratification of inscribing it to you; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have derived from your Writings, and of the high esteem with which I am <b>Very</b> <b>truly</b> <b>yours,</b> WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had from}} you some days ago {{a very kind}} and {{touching}} letter, which greatly charmed me, but which now that I wish to read it over again before belatedly thanking you for it I find I have stupidly and inexplicably mislaid--at any rate I can't to-night {{put my hand on}} it. But the extremely pleasant and interesting impression of it abides with me; I rejoice that you were moved to write it and that you didn't resist the generous movement--since I always find myself (when the rare and blest revelation--once in a blue moon--takes place) the happier for the thought that I enjoy the sympathy of the gallant and intelligent young. I shall send this to Arthur Benson with the request that he will kindly transmit it to you--since I fail thus, provokingly, of having your address before me. I gather that you are about to hurl yourself into the deep sea of journalism--the more treacherous currents of which (and they strike me as numerous) I hope you may safely breast. Give me more news of this at some convenient hour, and let me believe that at some propitious one I may have the pleasure of seeing you. I never see A.C.B. in these days, to my loss and sorrow--and if this continues I shall have to depend on you considerably to give me tidings of him. However, my appeal to him (my only resource) to put you in possession of this will perhaps strike a welcome spark--so you see you are already something of a link. Believe me <b>very</b> <b>truly</b> <b>yours,</b> ...|$|E

6000|$|Dear Mr. Ruskin, do let us {{hear from}} you sometimes. It {{is such a great}} gift, a letter of yours. Then {{remember}} that I am a spirit in prison all the winter, not able to stir out.

6000|$|... "Under a misapprehension, {{you seem}} to {{attribute}} to me interested [...] motives in this matter--to call it by no harsher term. But I assure [...] you, dear sir, that if I seem to be 'infesting the widow,' it is all [...] seeming, and void of reality. It is from no seeking of mine that I [...] am in this position. She asked me, herself, to write you. I never [...] have infested her--indeed I scarcely know her. I do not infest [...] anybody. I try to go along, in my humble way, doing as near right [...] as I can, never harming anybody, and never throwing out [...] insinuations. As for 'her lord and his effects,' they are of no [...] interest to me. I trust I have effects enough of my own--shall [...] endeavor {{to get along with}} them, at any rate, and not go mousing [...] around to get hold of somebody's that are 'void.' But do you not [...] see?--this woman is a widow--she has no 'lord.' He is dead--or [...] pretended to be, when they buried him. Therefore, no amount of [...] 'dirt, bathing,' etc., etc., howsoever 'unfairly followed' will be [...] likely to 'worm him from his folly'--if being dead and a ghost is [...] 'folly.' Your closing remark is as unkind as it was uncalled for; [...] and if report says true you might have applied it to yourself, sir, [...] with more point and less impropriety. [...] <b>Very</b> <b>Truly</b> <b>Yours,</b> SIMON ERICKSON.|$|E
6000|$|I like {{to think}} that [...] "Tom Sawyer" [...] and [...] "Huckleberry Finn" [...] will be looked upon, fifty or a hundred years from now, as the picture of buoyant, dramatic, human American life. I feel, deep in my own heart, pretty sure that they will be. They won't be looked on then as the work of a [...] "humorist" [...] any more than we think of Shakespeare as a humorist now. I don't mean by this to set up a {{comparison}} between Mark Twain and Shakespeare: I don't feel competent to do it; and I'm not at all sure that it could be done until Mark Twain's work shall have its fair share of historical perspective. But Shakespeare was a humorist and so, thank Heaven! is Mark Twain. And Shakespeare plunged deep into the deep, sad things of life; and so, in a different way (but in a way that has more than once brought tears to my eyes) has Mark Twain. But after all, it isn't because of any resemblance for anything that was ever before written that Mark Twain's books strike in so deep: it's rather because they've brought something really new into our literature--new, yet old as Adam and Eve and the Apple. And this achievement, the achievement of putting something into literature that was not there before, is, I should think, the most that any writer can ever hope to do. It is the one mark of distinction between the [...] "lonesome" [...] little group of big men and the vast herd of medium and small ones. Anyhow, this much I am sure of--to the young man who hopes, however feebly, to accomplish a little something, someday, as a writer, the one inspiring example of our time is Mark Twain.

5000|$|She {{made her}} Broadway debut in 1895 {{and went on}} to appear in more than seventy Broadway productions. With the money from her first Broadway success, she bought the townhouse known as River Mansion at 337 Riverside Drive. Her first husband was Broadway actor Robert Taber. Their {{marriage}} lasted from 1894 to 1900 and produced no children. Taber and Marlowe were married in 1894. According to many who knew her, Marlowe sacrificed her own self-interests many times in order to promote Taber's career. Despite this, however, professional jealousy ended their marriage in 1900. In a letter dated April 2nd, 1895 from Taber he writes [...] "I herewith return your play. Mrs. Taber is grateful for your kindness in submitting it and notwithstanding its interest - She finds it unsuited for her present use. <b>Very</b> <b>truly</b> <b>yours,</b> Robert Taber". Taber was touring in England {{at the time of their}} divorce. [...] In 1904, Marlowe starred as Mary Tudor in Paul Kester's adaptation of When Knighthood Was in Flower. This was an enormous success, and made Marlowe financially independent. Other hits for Marlowe followed including Charlotte Oliver in the adaptation by Kester and Middleton of George Washington Cable's The Cavalier, and Ingomar, both in 1903. Of her performance in the latter, The New York Sun wrote, [...] "There is not a woman player in America or in England that is - attractively considered - fit to unlace her shoe".|$|E
