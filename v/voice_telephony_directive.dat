This article examines how the practical measures put in place by the ONP process have addressed user interests. Second, it asks how users have influenced the direction of the ONP process, particularly with regard to the proposed <b>Voice</b> <b>Telephony</b> <b>Directive</b> and, finally, it asks how ONP will {{meet the needs of the}} user in the future. It argues that the ONP bargain should be shifted from the Community level to the marketplace itself, allowing experience to necessitate regulation, rather than regulation to dictate experience. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>telephony</b> is the {{predominant}} service on today’s cellular mobile networks, {{in terms of}} number of customers, revenues and network usage. However, {{it is difficult to}} predict how long this will be the case given the rising demand for new Internet multimedia services. It is therefore essential that 3 rd generation (3 G) mobile networks support a <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> service, but also that these networks are also capable of providing Internet multimedia services using the same technology. This paper provides an overview of how <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> is provided in the initial phase of the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). It then describes how this is expected to evolve in later phases — so that <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> becomes one {{of a large number of}} multimedia services provided from a common Internet protocol-based mobile network. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} use Broadband Internet {{services}} simultaneously with <b>voice</b> <b>telephony,</b> {{it is necessary}} to use a DSL filter. This is a low pass filter in line with the phone outlet. This prevents high frequency data noise from affecting the lower frequency voice bandwidth and it also prevents the low impedance of the connected phone from attenuating or modulating the high speed DSL data Path. Enough bandwidth is retained for <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> and the majority is used for high speed data.|$|R

This paper argues that its dominance in the <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> market funded its initial expansion into these new markets, and that broadband and sports content are mutually supportive lines of business.

40|$|The UK's Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) {{carried out}} a {{detailed}} review in late 1986 of British Telecom's (BT) tariff charges and its profits.

40|$|The last 30 {{years have}} seen huge {{technological}} and commercial developments {{in the field of}} telecommunications. The main product of the telecommunications industry has until recently been <b>voice</b> <b>telephony.</b> With the growth of data and multimedia services in the last decade the role of <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> is changing. In recent years telecommunications manufacturers have begun producing and marketing a new network concept for voice services entitled Next Generation Networks (NGN). These networks are based on packet switching technology as opposed to the circuit switching technology traditionally used in <b>voice</b> <b>telephony.</b> And telecom carriers like BT are replacing their Circuit switch based PSTN equipments by packet switching based Next Generation Networks products. Therefore in this study analysis and observation have been done of that process of migration from PSTN to IP/MPLS. Only BT has fully in progress for this migration through their 21 Century Network Project up till now and layout their plan for broadband dial tone to every customer till 2009.
