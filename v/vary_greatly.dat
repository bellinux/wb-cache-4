5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with {{feathering}} on the ears and legs. Colors can <b>vary</b> <b>greatly,</b> and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.|$|E

5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not {{believed to be a}} threat to the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E
5|$|Drosera, {{commonly}} known as the sundews, {{is one of the largest}} genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> in size and form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the water}} {{remaining}} in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts {{for a few seconds}} every few minutes, while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10minutes every 8–12hours.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> in size. They {{include the}} {{smallest}} primates {{in the world}} and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently {{range in size from}} about 30g (1.1oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9kg (15–20lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema). When recently extinct species are considered, the size range extended up to that of a gorilla at 160–200kg (350–440lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.|$|E
5|$|Seabirds (also {{known as}} marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment. While seabirds <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> in lifestyle, {{behaviour}} and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, {{as the same}} environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene.|$|E
5|$|Seeds are {{the primary}} way that trees {{reproduce}} and their seeds <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, Sequoiadendron giganteum, produces {{one of the smallest}} tree seeds. The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E

5|$|Some observers, such as {{petroleum}} industry experts Kenneth S. Deffeyes and Matthew Simmons, predict negative global economy implications following a post-peak production decline and subsequent oil price increase {{because of the}} high dependence of most modern industrial transport, agricultural, and industrial systems on the low cost and high availability of oil. Predictions <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> as to what exactly these negative effects would be.|$|E
5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns <b>vary</b> <b>greatly,</b> but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of the galero in arms can <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> depending on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E

5|$|The {{potential}} {{changes from}} extraterrestrial contact could <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> in magnitude and type, {{based on the}} extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of the species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, but the species now {{classified}} as Diplacus are. Some species grow in dry areas, others in wet habitats, such {{as members of the}} section Simiolus, which are hydrophilic. Both overall plant size and corolla size <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> throughout the genus. A minimum of 25 of the species are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E
50|$|A squadron, or naval squadron, is a {{significant}} group of warships which is nonetheless considered {{too small to be}} designated a fleet. A squadron is typically a part of a fleet. Between different navies there are no clear defining parameters to distinguish a squadron from a fleet (or from a flotilla), and the size and strength of a naval squadron <b>varies</b> <b>greatly</b> according to the country and time period. Groups of small warships, or small groups of major warships, might instead be designated flotillas by some navies according to their terminology. Since the size of a naval squadron <b>varies</b> <b>greatly,</b> the rank associated with command of a squadron also <b>varies</b> <b>greatly.</b>|$|R

5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves <b>vary</b> <b>greatly</b> {{in overall}} shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
5|$|Building {{materials}} <b>vary</b> <b>greatly.</b> Brick {{was rarely}} {{used at the}} time Round Hill was developing (although a few houses in Belton Road were built of it); bungaroosh was often used for walls instead. Characteristic of Brighton but almost unknown elsewhere, this consisted of random assortments of materials such as low-quality brick, cobbles, flints, pebbles, rubble, wood and sand, set in hydraulic lime and shuttered. Bungaroosh was often faced with render or stucco to make it weatherproof. Some flint buildings survive on Prince's Crescent. When built, most windows in the conservation area's houses were sashes, and roofs were of Welsh slate.|$|E
