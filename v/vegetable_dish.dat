25|$|Indians {{consider}} a healthy breakfast important. They generally prefer to drink tea or coffee with breakfast, though food preferences vary regionally. North Indian people prefer roti, parathas, and a <b>vegetable</b> <b>dish,</b> accompanied by achar (pickles) and some curd. Pickles {{have been available}} to the consumers publicly since many centuries. One of the oldest pickle companies in India is Harnarains, which had started off in the 1860s in Old Delhi. People of western India prefer dhokla and milk and South Indians prefer idlis and dosas, generally accompanied by various chutneys.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} of India, fasts of {{religious}} nature are {{an occasion for}} a change in normal diet, and a total absence from cooking or eating is held as elective while a normal diet for a fasting day is a light feast consisting of different foods from usual, amongst which sweet potato is one of the prime sources of sustenance. Sweet potato– shakarkand, शक्करकंद– is eaten otherwise, too, and a popular variety of preparation in most parts is roasted slow over kitchen coals at night and eaten with some dressing—primarily salt, possibly yogurt—while the easier way in the south is simply boiling or pressure cooking before peeling, cubing and seasoning for a <b>vegetable</b> <b>dish</b> as part of the meal. In Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is known as 'Sakkara valli Kilangu'. It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into flour; this is then mixed with wheat flour and baked into chapattis (bread). Between 15 and 20 percent of sweet potato harvest is converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber harvest is used in India as cattle fodder.|$|E

6000|$|Venetians eat but {{one meal}} a day, which is dinner. They breakfast {{on a piece}} of bread with coffee and milk; supper is a little cup of black coffee, or an ice, taken at a caffè. The coffee, however, is {{repeated}} frequently throughout the day, and in the summertime fruit is eaten, but eaten sparingly, like everything else. As {{to the nature of the}} dinner, it of course varies somewhat according to the nature of the diner; but in most families of the middle class a dinner at home consists of a piece of boiled beef, a minestra (a soup thickened with vegetables, tripe, and rice), a <b>vegetable</b> <b>dish</b> of some kind, and the wine of the country. The failings of the repast among all classes lean to the side of simplicity, and the abstemious character of the Venetian finds sufficient comment in his familiar invitation to dinner: [...] "Venga a mangiar quattro risi con me." [...] (Come eat four grains of rice with me.) ...|$|E
