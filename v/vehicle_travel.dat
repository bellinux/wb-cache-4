25|$|Final Fantasy XV {{is an open}} world action {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. Being the fifteenth main installment in the Final Fantasy series, the game was released for the PS4 and Xbox One in November 2016, and will be released for Windows in early 2018. The game features an open-world environment and action-based battle system, incorporating quick-switching weapons, elemental magic, and other elements — such as <b>vehicle</b> <b>travel</b> and camping.|$|E
25|$|Relatively low {{and stable}} oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to {{significant}} increases in <b>vehicle</b> <b>travel</b> from 1980–2000, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as urban sprawl. Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for just in time deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.|$|E

25|$|The {{announcement}} of the Gateway Program in 2005 by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation meant a large expenditure in transportation infrastructure. Despite the oppositions by the Metro Vancouver and several mayoral councils, the project went ahead to create the South Fraser Perimeter Road and the Port Mann Bridge, both which pass through major portions of Surrey. It has been criticized to be contradictory to not only Metro Vancouver's Sustainable Region Initiative, but also Surrey's Sustainability Charter. Studies have shown that {{with an increase in}} road capacity, generated traffic increases, that is traffic that is diverted (shifted in time and route) and induced travel (increased total motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>travel).</b> With the construction of the 10 lane Port Mann Bridge, the problem of suburban sprawl is exacerbated not only with the additional capacity, but RapidBus service was also cancelled despite expectations of a stop in Surrey.|$|E
25|$|The {{metropolitan}} area of Adelaide, South Australia {{is served by}} {{a wide variety of}} transport. Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, it forms a hub for east-west and north-south routes. The road network includes major expressways such as the Southern Expressway, the South Eastern Freeway, the Port River Expressway, the Northern Expressway and the South Road Superway. The city also has a public transport system managed by Adelaide Metro, consisting of a contracted bus system including the O-Bahn Busway (a guided busway), six metropolitan railway lines, and the Glenelg-Adelaide-Hindmarsh Tram. According to a study conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Adelaide has the highest passenger <b>vehicle</b> <b>travel</b> to work (84%) and the second lowest proportion of people walking to work (2.9%)something that is being combated by the South Australian government in an effort to increase citizen ridership and use of public transport.|$|E
25|$|The New York Central, {{like many}} U.S. railroads, {{declined}} after the Second World War. Problems resurfaced that had plagued the railroad industry before the war, such as over-regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which severely regulated the rates {{charged by the}} railroad, along with continuing competition from automobiles. These problems were coupled with even more formidable forms of competition, such as airline service in the 1950s that began to deprive the NYC of its long-distance passenger trade. The Interstate Highway Act of 1956 helped create a network of efficient roads for motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>travel</b> through the country, enticing more people to travel by car, as well as haul freight by truck. The 1959 opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway adversely affected NYC freight business. Container shipments could now be directly shipped to ports along the Great Lakes, eliminating the railroads' freight hauls between {{the east and the}} Midwest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Detecting {{groups of}} <b>vehicles</b> <b>travelling</b> {{together}} as a convoy is an important problem in military and law enforcement applications. License plate recognition sensors provide discrete, irregularly sampled, time series information about where <b>vehicles</b> are <b>travelling.</b> With this irregular time series, {{we would like to}} determine when <b>vehicles</b> <b>travel</b> as a convoy. We construct a semi-Markov process to model network traffic and utilize the Markov property to develop a sequential hypothe-sis test. This requires defining two models for how <b>vehicles</b> <b>travel</b> through the network and testing the likelihood between them. The main contribution of this work is the modeling of the alternate hypothesis of when two vehicles are traveling as a convoy. We present performance results based on simulated data showing the tradeoff between false-positives and true detections. Keywords—Convoy Detection, License Plate Recognition, LPR I...|$|R
