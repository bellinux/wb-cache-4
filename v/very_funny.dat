5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been reprinted many times, in at least 16 English {{versions}} and in Spanish, Chinese and German editions. While some critics consider Newby's Love and War in the Apennines a better book, A Short Walk was the book that made him well-known, and critics {{agree that it is}} both understated and <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> in an old-school British way.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} American actor Dennis Weaver, {{famous for}} his role in the television show Gunsmoke, in a guest role as the Western actor Buck McCoy. Al Jean, the show runner for the episode, stated in the DVD commentary that Weaver was <b>very</b> <b>funny,</b> a ”terrific guy”, and that it was an honor to meet him. Karl Wiedergott, an actor who usually fills in for unavailable male cast members during table reads for The Simpsons episodes, portrayed an alcoholic resembling Walter Brennan. The dog was played by voice artist Frank Welker.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, {{who thought it}} would be funny if the plant went on strike. The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who is tempting Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being <b>very</b> <b>funny.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>very</b> <b>funny,</b> but I couldn't {{do it at}} the time. Making 'Fawlty Towers' work at 90 minutes was a very {{difficult}} proposition. You can build up the comedy for 30 minutes, but at that length {{there has to be a}} trough and another peak. It doesn't interest me. I don't want to do it.|$|E

25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't <b>very</b> <b>funny,</b> and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E

25|$|Kilmer {{was married}} to actress Joanne Whalley from March 1988 to February 1996. The two met while working {{together}} on the film Willow. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mercedes (b. October 29, 1991), and a son, Jack (b. June 6, 1995). Warwick Davis, Kilmer's co-star from the 1988 fantasy Willow, in his audio commentary for the film said that the question he is most asked is {{what it was like}} working with Kilmer. Though Kilmer has a reputation of being difficult, Davis describes him as a <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> man and a hard working, dedicated actor. Kilmer reunited with Davis in the 2013 Easter special of the sitcom Life's Too Short, in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself as a mooching, arrogant eccentric.|$|E
25|$|Noll {{has become}} a popular {{internet}} meme, particularly in Australia. The popular phrase 'Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title' gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase. Noll acknowledged the internet fame, finding it 'very funny' and stating 'Some of the stuff they’ve done is bloody brilliant and very clever and <b>very</b> <b>funny.</b> I reckon half of the kids putting together these memes {{need to be on}} my marketing team!' In January 2016 a Facebook page was created titled 'Get Shannon Noll to Groovin' the Moo 2016'. Despite the pages thousands of likes the organisers of Groovin' the Moo didn't reach out to the artist to perform. In June 2016, the 'GATchphrase' for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australia Idol title. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event. Noll is recognisable by his southern cross tattoo, an image of which was highly circulated in internet meme culture. This displays his patriotic pride and love for Australia.|$|E
25|$|Rodriguez and Del Rio were {{traded to}} the SmackDown brand on the April 20 episode of SmackDown. On the May 21 episode of Raw, Santino Marella criticised Rodriguez's announcing and then {{attacked}} Rodriguez. Rodriguez unsuccessfully challenged Marella to a match on the May 25 SmackDown. On the June 8 SmackDown, to tie in with Del Rio's feud with World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, Rodriguez dressed up as Sheamus and mocked Sheamus' mannerisms. Rodriguez's portrayal of Sheamus was praised as <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> from critics and fans alike. On the June 11 episode of Raw, Rodriguez resumed his feud with Marella, teaming with Beth Phoenix to beat Marella and Layla. After the match, Marella embarrassed Rodriguez by ripping off Rodriguez's shirt to reveal {{he was wearing a}} Justin Bieber T-shirt underneath. Their feud ended at No Way Out, when Rodriguez lost to Marella in a non-title tuxedo match, Rodriguez's first pay-per-view singles match. In September 2012, during Del Rio's feud with Sheamus, Rodriguez suffered a Brogue Kick from Sheamus and thus enlisted David Otunga's help as his lawyer to try and ban the Brogue Kick. Rodriguez was later pinned in a six-man tag match later that month with Del Rio and Otunga against Sheamus, Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara.|$|E

500|$|Sam Morgan of Hollywood.com complimented {{the writers}} for {{attempting}} to write a [...] "classic MF episode" [...] but concluded, [...] "It had some <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> bits, but that heart it searched far and wide for just wasn’t there".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. When Dietter read through his first script, she did not find it <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> {{because of all the}} visual gags. Once the animatic was finished, her opinion changed, and she thought to herself: [...] "Hey, this is really funny!".|$|E
500|$|... "Road Trip" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{said the}} episode {{was a good}} payoff to the romance between Leslie and Ben all season, a story arc he initially had problems with. Sepinwall also called the Ron Swanson subplot [...] "simply fantastic in both concept and execution". Scott Meslow of The Atlantic called [...] "Road Trip" [...] a <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> episode and strong pay-off to the romance between Leslie and Ben that had been building all season. Joel Keller of TV Squad said the Know Ya Boo story felt simply like an excuse to include Andy and April in the show, but that Ron's subplot with the little girl was [...] "classic Ron Swanson". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said the plot felt [...] "admittedly, a little more sitcom-y than I like" [...] but was <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> and progressed the Leslie and Ben story arc without letting the show [...] "jump the shark".|$|E

[...] In his review for the Inside Pulse, Joe Corey said that the episode is [...] "equally dangerous" [...] with the remaining episodes of the Extreme Kah-Rah-Tay DVD.|$|E
500|$|Wilson, {{after seeing}} an early {{screening}} of Dustbin Baby, {{said that it}} was the best film adaptation of any of her works. Haig said that the film was his favourite of his summer projects, saying [...] "it was a terrific story and very touchingly done.

During its initial run on BBC One, Dustbin Baby was watched by 2.3 million viewers, giving it a 15.4% share of the audience.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Hamm's role as Drew, {{reporting}} that his character [...] "initially seemed {{too good to}} be true but the show gradually revealed him to be imperfect and even fucked up enough to be plausible. [...] The Hamm subplot was <b>very</b> <b>funny</b> and well-executed". Sepinwall also praised Hamm, writing, [...] "Finally! It took three episodes... but Tina Fey (who wrote this one) let Jon Hamm be funny on his way out the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} around Brooklyn Heights, as the Coens {{wanted to stay}} in New York City to be with their families.

Filming began on August 27, 2007 and was completed on October 30, 2007. John Malkovich, appearing in his first Coen brothers film, said of the shooting, [...] "The Coens are <b>very</b> delightful: smart, <b>funny,</b> <b>very</b> specific about what they want but not overly controlling, as some people can be." [...] The film opened the Venice Film Festival in August 2008.|$|R
