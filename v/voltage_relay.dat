The average accuracy of the proposed method is 89.76 %. In [105], SOM is applied for ID. The papers propose application of SOM for classification of different islanding from non-islanding scenarios by analyzing the input signal of automatic load frequency controller (ALFC) of a distributed resource through it. The output of SOM sends a control signal to the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) for an under <b>voltage</b> <b>relay</b> tripping. The misclassification rate of [105] is 2.08 % while in [106] it is 1.81 %. [107] proposes ENN with active and passive multi variable detection techniques for ID.

40|$|Abstract: In a {{widespread}} blackout, system restoration must begin from pre-selected generating units {{with the ability}} to start themselves. Units, which participate in this ancillary service, must have the ability to provide at least three sequential black starts, within two hours, to allow for possible tripping of the transmission or distribution system during the re-instatement.

This paper suggests a new start-up method to reduce such unwanted tripping. Almost all generators are equipped with under <b>voltage</b> <b>relays,</b> which operate when the voltage reaches under 95 percent of nominal value.
