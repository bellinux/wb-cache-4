In vertebrates, the saccule and utricle together make the otolith organs. Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive {{to a change in}} horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> (such as when in an elevator).|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 26, 2014). The Equine Lameness Locator ® (ELL) is a newly developed system {{that provides a}} robust and objective method to detect and evaluate equine lameness. To achieve objective lameness evaluation, the system analyzes a horse’s head and pelvis vertical movement signals during trotting. Two uniaxial accelerometers are placed on the horse’s torso, one each on the horse’s head and pelvis to record <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> <b>Vertical</b> position signals are obtained by numerical double integration of the acceleration signals. However, these integrated position signals contain very large moving averages and require advance methods of signal processing for correction. In this thesis, {{a combination of the}} Hilbert Huang transform and a conjugate-pair decomposition method is proposed and tested against the current ELL’s signal processing method, a sliding-window curve-fitting method. Numerical simulations and experimental results show that the proposed new method involves more intense computation but does not provide better results for lameness evaluation of horses. Hence, the original sliding-window curve-fitting method is recommended for future use. Clinical and experimental observations reveal that a horse’s head and pelvis also rotate during trotting. These rotations may cause inaccurate measurements of the true <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Hence, this work also numerically and experimentally examines the influences of rotations on the measured <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Numerical techniques, unique experimental devices and setups, and an algorithm for correcting accelerometer outputs to obtain true <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations</b> have been developed and experimentally validated...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand to}} sail at high forward speeds in both calm water {{and in a}} seaway remains high. For various patrol, search and rescue or {{military}} operations attaining high forward speeds is essential. In head and bow quartering seas, the main factor for voluntary speed reduction is the occurrence of large <b>vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations.</b> The occurrence of large <b>vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations</b> imposes limits to the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas. A challenge for designers of fast monohulls is to explore different possibilities to increase the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas. To achieve this a reduction of the <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations</b> is required. The operability can be considered improved if the level of accelerations can be reduced compared to a trip at an equal but constant forward speed. This implies {{that it is possible}} to sail at a higher speed without increasing the discomfort on board. A solution for increasing the operability of planing monohulls sailing in head seas has been found in proactive control. <b>Vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations</b> have a very short duration. Unacceptably large <b>vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations</b> have a low frequency of occurrence. These two aspects are the incentive for a proactive control system. What makes proactive control unique is the fact that the control is based on predicted <b>vertical</b> peak <b>accelerations.</b> The response of the ship for the next few seconds needs to be simulated real-time while sailing. These predictions should be carried much faster than real-time, since there is little to effectuate control because of the high relative velocity between ship and incoming waves. In this dissertation proactive control of the forward speed, also termed automated proactive thrust control, has been presented. The purpose of this study is to show the level of reduction of the <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations</b> possible with automated proactive thrust control.

2500|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} (FDR) was an antiquated analog model which used metal foil strips scratched by moving pins. Here, it did not record <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> readings and misrecorded heading indications. One needle recorded some lines twice, initially confusing the investigators, leading the team to send the FDR to the American company which manufactured it. The manufacturer asked an ex-employee, the highest expert regarding the company's {{flight data recorder}}s, to temporarily leave retirement to examine the recorder. The expert concluded that the needle {{supposed to have been}} recording the altitude had been shaking so much that it left other stray marks on the foil. This particular FDR was able to record for hundreds of hours; further investigations found that the needle had been shaking abnormally for months. This told investigators that another component, not just the APU with the broken mount, had also been vibrating. The investigators charted the vibrations and found that two months before the crash, the vibrations stopped for two weeks, since during that period the aircraft received a major overhaul in Canada by the airline's previous owner. Afterward, the vibrations increased up to the accident flight. During the Canadian company's test flights of the aircraft and its first several passenger flights for Partnair, the FDR recorded almost no abnormal vibrations. A review of the maintenance records of the aircraft revealed that during the overhaul, the mechanic discovered wear on one of the four bolts and sleeves that held the vertical fin and fuselage together and replaced them. The vibrations stopped after the parts were replaced, but gradually worsened afterwards.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of shaking table tests {{performed}} to assess the response of an object placed on a vibration isolator to intense ground motions whose peak accelerations are close to or over the gravity <b>acceleration</b> in both <b>vertical</b> and horizontal directions. The passive vertical and horizontal vibration isolator, developed by the authors, has rolling load-bearing elements and constant-force springs to provide piecewise-constant restoring forces. First, we performed shaking table tests, wherein only the horizontal vibration was isolated. An unexpected finding from the tests is that, when the vibration isolator was subjected to ground motions with intense <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations,</b> not only <b>vertical</b> but also horizontal accelerations were amplified. This led to a large rocking response or overturning of the object placed on the vibration isolator. A likely reason for the amplification is rocking of the upper portion of the vibration isolator above the rolling load-bearing elements induced by intense <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> Next, we performed shaking table tests, wherein both vertical and horizontal vibrations were isolated. In this case, the vertical as well as horizontal accelerations were significantly reduced and the rocking response of the vibration-isolated object was suppressed. These results suggest potential risks in conventional horizontal vibration isolators having rolling load-bearing elements when they are subjected to ground motions with intense <b>vertical</b> <b>accelerations.</b> The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of vertical vibration isolation to avoid such risks...|$|R
