50|$|Uroš Drenović {{was born}} in Sitnica, Ribnik near Mount Manjača in 1911. He {{finished}} teachers' college in Sarajevo, and became a schoolmaster in the Banja Luka area. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, he was a reserve officer in the Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> Kraljevine <b>Jugoslavije,</b> VKJ).|$|R
5000|$|Xhinovci {{joined the}} Kosovo Liberation Army (Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës; or KLA) in 1998, and {{fought against the}} Serb-dominated <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> <b>Jugoslavije)</b> {{with the goal of}} {{separating}} Kosovo from Yugoslavia. Xhinovci earned the reputation of a [...] "fierce fighter" [...] and commanded the respect of local Albanians. His comrades gave him the nickname [...] "Hitler" [...] due to his uncanny resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Xhinovci told journalist Una Hajdari: [...] "People have called me Hitler since my army days. They say I look a lot like him—unlike the English guy who plays him in that movie," [...] apparently a reference to Charlie Chaplin's role in The Great Dictator.|$|R
5000|$|Between January 1942 and November 1942, the movement's full {{official}} name was briefly National Liberation Partisan and Volunteer Army of Yugoslavia (Narodnooslobodilačka partizanska i dobrovoljačka <b>vojska</b> <b>Jugoslavije,</b> NOP i DVJ). The changes {{were meant to}} reflect the movement's character as a [...] "volunteer army".|$|R
50|$|The Security Administration (Uprava bezbednosti) was the counterintelligence {{branch of}} the Military of Serbia and Montenegro. When the Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (<b>Vojska</b> <b>Jugoslavije)</b> was formed on May 20, 1992, the Security Administration, former KOS, was moved from the Federal Secretariat of People's Defence (Savezni sekretarijat za narodnu odbranu) to the General Staff (Generalštab).In 2002, it was split into the Vojnobezbednosna agencija and the Vojnoobaveštajna agencija.|$|R
50|$|Đujić did {{not support}} the coup, and was in Strmica with his family when the Axis {{invasion}} began. He realized that Yugoslavia's collapse was inevitable after seeing a column of demoralised troops from the barely-mobilised 12th Infantry Division Jadranska pass his home. Once {{it became clear that the}} Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> Kraljevine <b>Jugoslavije,</b> VKJ) could not hold the Axis advance, Đujić started blaming Croat fifth column activity for the VKJ's military defeats. On 10 April 1941, the Ustaše-led Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH) was proclaimed in Zagreb and divided into German and Italian zones of occupation. Between April and August, NDH authorities implemented a policy of widespread incarcerations, massacres, forced emigration, and murder of Serbs.|$|R
50|$|The Yugoslav forces {{consisted}} {{of more than}} 33 divisions of the Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> Kraljevska <b>Jugoslavije,</b> VKJ), four air brigades of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije, VVKJ) with more than 400 aircraft, and the small Royal Yugoslav Navy (Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica, KJRM) centred around four destroyers and four submarines based on the Adriatic coast and some river monitors on the Danube. The VKJ was heavily reliant on animal-powered transport, was only partly mobilised {{at the time of}} the invasion, and had only 50 tanks that could engage German tanks on an equal basis. The VVKJ was equipped with a range of aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French and British design, including less than 120 modern fighter aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> Kraljevine <b>Jugoslavije,</b> VKJ) {{was formed}} after World War I as the Army of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kingdom of SCS), when that country was created on 1 December 1918. To defend the new kingdom, an army was formed around {{the nucleus of}} the victorious Royal Serbian Army {{combined}} with armed formations raised in the former parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire that joined with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the new state. Many former Austro-Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army. From its beginning, the army, like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom, was dominated by ethnic Serbs, who saw the army as a means by which to secure Serb hegemony in the new state.|$|R
50|$|In July 1944, German {{defenses}} {{began to}} fail. After {{the failure of}} Operation Draufgänger (Daredevil) - a 1944 anti-partisan operation in Montenegro, Yugoslavia, and Northern Albania - three divisions of the Narodnooslobodilačka <b>vojska</b> <b>Jugoslavije</b> (the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia) (NOVJ) - managed to cross the Ibar River {{to the east and}} threaten the main railroad lines. After the failure of Operation Rübezahl in Montenegro in August 1944, two additional NOVJ divisions broke through the German blockade, successfully entrenching themselves in western Serbia. Army Group F command responded by deploying additional forces: the 1st Mountain Division arrived in Serbia in early August, followed by the 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division from the Thessaloniki area.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, Đurišić {{entered the}} 55th {{class of the}} Military Academy; he was {{commissioned}} as an infantry potporučnik (second lieutenant) in the Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> Kraljevine <b>Jugoslavije,</b> VKJ) in 1930. He began his service in Sarajevo with the 10th Infantry Regiment Takovska and attended infantry officers' school. Đurišić remained in Sarajevo until 1934 when, upon his own request, he was transferred to Berane where he served first as a platoon commander and later as a commander of the 1st Company of the 48th Infantry Regiment. On 7 April 1939, after the Italian invasion of Albania, Đurišić's company was sent to Plav near the Albanian border to gather intelligence. He established contact with individuals in Albania and obtained intelligence, but the information he obtained was not very useful {{for the defense of}} Yugoslavia and he returned to Berane with his company. Contacts Đurišić made during this period would become important a few years later.|$|R

50|$|A {{general state}} of war lasted for 10 days and ended on 6 July 1991. The <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> {{suffered}} approximately 150 casualties. Many <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> soldiers and officers were wounded or captured. After the Brioni Agreement was signed, the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> agreed to withdraw from Slovenia by 10 October 1991, leaving numerous tanks, rifles, trucks and other equipment.|$|R
50|$|His {{military}} career almost {{came to an}} abrupt end in 1939, when he submitted a report strongly criticizing the organization of the Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> Kraljevine <b>Jugoslavije,</b> VKJ). Among his most important proposals were abandoning the defence of the northern frontier to concentrate forces in the mountainous interior; re-organizing the armed forces into Serb, Croat, and Slovene units in order to better counter subversive activities; and using mobile Chetnik units along the borders. Milan Nedić, the Minister of the Army, was incensed by Mihailović's report and ordered that he be confined to barracks for 30 days. Afterwards, Mihailović became a professor at Belgrade's staff college. In the summer of 1940, he attended a function put on by the British military attaché for the Association of Yugoslav Reserve NCOs. The meeting was seen as highly anti-Nazi in tone, and the German ambassador protested Mihailović's presence. Nedić once more ordered him confined to barracks for 30 days as well as demoted and placed on the retired list. These last punishments were avoided only by Nedić's retirement in November and his replacement by Petar Pešić.|$|R
50|$|On 23 April 1998, the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (VJ) ambushed the KLA {{near the}} Albanian-Yugoslav border. The KLA {{had tried to}} smuggle arms and {{supplies}} into Kosovo. The <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army,</b> although greatly outnumbered, had no casualties, while 19 militants were killed.|$|R
50|$|He {{served as}} an active {{commissioned}} officer in Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> artillery units until 1941. At {{the start of the}} April War, Mesić was artillery Lieutenant Colonel in command of the Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> artillery regiment serving in Niš, near the Bulgarian border.|$|R
50|$|On 27 June 1991, the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> {{attacked}} the Slovenian TO units on borders {{and also in}} all other areas which were under Slovenian control. The Slovenian TO blockaded all the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> bases in Slovenia and kept them under siege for 10 days.|$|R
50|$|In {{accordance}} with the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army's</b> war plan, R-41, a strategy was formulated that, {{in the face of}} a massive Axis attack, a retreat on all fronts except in the south be performed. Here the 3rd <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army,</b> in cooperation with the Greek Army, was to launch an offensive against the Italian forces in Albania. This was in order to secure space to enable the withdrawal of the main <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> to the south. This would be via Albanian territory in order to reach Greece and the Allied forces to be based there. The strategy was based on the premise that the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> would, together with the Greek and British Armies, form a new version of the Salonika Front of World War I.|$|R
50|$|Albanian Army and KLA {{artillery}} {{continued to}} shell the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army's</b> positions from Maja Glava and Rasa Košares. The <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> Headquarters decided {{to launch a}} sudden attack and surprise the enemy. On April 14, Yugoslav troops attacked Maja Glava. The distance between the two enemy trenches wasn't longer than 50 meters. The <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> was unable to take Maja Glava completely, but it prevented the Albanians' artillery from engaging them from their positions. The Maja Glava front was stabilized {{until the end of}} the war, without any changes on the lines.|$|R
50|$|The army's {{development}} was {{hampered by the}} kingdom's poor economy, and this continued during the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed {{the name of the}} country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army was renamed the Royal <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> (<b>Vojska</b> Kraljevine <b>Jugoslavije,</b> VKJ). The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became difficult to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. Infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26,000-27,000 men, as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in their invasions of Poland and France.|$|R

50|$|May {{began with}} several {{unsuccessful}} attacks by the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> {{to take back}} the Košare outpost. The attacks were made unsuccessful because of the constant artillery fire aimed at their positions. On the 6th of May, the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> counterattacked at Rasa Košares, in an effort to halt the artillery bombardment. A bloody skirmish ensued, but the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> did not manage to take Rasa Košares. On 10 May, the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> sent two T-55 tanks to help stabilize the offensive on Rasa Košares. When the tanks penetrated the KLA's lines, they managed to gain over 100 meters of insurgent-held territory, but the KLA still managed to retain control of Rasa Košares. During the night between the 10th and the 11th of May, NATO bombers dropped dozens of bombs on the Yugoslav troops who had attacked KLA positions under Rasa Košares. At least in two of these instances NATO dropped cluster bombs on <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>army</b> troops. In these attacks, NATO killed 8 Yugoslav soldiers and one officer and managed to wound over 40. The KLA seized the opportunity to attack and fought the Yugoslav soldiers out of their positions and forced them back.During the middle of May, many bloody skirmishes were fought at Mrcaj, which was eventually taken by the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army.</b> After the <b>Yugoslavs</b> had inflicted some casualties on the insurgents, the KLA had to retreat from their positions giving the Yugoslavs the chance to take the now undefended position. This development allowed the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>Army</b> to stabilize their position on the battlefield and to hold the attackers outside of their line of defense. On 22 May, NATO aircraft mistakenly bombed KLA positions, killing 67.|$|R
25|$|Concurrent ground {{operations}} – The KLA undertook operations in Kosovo itself {{and had some}} successes against Serb forces. The <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>army</b> abandoned a border post opposite Morinë near the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>army</b> outpost at Kosare in the north west of the province. The <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>army</b> outpost at Kosare remained in Yugoslav hands throughout the war: this allowed for a supply line {{to be set up}} into the province and the subsequent taking of territory in the Junik area. The KLA also penetrated a few miles into the south-western Mount Pastrik area. But most of the province remained under Serb control.|$|R
