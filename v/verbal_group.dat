40|$|Abstract: There is {{a dearth}} of studies on mood and {{modality}} as a focus. This study examines their manifestation in texts. The data comprises 3, 069 <b>verbal</b> <b>groups</b> obtained by orthographically transcribing Christian Religious Knowledge, Geography, Physics, and Chemistry lessons recorded in schools in Lagos, Nigeria and identifying all the <b>verbal</b> <b>groups</b> therein. The topics taught were respectively The mission of the Church, The Drainage System, Electric Field, and Nitrogen. The scale-and-category version of the systemic grammatical model, complemented by simple percentage, aided the analysis. Results show that mood recurred far more than modality; mood represents 72 per cent of the data and 81 per cent of the finite <b>verbal</b> <b>groups</b> as against modality’s 13 and 14. However, modality was higher than interrogative mood and imperative mood, which respectively represent 11 and 8. 3 per cent of finite. Imperative mood recurred more in Physics, and was more frequently occurring in segments of the lesson involving strict computation. Root modality and Epistemic modality manifested {{at a ratio of}} 3 : 2 in favour of Root meaning, but Epistemic modality was significantly higher than Root modality in Physics.

30|$|As {{shown in}} (1), the {{congruent}} way to represent {{experience in the}} English clause—as well as the Spanish—is when processes are realized with <b>verbal</b> <b>groups</b> (attacked), participants with nominal groups (the soldiers; the town), associated circumstances as prepositional phrases or adverbial groups (with guns), and logical relationships between clauses through conjunctions (and then).|$|R

30|$|But what we {{are seeing}} in the lexicogrammar is more than just {{internal}} regularity. Mandarin seems to take a consistently analytical approach to the construal of experience. This appears in all three primary elements of the clause: <b>verbal</b> <b>group,</b> nominal group and “prepositional” phrase. The last is in fact pre-/post-positional: it analyses out the domain of the minor process into the two factors of “relation” and “facet”. Typically the nominal group analyses the “thing” into a general class plus optional subclass; the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> analyses the process into an event plus optional culmination; and the meaning of the whole is derivable from the meaning of its parts.|$|E
50|$|Computer Assisted Reviewing for Translation (CART) {{tools are}} CAR tools {{being able to}} manage multi-lingual comparisons. This implies {{to be able to}} match each part of text from one {{document}} to the other, taking into account the specificity of each language: date/number formats, punctuation (for example, French/English quotation marks), etc. The best CART tools are able to find matches between noun or <b>verbal</b> <b>groups,</b> this implying to find terminological and syntaxical elements using linguistic analyzers.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, clauses of {{disappearance}} (e.g., (5)) are event-existentials, for {{the simple}} reason that they express existence/occurrence of events rather than things. Finally, it should be pointed out that, as the above discussion suggests, thing existentials do not constitute a homogeneous category. Those existentials whose processes are realized by <b>verbal</b> <b>groups</b> other than yǒu denote the occurrence/existence of event to some extent. Thing-existentials and event-existentials form a continuum. This is what we will elaborate on in the following two sections.|$|R
30|$|Here the {{placement}} of the groups is textually motivated. The textual meaning is to construe modality as NEW. It is similar to the evaluative enhanced construction “it is … that”, e.g. it is also possible that, in English (Fawcett and Huang 1995, Wang 2008). Without this kind of grammatical construction in Chinese, the post position of a group is a more common strategy. The <b>verbal</b> <b>groups</b> could not be considered as realizing events because no Participant is involved. Hence, they realized implicit modality.|$|R

30|$|The {{tendency}} {{is the same}} with the expression méizhǔn. The translation proves that the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> at issue realizes implicit modality. It differs from the adverbial group {{in the sense that it}} foregrounds the meaning of mental processes.|$|E

30|$|First, in Chinese {{the lowest}} rank with {{implications}} for clause grammar {{is the group}} rather than the word. The internal structure of the word is strictly derivational (compounds, word class formatives) rather than inflectional. Grammatical affixes (usually known as particles) can be analysed {{as part of the}} structure of either the group (subordination, aspect) or the clause (aspect, mood). This means that the conception of rank scale is a little different from English in that some word classes operate directly {{in the structure of the}} clause. Secondly, there is a degree of functional indeterminacy between certain ranks […] this often makes it difficult to distinguish between <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> and clause, and between <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> complex and clause complex.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with explicating the role of language in mobilising action through management emails. Situated {{within the context of}} organisational change in a globalised manufacturing business, the project is framed by behavioural observations from management scholars Palmer and Hardy (2000) of mobilisation strategies that utilise linguistic resources since they: (a) involve a sense of obligation or inclination in directives; (b) show how co-operation will produce mutual benefits; (c) construct desired actions as legitimate, beneficial or inevitable; and (d) use past or anticipated meanings, for or against certain actions. Systemic Functional Linguistics is the underlying framework employed to provide a theoretically principled account of the intuitively derived observations from Palmer and Hardy (2000) which are applied to a sample of twenty-seven email texts, through corpus- and text-based analysis. A major finding is that the representation of action is enacted interpersonally through the <b>verbal</b> <b>group.</b> This view complements experientially dominated accounts of the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> which focus on the tense system. Further, action is found to be motivated through the negotiation of evaluative stance. By relating the grammar of the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> as well as other resources to the discourse semantics of Appraisal, modulation (of obligation or inclination) is found to be enabled by both negative as well as positive judgements of capacity. Specifically, judgements of capacity are re-interpreted as invocations of high obligation as managers seek to mobilise (further) positive performance. The analysis demonstrates that elements in the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> (complex) and Appraisal co-opt action through enabling positioning of the writer, in terms of assessing and grading categorical meanings, manipulating interpersonal time, or foregrounding solidarity. A significant contribution to the thesis is an extension of the system of GRADUATION: FOCUS (Hood, 2004 a) through the demonstration of how resources of the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> negotiate expectations of appearances and achievements. This study has also extended the resources of GRADUATION: FORCE by applying it to the management context. The practical contribution of the study is that these insights may more explicitly inform management training and enable managers to participate more effectively within their community of practice...|$|E
3000|$|The Finite/Predicator may be {{realized}} by <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> {{consisting of a}} single verb, or by a <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> consisting {{of more than one}} verb. In the BH clause, the Finite and Predicator elements are normally fused and do not function separately in the clause, unlike in English; however, in certain cases they may {{be realized}} separately. Realized as separate elements, the Finite includes marking for person, gender, number and tense/aspect, while the Predicator is typically realized by means of one of the infinitive forms. This structure is described as “auxiliary[*]+[*]infinitive” (Chrzanowski 2013 : 246 [...]). In some cases, however, BH uses a “two-finite-verb construction”, in which both the auxiliary and the lexical verb are fully inflected as if they were two separate clauses (ibid.).|$|E

This included a control <b>group,</b> a <b>verbal</b> strategy <b>group</b> (where gestures were associated with labels) and a gestural strategy group (where participants repeated gestures and were told to imagine reproducing the movements).

30|$|A {{limitation}} of this experiment is that participants were not provided with detailed instructions for completing their explanations. In addition, this experiment does not fully clarify the role of spatial ability, since high spatial participants in the visual and <b>verbal</b> <b>groups</b> demonstrated equivalent knowledge of the pump on the post-test. One possibility is that the interaction with the bicycle pump prior to generating explanations was a sufficient learning experience for the high spatial participants. Other researchers (e.g. Flick, 1993) have shown that hands-on interactive experiences can be effective learning situations. High spatial ability participants may {{be better able to}} imagine the movement and function of a system (e.g. Hegarty, 1992).|$|R
30|$|The {{placement}} of the infinitive absolute before the finite verb (Finite/Predicator) typically expresses {{a high degree of}} certainty {{on the part of the}} speaker, thus grammaticalizing modalization in the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> (van der Merwe et al. 1999 : 158; Waltke and O’Connor 1990 : 584 - 488).

Contextualising <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> making: issues {{in the development of}} a text-based description of Chinese grammar. This study sets out to explore the relationship between grammatical patterning and the organisation of discourse in Modem Standard Chinese. Chapter 0 lays the groundwork for the theoretical framework and the descriptive methodology of the thesis. Chapter 1 discusses the questions of what constitutes a text, and how a text relates to the context in which it is produced. It introduces the three functional components or metafunctions of systemic functional theory according to which language use may be understood - the textual, the interpersonal, and the experiential - and shows how these metafunctions can be used in the description of a text to make connections between its context of situation (register), its overallorganisation as a text (discourse-semantics) and the form of its wording (lexicogrammar). It describes the lexicogrammar of a single Chinese text in terms of the basic grammatical systems which build up the meaning of the clause, and the functional clause elements which realise those systems. Chapter 2 reviews the grammatical description put forward in Chapter 1 in terms of the different structures constituted by the textual, interpersonal and experiential elements of the clause in Chinese. It discusses the relationship between the central lexicogrammatical unit of clause and the other units of which it is constituted, and shows how the different functional components of the lexicogrammar define structures whose scope doesnot always coincide with the clause. It then examines how clauses are joined together, analysing the text in terms of a fvirther functional structure - the logical, and shows how these four types of grammatical structure come together to express the meanings of the whole text. Chapter 3 examines the grammatical systems that lie behind the different function structures of the clause. It compares the single text used in Chapter 1 with other Chinese texts which contrast with it in terms of their textual, interpersonal, experiential or logical patterning, and discusses the ways in which a grammatical description is influenced by features of the texts chosen as data. It then contrasts the parameters of this systemic functional description of Chinese grammar with other descriptive frameworks. Chapter 4 sets out the systemic meaning options available in the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> in Chinese and the structures through which they are reahsed, and shows the relationship of the <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> systems to the clause systems already described in previous chapters. It traces the changes in <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> marking through the unfolding of a particular Chinese text by describing the meanings that are taken up from <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> systems at different points in the text, and identifying the various factors that trigger this marking. Chapter 5 sums up the issues raised throughout the thesis in setting up a framework for describing Chinese clause and <b>verbal</b> <b>group</b> systems through their contribution to the organisation of text. It characterises the relationship between the different layers of meaning in text - the grammatical meanings embodied in clauses and groups, and the semantic meanings realised over the text as a whole-and shows how grammatical description needs to be both top-down, i. e. in terms of the contexts of grammatical structure, and bottom-up, i. e. in terms of its realisations. In putting forward this small-scale functional description of the grammar of a number of Chinese texts, it is concerned to develop a text based process of grammatical description which can be applied for purposes, such as language teaching,which depend on interpreting the meaning and wording of texts.

40|$|In formal {{syntactic}} analysis, the {{noun phrase}} functioning as subject governs the verb phrase functioning as predicate, and the verb within the verb phrase in turn governs the noun phrase functioning as its object.
