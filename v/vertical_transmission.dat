5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of <b>vertical</b> <b>transmission</b> include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>{{transmission}}</b> of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E

Monthly farm-gate and retail prices in Voronezh Oblast, a historically large agrarian region located {{to the south of}} Moscow, covering the period from 2002 to 2014 were used in the analysis. When estimating the <b>vertical</b> price <b>transmission</b> in the dairy market, seasonality should be taken into account. Using a cointegration technique, no empirical evidence is found for cointegration between farm-gate and retail prices. There is unidirectional Granger causality from retail to farm prices and not vice versa. The results support the assumption that price changes are not transmitted efficiently from one level to another and support the view that Russian retailers have more market power than farmers...|$|R

30|$|Aragrande et al. (2017) look at {{the issue}} of the {{competition}} along the food-chain by using a different approach that is analyzing <b>vertical</b> price <b>transmission</b> in the sugar industry. The issue is relevant because <b>vertical</b> price <b>transmission</b> provide some preliminary indications to assess market efficiency. Indeed, asymmetries in price transmission might reveal the existence of market power along the supply chain. Aragrande et al. (2017) analyze the peculiar case of the sugar sector in the EU that is relevant for two main reasons: the downstream sector is highly concentrated and farm production has been historically managed by a quota regime. In particular, the authors use an econometric model to investigate changes in <b>vertical</b> price <b>transmission</b> linked to the sugar policy reform and to assess the effect of such reform on the sugar retail price. Such results are further analyzed according to the degree of competition and concentration in the EU sugar industry. In conclusion, they show that <b>vertical</b> price <b>transmission</b> asymmetries still exist after the reform. Hence, the current EU sugar market seems far from reaching efficiency even if they conclude that the reform might have created more favorable conditions to improve it.|$|R

Symptoms and treatment of infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending on the organism causing it. Shigella infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Streptococcus infections cause similar symptoms to nonspecific vulvovaginitis and are treated with amoxicillin. STI-associated vulvovaginitis may be caused by sexual abuse or <b>vertical</b> <b>transmission,</b> and are treated and diagnosed like adult infections.|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is an epidemic that disproportionally affects the Haitian immigrant women in Palm Beach County, Florida. I have learned about this association from others 2 ̆ 7 published research that the Haitian immigrant women within this locality {{are more likely to}} be hospitalized for HIV-related complications and to delay seeking care than are other racial and ethnic groups. The knowledge on the perceptions of lives for Haitian immigrant women as it relates to the HIV transmission could help fight this virus. Guided by the health belief model, the purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand the lived experiences and perceptions of Haitian immigrant women about <b>vertical</b> HIV <b>transmission.</b> Data were collected via 25 interviews with HIV-positive Haitian immigrant women of 18 to 65 years old. Three-step approach of Creswell was used under which data were reduced into themes, coded, and condensed.

Finally, the pricing behaviour of sugar merchants shows a certain asymmetry toward price increases.|$|R
25|$|African Americans and {{immigrants}} from developing countries typically have an HSV-1 seroprevalance in their adolescent {{population that is}} {{two or three times}} higher than that of Caucasian Americans. Many white Americans become sexually active while seronegative for HSV-1. The absence of antibodies from a prior oral HSV-1 infection leaves these individuals susceptible to herpes whitlow, herpes gladiatorium, and HSV-1 genital infection. Primary genital infection brings with it the risk of <b>vertical</b> <b>transmission</b> to the neonate, and is highest if the mother contracts a primary infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. In the U.S. the number of genital infections caused by HSV-1 is now thought to be about 50% of first episodes of genital infection.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis B is {{a disease}} caused by {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) which infects the liver of hominoidea, including humans, and causes an inflammation called hepatitis. The disease has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. About {{a third of the}} world's population, more than 2 billion people, have been infected with HBV. Transmission of HBV results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids containing blood. Possible forms of transmission include (but are not limited to) unprotected sexual contact, blood transfusions, re-use of contaminated needles and syringes, and <b>vertical</b> <b>transmission</b> from mother to child during childbirth. HBV can also be transmitted between family members within households, possibly by contact of non-intact skin or mucous membrane with secretions or saliva containing the virus. However, at least 30% of reported hepatitis B cases among adults cannot be associated with an identifiable risk factor.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or <b>vertical</b> <b>transmission.</b> Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of <b>vertical</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> in the western region of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The study analyzed the medical records of HIV- 1 -infected mothers and infant pairs living in the municipalities of São Paulo Regional Health Departments DRS II (Araçatuba) and DRS XI (Presidente Prudente). From March 2001 to March 2006, blood samples were collected and referred to the Molecular Biology Unit of the Adolfo Lutz Institute (ALI), Presidente Prudente. HIV- 1 -RNA viral load was determined by bDNA assay. RESULTS: The number of births (109 / 217, 50. 2 %) and <b>vertical</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmissions</b> (6 / 109, 5. 5 %) that occurred in DRS II was similar to births (108 / 217, 49. 8 %) and <b>vertical</b> <b>transmissions</b> (7 / 108, 6. 5 %) in DRS XI (p > 0. 05). Although 80 % (4 / 5) of the infected children were male in DRS II, while in DRS XI, 75 % (6 / 8) were female, no differences between sex regarding infected and noninfected children in the regions of Araçatuba and Presidente Prudente were verified. The overall <b>vertical</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> rate was 6 %. No consistent reduction in the prevalence of <b>vertical</b> HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> occurred over the years. About 20 % of mothers {{did not know the}} HIV- 1 status of their newborns eight months after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, MTCT prevalence rates were about 70 % higher than those previously determined in the State of São Paulo, with noreduction throughout the period. Furthermore, a significant number of mothers did not know the HIV-status of their newborns eight months after delivery...|$|R

We define horizontal transmissions as changes that are generated by linkages among fuels at a similar stage of processing while <b>vertical</b> <b>transmissions</b> are changes that are generated by upstream/downstream linkages in the oil supply chain. Here, we investigate <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>transmissions</b> by estimating vector error correction models (VECMs) that represent relationships among {{the price of crude}} oil, US refinery utilization rates, US stocks of crude oil, US stocks of motor gasoline, the US price of motor gasoline, and the US price of a substitute fuel, natural gas. Causal relationships estimated from both weekly and quarterly observations indicate that the price of crude oil is an important gateway for disturbances to the oil supply chain. Impulse response functions indicate that disturbances to crude oil prices ripple down the oil supply chain and affect inventory behaviors, refinery utilization rates, and the price of motor gasoline, and are transmitted laterally to the natural gas market.

25|$|Current {{research}} regarding EEC {{syndrome is}} focused on the genetic components contributing to the presented traits found in patients with EEC. A normal human karyotype includes 22 pairs of autosomal or non-sex chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, constituting a total of 46 chromosomes. During reproduction, each parent contributes 23 chromosomes; 22 autosomal chromosomes and one sex chromosome. As stated above, EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that there is an abnormal gene on one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes from either parent. Because the gene is dominant, only one parent must contribute the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease and the contributing parent will usually have the disease, due to the expression of the dominant gene in the parent. Some characteristics of autosomal dominant inheritance patterns include a <b>vertical</b> <b>transmission</b> pattern, meaning that the disease phenotype is seen in generation after generation. Also, the recurrence risk is 50% and there are an equal number of affected males and females. Though we can calculate the chance of inheritance of the gene, the degree of expression cannot be calculated.|$|E
