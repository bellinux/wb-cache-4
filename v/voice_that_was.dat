5|$|The Tippett family {{originated}} in Cornwall. Michael Tippett's grandfather, George Tippett, left the county in 1854 {{to make his}} fortune in London through property speculation and other business schemes. A flamboyant character, he had a strong tenor <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a popular feature at Christian revivalist meetings. In later life his business enterprises faltered, leading to debts, prosecution for fraud, and a term of imprisonment. His son Henry, born in 1858, was Michael's father. A lawyer by training, he was successful in business and was independently wealthy {{by the time of}} his marriage in April 1903. Unusually for his background and upbringing, Henry Tippett was a progressive liberal and a religious sceptic.|$|E
25|$|John Coates (29 June 1865 – 16 August 1941) was {{a leading}} English tenor, who sang in opera and oratorio and on the concert platform. His {{repertoire}} ranged from Bach and Purcell to contemporary works, and embraced the major heldentenor roles in Richard Wagner's operas. For more than 40 years, with only a four-year interruption for military service during World War I, he overcame the limitations of a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not naturally large by impressing listeners with his intense artistic expression, lively diction, musical versatility and memorable stage presence.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois, Cleveland began singing {{as a boy}} soprano at Pilgrim Baptist Church where Thomas A. Dorsey was {{minister}} of music and Roberta Martin was pianist for the choir. He strained his vocal cords as a teenager while part of a local gospel group, leaving the distinctive gravelly <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> his hallmark in his later years. The change in his voice led him to focus on his skills as a pianist and later as a composer and arranger. For his pioneering accomplishments and contributions, he is regarded {{by many to be}} one of the greatest gospel singers that ever lived.|$|E

25|$|The L.A. riots {{contributed to}} the {{creation}} of new ethnic agendas and organization. A week after the riots, in the largest Asian-American protest ever held in a city, about 30,000 mostly Korean and Korean American marchers walked the streets of L.A. Koreatown, calling for peace and denouncing police violence. This cultural movement was devoted to the protection of Koreans' political rights, ethnic heritage, and political representation. It created a new form of leaders within the community, in which second generation children spoke on behalf of the community. Korean Americans saw a shift in occupation goals, from storeowners to political leaders. Such political voice aided Korean Americans in receiving governmental aid in the reconstruction of their damaged neighborhoods. Countless community and advocacy groups have been established to further fuel Korean political representation and understanding. They experienced firsthand the severity of such isolation, as they were forced to endure the physical and psychological aftermath. The representative <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> created remains present in South Central Los Angeles, as such events as the riots {{contributed to the}} shaping of identities, perceptions and political and social representation.|$|E
500|$|Johnson sang in a harsh, gravelly bass <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{meant to}} be {{powerful}} enough to be heard by passersby on the streets. His vocal interplay was described by the blues writer Mark Makin as [...] "fierce" [...] and [...] "not unlike the 'Hell and Damnation' of a Baptist preacher such as a fired-up Reverend A. W. Nix". On some instances in his recordings, Johnson also delivered vocals in his natural tenor voice. The only known influence on Johnson's singing style is the blind musician Madkin Butler, who, like Johnson, sang his religious message {{on the streets of}} Texas cities.|$|E
500|$|Twice Through the Heart {{lasts for}} {{approximately}} 30 minutes. It consists of nine musical numbers arranged in three sections. It is narrated {{by a woman}} in the prison cell where she has been sent for the murder of her husband. To express the woman's feelings, Kay deliberately chose a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> unpoetic: [...] "I wanted the voice to be so everyday, it would be banal." [...] Turnage's music too includes similarly basic material, what critic Tom Service describes as [...] "simple hummable tunes", but these are transformed and distorted, a metaphor for how initial loving intimacy is destroyed and distorted by years of violence and abuse. Turnage's musical language is modernist but influenced by jazz, an area of musical interest he shared with Kay.|$|E

500|$|The Duke spent William's {{reign in}} the House of Lords, {{where he was}} assiduous in his attendance. Wrote {{newspaper}} editor James Grant, [...] "He is literally—the door-keeper of course excepted—the first man in the House, and the last out of it. And this not merely generally, but every night." [...] Grant, in his observations of the leading members of the House of Lords, indicated that the Duke was not noted for his oratory (he delivered no speech longer than five minutes) and had a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> difficult to understand, though, [...] "his manner is most mild and conciliatory." [...] Grant denigrated the Duke's intellect and influence, but stated that the Duke had indirect influence over several members, and that, [...] "he {{is by no means}} so bad a tactician as his opponents suppose." ...|$|E
500|$|Wu {{was known}} for posting humorous videos on YouTube. When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a [...] "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not [...] "make all A's...in school today [...] made a B+." [...] He is then greeted by a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> supposed to be his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell phone. At this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and the {{voice on the other end}} to Wu's disappointment says, [...] "Hey, why did you tell me to call you?" [...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E

500|$|In the pulpit, Wilson {{was said}} to have a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> harsh and indistinct and his {{demeanor}} was directed at strict discipline, but he had a penchant for rhymes, and would frequently engage in word play. [...] He was unpopular during his early days of preaching in Boston, partly attributable to his strictness in teaching, and partly from his violent and arbitrary manner. [...] His gruff style was further highlighted by the mild qualities of John Cotton, with whom he shared the church's ministry. [...] When Wilson returned to Boston in 1635, Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and immediately saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his. [...] She found his emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of [...] "evidencing justification by sanctification" [...] (a covenant of works) to be repugnant, and she told her followers that Wilson lacked [...] "the seal of the Spirit." [...] Wilson's doctrines were shared with all of the other ministers in the colony, except for Cotton, and the Boston congregation had grown accustomed to Cotton's lack of emphasis on preparation [...] "in favor of stressing the inevitability of God's will." [...] The positions of Cotton and Wilson were matters of emphasis, and neither minister believed that works could help to save a person. [...] It is likely that most members of the Boston church could not see much difference between the doctrines of the two men, but the astute Hutchinson could, prompting her to criticize Wilson at her home gatherings. [...] Probably in early 1636 he became aware of divisions within his own Boston congregation, and soon came to realize that Hutchinson's views were widely divergent from those of the orthodox clergy in the colony.|$|E

50|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} are {{the most}} common positive symptom in children. A child's auditory hallucinations may include <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> conversing with each other or <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> speaking directly to the children themselves. Many children with auditory hallucinations believe that if they do not listen to the voices, the voices will harm them or someone else. Tactile and visual hallucinations seem relatively rare. Delusions are reported in more than half of children with schizophrenia, but they are usually less complex than those of adults.|$|R

However, it was Dagmar Krause's unusual and eerie high-pitched <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the group's most arresting feature.

2500|$|Some critics criticized Lanois' {{production}} on Time Out of Mind. Allmusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, [...] "...Time Out of Mind has a grittier foundation—by and large, {{the songs are}} bitter and resigned, and Dylan gives them appropriately anguished performances. Lanois bathes them in hazy, ominous sounds, which may suit {{the spirit of the}} lyrics, but are often in opposition to Dylan's performances." [...] Michael Gray writes, [...] "The sound is elsewhere unhelpful too on Time Out of Mind. Some tracks have Dylan so buried in echo that there is no hope of hearing the detailing in his <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> once so central and diamondlike a part of his genius." ...|$|E

Wilkins had initially refused to announce the news because he despised Du Bois as a Communist—but then insisted on making the announcement when he realized that Randolph would make it if he didn't. Wilkins said: [...] "Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that {{at the dawn of the}} twentieth century his was the <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> calling you to gather here today in this cause.

2500|$|Robertson kept {{an office}} on the {{property}} of the recording studio The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California, where he would work out ideas for the album. Much of the album was recorded there. Robertson's basic backing band included guitar player Bill Dillon, a friend of Lanois' who had also played for Ronnie Hawkins, as well as bass player Tony Levin, and Parisian drummer Manu Katché. Robertson brought in drummer Terry Bozzio after Katché had to return to Paris. Robertson also brought in The BoDeans to provide group vocals for some of the tracks on the album, most notably on [...] "Showdown at Big Sky". BoDeans member Sammy BoDean created a faux female <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> used on the chorus of [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River".
