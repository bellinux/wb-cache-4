5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> biological function, so mathematical methods {{have been developed for}} the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

Important cargo quantities are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled {{to reduce the}} diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E

Teller's lifelong friendship with a Czech physicist, George Placzek, was also <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> his scientific and philosophical development.
