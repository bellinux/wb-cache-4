40|$|Objectives: Adhesions {{around the}} flexor tendons block tendon gliding. The most common problem in {{secondary}} surgery is inadequate and ineffective tenolysis. Local anesthesia facilitates patient comfort and early active mobilization, which is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>after</b> tenolysis surgery and even surgery without tourniquet. This study presents a tenolysis series managed with local anesthesia. Methods: We performed 22 tenolysis surgeries for zone 1 and zone 2 tendon adhesions under local infiltration anesthesia. If active flexion was achieved due to unblocked motor function, we removed the screen between the surgery area and patient {{to allow the}} patient to view their own movement. Results: There was 1 relapse. However, {{the results of the}} remaining patients were good or excellent. Discussion: This anesthesia technique enables comfortable surgery without tourniquet, unblocked motor function, and less postoperative pain. Preserving motor function is crucial for evaluating the adequacy of tenolysis intraoperatively. We recommend local infiltration anesthesia for suitable patients undergoing tenolysis.
