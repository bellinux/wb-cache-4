Surveyors included architects, materials conservators, architectural historians, structural engineers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers. The architectural and materials condition survey included a close-range visual inspection {{of all of the}} wood members in the building to determine locations of deteriorated wood, an analysis of the types of wood species occurring in the building, a study of the building’s construction details, glazing, and a photographic survey. The structural survey included measuring the deflection of each of the arches and studying the probable lateral and <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> paths to determine areas of weakness.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the probe}} is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue's forward {{internal}} receptacle, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. [...] The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a NATO standard and were originally developed by the company Flight Refuelling Limited in the UK and deployed in the late 1940s and 1950s. [...] This standardization allows drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations the ability to refuel probe-equipped aircraft from other nations. [...] The NATO standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the refueling valve to {{the end of the}} probe. [...] This is so that if a large side or <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the fuel valve breaks off, rather than the probe or receiver aircraft suffering structural damage. [...] A so-called [...] "broken probe" [...] (actually a broken fuel valve, as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence. [...] Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed during ground maintenance.|$|E

It was also showed that, for piles with large exposure lengths under <b>vertical</b> <b>loads,</b> the gravity second-order effect must not be ignored and the <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> increased not only the bending moments of piles but also the shear forces.

Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including Alpine/Luxman, Matsushita under the Technics brand, Kenwood and Toshiba/Aurex. For the early <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman, Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand). Kenwood added their [...] "Sigma Drive" [...] outputs to this design as a modification. A picture of this early design can be seen on the Panasonic Web site. The <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> is similar the one common in cassette decks, where the holder opens, and disc is dropped to it. The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of new {{offshore}} applications are emerging in the energy sector. The {{oil and gas industry}} is targeting minimum facility applications, whilst the renewable energy sector is developing offshore wind turbines, {{as well as a number}} of wave and tidal energy devices. The design and installation of the foundations are key considerations in the financial viability of such offshore engineering projects. Suction caisson foundations are a potential solution for these new developments, but design guidance is relatively sparse. This paper considers the <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> response of a caisson foundation in clay, during installation and under both monotonic and cyclic <b>vertical</b> <b>loading.</b> The main contribution is the presentation and interpretation of high quality experimental data. <b>Vertical</b> <b>loading</b> is critical for the design of a multi-footing structure of the type that might be used for large offshore wind turbines. We first consider the installation behaviour and compare data from pushed installations and a suction installation with results from a theoretical calculation. We then consider cyclic <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> tests, focussing on cyclic amplitudes that take the foundation into tension.

40|$|Lunge is one {{frequently}} executed {{movement in}} badminton and involves a unique sagittal footstrike angle {{of more than}} 40 degrees at initial ground contact compared with other manoeuvres. This study examined if the shoe heel curvature design of a badminton shoe would influence shoe-ground kinematics, ground reaction forces, and knee moments during lunge. Eleven elite and fifteen intermediate players performed five left-forward maximum lunge trials with Rounded Heel Shoe (RHS), Flattened Heel Shoe (FHS), and Standard Heel Shoes (SHS). Shoe-ground kinematics, ground reaction forces, and knee moments were measured by using synchronized force platform and motion analysis system. A 2 (Group) x 3 (Shoe) ANOVA with repeated measures was performed {{to determine the effects}} of different shoes and different playing levels, as well as the interaction of two factors on all variables. Shoe effect indicated that players demonstrated lower maximum <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rate in RHS than the other two shoes (P < 0. 05). Group effect revealed that elite players exhibited larger footstrike angle, faster approaching speed, lower peak horizontal force and horizontal loading rates but higher <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates and larger peak knee flexion and extension moments (P < 0. 05). Analysis of Interactions of Group x Shoe for maximum and mean <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates (P < 0. 05) indicated that elite players exhibited lower left maximum and mean <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates in RHS compared to FHS (P < 0. 01), while the intermediate group did not show any Shoe effect on <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> rates. These findings indicate that shoe heel curvature would play some role in altering ground reaction force impact during badminton lunge. The differences in impact loads and knee moments between elite and intermediate players may be useful in optimizing footwear design and training strategy to minimize the potential risks for impact related injuries in badminton...|$|R

50|$|Lift-off {{oversteer}} (also {{known as}} snap-oversteer, trailing-throttle oversteer, throttle off oversteer, or lift-throttle oversteer) {{is a form}} of oversteer in automobiles that occurs while cornering when closing the throttle causes a deceleration, causing the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> on the tires to shift from the rear to the front, in a process called weight transfer. This decrease in <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> on the rear tires causes a decrease in the lateral force they generate, so that their lateral acceleration (into the corner) is also decreased. This causes the vehicle to steer more tightly into the turn, hence oversteering. In other words, easing off the accelerator can cause the rear tires to lose traction, with the potential for the car to leave the road tail first.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the performance of}} a modified large scale shear box apparatus, which is mainly used to execute full scale laboratory study of segmental retaining walls. A typical apparatus has already been adopted by the current ASTM and NCMA test protocols and by literature studying of those test protocols, it is found that protocols recommend a fixed vertical actuator with roller or airbag configuration as a proposed <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> assembly. Previous research study demonstrated that <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement greatly influences the interface shear capacity of block systems and fixed vertical actuator with flexible airbag shows better loading arrangement for the blocks which have dilatant behavior. However, airbag arrangement is strenuous and time-consuming loading assembly compared to fixed vertical actuator which increases normal load with shear displacement due to bending of vertical actuator locked with the top block during shear loading. For the drawbacks of fixed <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement, the apparatus used in this study was fully redesigned and modified in terms of normal loading arrangement specially. A moveable <b>vertical</b> <b>loading</b> assembly is used in the modified apparatus which allows the piston movement with the top blocks during shear testing. The results outlined in this paper report that normal load remains constant over the period of shear testing {{for a wide range of}} surcharge loading. It could easily be concluded that the modified apparatus might be a better alternative to the existing apparatus used in the test protocols. ...|$|R
