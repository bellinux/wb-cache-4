40|$|This new instrument, {{that will}} {{enter into force}} once it has been {{ratified}} by at least twenty States, deals with the international carriage of goods and is closely connected with the international trade. International transport law is currently regulated by two main international Conventions, the Hague Rules and the Hamburg Rules. Many countries have adopted the Hague Rules as amended by two Protocols, respectively adopted in Brussels on 1968 (the Hague <b>Visby</b> <b>Rules</b> – 30 contracting States) and on 1979 (the Special Drawing Rights Protocol – 25 contracting States). Some other Countries apply a sort of mix system between these Conventions. As we can see, actually the field of maritime transport law {{is not at all}} internationally unified, eventhough the Hague and the Hague-Visby Rules are, at this stage, the more common rules applied by the shipowners of the Western countries...|$|E
40|$|Discusses the {{significance}} of the bill of lading in international trade and its effective role as a document of title. Looks at: (1) the general functions of a bill of lading; (2) the difference between ordinary and straight bills of lading; (3) the treatment of straight bills under the Hague Rules 1924 and the Hague <b>Visby</b> <b>Rules</b> 1968; and (4) the Court of Appeal's decision in JI MacWilliam Co Inc v Mediterranean Shipping Co SA (The Rafaela S) on whether a straight bill was a document of title under the 1968 Rules for the purpose of determining the applicability of a package limitation under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971. Explains the legal nature of straight bills of lading, including the importance of the requirement to produce a bill before possession of goods can be taken and any mandatory requirement for a bill to be presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} of seaborne cargo rules, there have been the Hague, <b>Visby,</b> and Hamburg <b>Rules,</b> {{as well as the}} UN latest {{relevant}} convention – the Rotterdam Rules. All tried to promote uniform rules, but none of them have fulfilled that task yet. This empirical study attempts to examine these existing rules and their impact on legal uniformity on seaborne cargo rules. This survey involved in Chinese and some European maritime professionals. To assess the uniform law in practice, a semi structured survey was designed and utilised. A list of questions was addressed to professionals to examine their understanding of this area of law. Some choices had been provided to be potential answers, but all questions were kept open for further comments and revisions from respondents. Inherited from a previous pilot study, this study maintained the use of the paper-based and face-to-face survey. A new approach – the introduction of online counterpart survey, has been introduced, because this is a user friendly way to submit responses. Regardless of varied numbering of questions, online survey included the same questions of the paper-based survey. After analysing all responses, this study found that the Rotterdam Rules were diversely understood and could potentially cause further legal fragmentation in practice rather than unifying law. The Rotterdam Rules faced a dilemma. Though attempting to update the legal regimes to accommodate changing commercial realities, the Rules would jeopardize uniform law if they were not being widely ratified. This dilemma might come true given a number of negative factors in their ratification. Even so, the contemporary commercial and shipping realities still call for rules on electronic commerce and multi-modal transport...|$|R
40|$|The Rotterdam Rules set forth, on {{the lines}} of the Hague- <b>Visby</b> <b>Rules,</b> a number of {{excepted}} perils when the carrier will not be liable for the damage to cargo. The institute of excepted perils was established by the Hague Rules almost 90 years ago, and is still implemented in practice. For such cases exceptionally the carrier is not liable under the principle of assumed guilty, but under the principle of proven guilty. In the preliminary activities for concluding the new international convention, the possibility has been considered of abolition of the institute of excepted perils has been considered, but in the end nevertheless, on the initiative of mainly maritime states, it has been retained, developed and more contemporarily styled, i. e. concerted with the requirements of the contemporary maritime transport. The Rotterdam Rules in Article 17, Paragraph 3, taxatively cite the excepted perils due to which the carrier will be able to exculpate from liability. The key difference is that error in navigation is no longer an excepted peril. Especially important novelties introduced by the Rotterdam Rules are exemption of the carrier from liability due to the acts of piracy, terrorist attacks, undertaking measures to avoid or prevent possible damage to the environment, and alike...|$|E
