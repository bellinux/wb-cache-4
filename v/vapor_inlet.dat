40|$|To provide {{essential}} {{design information}} of microchannel evaporators, an experimental {{study was conducted}} on the effects of geometry, operating conditions and fluid properties on the distribution of refrigerant and pressure drop in horizontal heat exchanger manifolds. An experimental facility with a visualization section for mimicking a real heat exchanger manifold geometry was developed. Under realistic operating conditions, measurements of refrigerant distribution were conducted by measuring mass flow rates and vapor quality of all branch tube groups (individual adjacent heat exchanger tubes were grouped in groups) for a total of 60 test cases. The flow direction within the heat exchangers is vertically upward. Stratified flow is observed for the end inlet case of the dividing manifold due to the gravitational effect. The liquid level increases along the dividing manifold because the liquid is traveling farther than the vapor due to inertia difference. Near the end of the manifold, the liquid level is almost constant. For the side inlet case, it is observed that the incoming refrigerant impinges on the inner side wall of the manifold, and is divided symmetrically near the inlet, and the interface between the vapor and the liquid has a V-shaped form near the inlet. Based on the measurements, it is observed that for the end inlet case, the profile of the branch tube inlet vapor quality is of a "stepwise" shape. There exist two almost constant value regions, one of about 100 % vapor quality near the inlet and the remainder of about 12 % vapor quality with a very short transition region. For the end inlet case, as the manifold inlet mass flow rate increases, the number of branch tube groups having almost 100 % tube inlet vapor quality increases also because the vapor-liquid interface is moving farther {{towards the end of the}} manifold due to the increased momentum. However, for the side inlet case, there is no such region having 100 % branch tube inlet vapor quality. For the side inlet case, the profile of the branch tube inlet vapor quality is symmetric. Near the inlet, the branch tube inlet vapor quality is about 60 ~ 70 %, and near the end of the manifold, the branch tube inlet vapor quality is about 20 %. In between two regions, the branch tube inlet vapor quality decreases monotonously along the manifold. The flow distribution is strongly affected by the manifold inlet location and/or manifold inlet geometry and manifold inlet vapor mass flux. Correlations are proposed using the T-junction concept in a modified form from Watanabe et al. 's method (1995). For R- 410 A and R- 134 a tests with both inlet cases, 90 % of measured <b>vapor</b> <b>inlet</b> quality data and 90 % of measured liquid fraction of taken off data are within predicted values ± 0. 1. To investigate the effect of refrigerant maldistribution on the performance of the tested heat exchangers, heat exchanger simulations were conducted. Based on the heat exchanger simulation results using test results for the refrigerant distribution, for the side inlet case, the capacity degradation based on the uniform distribution at the tested inlet manifold mass flow rates (at 30, 45 and 60 g/s) is 5 ~ 8 %. For the end inlet case, as the inlet manifold mass flow rate increases, the capacity degradation based on the uniform distribution ranges from 4 % to 15 % as a function of the manifold inlet mass flow rate. Therefore, the side inlet is preferred for a wide range of mass flow rates compared to the end inlet...|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study were to {{determine}} whether formic and acetic acid could be quantified from the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Experiment (DC 3) through post-mission calibration and analysis and to optimize a reagent gas mix with CH 3 I, CO 2, and O 2 that allows quantitative cluster ion formation with hydroperoxides and organic acids suitable for use in future field measurements. There is a scarcity of organic acid measurements in the upper troposphere under stormy conditions with which to compare and assess photochemical and transport theory. DC 3 observations made in May and June 2012 extending from the surface to 13 km over the central United States during convective storm conditions would be a significant addition to our knowledge base. Organic acid measurements were made with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) aboard the NCAR Gulfstream-V platform in DC 3. The primary objective of the CIMS was to observe hydrogen peroxide and methyl hydroperoxide though it recorded signals attributed to iodide clusters of formic and acetic acid at 173 and 187 townsend, respectively. Both organic acids were targets of opportunity as the reagent ion (I-) needed for clustering was not specifically used in the field. However an iodide source gas (iodomethane, CH 3 I), was used during pre-mission experiments and a residual amount adsorbed onto the inlet surfaces was found to be bleeding off the plumbing in the field. Post-mission laboratory experiments were performed to determine the CIMS instrument’s sensitivity to these organic acids under iodomethane outgassing and the varying water vapor and sample flow conditions encountered during DC 3 flights. Laboratory calibration experiments with varying iodomethane concentrations, inlet pressures, and water vapor mixing ratios were performed. Calibrations for hydrogen peroxide and methyl hydroperoxide were used to tune the reagent gas mixture composed of CH 3 I, CO 2, and O 2 to best match the observed sensitivities for hydrogen peroxide and methyl hydroperoxide in DC 3. Formic and acetic calibration functions were fit to the water vapor and sample flow results. Formic acid displays both a water <b>vapor</b> and <b>inlet</b> pressure dependence, whereas, acetic acid sensitivity was found to be independent of water <b>vapor</b> and <b>inlet</b> pressure within the range of conditions encountered in DC 3 and the laboratory. These laboratory calibrations were further evaluated by comparison to in-flight calibrations from the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) to confirm the reliability of the fits and laboratory methodology. The laboratory and field calibration work showed very good correspondence for hydrogen peroxide, methyl hydroperoxide, and acetic acid. However, the apparent formic acid sensitivity fits gave a factor of two greater sensitivity than observed in the FRAPPE formic acid field calibrations. Further comparison to ground and prior airborne measurements suggest the calibration problem lies in the FRAPPE field calibration and the laboratory work was valid for formic acid as it was for DC 3 and FRAPPE peroxides and FRAPPE acetic acid. Subsequently, the laboratory calibration fits were applied to quantify DC 3 formic and acetic acid. A DC 3 research flight (RF 03) case study is presented to illustrate formic and acetic acid behavior when air from a high biogenic source region with identifiable convective storm outflow was sampled. ...|$|R

The concurrent liquid–vapor two-phase flow field {{is divided into}} three zones: the thin liquid film flow on the sidewall, the condensate flow in the corners, and the vapor core flow in the center. The model takes into account the effects of capillary force induced by the free liquid film curvature variation, interfacial shear stress, interfacial thermal resistance, gravity, axial pressure gradient, and saturation temperatures. The axial variation of the cross-sectional average heat transfer coefficient of steam condensing inside an equilateral triangular channel is found to be substantially higher than that inside a round tube having the same hydraulic diameter, in particular in the entry region. This en-hancement is attributed to the extremely thin liquid film on the sidewall that results from the liquid flow toward the channel corners due to surface tension.

In this work, {{an investigation of the}} effect of heat flux, mass flux and <b>inlet</b> <b>vapor</b> qualities on the flow patterns and pressure drop for flow boiling of R 134 a in 0. 54 mm square parallel minichannels is reported. In particular, flow boiling experiments are conducted at flow rates between 0. 1 and 0. 51 g/s and heat fluxes from 0 to 36 kW/sq. m [...] The heat flux input among a set of four horizontal, parallel minichannels is individually varied and controlled in each test.

The refrigerant cycle was driven by a gear pump, liquid refrigerant flows from the gear pump, passes through an electrical pre-heater, evaporator and post-heater, thenÂ flow through water/glycol bath pre-condenser, condenser and post-condenser. Experimental data for pure R 410 A, R 410 A and lubricantÂ RL 32 H mixture pressure dropÂ in flow boiling is presented and analyzed in this paper. <b>Inlet</b> <b>vapor</b> quality was changing at 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 to 0. 8 with 0. 2 quality increase along the tube, mass fraction of lubricant was changing from 0 %, 1 %, 3 % to 5 %,Â and mass velocity of the pure and mixture varied from 100 to 700 kg s- 1 m- 2.

40|$|Water vapor {{condensation}} and {{two-phase flow}} appear in {{plate heat exchangers}} being used as condensers. Analysis of water phase change and flow dynamics is an important but complicated task due to large change in water physical/transport properties across the water liquid-vapor interface boundary. In particular, a singular-link behaviour in Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations is present due to the large step change in the density when computational simulation methods are applied. Conventional methods using ensemble averaged parameters such as void fraction are impossible {{to be applied to}} cases where high-resolution calculations and detailed analysis are required. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach is presented for analysis of water vapor condensation and two-phase flow in a channel relevant for plate heat exchanger parallel plates. The developed model is based on the governing equations which are directly solved for the entire single- and two-phase fields. The water phase change and two-phase flow are treated by employing a water liquid-phase fraction factor based on the total enthalpy in each computational cell. The factor is defined as the ratio of the total enthalpy differential to the latent heat of condensation. The density, viscosity and conductivity of the two-phase region are calculated and updated based on the calculated value of the liquid-phase fraction factor until a converged result is reached. It is revealed that, among others, the <b>inlet</b> <b>vapor</b> velocity has significant effects on the water phase change and two-phase flow in the channel, in terms of liquid-water fraction factor distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{laboratory}} scale experimental research {{was to investigate the}} application of integrated microwave irradiation and granular activated carbon adsorption for removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from emissions released from industrial processes and considered major pollutants of the environment. A stream containing 300 ppm toluene was supplied and passed through the granular activated carbon (GAC). The saturated adsorbent was placed in a quartz glass reactor and treated by microwave (MW) irradiation at heating frequency of 2450 MHz at different power levels. Adsorption capacity was evaluated through breakthrough curves and the residue analyzed by gas chromatography. Breakthrough results showed that the high relative humidity of the inlet gaseous stream could lead to decreased GAC adsorption capacity. We found that GAC could absorb microwave irradiation and dissipate heating energy increasing its temperature up to 600 Â°C in a short time mainly depending on the microwave power level. Our experimental results indicated that most of the toluene vapor passed over GAC was decomposed under 900 watt microwave irradiation after around 10 minutes. The addition of water <b>vapor</b> in the <b>inlet</b> stream slightly decreased pollutant removal rate over the GAC while the overall oxidation removal remain the same compared to stream with low content of water vapor. Adsorption isotherms showed that GAC surface area and porosity values increased slightly under microwave irradiation. We concluded that simultaneous application of GAC and microwave irradiation may be an effective approach for removing VOCs from gaseous stream...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWater vapor in {{a natural}} gas stream can result in line {{plugging}} due to hydrate formation, reduction of line capacity due to collection of free water in the line, and increased risk of damage to the pipeline due to the corrosive effects of water. Therefore, water vapor must be removed from natural gas to prevent hydrate formation and corrosion from condensed water. Gas dehydration {{is the process of}} removing water vapor from a gas stream to lower the temperature at which water will condense from the stream; this temperature is called the “dew point” of the gas. Molecular sieves are considered {{as one of the most}} important materials that are used as desiccant materials in industrial natural gas dehydration. This work shows a study of natural gas dehydration using 3 A molecular sieve as a type of solid desiccant materials, the scope of this work was to build up a pilot scale unit for a natural gas dehydration as simulation of actual existing plant for Egyptian Western Desert Gas Company (WDGC). The effect of different operating conditions (water vapor concentration and gas flow rate) on dehydration of natural gas was studied. The experimental setup consists of cylinder filled with 3 A molecular sieve to form a fixed bed, then pass through this bed natural gas with different water vapor concentration, The experimental setup is fitted with facilities to control bed pressure, flow rate, measure water vapor concentration and bed temperature, a gas heater was used to activate molecular sieve bed. Increasing water <b>vapor</b> concentration in <b>inlet</b> feed gas leads to a marked decrease in dehydration efficiency. As expected, a higher inlet flow rate of natural gas decrease dehydration efficiency. Increasing feed pressure leads to higher dehydration efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{demonstrate}} {{and evaluate the}} effectiveness of heat interception methods for use on a relevant cryogenic propulsion stage at a system level has been identified. Evolvable Cryogenics (eCryo) Structural Heat Intercept, Insulation and Vibration Evaluation Rig (SHIIVER) will be designed with vehicle specific geometries (SLS Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) as guidance) and will be subjected to simulated space environments. One method of reducing structure-born heat leak being investigated utilizes vapor-based heat interception. Vapor-based heat interception could potentially reduce heat leak into liquid hydrogen propulsion tanks, increasing potential mission length or payload capability. Due to the high number of unknowns associated with the heat transfer mechanism and integration of vapor-based heat interception on a realistic large-scale skirt design, a sub-scale investigation was developed. The sub-project effort is known as the Small-scale Laboratory Investigation of Cooling Enhancements (SLICE). The SLICE aims to study, design, and test sub-scale multiple attachments and flow configuration concepts for vapor-based heat interception of structural skirts. SLICE will focus on understanding the efficiency of the heat transfer mechanism to the boil-off hydrogen vapor by varying the fluid network designs and configurations. Various analyses were completed in MATLAB, Excel VBA, and COMSOL Multiphysics to understand the optimum flow pattern for heat transfer and fluid dynamics. Results from these analyses were used to design and fabricate test article subsections of a large forward skirt with vapor cooling applied. The SLICE testing is currently being performed to collect thermal mechanical performance data on multiple skirt heat removal designs while varying <b>inlet</b> <b>vapor</b> conditions necessary to intercept a specified amount of heat for a given system. Initial results suggest that applying vapor-cooling provides a 50 heat reduction in conductive heat transmission along the skirt to the tank. The information obtained by SLICE will be used by the SHIIVER engineering team to design and implement vapor-based heat removal technology into the SHIIVER forward skirt hardware design...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} vapor compression systems, electronic {{expansion valves}} (EXVs) {{are used for}} refrigerant flow control. Subcooled refrigerant enters the expansion device and is expanded to the evaporation pressure while the valve opening is modified to achieve the desired mass flowrate. The relationship between the inlet and outlet conditions, the opening, and the mass flowrate has been extensively studied, e. g. by Park et al. (2007) and appropriate empirical correlations have been developed. However, for certain operating conditions (e. g. low refrigerant charge) or applications that generally have two-phase inlet conditions (e. g. balancing valves used in a hybrid control scheme as proposed by Kim et al. (2008)), these correlations are not applicable, since even low <b>inlet</b> <b>vapor</b> fractions lead to a significant reduction of the valve mass flowrate at a given opening. This paper proposes a continuous correlation {{that can be used}} for both two-phase and subcooled valve inlet conditions. The benefit of the continuity is that there is a smooth transition between subcooled and two-phase inlet conditions, which is essential for control and simulation purposes. The new correlation employs the Buckingham-Pi theorem as proposed by Buckingham (1914). The selected dimensionless Pi-groups describe opening of the valve, subcooling, inlet and outlet pressures, driving pressure difference across the valve, inlet density, surface tension, and viscosity. The data that was used to determine the coefficients of the correlation was taken on a dedicated valve test stand, which was sized for the per-circuit capacity of a typical 5 -ton R 410 A heat pump and a 3 -ton R 404 A large room cooling system. The purpose of these tests was mainly to map the valves for the low pressure drops, high inlet qualities and large valve openings that occur when they are used as balancing valves in a hybrid control approach. Two commercially available valves of different rated capacity were tested. Due to the much higher valve capacity for subcooled inlet conditions, valve openings of less than 5 % occurred in that case. This led to an accuracy of the correlation for these points that is less than what typically can be found for correlations with subcooled inlet conditions in the open literature. However, for two-phase flow inlet conditions, the resulting RMS of 1. 0 g/s for the 8 -PI correlation is sufficiently small to use the approach for estimating the refrigerant mass flow and using the EXV as a virtual flow sensor. The limitations of this approach in practical applications, as well as possible applications in fault detection and diagnostics are shown for application as balancing valves within a 5 -ton R 410 A heat pump and a 3 -ton R 404 A large room cooling system...|$|R
40|$|Space {{agencies}} worldwide {{are being}} {{confronted with the}} challenges of more distant manned space missions, which will demand greater energy efficiency and reduced weight and volume. One method being considered to reduce the weight and volume is to replace present single-phase Thermal Control Systems (TCSs) with ones that rely on flow boiling and condensation. This transition will require {{a thorough understanding of}} the influence of reduced gravity on flow boiling and condensation, and the development of predictive tools for both. The primary {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the impact gravitational body force effects have on flow boiling heat transfer performance and critical heat flux (CHF). Two flow boiling investigations will be presented, where experimentation was conducted both on-ground and in microgravity conditions. ^ The terrestrial-based study explores the mechanism of flow boiling CHF for FC- 72 in a rectangular channel fitted along one side with a heated wall. The flow is supplied as a two-phase mixture and the channel is tested at different orientations relative to Earth 2 ̆ 7 s gravity. High-speed video imaging is used to identify the complex flow boiling CHF trigger mechanism for different orientations, mass velocities and inlet qualities. It is shown that orientation has a significant influence on CHF for low mass velocities and small inlet qualities, with the orientations surrounding horizontal flow with downward-facing heated wall causing stratification of the vapor towards the heated wall and yielding very small CHF values. High mass velocities cause appreciable diminution in the influence of orientation on CHF, which is evidenced by similar flow patterns and CHF trigger mechanism regardless of orientation. The Interfacial Lift-off Model is shown to predict the influence of orientation on CHF with good accuracy. Overall, this study points to the effectiveness of high mass velocities at combating buoyancy effects and helping produce CHF values insensitive to orientation. ^ It is also shown that the influence of orientation can be negated by simultaneously satisfying three separate criteria: overcoming the influence of gravity perpendicular to the heated wall, overcoming the influence of gravity parallel to the heated wall, and ensuring that the heated wall is sufficiently long to endure liquid contact. These criteria are combined to determine the minimum mass velocity required to negate gravity effects in both terrestrial and space applications. Exceeding this minimum is of paramount importance to space systems since it enables the implementation of the vast body of published CHF data, correlations and models developed from terrestrial studies for design of thermal management systems for space applications. ^ This study also investigates the interfacial phenomena preceding the occurrence of CHF for flow boiling with a finite <b>inlet</b> <b>vapor</b> void. Temporal records of the heated wall temperatures are used to track the complex transient response of the heated wall, and identify differences between temperature excursions associated with momentary localized dryout and those with true CHF. It is shown that the flow enters the channel fully separated, with a liquid layer sheathing all four channel walls surrounding a central vapor core. At high heat fluxes, a wavy vapor layer begins to form beneath the liquid layer adjacent to the heated wall, and cooling is provided mostly though wetting fronts associated with the wave troughs in accordance with the Interfacial Lift-off Model. However, depending on mass velocity, inlet quality and flow orientation, conditions may arise that cause breakup of the heated wall liquid layer into ligaments that are entrained in the vapor core. This phenomenon causes localized dryout and wall temperature excursions at heat fluxes well below CHF, but the wall is able to recover from these excursions by a combination of reattachment of ligaments with the heated wall and lateral heat conduction within the wall itself. Recommendations are made concerning construction of the heated wall and CHF detection in pursuit of reliable CHF data. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
