40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the role}} of metaphors in an electronic communication arena based on the data collected in wide-ranging research, {{carried out by the}} GIRCOM research group, into sociability in a Universitat Oberta de Catalunya <b>virtual</b> <b>forum.</b> Initially, the analysis observed how metaphors for the "new" media were used as a resource by participants in the forum to structure an emergent experience and field of meaning. Indeed, the use of these metaphors in certain messages on the forum, and their use by participants interviewed, allowed for the confirmation of an old hypothesis: metaphors served (the students) to be able to understand one thing in terms of another. Subsequently, the analysis, (taking into account that {{in the same way that}} a metaphor was able to aid understanding of a new concept in terms of another, it was also able to hide or ignore other possible conceptions), led us to suspect that the different metaphors chosen by the participants responded to the various interests in the social space generated in the <b>virtual</b> <b>forum.</b> The hypothesis proposed would require further research for its verification, but we believe the "elective affinity" between social position and the field of semantics configured by the metaphors that the social agents that occupy these positions use to talk about the emergent social space to be significant...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In 2003, an ICRC-SFD Ponseti {{program was}} {{introduced}} in southern Vietnam. Additional programs were introduced by the Prosthetics Outreach Foundation and independently by physicians trained at our center. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the impact, progress and challenges facing Ponseti practitioners and patientsâ family members in Vietnam. In addition, web-conferencing (Ponseti <b>Virtual</b> <b>Forum)</b> for continued medical education in the method was also assessed. Methods: Multiple questionnaires were developed to conduct face-to-face practitioner interviews, focus group interviews, and parental interviews. Observation was done at multiple site clinics to determine or confirm additional challenges faced by practitioners. Web conferencing was introduced to sites in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang City. Results: The number of clubfoot patients treated with the Ponseti method has increased over time with approximately 1, 252 infants treated between 2003 and 2010. Specific challenges were identified relating to communication, networking, distance and transportation, and finances for both practitioners and parents. The PVF was not only found to facilitate rapid, relevant dissemination of medical knowledge â thus increasing physician and patient satisfaction â but it may also be found to act as an interface in which medical culture, insight, and compassion are shared benefiting all <b>virtual</b> <b>forum</b> participants. Conclusion: The identified progress and challenges mirrored that of similar studies done in other countries with several factors affecting progress. Focusing on improving communication channels and networking while working with the ministry of health may improve the facilitation of the Ponseti method in Vietnam. Further implementation and evaluation of the PVF may act as a guide for current and future programs in Vietnam or other countries...|$|E

A questão investigada é: Como a interação no fórum virtual pode alavancar a aprendizagem da escrita de textos acadêmicos e promover a construção de uma consciência deontológica inerente a essa atividade? Os resultados mostraram que, no ambiente virtual, os alunos discutiram suas dificuldades relativas à escrita acadêmica e se descobriram autores de artigos científicos e projetos de pesquisa, evitando a apropriação indevida de ideias alheias e estabelecendo relações cooperativas e respeitosas para com as dificuldades de escrita do outro.
