50|$|The first Dominator, the Model 7, had a 497 cc {{parallel}} twin engine with iron cylinders and cylinder {{head and a}} Lucas K2F magneto. The crankshaft was of 360-degree layout with two main bearings. A single camshaft {{at the front of}} the engine was driven by gears and chain. The rocker box was integral with the head, so there were fewer gasket faces to leak and less <b>valve</b> <b>noise.</b> The engine was a long stroke design with 66.0 x 72.6 mm bore and stroke and mild tuning, resulting in more torque low down. For the first few years a plunger frame was used, but in 1953 the Model 7 was upgraded with a single downtube swinging arm frame, 19-inch front wheel and 'pear shaped' silencers, still known as a Model 7.The Model 7 continued in production through to 1955 and was often used with a sidecar, which could not be fitted to the later Featherbed frame Dominators.|$|E

It was fairly advanced for its era, having an aluminum head and sump, five main bearings, and a reasonably high compression ratio, but was sometimes criticized for having a noisy valve train.

40|$|BackgroundATS Medical, Inc, {{developed}} a mechanical heart valve {{that has been}} in use since 1992. In this article, we present the results of 15 years of follow-up of patients who have undergone ATS heart valve replacement at our hospital. Methods and ResultsWe performed ATS heart valve replacements on 231 patients between September 1993 and March 2008. Our operative mortality rate for the study period was 2. 2 %. The survival for postoperative thromboembolic events was 0. 29 %/pt-y for aortic valve replacement, 0. 48 %/pt-y for mitral, 0. 80 %/pt-y for double valve replacement, and overall 0. 44 %/pt-y. The survival after bleeding events was 0. 29 %/pt-y for aortic valve replacement, 0. 16 %/pt-y for mitral, 0 %/pt-y for double valve replacement, and overall 0. 19 %/pt-y. Patient–prosthesis mismatch, as determined by echocardiography, was found in 83. 3 % of patients at 19 mm, but other sizes showed good valve function. Prosthetic <b>valve</b> <b>noise</b> was undetectable in 92. 8 % of patients, and quality of life was excellent. ConclusionsFew prosthetic valve–related complications were seen with ATS heart valve replacements in this study, and the follow-up results were favorable. The international normalized ratio was maintained in the range 1. 6 to 2. 0 in patients with aortic valve replacement in sinus rhythm. Not only bleeding events, seen at a rate of 0. 19 %/pt-y, but also thromboembolic events, at 0. 44 %/pt-y, were low when compared with conventional mechanical valves. Prosthetic <b>valve</b> <b>noise</b> is low, and this appears to be an excellent mechanical valve from the quality of life standpoint.

40|$|Flow {{control valves}} may {{experience}} localized cavitation {{when the local}} static pressure drops to the liquid vapor pressure. Localized damage to the valve and surrounding area can occur when the vapor cavity collapses. Valve designs that reduce cavitation are based on empirical evidence and accumulated experience, {{but there are still}} considerable cavitation problems in industry. Valve designers may use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate cavitation in flow control valves, but model validation is challenging because there are limited data of local cavitation from the valve surface. Typically, the intensity of cavitation in a control valve is inferred from measurements of observable side effects of cavitation such as <b>valve</b> <b>noise,</b> vibration, or damage to the valve assembly. Such an indirect approach to characterizing cavitation yields little information about the location, degree, and extent of the cavitation flow field {{that can be used in}} CFD validation studies. This study uses 3 D X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to visualize cavitation from a 5. 1 cm diameter butterfly valve and compares the resulting vapor cloud to that predicted by CFD simulations. Qualitative comparisons reveal that the resulting cavitation structures are captured by the simulations when a small amount of non-condensable gas is introduced into the fluid and the simulations are completed in a transient mode...|$|E

For special low-noise audio valves, the frequency at which 1/f noise takes over is reduced as far as possible, maybe to something like a kilohertz.

As a consequence, the performance of measurement systems will affect the profitability of any business. In the Oil and Gas Industry measurement systems are used for fiscal and custody transfer purposes, for process plant operations and for plant efficiency monitoring.

This paper highlights the implications of measurement uncertainties on LNG product allocations and how, through a study of these uncertainties and the implementation of a Measurement Upgrade Enhancement Project, the final Allocation Uncertainty was more than halved. The study addressed each of the metering elements associated with the allocation process and identified which of these had the greatest impact (and/ or required attention). The measurement upgrade addressed issues affecting key meter performance such as flow profile effects and <b>valve</b> <b>noise</b> with respect to ultrasonic measurement. A major factor in the success of the project was the use of a Measurement Exposure Model (MEM) which determined the measurement uncertainties associated with key metering points, and the impact they had on the final LNG Product Allocation.

40|$|A stacked-disc {{structure}} {{is comprised of}} a stack of annular discs (13) scalloped along the outer edge to provide lobes (13 a) and etched on one side to provide lands (13 a). A web (13 d) is retained in the lobes to strengthen the discs {{so that they will}} not collapse due to high fluid pressure. The stack of discs is retained by a housing (10) having a fluted interior wall to retain the ends of the lobes. End plates (11 and 12) secure the stack of discs with a spacer (14) at one end having lands (14 a) on lobes which match the lobes of the stacked discs to allow fluid to flow into, or out of, the spaces between the lobes of the stacked discs. The spaces between the lands on the etched discs provide passages for fluid flow into or out of the hollow core of the stack. The height of the lands (i. e., depth of the etch) determines the size of the smallest particle that will be permitted to flow through. The stacked-disc structure may be connected to the inlet of a valve, or be incorporated into the valve housing on the inlet side of the valve seat to assure substantially constant fluid velocity, and thereby reduce <b>valve</b> <b>noise</b> when the valve is operated...|$|E
40|$|The Small Hot Jet Acoustic Rig (SHJAR), {{located in}} the Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL) at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, was {{commissioned}} in 2001 to test jet noise reduction concepts at low technology readiness levels (TRL 1 - 3) and develop advanced measurement techniques. The first series of tests on the SHJAR were designed to prove its capabilities and establish {{the quality of the}} jet noise data produced. Towards this goal, a methodology was employed dividing all noise sources into three categories: background noise, jet noise, and rig noise. Background noise was directly measured. Jet noise and rig noise were separated by using the distance and velocity scaling properties of jet noise. Effectively, any noise source that did not follow these rules of jet noise was labeled as rig noise. This method led to the identification of a high frequency noise source related to the Reynolds number. Experiments using boundary layer treatment and hot wire probes documented this noise source and its removal, allowing clean testing of low Reynolds number jets.

Thus, regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed in this study to localize and locate leaks in water pipelines using noise loggers.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of acoustic excitation studies is {{to gain a}} high level of control over processes governing free shear flow characteristics. The basic premise is that inherent instability waves in free shear flows are excitable by external perturbations with frequencies close to the natural instability frequency of the flow. An 8. 89 cm diameter axisymmetric jet was acoustically excited by four loudspeakers placed upstream of the nozzle exit. Measurements were made at Mach numbers of 0. 435 and 0. 2. A single hot-wire probe was used to obtain turbulence levels at the nozzle exit and along the centerline, and a microphone at the nozzle exit was used to study the resonance characteristics of the rig. A Pitot probe was stationed at X/D = 9 downstream along the nozzle axis to study the Strouhal number dependence and to look at threshold levels for excitation. The test results were obtained after a preliminary evaluation and facility improvement. Excitation at the correct Strouhal number enhanced mixing significantly. The effects were most prominent in the Strouhal number range between 0. 4 and 1. 0. The effects of acoustic excitation also depend considerably on the sound pressure level at the nozzle exit and were more pronounced at higher sound levels. Other factors which influenced the excitability were <b>valve</b> <b>noise,</b> exit turbulence levels, extraneous noise, and a flanged nozzle.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} flowmeters {{are provided}} with a calibration certificate, based on stationary flow conditions and {{do not include the}} impact of installation effects like swirl, a-symmetry, and piping and flow dynamics. Flow pulsations, <b>valve</b> <b>noise</b> and mechanical pipe vibrations can have a considerable impact on flowmeter accuracy in gas as well as in liquid flows. International standards like ISO, AGA and API, available for several flowmeter principles, sometimes refer to swirl, flow and piping dynamic effects, though they do not specify allowable amplitudes or frequencies. Investigations on the impact of piping and flow dynamics on differential pressure, turbine, vortex and Coriolis flowmeters have been published at several occasions. Ultrasonic noise of control valves is well known as a potential source of errors on ultrasonic flowmeters. The impact of mechanical pipe vibrations on vortex and Coriolis flowmeters can result in large errors if vibrations occur in the operating range of the flowmeter. Investigations on several commercially available flowmeters of this type have reported these phenomena for vortex and Coriolis flow meters. Several manufacturers, operating companies and engineering contractors have expressed their interest in developing a well-defined test for this type of applications. An absolute criterion for allowable pulsations or vibrations can hardly be defined as the impact on flowmeters differs for each flow metering principle and/or size. Therefore individual criteria should be developed for each type of flowmeter and its application.

40|$|This {{portion of}} the report {{documents}} {{the results of an}} experimental program, which focused on pulsed blowing from the trailing edge of a CCW. The main objective {{of this study was to}} assess whether pulsed blowing resulted in more, less, or the same amount of radiated noise to the farfield. Results show that a reduction in far-field noise of up to 5 dB is measured when pulse flow is compared to steady flow for an equivalent lift configuration. This reduction is in the spectral region associated with the trailing edge jet noise. This result is due to the unique advantage that pulsed flow has over steady flow. For a range of frequencies, more lift is experienced with the same mass flow as the steady case. Thus, for an equivalent lift and slot height, the pulsed system can operate at lower jet velocities, and hence lower jet noise. At low frequencies (below 1 kHz), the pulsed flow configuration generated more noise in the farfield. This is most likely due to the pulsing mechanism itself. Since the high pressure air feeding the pulsing mechanism was first passed through a high performance muffler, it is likely that this increase in not due to upstream <b>valve</b> <b>noise.</b> Most likely, the impulsive component of the air that periodically fills the plenum causes a broadband source that reaches the farfield. Although the benefit of a pulse trailing edge jet is evident from a mass flow usage and jet noise perspective, attention should be paid towards the design of a viable pulsing system. Future research program in this area should concentrate on the development of a "quiet" pulsing device...|$|E

The devices studied were sputter deposited NiFe/Cu/NiFe/FeMn spin valves with D R/R ∼ 4 %. Static measurements demonstrated a strong dependence of the magnetic coupling and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) ratio on the thickness and quality of the Cu spacer layer and the bottom NiFe layer (free layer). These parameters were varied to determine how the <b>noise</b> in spin <b>valve</b> sensors would be affected.

The noise was minimized for spin valves operating with parallel anisotropy axes and an applied field aligned along the hard axis of magnetization. Dynamic fields were used to measure the Barkhausen noise in the sense layer of the spin valve. The low frequency noise in the presence of dynamic fields was much greater than the 1 /f noise background. Clustering of Barkhausen jumps was used to explain the observed dependence of the noise power on the magnitude and frequency of the applied field.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} decade, {{deployment}} of high-pressure direct injection systems in petrol engines has dramatically increased, mainly {{due to the}} advantages for fuel economy. At {{the heart of a}} gasoline direct injection system lies the high-pressure fuel pump, which pressurizes the petrol to more than 30 times compared to that of conventional port fuel injected engines. The high-pressure system is driven mechanically by the cam-shaft, and results in generation of inherent undesirable noise which renders the sound quality of the traditionally-silent petrol engine similar to that of a common-rail diesel engine. This paper gives a comprehensive review of the measures developed to mitigate the inherent noise of the high-pressure direct injection system. For the high-pressure pump, Design of Experiments was employed to enable the improvement of the mechanical design attributes of the outlet valve. Model-based control design and advanced control algorithms were developed and deployed on the real-time controller to reduce the noise of the solenoid valve which controls the flow through the pump, hence reducing the inlet <b>valve's</b> ticking <b>noise.</b> The high-pressure fuel is delivered from the pump to the combustion chambers via the high-pressure fuel rail and injectors: when the latter are energized, they induce significant structure-borne vibration in the engine block which in turn results in undesirable noise: this was mitigated by developing an isolation system for the fuel rail and a suspension mounting scheme for the fuel injectors. Our paper presents the details and merits of these component- and system-level developments, each of which resulted in noise reductions of 2 - 6 dB(A) at the various characteristic frequency bands of the gasoline direction injection system during engine idling condition...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{acoustic}} effects of horizontal airwater flow through an orifice are investigated experimentally. Single phase flow (air) and two-phase flow (air and water) tests are performed for {{two sets of}} orifices. One set of straight edged and one set of upstream rounded orifices. For each set, the diameters of the orifices were 2, 5, and 10 mm, with a thickness of 5 mm. The two-phase flow is generated by injecting water {{at a rate of}} 0 to 40 g/s to air in a pipe with diameter of 25 mm. The air rate is fixed in the range from 5. 8 to 14 g/s, where the upstream pressure varies from 1. 5 to 4 bar at ambient temperature. Unsteady pressure fluctuations are recorded at two upstream and two downstream position. The <b>valve</b> <b>noise</b> standard NEN-EN-IEC for dry gas is assessed by means of experimental data in dry conditions at fixed air mass flow rate. Predictions of sound power spectra by means of standard NEN-EN-IEC (60534 - 8 - 3, 2011) are found to be more accurate compared to those obtained following Reethof & Ward (1986), also in conditions of a choked orifice. For the multiphase case, the majority of the conditions are visually recognized as stratified and stratified-wavy with slugs arising at water mass flow rate larger than 23. 6 g/s. The slug frequency lies between 0. 6 and 1. 1 Hz. For a fixed gas rate, at increasing liquid rate, the efficiency (ratio of acoustic power to flow energy) at the downstream position initially decreases while rapidly increasing at higher liquid rates, even discounting the increased total mass flow rate. The frequency spectrum changes significantly by introducing liquid, increasing the low frequency energy content. A peak at Sr ~ 0. 3 remains but likely radial modes are excited in some of the conditions. The influence of the edge rounding is minimal and changes effective the contraction ratio of the effective choke area...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level <b>valve</b> <b>noise</b> is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed.

An overview of the noise sources associated with a centrifugal air compressor will be discussed along with the noise attenuation techniques. Moreover, proper selection and installation of accessory hardware associated with the compressor installation will be addressed, since the accessory hardware can often generate higher noise levels than the compressor if not selected and installed correctly. Guidelines for valve sizing, proper lagging of piping and <b>valves</b> for <b>noise</b> reduction, drain line noise attenuation, inlet silencer selection, discharge silencer selection and silencer installation will also be explored. The refining, petrochemical, oil and gas, automotive, steel, electronic and industrial applications utilize centrifugal air compressors to provide utility air to support manufacturing their processes. They are often purchased to meet a specified noise level based on customer site requirements. Compressors that meet the noise requirement without using a complete sound enclosure are preferred. This is due to both the high cost associated with sound enclosures and because sound enclosures make access to the compressor difficult for maintenance. Figure 1 shows a typical centrifugal air compressor package for a refinery application. Proper site development is important for reduced noise levels while the equipment is in operation. Outdoor installations do not exactly replicate a Free Field noise environment; indoor installations are often reverberant in nature because of building construction. In any case, when the compressor is in operation, the noise level measured with a sound level meter is often higher than the actual compressor generated noise. This paper will provide guidelines on how to achieve compressor installation noise objectives...|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay between}} current and {{magnetization}} fluctuations and dissipation in layered-ferromagnetic-normal-metal nanostructures is investigated. We use scattering theory and magnetoelectronic circuit theory to calculate charge and spin-current fluctuations. Via the spin-transfer torque, spin-current noise causes a significant enhancement of magnetization fluctuations. A special {{focus is on}} spin valves in {{which one of the}} ferromagnets is pinned. We find that the magnetization noise and damping are tensors that depend on the magnetic configuration. For symmetric spin valves in which both layers fluctuate, dynamic cross-talk between the layers becomes important, causing a possibly large difference in noise level between the parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations. Due to giant magnetoresistance (GMR), the magnetization fluctuations in spin <b>valves</b> induce resistance <b>noise,</b> which is identified as a prominent source of electric noise at relatively high current densities. The resistance noise is shown to vary considerably with the magnetic configuration, partly due to the dependence of the angular GMR. The contribution from spin-current fluctuations to the resistance noise is shown to be significant. Resistance noise is an experimentally accessible quantity that can be measured to verify our results. Kavli Institute of NanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation is a harmful {{phenomenon}} {{for control}} <b>valves.</b> Starting from <b>noise</b> and vibration, cavitation can bring erosion and pitting of mechanical parts. Experimental costs for cavitation tests are high, not even considering the difficulties to test large-sized valves. For those reasons a CFD analysis {{could be an}} attractive solution to predict cavitation. However, a reliable numerical prediction of cavitation inception is hard to achieve and the computational cost of complex multi-phase models, necessary for a correct description of this phenomenon, is often very high. The purpose {{of this research is}} to overcome those difficulties by using a single-phase model to predict the onset of cavitation, in terms of the incipient cavitation index introduced in several technical standards. A method, based on the generalized pressure criterion reported in previous works, is applied to particularly complex control devices, namely the Cage Ball control valves, in which perforated plates are inserted to increase the energy dissipation with respect to a traditional Ball valve. Numerical results are compared with our own experimental data of acceleration induced by cavitation vibrations, showing good agreement. The final result is a simple and reliable method, with low computational cost, to evaluate the incipient cavitation index for control valves...|$|R
40|$|In the U. S. {{natural gas}} is {{distributed}} through {{more than one million}} miles of high-pressure transmission pipelines. If all leaks and infringements could be detected quickly, it would enhance safety and U. S. energy security. Only low frequency acoustic waves appear to be detectable over distances up to 60 km where pipeline shut-off valves provide access {{to the inside of the}} pipeline. This paper describes a Portable Acoustic Monitoring Package (PAMP) developed to record and identify acoustic signals characteristic of: leaks, pump <b>noise,</b> <b>valve</b> and flow metering noise, third party infringement, manual pipeline water and gas blow-off, etc. This PAMP consists of a stainless steel 1 / 2 inch NPT plumbing tree rated for use on 1000 psi pipelines. Its instrumentation is designed to measure acoustic waves over the entire frequency range from zero to 16, 000 Hz by means of four instruments: (1) microphone, (2) 3 -inch water full range differential pressure transducer with 0. 1 % of range sensitivity, (3) a novel 3 inch to 100 inch water range amplifier, using an accumulator with needle valve and (4) a line-pressure transducer. The weight of the PAMP complete with all accessories is 36 pounds. This includes a remote control battery/switch box assembly on a 25 -foot extension chord, a laptop data acquisition computer on a field table and a sun shield...|$|R
