50|$|On 20 January 1971, the {{organizer}} of the Frankfurt Motor Show, the Association of the German Automobile Industry (<b>Verband</b> <b>der</b> Deutschen <b>Automobilindustrie</b> - VDA) canceled the show scheduled to be held the following September. According to the President of the Association, Dr. Johann Heinrich von Brunn, this was because the automobile industry needed to take cost-saving measures to counteract the high costs facing it. The cost of the exhibition - almost DM 100 million - {{was considered to be}} excessive in comparison to the business benefits. For the Frankfurt-based fair and exhibition company, Messe Frankfurt, cancellation would have meant a loss of at least DM 1.5 to 2 million in revenues. In mid-March 1971, Messe Frankfurt announced that a new event - Automechanika 71 - would be held instead of the Motor Show. The initiative for this came from the associations of the motor-vehicle and filling station and garage trades that still wanted to present their products. Manufacturers of automotive parts account for around 90 percent of exhibitors at the Frankfurt Motor Show.|$|R

Therefore, it is limited to representations by parametric polynomials, but this covers {{the great majority of}} free-form CAD systems. It includes Bézier, B-Spline and Coons tensor product types of surfaces and corresponding curves. The VDA-FS specification is released in the German Industrial Standard DIN 66301.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Horst Eckard {{founded the}} company Eckard Design in Groß-Zimmern near Darmstadt. In {{the same year}} as the company was founded, the first branch office was opened in Cologne. A year later, the head office was moved to Fulda, and the company {{developed}} motor vehicles and production plants. Prototypes have also been constructed since 1986. The company's international activities began in 1987, with the opening of a branch office in Martorell (Barcelona) in Spain. The company's Rechtsform was changed in 1992, when it became a Aktiengesellschaft and the name Edag Engineering + Design AG came into being. In 1998, EDAG was the first automotive service provider to be admitted to the <b>Verband</b> <b>der</b> <b>Automobilindustrie</b> (Association of the German Automotive Industry). In 2004, FFT Flexible Fertigungstechnik GmbH & Co. KG, which is today called FFT Produktionssysteme GmbH & Co. KG, was integrated into the company. In February 2006, Lutz Helmig, owner of Aton GmbH and founder of the Helios-Kliniken, purchased EDAG from the nine founding families. In 2007, personnel service provider ED Work GmbH & Co.

50|$|The term ISIR (initial sample {{inspection}} report) {{is being used}} by German companies like VW and BMW. ISIR form is standardized by <b>Verband</b> <b>der</b> <b>Automobilindustrie</b> e. V., short VDA, a German interest group of the German automobile industry, both automobile manufacturers and automobile component suppliers. The term is also used by some other companies like Hyundai and Kia. In fact ISIR is like the Warrant and Inspection Report of PPAP document package. PPAP document package includes some other document such as PFMEA, control plan, drawing, MSA, capability data etc. Besides ISIR document, other documents like that of PPAP is normally required by VW and Hyundai for release of a product and process. The PPAP is like the older ISIR plus a lot more, unless your customer has a specific requirement for using their ISIR within their system. ISIR is {{a summary of the}} initial sample being presented at what ever state. The PSW is supported and validated by the ISIR. This does not mean the product being presented is under serial conditions but just states with evidence the current status.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{so-called}} Electronic Throttle Control {{unit was}} a big step towards reducing important parameters like fuel consumption or exhaust emmission. Due to its safety-criticality, a dependability study was initiated by the manufacturer Siemens Automotive. As the most important result, values could be stated for the quantitative estimation of the safety-critical and the availability-relevant cases. The study {{was based on the}} existing safety concept, but after this study, a slightly changed system architecture of the ECU was proposed to VDA (<b>Verband</b> <b>der</b> <b>Automobilindustrie),</b> which enhances availability and safety of the ECU significantly, at about the same cost. For this study, a new kind of Markov evaluation method was used, called TEFT (Time-Extended Fault Trees). This was necessary to deal with concepts like multiple faults, faulty states, and time. In this paper, the questions raised by the Electronic Throttle Control system are described, together with our way to solve these problems...|$|E
