I must apologize for not writing sooner but I have been very busy. Since coming up here to Dutch Harbor I have received some cigarettes which you sent me. Let me thank you right now for thinking of me. I must admit that I never kept in touch with the Bryant Service Club but I have moved around quite a bit since coming in service. There isn’t much I can tell you about this place for we are subject to censorship. I am going on my forth month up here and it isn’t so bad. We have bowling alleys, gym, and movies up here. Hence we are really living. I write often to my ex roommate Larry Barbeau, he is still in Virginia. I was glad to hear Ben Scuda was found alive. I knew him very well. Often I think of the swell times I had back at Bryant and wished that I was there once again. I think of all the friends I made there and wonder where they are. I have no idea when I will get back to the states again. Most likely not for a long time. We must all have faith and know that <b>victory</b> <b>will</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>ours.</b> Please remember me to the Faculty and to everyone else. I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> anxious to hear form you in the near future. Until we meet again Yours trulyRichard C. Walrath Richard C. Walrath SK 3 /cCo. A Pet. 37 th Spec.

[...] "Though you refuse a commission from me, I am so convinced {{that you are}} in heart one of us that I will take you into my confidence and tell you something known to only half a dozen trusted individuals here. You rightly say that if we have strength we must show it to the country. That is what we are now about to do. A cavalry force has been sent against us and we shall engage it before two days are over. As far as I know, the forces will be pretty evenly balanced, though our enemies will, of course, be better armed. We shall choose our own ground; and, should they attack us tired with a long march, or if there should be any disaffection amongst them, the <b>victory</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ours,</b> and after that every Blanco sword in the Banda will be unsheathed in our cause. I need not repeat to you that in the hour of my triumph, if it ever comes, I shall not forget my debt to you; my wish is to bind you, body and heart, to this Oriental country. It is, however, possible that I may suffer defeat, and if in two days' time we are all scattered to the winds, let me advise you what to do. Do not attempt to return immediately to Montevideo, as that might be dangerous. Make your way by Minas to the southern coast; and when you reach the department of Rocha, inquire for the little settlement of Lomas de Rocha, a village three leagues west of the lake. You will find there a storekeeper, one Florentino Blanco--a Blanco in heart as well. Tell him I sent you to him, and ask him to procure you an English passport from the capital; after which it will be safe for you to travel to Montevideo. Should you ever be identified as a follower of mine, you can invent some story to account for your presence in my force. When I remember that botanical lecture you once delivered, also some other matters, I am convinced that you are not devoid of imagination." ...|$|E

Heroically defending the people, the 5 charged gunfire with bare fists and sticks. We vow this assassination will be the costliest mistake the capitalists have ever made, and the turning point of class struggle in the U.S.The CWP 5 were among the strongest leaders of their times. Their death marked an end to capitalist stabilization (1950s-1970s) when American workers suffered untold misery, yet as a whole remained dormant for lack of its own leaders. In 1980 the deepest capitalist crisis began. The working class was awakening. The CWP 5 lived and died for all workers, minorities, and poor; for a world where exploitation and oppression will be eliminated, and all mankind freed; for the noble goal of communism. Their deaths, a tremendous loss to the CWP and to their families, are a clarion call to the U.S. people to fight for the workers' rule. In their footsteps waves of revolutionaries will rise and join our ranks.We will overthrow the rule of the monopoly capitalist class! <b>Victory</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ours!</b> November 3, 1980 Central Committee, CWP, USAFIGHT FOR REVOLUTIONARY SOCIALISM AND WORKERS RULE."The body of Sandi Smith, the only black victim, was returned to her hometown in South Carolina at her family's request.|$|E
