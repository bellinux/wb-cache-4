Sophisticated segmentation algorithms, <b>vessel</b> <b>analysis</b> tools based on a centerline approach, and automatic lumen boundary definition are emerging techniques; bone removal with thresholding or subtraction algorithms has been introduced. These techniques increasingly provide a quality of <b>vessel</b> <b>analysis</b> comparable to that achieved with intraarterial three-dimensional rotational angiography.

40|$|Purpose: Carotid artery {{stenosis}} quantification {{is still}} considered a leading parameter {{in the choice of}} the therapeutic option. Our purpose was to asses the concordance between radiologist and a semi-automatic computer software in the stenosis quantification of carotid artery studied by using a Multi-Detector-Row CT angiography (MDCTA). Methods and material: 45 patients studied by using a 40 -detector row CT scanner were retrospectively analyzed. Carotid artery stenosis was quantified by one high experienced radiologist in <b>vessel</b> <b>analysis</b> and by using a dedicated software. Carotid artery stenosis was calculated according to the ECST method. Bland-Altman statistics was used to measure the inter- and intra-concordance between radiologist and software and correlation coefficient between measures were performed by using nonparametric Spearmann correlation statistic. A p value < 0. 05 was considered to mean statistical significance. Results: A strength correlation according to linear regression (correlation Spearman' ρ coefficient = 0. 975; p < 0. 0001) between radiologist and software of <b>vessel</b> <b>analysis</b> was observed. Between first and second stenosis of carotid artery quantification performed by radiologist and software of <b>vessel</b> <b>analysis</b> we observed a Spearman' ρ coefficient = 0. 943 (p < 0. 0001) and a Spearman' ρ coefficient = 0. 9879; (p < 0. 0001) respectively.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of vocal folds (VF) diseases is error- prone {{due to the}} large variety of diseases that can affect them. VF lesions can be divided in nodular, e. g. nodules, polyps and cysts, and diffuse, e. g. hyperplastic laryngitis and carcinoma. By endoscopic examination, the clinician traditionally evaluates the presence of macroscopic formations and mucosal vessels alteration. Endoscopic narrow-band imaging (NBI) has recently started to be employed since it provides enhanced vessels contrast as compared to classical white-light endoscopy. This work presents a preliminary study {{on the development of}} an automatic diagnostic tool based on the assessment of vocal cords symmetry in NBI images. The objective is to identify possible protruding mass lesions on which subsequent <b>vessels</b> <b>analysis</b> may be performed. The method proposed here is based on the segmentation of the glottal area (GA) from the endoscopic images, based on which {{the right and the left}} portions of the vocal folds are detected and analyzed for the detection of protruding areas. The obtained information is then used to classify the VF edges as healthy or pathological. Results from the analysis of 22 endoscopic NBI images demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust and effective, providing a 100 % success rate in the classification of VF edges as healthy or pathological. Such results support the investment in further research to expand and improve the algorithm presented here, potentially with the addition of <b>vessels</b> <b>analysis</b> to determine the pathological classification of detected protruding areas...|$|R

Hence the aim of this prospective non-interventional study was to validate the hypothesis that right IJV diameter is greater than those of left IJV and to determine the cross-sectional area of the IJVs using computed tomography (CT) -scans and original automatic software. METHODS: All consecutive adult outpatients who underwent a thoracic contrast-enhanced (TCE) helical CT-scan during a 5 -month period were included. To determine diameter and cross sectional area of the IJVs, we used Advanced <b>Vessel</b> <b>Analysis</b> software integrated in a CT-scan (Advanced <b>Vessel</b> <b>Analysis</b> on Advantage Workstation Windows 4. 2; General Electrics) allowing automatic segmentation of vessels and calculation of their diameters and cross-sectional areas. RESULTS: A total of 360 TCE CT-scans was performed; 170 were excluded from the analysis. On the remaining 190 CT scans, the diameter and cross-sectional area of the right IJV were significantly greater than those of the left IJV (17 +/- 5 mm [median: 17 mm, range: 13 to 20 mm] vs. 14 +/- 5 mm [median: 13 mm, range: 10 to 16 mm], P < 0. 001; and 181 +/- 111 mm 2 [median: 160 mm 2, range: 108 to 235 mm 2] vs. 120 +/- 81 mm 2 [median: 102 mm 2, range: 63 to 168 mm 2], P < 0. 001, respectively).
