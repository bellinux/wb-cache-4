5|$|The N1s {{compared}} favourably {{with the}} Nclass, although the type showed little improvement in performance. More {{of the class}} were built {{when it became clear}} that the type's smaller cylinders provided greater route availability. A total of six engines were built. The N1class was primarily used on the Eastern section of the Southern Railway network, and used by the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) from 1948. The N1s gave <b>valuable</b> <b>service</b> until they were withdrawn in 1962. None were preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile than before. The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide <b>valuable</b> <b>service</b> to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.|$|E
