40|$|We discuss an {{alternative}} to traditional paradigms under which high-level accelerator applications are developed. In this revised view, {{emphasis is placed on}} use of pre-existing tools, speed of development, accessibility to the user, and ease of modification, rather than traditional fiduciary parameters such as generality, robustness, security, and completeness. Applications developed under this paradigm can be easily generated, readily modified, and fully accessible to users with a minimum of training and installation or maintenance overhead. A sample application is described. Traditional Paradigms High-level accelerator applications have been generated under numerous organizational models, most of which are well described by a “client/vendor” relationship. In this paradigm, a “client ” (typically, an intended user of the high level application) contracts with a “vendor ” (typically, a software organization of some description) to provide an application that meets (nominally) clearly defined requirements. The client provides the requirements, and the vendor is more or less free to construct the application in any fashion consistent with the defined criteria. In this paradigm, the user is insulated from the process of software generation. For this reason, <b>vendors</b> <b>place</b> considerable emphasis on generality, robustness, security, and completeness as key features of the product. Such an outlook helps ensure that all client requirements- stated, inferred, or otherwise perceived- are met. This bias also tends to fuel enthusiasm for the use of object-orient programming tools and techniques in application development. Such methods, with their implementations of polymorphism and inheritance, enable vendors to write general and robust applications with inherently secure structures that allow clients access to certain defined “public ” information, but protect other information in “private ” data structures available to the software developer only. Implementation time and fault sensitivities are significantly reduced through such methods. It is for vendors, therefore, a most cost-effective paradig...|$|R
5000|$|Virgin boy {{eggs are}} widely {{accepted}} as a time-honored tradition of the city, rather than considered taboo like most other cultures. Boy egg vendors go to elementary schools {{in the city where}} they collect urine from young boys, preferably under the age of ten. The children, having been raised in the city and indoctrinated into its culture, are used to the practice. As young boys would in schools from many other cultures, they excuse themselves from class when they feel the urge to urinate. However, instead of going to the restroom, they relieve themselves in the basin that the <b>vendors</b> <b>place</b> in the hallways. Some vendors go as far as to wait with containers in parks or public restrooms for a parent who is willing to let their child offer urine. The teachers, being accustomed to the tradition as well, often remind the boys to not urinate in the basin if any of them have a fever or feel ill. In addition to buying them from street vendors, residents of Dongyang are also known to cook and prepare the eggs at home, using the urine from household boys. Although modern medical research provides evidence that there are no health benefits from ingesting urine, the virgin boy eggs remain deeply rooted in tradition. As of 2012, the eggs are sold for about 1.50 yuan (approximately $0.24) per egg and are approximately twice the price of normal eggs. However, not all of Dongyang's residents enjoy the dish. One local man was quoted stating, [...] "The smell kills me. I feel like throwing up at the thought of it.

50|$|Beef {{entrails}} {{had been}} a popular kind of snacks in Guangdong province of China. Due to the Chinese Civil War of the mid-20th century, a wave of migrants from mainland China flooded into Hong Kong as refugees. With {{the influence of the}} migrants from Guangzhou, beef entrails became popular in Hong Kong. With the economic boost of Hong Kong in the 1970s, the fusion of Chinese and Western cultures led to the popularity of beef entrails among foreign visitors. It is common to buy beef entrails from street vendors, which is another unique feature that can be found in Hong Kong. Under the law, if the street vendors fail to get licenses given out by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, they cannot continue their business as they may cause hygienic problems, and hawkers may worsen the city image of Hong Kong. In 1958, the government set up Hawkers Control Teams to combat street vendors. However, starting from the 1970s, the government has slowly stopped giving out licenses to street vendors.

40|$|Economic {{growth has}} spurred rapid {{urbanization}} in Malaysia and triggered changes in diet, lifestyle, and disease trends. National {{studies show that}} a third of Malaysia 2 ̆ 7 s population is overweight/obese while household expenditures on dining out grow. In metropolitan Kuala Lumpur (KL), residents navigate concepts of nutrition, body weight, and health as they dine out. Using the biocultural framework, this study examined links between body weight, diet, income, street food consumption, and nutritional knowledge through the perspectives of consumers and vendors. Altogether, 77 participants were recruited for this three-phase research. In the first phase, a survey was administered to 60 participants recruited at street food sites around KL. In the second phase, semi-structured interviews, anthropometry, and diet recalls were conducted on 13 participants. Finally, semi-structured interviews and observations were carried out on four street food <b>vendors</b> at their <b>places</b> of business. Though the findings in this research did not show statistical relationships between body weight status, income, and dining out in KL, telling diet and lifestyle trends emerged. Work mediates the lives of participants, often dictating their diet and capacity to engage in physical activity. Though most female participants work, they still bear the expectations of meal provisioning. These factors encourage the consumption of food away from home, and the commercialization and gentrification of the local street food industry. When viewed critically through the biocultural framework, these observations support the idea that trade liberalization and domestic economic policies have induced demographic changes, household transformations, and dietary adaptations among urban dwellers in KL...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{confirms}} that UK organisations are increasingly adopting cloud services, {{and it also}} reveals {{that they have been}} progressively migrating services perceived as non-mission critical (i.e. where lock-in and security risks seem lower) such as general purpose applications suites, email and massaging applications. This strategy used allows the organisations {{to get a feel for}} how the cloud environment works before fully committing themselves. However, this is generally not the case for organisations surveyed. A lesser minority (see Fig.  7) seem to have adopted core systems in the cloud (e.g. ERP and CRM), including accounting and finance applications. At present, as indicated by the Cloud Industry Forum [39], cloud providers or <b>vendors</b> are better <b>placed,</b> if they ensure such capabilities like the trial or “test and see” strategy (whether completely free or paid for time limited pilot) is made available within their go-to-market strategy. It is worth underlining that, free of charge or low cost does not necessary mean free of lock-in risks or low proprietary lock-in risk. Organisations must be cautious of potential areas of lock-in traps and take adequate measures to mitigate their exposure; e.g. choice of operating environment, programming models, API stack, data portability etc. Further, businesses should take heed of other legal, regulatory, or reputational risks that may exist. This is vitally important if the data involved is not just for testing, but constitutes real corporate data, perhaps even confidential or personal data. It is interesting to note that 28  % of organisations surveyed have already adopted the cloud model for hosting accounting and finance applications (refer to Fig.  7).|$|R
