40|$|A 48 {{year old}} woman is {{described}} who presented with increasing muscular rigidity {{and who was}} found to have a mediastinal tumour. Electrophysiological studies revealed that the muscular stiffness resulted from <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> motor <b>unit</b> activity which outlasted voluntary effort, and which was abolished by nerve block. The abnormal activity may have arisen at the anterior horn cell level. Marked improvement followed the administration of diphenylhydantoin...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} {{phase of}} homograft immunity {{can be studied}} in vitro in the mixed leukocyte culture reaction. In this reaction, {{at the end of}} seven days, up to 30 per cent of the lymphocytes in culture “respond” to a single allogeneic cell stimulus. This paper presents evidence that the lymphocytes responding in culture divide with the generation time of 18 - 21 hours, with some asynchrony, and that {{a large percentage of the}} cells found at the end of the culture period may be the products by division of a small number of cells initially responding. Two estimates are made of the frequency of the initially responding unit (the cell(s) responsible for initiating the response). These are probably minimum estimates and are in the range of 1 in 200 to 1 in 2000 cells which can initially respond. This <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> of responding <b>units</b> as compared with the responding units in immediate type hypersensitivity (antibody production) is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{design of}} dual {{broadband}} antenna is proposed in this paper; {{it consists of}} one low <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> and two <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>units.</b> The low <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> consists {{of a pair of}} printing vibrators; the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> consists of a pair of printing oscillators, which is bent at its end, and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> and low <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> are set on the same dielectric substrate. Through adding a parasitic unit on antenna, it can enhance frequency bandwidth without affecting the bandwidth. In the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>unit,</b> it adopts gap-coupled microstrip line feeding method in order to get enough bandwidth. Through the test of dual broadband antenna, it can be found that, in the low frequency part, the antenna covers 20 % bandwidth of the total bandwidth, and it covers the frequency from 800 [*]MHz to 980 [*]MHz. In the <b>high</b> <b>frequency,</b> the antenna covers 60 % of total bandwidth and its frequency is from 1540 [*]MHz to 2860 [*]MHz, so the designed antenna can satisfy the frequency requirements of 2 G/ 3 G/LTE (4 G) communication system...|$|R

5000|$|... 1) Electrophysiological {{recordings}} {{from the}} eighth cranial nerve {{of males and}} females reveal that primary auditory neurons of the two sexes are maximally excited by different frequencies. Of the three main classes of primary auditory units (low, mid, and <b>high</b> <b>frequency),</b> the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>units</b> in females are tuned (maximally sensitive) to sounds of approximately 2 kHz (the frequency of the “Qui” note), whereas the same units in males appear to be tuned to >3 kHz. The mid <b>frequency</b> <b>units,</b> on the other hand, are tuned to around 1.2 kHz (frequency of the [...] "Co" [...] note) in males, and to significantly lower frequencies in females. Increased sensitivity in females to the [...] "Qui" [...] note and in males to the [...] "Co" [...] note explains the difference in behavioral responsiveness of each sex to the note of the call that is biologically relevant. The low and mid <b>frequency</b> <b>units</b> are thought to derive from the amphibian papilla, whereas the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>units</b> correspond to the basilar papilla. Although no difference was found for low <b>frequency</b> <b>units,</b> the sex differences in mid and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>unit</b> response suggest {{that there may be a}} neural basis for male [...] "Co" [...] note selectivity in the amphibian papilla, and for female “Qui” note selectivity in the basilar papilla.|$|R
