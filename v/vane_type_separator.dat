3000|$|Wire mesh, <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> and {{cyclonic}} <b>separators</b> {{are standard}} as mist extractors {{for the small}} liquid droplets that are not separated by gravity in {{the main body of}} the separator (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004). These cyclones are used for water and condensate removal but have not been applied for removing condensed contaminants, such as CO_ 2 or H_ 2 S. [...] This is because cyclones can only handle condensing droplet sizes above 10  μm (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004; Clift 1997; Svarovsky 1984). To achieve such droplet, sizes requires unrealistically large droplet growth pipes. It is well known in laboratory chemical applications that microcyclones can separate micron-sized droplets having diameters as small as 1 μm, but then the flow is very small and orders of magnitude less than the flow in gas well applications. Alternatively, one can improve separation efficiency by increasing swirl velocity to supersonic velocity but at the costs of large pressure drops (Schinkelshoek et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of free-breathing polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) was studied experimentally {{and the effect}} of the cathode separator structure on the cell performance was investigated. Two <b>types</b> of cathode <b>separators</b> were used for a cell with an 18 cm 2 active area: an open type with parallel rectangular open-slits and a channel type with straight vertical channels with open ends. The polarization curves, cell impedance, and contact pressure distribution of the separators were measured with each type of cathode structure. The result showed {{that it is difficult to}} realize a uniform contact pressure across the cell layers for the open <b>type</b> <b>separator,</b> and this results in higher contact resistance and poorer cell performance than the channel <b>type</b> <b>separator.</b> The channel <b>type</b> <b>separator</b> can maintain a low contact resistance, and the cell performance is strongly affected by the natural convection inside the channel. Optimization of the channel design of the channel <b>type</b> <b>separator</b> achieves good performance and this <b>type</b> of <b>separator</b> is superior for a free-breathing PEMFC. A computational three-dimensional analysis for the free-breathing channel type PEMFC with the different channel depths was performed, and it identified the influence of natural convection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports on}} the {{experimental}} investigation of the aerodynamic effects on even and odd number bladed vertical axis <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> rotor. The experiment was conducted {{with the help of}} a subsonic wind tunnel together with the experimental set-up of the <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> rotor and a spring balance. To ensure a Reynolds number independent approach, different stream flow was maintained. The flow velocities varied from 5 m/s to 9 m/s covering the Reynolds number from 0. 6375 X 10 5 to 1. 2 X 10 5. A four, five and six bladed vertical axis <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> rotor was used to determine the aerodynamic properties in dynamic condition. It is found that the power coefficient increases with increasing the number of blade but the significant effect of even and odd number blade is observed on the range of tip speed ratio.

40|$|Abstract. Satellites {{store and}} manage {{propellant}} by surface tension. A surface tension propellant management device (PMD) {{consists of a}} propellant refillable reservoir (PRR) for propellant storage and propellant acquisition vanes (PAVs) for propellant transportation. PRR is {{a key part of}} <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> surface tension tank (STT), and its storage performance determines the fluid management of <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> STT. In the present paper, a model test system was established and microgravity drop tower tests conducted based on experimental study of fluid storage and transportation behavior of PRR. Laws of fluid storage and transportation of PRR in microgravity environment were obtained. The test results show that two types of PRR both have good liquid storage capacity, and the double cone PRR exhibits good liquid storage capacity in lateral acceleration. A rational design of PRR can effectively store liquid and control liquid transportation velocity. The test results offer a guideline for optimization of new-style <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> PMD, and also provide a new method for fluid control in space environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of swirler design parameters namely, vane shape (flat or curved), vane outlet angle, aspect ratio and space-to-chord ratio (number of vanes), on the pressure drop-mass flow characteristics {{and the size}} and turbulence characteristics of the downstream recirculation region has been determined experimentally. A five-hole spherical pressure probe and hot-wire anemometry {{have been used for}} the investigation. A technique for simple and reasonably accurate interpretation of the signals from the hot-wire anemometer has been formulated. Its performance has been tested at first in round jets for which experimental turbulence data are already available for comparison purposes. The method has been applied subsequently to swirling flows issuing from the swirlers; the mean and turbulence characteristics of the flow fields have been determined in this way. In addition to these, the turbulent viscosities Ĭrr, Ĭrz, Ĭrθ and Ĭθθ have been calculated. Also, detailed accounts of the previous experimental work on swirling flows and of some finite difference procedures for the computation of weakly and strongly swirling flows have been given. It has been shown that the hot-wire formulation developed provides a simple, economic and efficient procedure for the measurement of the turbulence quantities in swirling flows. The results have shown that curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers operate more efficiently than flat <b>vane</b> <b>types</b> such that a larger recirculation region and a stronger shear zone are induced at a lower pressure drop. The pressure drop through both the flat and curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers increases with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratio. The size of the downstream recirculation region, the reverse mass flow and the decay rates of the axial and swirl velocities increase with increasing vane angle and decreasing aspect ratio in the case of curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers. The effect of the space-to-chord ratio has not been found very significant in the cases of I 6 and I 2 vanes for the vane angle of 60 ° and the aspect ratio 0. 4. Higher turbulence and stronger shear zones can be obtained in swirling flows with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratios. Turbulence is anisotropic in strongly swirling jets issuing from <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers. The most dominant stresses are in turn ww, uw, and uu; all the other stresses are smaller. In parallel to the anisotropy in the stresses, the turbulent viscosities are also anisotropic; the turbulent viscosity Ĭθθ has shown domination among the four viscosities which have been calculated. Ĭrr values have shown too much scatter. For these reasons, curved <b>vane</b> <b>type</b> swirlers should prove much more efficient than flat <b>vane</b> <b>types</b> in the application to combustion process...|$|R
