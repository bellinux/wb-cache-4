5000|$|Human foods: <b>Vomitoxin</b> {{is not a}} known {{carcinogen}} as with aflatoxin. Large {{amounts of}} grain with <b>vomitoxin</b> {{would have to be}} consumed to pose a health risk to humans. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has established a level of 1 ppm (parts per million) restriction of <b>vomitoxin.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{compared}} to other trichothecene mycotoxins which can form in grains and forages, <b>vomitoxin</b> is relatively mild. Reduced feed intake, with its accompanying decrease in performance, is the only symptom of <b>vomitoxin</b> toxicity livestock producers will likely encounter.

50|$|<b>Vomitoxin</b> {{belongs to}} a class of mycotoxins (trichothecenes) which are strong inhibitors of protein synthesis; {{exposure}} to <b>vomitoxin</b> causes the brain to increase its uptake of the amino acid tryptophan and, in turn, its synthesis of serotonin. Increased levels of serotonin {{are believed to be}} responsible for the anorexic effects of DON and other trichothecenes. Irritation of the gastrointestinal tract may also play a role in reducing feed intake, and may also partially explain the high incidence of paraesophageal stomach ulcers observed in sows during feed refusal.|$|E
50|$|Fusarium toxins have {{negative}} effects on the immune, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems of animals. DON is a protein synthesis inhibitor, also called <b>vomitoxin,</b> due to its {{negative effects on}} feed intake in pigs. Pigs are the most sensitive to DON, while ruminant animals such as cattle have higher tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Outbreaks {{of barley}} scab (also known as {{fusarium}} head blight) usually occur {{when there are}} high moisture conditions during the flowering stages of barley development. The infected crops become bleached in color, shrunken, and discolored and will grow pink spore masses on the barley heads. The disease {{has the potential to}} destroy a crop within weeks. The shrunken kernels can become so light that the wind can blow them away {{from the rest of the}} crop. In addition, barley scab produces toxins that severely reduce the value of the harvested barley. This toxin, deoxynivalenol, also known as <b>vomitoxin</b> because of its tendency to induce vomiting at high levels, will pass through the brewing process into the beer. When the beer is opened the toxin will cause the liquid to overflow from the bottle or can. Because this is not commercially desirable, barley producers receive severe price discounts when <b>vomitoxin</b> is present.|$|E
5000|$|Livestock {{and farm}} animals: In animals and livestock, <b>vomitoxin</b> causes {{a refusal to}} feed and lack of weight gain when fed above advised levels. Restrictions are set at 10 ppm for poultry and ruminating beef and feedlot cattle older than four months. Ingredients may not exceed 50% of the animal's diet. Dairy cow feed limits are set at 2 ppm.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vomitoxin,</b> {{also known}} as {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON), is a type B trichothecene, an epoxy-sesquiterpenoid. This mycotoxin occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and corn, and less often in rice, sorghum, and triticale. The occurrence of deoxynivalenol is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F. culmorum, {{both of which are}} important plant pathogens which cause fusarium head blight in wheat and gibberella or fusarium ear blight in corn. A direct relationship between the incidence of fusarium head blight and contamination of wheat with deoxynivalenol has been established. The incidence of fusarium head blight is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering (anthesis), and the timing of rainfall, rather than the amount, is the most critical factor. However, increased amount of moisture towards harvest time has been associated with lower amount of <b>vomitoxin</b> in wheat grain due to leaching of toxins. Furthermore, deoxynivalenol contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards Fusarium species, previous crop, tillage practices, and fungicide use. [...] It occurs abundantly in grains in Norway due to heavy rainfall.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{control of}} barley scab {{is seen as}} a high priority, {{resulting}} in the U.S. National Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative. In 2005 alone North Dakota State experts estimated that scab cost the North Dakota farm economy $162 million and in 1993 it cost North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota $1 billion. Fungicide trials in 2004 were promising. Results demonstrated that fungicide use reduced scab by 77-85%, reduced <b>vomitoxin</b> levels by 49-69%, and increased yields by 10-14%.|$|E
40|$|Microbial inocula from rumen fluid, soil, and {{contents}} of the large intestines of chickens (CLIC) and of swine (SLIC) were tested {{for their ability to}} transform deoxynivalenol (<b>vomitoxin)</b> in vitro. Microorganisms in (CLIC) completely transformed pure <b>vomitoxin,</b> and this activity was retained through six serial subcultures. No alteration of the toxin by incubation with SLIC was detected, whereas 35 % of the <b>vomitoxin</b> was metabolized in the original culture of rumen fluid and 50 % was metabolized by the soil sample, though metabolism was decreased in subsequent subcultures of either sample. A single metabolite was isolated and identified as deepoxy <b>vomitoxin.</b> The increase in concentration of deepoxy <b>vomitoxin</b> in the culture medium corresponded with the decrease in <b>vomitoxin</b> concentration. The <b>vomitoxin</b> transformation rate was not affected by either the ratio of CLIC to <b>vomitoxin</b> (5 to 0. 2 g of CLIC per mg of <b>vomitoxin)</b> or the initial concentration of <b>vomitoxin</b> (14 to 1, 400 ppm) in the medium. Biotransformation of <b>vomitoxin</b> was completely inhibited when the pH in the medium was lowered to 5. 20. Sodium azide at a 0. 1 % (wt/vol) concentration in the medium blocked the transformation of <b>vomitoxin,</b> suggesting that the deepoxidation of <b>vomitoxin</b> is an energy-dependent process. About 50 % of the <b>vomitoxin</b> in moldy corn in culture medium was transformed by microorganisms from CLIC. The <b>vomitoxin</b> transformation rate in moldy corn was not affected when the concentration of CLIC changed from 0. 2 to 0. 8 g/ml of medium. <b>Vomitoxin</b> in the moldy corn was not transformed when CLIC were added to corn without culture medium.

40|$|A {{total of}} 340 barrows (PIC 1050, {{initially}} 25. 7 lb Â± 0. 2 lb BW and 35 d of age) {{were used in}} a 28 -d growth trial examining the effects on nursery pig growth performance of adding Biomin Product A (Biomin; Herzogenburg, Austria) to diets contaminated with deoxynivalenol (DON), or <b>vomitoxin</b> on nursery pig growth performance. Also, 5 % water was added in a diet with Biomin Product A {{as a means of}} potentially enhancing the activity of the product. Pigs were allotted to pens by weight, and pens were assigned to 1 of 8 treatments in a randomized complete block design with location in the barn serving as the blocking factor. There were 9 replications per treatment (pens) and 4 to 5 pigs per pen. Initial mycotoxin analyses were conducted on the primary ingredients at Romer Labs 5 and served as the basis of diet formulation. Eight dietary treatments were formulated to contain: (1) no <b>vomitoxin</b> or Biomin Product A, (2) 1. 5 ppm <b>vomitoxin</b> and no Biomin Product A, (3) 1. 5 ppm <b>vomitoxin</b> and 0. 15 % Biomin Product A (3 lb/ton), (4) 1. 5 ppm <b>vomitoxin</b> and 0. 30 % Biomin Product A (6 lb/ton), (5) 3. 0 ppm <b>vomitoxin</b> and no Biomin Product A, (6) 3. 0 ppm <b>vomitoxin</b> and 0. 30 % Biomin Product A (6 lb/ton), (7) 3. 0 ppm and 0. 45 % Biomin Product A (9 lb/ton), and (8) 3. 0 ppm <b>vomitoxin</b> and 0. 45 % Biomin Product A with 5 % water added to the diet. Dried distillers grains with solubles containing <b>vomitoxin</b> were used to increase concentrations in the treatment diets. After feed manufacturing, ingredients and diets were analyzed at Romer Labs and NDSU 6. DON levels for the low- (1. 5 ppm) and high- (3. 0 ppm) <b>vomitoxin</b> diets were determined to average 2. 5 and 5. 2 ppm, respectively. Experimental diets were fed in meal form from d 0 to 21, and a common diet was fed from d 21 to 28 to evaluate performance immediately after removing <b>vomitoxin</b> from the diet. Overall (d 0 to 21), pigs fed high-vomitoxin diets had decreased (P 0. 24) on ADG; however, adding Biomin Product A to low-vomitoxin diets increased (quadratic, P 0. 39) in performance or feed efficiency when 5 % water was added to the diet containing Biomin Product A. In conclusion, adding Biomin Product A to the diet did not improve nursery pig performance during the 3 -week period during which diets containing low or high concentrations of <b>vomitoxin</b> were fed...|$|E
