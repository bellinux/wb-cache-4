5000|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>phishing</b> is the {{criminal}} practice of using social engineering {{over the telephone}} system {{to gain access to}} private personal and financial information from the public for the purpose of financial reward. It is sometimes referred to as vishing, a word that is a combination of [...] "voice" [...] and phishing. <b>Voice</b> <b>phishing</b> exploits the public's trust in landline telephone services, which have traditionally terminated in physical locations known to the telephone company, and associated with a bill-payer. <b>Voice</b> <b>phishing</b> is typically used to steal credit card numbers or other information used in identity theft schemes from individuals.|$|E

The website was designed to offer microfinance information and other related services to low-income earners. The portal website offers eight services, including loan information, free credit checks, information on <b>voice</b> <b>phishing</b> fraud, checks on legally established financial institutions, financial knowledge, credit recovery programs, rehabilitation support programs, and reports of illegal financial practices.|$|E

5000|$|As {{defined by}} Song, Kim and Gkelias (2014), <b>voice</b> <b>phishing</b> is {{the act of}} a victim {{disclosing}} confidential and sensitive information such as personal finances to a scammer through social engineering (p. 865). [...] The decision for someone to carry out such a delicate action is heavily based on the faith that individuals hold with their telephone service. Song et al. made an initiative to combat this concern with improved authentication of origin detection through pinpointing masked call numbers with a solution called iVisher. iVisher traces call data back to its source, which is a PBX that governs the authentic caller ID pertinent to the name getting displayed for all VoIP calls (p. 868).|$|E
50|$|She finally goes to {{the police}} station to lodge a missing person's report and the officer, Detective Park, finds it {{suspicious}} that she is lodging the report so late, having last seen the duo 2 days ago. She also realises that the call earlier had just been a <b>Voice</b> <b>phishing</b> call. Since Han-Mae can't be contacted at the moment, the police ask her to provide their photos. But, while there are plenty of Da-eun's photos, surprisingly, there is not even a single photo of Han-Mae in her phone while she distinctly remembers the 3 of them clicking a photo together on Da-eun's 1st birthday. In the midst of this, her mother-in-law bursts in{{to the police station}} and demands to know where Ji-sun is hiding her daughter. She claims that Ji-sun and Han-Mae are working together in order to hide Da-eun. This is news to Detective Park who then proceeds to call her lawyer. He finds it suspicious as well that her daughter disappeared just days after she was served a detention. He tells her how big the problem is considering she doesn't even know Han-Mae's personal details and that her Foreigner ID was fake and even her phone was a burner phone.|$|E
40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{identify}} methods that phishers employ to attack unsuspecting internet users. The aim was {{for the purpose of}} minimizing their effects on websites as well as users. Eleven statements, namely, Emails, Web based, Malware based, Internet Relay Chats (IRC’s) Man in the middle (MITM) Domain Name Server (DNS) based, Impersonate, Forward Attack, Pop-up attack, <b>Voice</b> <b>Phishing</b> and Mobile Phishing, depicting methods used by phishers to carry out their attacks against unsuspecting victims who are the internet users were presented to respondents to indicate their level of agreement. The result showed that only two, (MITM and Web based) out of the eleven were not significant while the remaining nine were significant. That means only the two strategies of attacks are not really dangerous as such can be ignored. This also indicates a high level of danger posed by phishers. Suggestion for further studies was made...|$|E
40|$|Phishers {{nowadays}} rely on {{a variety}} of channels, ranging from old-fashioned emails to instant messages, social networks, and the phone system (with both calls and text messages), with the goal of reaching more victims. As a consequence, modern phishing became a multi-faceted, even more pervasive threat that is inherently more difficult to study than traditional, email-based phishing. This short paper describes the status of a data collection system we are developing to capture different aspects of phishing campaigns, with a particular focus on the emerging use of the voice channel. The general approach is to record inbound calls received on decoy phone lines, place outbound calls to the same caller identifiers (when available) and also to telephone numbers obtained from different sources. Specifically, our system analyzes instant messages (e. g., automated social engineering attempts) and suspicious emails (e. g., spam, phishing), and extracts telephone numbers, URLs and popular words from the content. In addition, users can voluntarily submit <b>voice</b> <b>phishing</b> (vishing) attempts through a public website. Extracted telephone numbers, URLs and popular words will be correlated to recognize campaigns by means of cross-channel relationships between messages...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{exploratory}} assessment of Phishing, SMiShing and Vishing attacks against mobile devices. It examines {{the implications of}} end-user behavior towards mitigating the risks posed by using mobile devices for online services and facilities. Phishing is that socially engineered attack aimed at enticing unsuspecting users with familiar websites spoofed and purported {{to come from a}} legitimate organization or source. It lures the user to furnish the assailant with the user’s access credentials, for which privileged access would be gained to harm the user. SMiShing attacks also happen whenever text messages are sent for the user to either click on a link provided, which leads to a fraudulent website or for the attacker to get access to the user’s contacts and/or any other confidential information. Vishing is a <b>voice</b> <b>phishing</b> attack, whereby a voice call received from an assailant lures the target into providing personal information with the intention to use that information to cause harm. With the proliferation of smart phones, tablets and hotspots, these social engineering attacks on mobile devices are now prevalent. The study observed and strategically interviewed 20 end-users for their knowledge, perceptions and behavior when confronted with phishing attack situations. The results show that men are more comfortable and trusting on the cyber-space and thus more susceptible to phishing attacks than women. The results also indicate that most users are either slightly aware or not at all aware of Phishing, SMiShing and Vishing threats against their mobile devices. Interestingly, 55 % would occasionally examine the messages received as perceived threats, whilst 35...|$|E
40|$|With the {{convergence}} of Internet and telephony, new applications (e. g., WhatsApp) have emerged as an important means of communication for billions of users. These applications are becoming an attractive medium for attackers to deliver spam and carry out more targeted attacks. Since such applications rely on phone numbers, we explore the feasibility, automation, and scalability of phishing attacks that {{can be carried out}} by abusing a phone number. We demonstrate a novel system that takes a potential victim's phone number as an input, leverages information from applications like Truecaller and Facebook about the victim and his / her social network, checks the presence of phone number's owner (victim) on the attack channels (over-the-top or OTT messaging applications, voice, e-mail, or SMS), and finally targets the victim on the chosen channel. As a proof of concept, we enumerate through a random pool of 1. 16 million phone numbers. By using information provided by popular applications, we show that social and spear phishing attacks can be launched against 51, 409 and 180, 000 users respectively. Furthermore, <b>voice</b> <b>phishing</b> or vishing attacks can be launched against 722, 696 users. We also found 91, 487 highly attractive targets who can be attacked by crafting whaling attacks. We show the effectiveness of one of these attacks, phishing, by conducting an online roleplay user study. We found that social (69. 2 %) and spear (54. 3 %) phishing attacks are more successful than non-targeted phishing attacks (35. 5 %) on OTT messaging applications. Although similar results were found for other mediums like e-mail, we demonstrate that due to the significantly increased user engagement via new communication applications and the ease with which phone numbers allow collection of information necessary for these attacks, there is a clear need for better protection of OTT messaging applications.

40|$|Considering the {{associated}} benefits that {{come along with}} VoIP technology over the tra-ditional telephony service; PSTN, {{there is no doubt}} that the best thing that has ever hap-pened to an organization is when management decided to move from the old world of telephony services “PSTN” to the new age of VoIP technology. Not only that this tech-nology provide a huge cost saving for an organization, but, also lots of both physical and logical benefits that are mostly inevitable for every organization. Considering this huge benefits, it is not a surprise that many organisations that have adopted this technology might neglect the security issues associated with it. Thus, fail-ure to have proper security infrastructure in place for VoIP technology simply means, failure to achieve the goal of every organisation security; Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA). Kinjal et al. (2012), discussed that, an attacker can execute various kinds of attacks on the vulnerable VoIP solution systems in order to disrupt VoIP ser-vices, and some of those attacks come under the classifications of; Confidentiality, Availability, Authenticity and Larceny. Mathiyalakan (2006), also discussed two factors that could hold back the adoption of VoIP technology including; Quality of Service (QoS) and Security. Based on these issues, this thesis project aim to identify and pro-vide mitigation strategy for VoIP security threats and challenges, as well as to explore IT solution best practice prior to the implementation of VoIP technology. In order to fulfil the purpose of this thesis, a case study about company xyz was chosen and the use of qualitative methods for data collection and analysis was also adopted. Analysis of the theoretical framework and empirical findings of this thesis project un-cover some the known VoIP security threats including; Call Eavesdropping, Call Re-cording, Voicemail Tampering, Denial of Service (DoS), Floods, Buffer Overflow At-tacks, Worms, Viruses, Registration Hijacking, Caller ID spoofing, Sound Insertion, <b>Voice</b> <b>Phishing,</b> Toll Fraud and Data Theft. And some of the discovered VoIP security challenges are; Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity, Traceability, Firewall, Network Address Translation “NAT” and Encryption. All these security threats and challenges can then be proactively mitigated through the adoption of Unified Expert Theory “UET”. The aim and concept around this theory is to address and provide detail awareness around VoIP technology through the involvement of Business, VoIP, Network and Security Experts that are needed for a successful VoIP solution.
