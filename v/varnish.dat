5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing. The processed wet fabric, soaked with <b>varnish,</b> was rubbed and pressed so the <b>varnish</b> {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess <b>varnish</b> was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented <b>varnish</b> that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the <b>varnish</b> to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E

5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} <b>varnish</b> application. Myers' patented <b>varnish</b> formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The <b>varnish</b> used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E
50|$|Acrylic <b>varnishes</b> are {{typically}} water-borne <b>varnishes</b> {{with the lowest}} refractive index of all finishes and high transparency. They resist yellowing. Acrylics {{have the advantage of}} water clean-up and lack of solvent fumes, but typically do not penetrate into wood as well as oils. They sometimes lack the brushability and self-leveling qualities of solvent-based <b>varnishes.</b> Generally they have good UV-resistance.|$|R

60|$|My room at {{the hotel}} was as dreary as a stubble-field upon a November evening. The whole house was new, <b>varnished,</b> and hard. My bedroom was small. A piece of new ingrain carpet covered part of the hard <b>varnished</b> floor. Four hard walls and a ceiling, deadly white, {{surrounded}} me. The hard <b>varnished</b> bedstead (the mattress {{felt as if it}} were <b>varnished)</b> nearly filled the little room. Two stiff chairs, and a yellow window-shade which looked as if it were made of <b>varnished</b> wood, glittered in the feeble light of a glass lamp, while the ghastly grayish pallor of the ewer and basin on the wash-stand was thrown into bold relief by the intenser whiteness of the wall behind it.|$|R

5|$|Kauri gum {{was used}} commercially in <b>varnish,</b> {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). Kauri gum was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{understand}} the mechanism of change in color of wood by impregnation and <b>varnishing</b> processes with SEM micrographs. Even tough the wood has many advanced properties; humidity is an important disadvantage for wood in use. Wood is impregnated and <b>varnished</b> with some special chemicals to overcome these disadvantages. In impregnation process, the impregnation material is placed to the wood cell and shows a keeping impact. In <b>varnishing,</b> the surface of wood is covered with the <b>varnishing</b> chemicals to keep the wood from external impacts. Some chemical and physical properties of wood are developed by those processes. So, to understand the mechanism this interaction is very important. Impregnation and <b>varnishing</b> changes the yellow color tone of wood. Use of these materials more than needed will cause to increase in production costs and also will create some environmentally bad results. In this study, cell structure of Oriental spruce (Picea orientalis Link.) wood impregnated and <b>varnished</b> is observed by scanning electron microscopy. The graphs taken by SEM are discussed to understand the mechanism of change in color. It is understood that the change in color of wood by impregnation and <b>varnishing</b> is due to the cypermethrin in Imersol-aqua. So, SEM micrograph technique may be used in analyzing the reasons of change in physical and mechanical properties of woods...|$|R
50|$|Eucalyptus vernicosa, {{commonly}} known as <b>varnished</b> gum, is an endemic Tasmanian shrub, and the smallest species of Eucalyptus.

5000|$|Fluoride <b>varnishes</b> were {{developed}} late 1960s and early 1970s {{and since then}} they have been used both as a preventative agent in public health programs and as a specific treatment for patients at risk of caries by the 1980s, mostly in European countries. Fluoride <b>varnishes</b> {{were developed}} primarily to overcome their shortcoming which is to prolong the contact time between fluoride and tooth surfaces. Furthermore, {{when compared to other}} existing topical fluoride the advantages of fluoride <b>varnishes</b> application are being a quick and easy procedure for the clinicians, reduced discomfort for the receiving patients, and greater acceptability by the patients. Fluoride <b>varnishes</b> are a concentrated topical fluoride containing 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) except the fulour protector. There are many types of fluoride <b>varnishes</b> and among them the popular brands are Duraphat and Fluor Protector. Currently, the anti-caries effect fluoride <b>varnishes</b> are backed up by Cochrane systematic reviews, 2002 which was updated in 2013 included 22 trials with 12,455 children aged 1-15 years old.

Horses with the <b>varnish</b> roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the impact of impregnation materials on the Brinell hardness of <b>varnished</b> wood materials. For this purpose, test specimens prepared from Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky), which met the requirements of ASTM D 358, were impregnated according to ASTM D 1413 - 07 with borax, boric acid, zinc chloride, and di-ammonium phosphate by a vacuum technique. After impregnation, the surfaces were coated by cellulosic, synthetic, and polyurethane <b>varnishes</b> in accordance with ASTM D 3023.

40|$|Abstract This study {{assessed}} fluoride (F) {{and sodium}} trimetaphosphate (TMP) release into artificial saliva from <b>varnishes</b> containing 0 %, 2. 5 %, and 5 % NaF, supplemented or not with 5 % TMP. The <b>varnishes</b> were applied on polyester sheets (n = 8 /group), and F and TMP released into artificial saliva were measured {{for up to}} 24 hours. The amount of F and TMP released were directly related to NaF and TMP concentrations in the <b>varnishes.</b> The highest F release was seen for 5 % NaF and 5 % NaF + 5 % TMP, whereas 5 % TMP released the highest amount of TMP. However, the simultaneous addition of NaF and TMP to <b>varnishes</b> significantly reduced the amount of F and TMP released from the products...|$|R

5|$|Since the {{kauri gum}} {{was found to}} mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri gum. It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high-grade <b>varnish</b> for violins.|$|E

This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new <b>varnish</b> added a thin layer.|$|E
5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue <b>varnish.</b> The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of <b>varnish</b> and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
