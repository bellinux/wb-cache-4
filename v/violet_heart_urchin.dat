50|$|The red <b>heart</b> <b>urchin</b> has few predators but is {{sometimes}} preyed on by stingrays and other fish, loggerhead turtles {{and the sea}} star Oreaster reticulatus. It can emit a noxious yellow exudate which repels fish and may even kill them. Several red <b>heart</b> <b>urchins</b> may aggregate and the progress of each one through the sediment can be observed by a depressed trail left behind as it progresses and a slight mound of coarser material above it. Red <b>heart</b> <b>urchins</b> burrow {{at the rate of}} 3 to 6 cm an hour during the day and twice as fast as this at night.|$|R

50|$|The Spatangidae are {{a family}} of <b>heart</b> <b>urchins.</b> There are four {{recognised}} genera within the family; Maretia, Paramaretia, Pseudomaretia and Spatangus.

50|$|Spatangus is a genus of <b>heart</b> <b>urchins</b> in the Spatangidae family. The genus {{is synonymous}} with the {{previously}} recognised genera Prospatangus Lambert, 1902 and Spatagus.

40|$|To study {{environmental}} risk assessment, echinoderms provide a useful model for ecotoxicological testing. However, limited {{knowledge of the}} life history of field collected <b>heart</b> <b>urchins</b> is a problem {{and the use of}} cultured urchins has been investigated here. The present study describes a culture method for the <b>heart</b> <b>urchin</b> Echinocardium cordatum under controlled laboratory conditions, providing organisms with a low biological variation. Based on our optimized growth protocol both larvae and juveniles have a growth rate comparable to E. cordatum in the wild. The toxicological response of cultured and field-collected E. cordatum was compared in standard saltwater toxicity bioassays. Using ammonium chloride as a water-soluble reference toxicant, mean 96 h LC 50 values for cultured <b>heart</b> <b>urchins</b> versus field collected animals were 37. 4 ± 7. 6 mg NH 4 +/l (n = 5) versus 22. 5 ± 4. 9 mg NH 4 +/l (n = 19), respectively. Additional toxicity experiments with tributyl tin (TBT) spiked sediments revealed 14 d LC 50 values of 1, 242 (95 % confidence interval 986 ¿ 1, 564) and 964 (95 % confidence interval 843 ¿ 1, 102) µg Sn/kg dw respectively in cultured and field collected E. cordatum. From this it was concluded that cultured <b>heart</b> <b>urchins</b> are less sensitive to TBT than field collected E. cordatum. Furthermore in whole sediment toxicity tests, survival of cultured sea urchins was higher or at least similar to that of field collected E. cordatum. The increased sensitivity of field urchins compared to cultured urchins in various toxicity tests may be due to multiple environmental stressors reducing their overall performance. Overall it was demonstrated that the use of cultured E. cordatum provides a significant advance for urchin-based bioassays for marine environmental toxicity testing, resulting in a more homogeneous, vital population with experimental data displaying reduced variability...|$|R
50|$|Approximately 23 {{species of}} sea urchins, 3 species of <b>heart</b> <b>urchins,</b> and 9 species of sand dollars call the Northern Gulf of California habitat their home. Where {{they are found}} {{throughout}} the Gulf of California, can be classified into three biogeographic regions called the Northern Gulf, Central Gulf, and Southern Gulf.|$|R
50|$|The red <b>heart</b> <b>urchin</b> {{is found}} in the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas, Florida and Bermuda. It inhabits reef flats, turtle grass beds, areas of coral {{fragments}} and deep reefs. It buries itself in the seabed choosing to inhabit sedimentary areas with sand, silt or coarse coral rubble. Its depth range is intertidal down to 200 m.|$|R
50|$|Cassiduloids have {{a rounded}} or {{slightly}} oval appearance, and look somewhat similar to <b>heart</b> <b>urchins,</b> {{although they are}} actually {{more closely related to}} the sand dollars. They are distinguished from other sea urchins by the presence of smaller intervening areas between the main ambulacral areas on the oral surface. They have no lantern as adults, and the petaloids are poorly developed or absent.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{echinoderms}} such as sea <b>urchins,</b> including <b>heart</b> <b>urchins</b> {{and sand}} dollars, {{have a hard}} [...] "test" [...] or shell. After the animal dies, the flesh rots out and the spines fall off, and then fairly often the empty test washes up whole onto a beach, {{where it can be}} found by a beachcomber. These tests are fragile and easily broken into pieces.|$|R
50|$|Meoma ventricosa, {{known by}} the common names cake <b>urchin</b> and red <b>heart</b> <b>urchin,</b> is a large species of sea urchin which lives in shallow waters in the Caribbean. It may reach a {{diameter}} of twenty centimeters and is covered in reddish-brown spines. It has both pentagonal radial symmetry and bilateral symmetry, giving it a sand-dollar appearance; however, two of its five sections are merged more closely than the others.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of Waldo arthuri, {{all members of the}} genus are found in the southern Atlantic and Antarctic Oceans. Waldo arthuri is found in an entirely separate oceanic basin, the northeastern Pacific Ocean, where it lives in a commensal relationship with the <b>heart</b> <b>urchin</b> Brisaster latifrons. This widely disparate distribution range is unusual for the genus because of the aforementioned lack of a pelagic larval phase for members of the genus.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{body is a}} {{somewhat}} elongated oval in form, and is distinguished by the mouth being placed towards {{one end of the}} animal, and the anus towards the other. As a result, <b>heart</b> <b>urchins,</b> unlike most other sea urchins, are bilaterally symmetrical, and have a distinct anterior surface. The presence and position of the mouth and anus typically give members of this group the distinct [...] "heart" [...] shape from which they get their name.|$|R
50|$|Amphiura chiajei buries {{itself in}} the {{sediment}} with the disc {{at a depth of}} about 5 cm. It extends one or two arms above the sediment to gather food particles which are then transferred along its arm to its mouth. It is often found in the same locations as the <b>heart</b> <b>urchin</b> Brissopsis lyrifera, and where this happens it grows more slowly than it does elsewhere. This is thought to be because the urchin churns up the sediment excessively.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, an {{epizootic}} event {{involving the}} red <b>heart</b> <b>urchin</b> occurred {{off the coast}} of Curaçao. It was established that the causative agent was a species of bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas. Affected urchins lost their spines and later died. It was found that the disease was largely confined to an area of a few square kilometres down-current from Willemstad harbour. It was suggested that polluted water caused an increase in bacteria-laden sediment and that consumption of this by the urchins caused their deaths.|$|R
5000|$|These {{particular}} {{sea urchins}} are distinguished from other sea urchins by their irregular shape: the anus and often even the mouth {{are no more}} at the two poles of the test, creating a bilateral symmetry instead of the classical 5-fold symmetry of echinoderms. The group includes the well known <b>heart</b> <b>urchins,</b> as well as flattened sand dollars, sea biscuits and some other forms. Most of them live inside the sediment, moving in thanks to their particular spines, and feed on its organic fraction.|$|R
