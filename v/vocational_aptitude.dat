2500|$|Frey and Detterman (2003) {{investigated}} {{associations of}} SAT scores with intelligence test scores. Using {{an estimate of}} general mental ability, or g, based on the Armed Services <b>Vocational</b> <b>Aptitude</b> Battery, which can be best thought of as representing crystallized intelligence (learned abilities), they found SAT scores to be highly correlated with g (r=.82 in their sample, [...]857 when adjusted for non-linearity) in their sample taken from a 1979 national probability survey. Additionally, they investigated the correlation between SAT results, using the revised and recentered form of the test, and scores on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, a test of fluid intelligence (reasoning), this time using a non-random sample. [...] They found that the correlation of SAT results with scores on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices was [...]483. They estimated that this latter correlation would have been about 0.72 {{were it not for}} the restriction of ability range in the sample. They also noted that there appeared to be a ceiling effect on the Raven’s scores which may have suppressed the correlation. Beaujean and colleagues (2006) have reached similar conclusions to those reached by Frey and Detterman.|$|E
2500|$|A 2004 {{meta-analysis}} by Richard Lynn and Paul Irwing {{published in}} 2005 {{found that the}} mean IQ of men exceeded that of women by up to 5 points on the Raven's Progressive Matrices test. Lynn's findings were debated {{in a series of}} articles for Nature. Jackson and Philipe Rushton found that males aged 17–18 years had an average of 3.63 IQ points in excess of their female equivalents on the Scholastic Assessment Test. Irwing (2012) found a 3-point IQ advantage for males in g from subjects aged 16–89 in the United States on the WAIS III test favoring men on the information, arithmetic, and symbol search, and favoring women on the processing speed. A 2005 study by Ian Deary, Paul Irwing, Geoff Der, and Timothy Bates, focusing on the ASVAB showed a significantly higher variance in male scores, resulting in more than twice as many men as women scoring in the top 2%. The study also found a very small (d' ≈ 0.07, less than 7%, of a standard deviation) average male advantage in g on the Armed Services <b>Vocational</b> <b>Aptitude</b> Battery test. [...] Another study by researcher Jianghong Liu also found 3 points higher male scores on the WISC, which is the children's version of the WAIS III. He stated that greater male performance on items such as Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, Picture Completion and Block Design is because these tests measure visual-spatial abilities in which males typically perform better than females.|$|E

This paper aims at describing a formative project devised at Enrique Jose Varona Senior High School in Holguín City. The project engaged the students in creating El Varona dice newspaper, stimulating social research activity, reporting and preparing articles as means of developing <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitudes</b> towards journalism, history, social and educational sciences. After constructing the corresponding framework critical workshops, individual and group interviews were used as methods of inquiring.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of discrete courses designed to prepare young adults with severe learning disabilities for the next stage in their lives, broadly assumed to be independent living and employment. It focuses particularly on the ways {{a small group of}} students in one college are prepared for supported employment. It captures the views of some of these students and of the significant adults who work with them. The thesis does not reject work as an option for young adults with severe learning disabilities; rather it promotes the view that work is one of the significant places where the adult community congregates. Inclusion in mainstream work, as is inclusion in mainstream school, is an important way to achieve first, public visibility and then, social acceptance for those with severe learning disabilities. In its final analysis, the thesis adopts a Foucauldian perspective and invites the further education sector to reconsider entrenched thinking which promotes normalised notions of work linked to the ability to perform a set of functional skills. Whilst inclusion in the workplace for people with severe learning disabilities is dependent on a normalised set of skills and behaviours and moreover, that these can be learned through behaviourist principles, this inclusion will not be achieved. The thesis suggest that a more positive way forward, may be to explore ways to harness the innate <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitudes</b> and aspirations of young adults with severe learning difficulties, and to support them in contributing to adult society, not judged by normalised measures of competence, but as valued participants whose particular talents are celebrated.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{the second part of}} a three-part thesis study that was started by LTC Martin Fair in June 2004. In his initial thesis, LTC Fair built a {{database}} by joining information from the U. S. Census Bureau, U. S. zip codes, and USAR zip code data. LTC Fair also formulated a network flow model and began an initial implementation of the first of many constraints. My thesis will validate the constraint models and develop the set of constraints that another project, by LTC Brau, will need to develop the network flow model. That model will optimize reserve unit readiness in the third and perhaps final part of the study. Since the early 1990 's and the demise of the Cold War, the United States Army active and reserve forces have undergone dramatic restructuring. The Active component was reduced in size from 18 active divisions down to today's total of ten-a force cut of approximately 300, 000 soldiers. Additionally, the United States Army Reserve forces mission shifted to a predominately Combat Support (CS) and Combat Service Support (CSS) mission. This realignment was an attempt to use the USAR component in a support role as the world situation dictated. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent declaration of a "War on Terrorism," the United States Army Reserve (and active component) has been called upon to deploy more frequently and for extended periods of time. Maintaining unit readiness and a satisfactory "fill-rate" {{is probably one of the}} leading challenges that our reserve forces face. This thesis examines the relationship between unit location and recruiting success. We seek to maximize the fill rate of United States Army Reserve (USAR) units. Our method will correlate the <b>vocational</b> <b>aptitudes</b> of the US population with the Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) of the USAR units. US Army (USA) author...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{measurement}} technique for determining skill levels required for various occupations for use in training, counseling, lob placement, and measuring labor force quality. Measures related to income and educational levels of workers were selected. It was assumed that higher earnings reflected a higher skill requirement. Data were collected from census information and "The Dictionary of Occupational Titles. " Only those mutually exclusive occupations were selected which contained 50. 000 workers in a 1960 census and which were clearly defined in "The Dictionary of Occupational Titleb. " Some of the information collected included: general educational development, specific <b>vocational</b> preparation, <b>aptitude.</b> interest, temperament, physical demands. percent of workers with less than a high school education, percent of workers with 4 years or more of college. median school years by worker in each occupation, median income by worker in each occupation, and median wage and salary.

40|$|Hälsans Trädgård is {{a project}} {{which is going to}} start in Gamla Linköping, Sweden. The authors were {{commissioned}} by Arbetslivsresurs, a company working with work rehabilitation, to select, define and make job analyses on five work tasks at Hälsans Trädgård in Gamla Linköping. A job analysis means an analysis of the demands the job make of the individual. The job analysis used in this study is called The Revised Handbook for Analyzing Jobs (RHAJ) and is from the US Department of Labor (DOL). As RHAJ is an American instrument, the authors produced a form where the concepts are translated into Swedish to make the analysis easier. The areas that were analyzed according to the RHAJ were: worker functions, general educational development, specific <b>vocational</b> preparation, <b>aptitudes,</b> temperaments, and physical demands and environmental conditions. The five work tasks that were analyzed at Hälsans Trädgård were: “Raking”, “Planting flowers”, “Weeding”, “Shoveling snow” and “Portraying Lisa”. The result shows that the five work tasks make low demands on the individual and that none of the tasks demand mathematical development. The task “Portraying Lisa” was the task which, in most cases, made the most demands on the individual. The discussion proposes how the work tasks can be more complex. The authors suggest investigations that test the RHAJ for validity and reliability and that the RHAJ in full be translated into Swedish and tested under Swedish circumstances in future research...|$|R

40|$|As an {{overview}} of a 6 -year federally funded state program, Project MINI-SCORE's final report is intended to provide guidance personnel in Minnesota with occupational data useful for counseling high school students. Over 17, 500 applicants to the full-time day programs offered in 24 Minnesota Area Vocational-Technical Schools were tested with a battery of five standardized <b>vocational,</b> personality, and <b>aptitude</b> tests and a personal data sheet {{in order to determine}} significant individual differences among those who are accepted into these schools, begin related employment, and achieve successful vocational adjustment, and those who do not. From these data bases, three instruments proved most useful for predicting success for vocational students: (1) the Minnesota Vocational Interest Inventory, (2) the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire, and (3) the Minnesota Importance Questionnaire. Other success criteria were inconsistent, although the existence of significant differences among male and female groups and those successful in different occupations was documented from pre-enrollment test data.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report results {{that suggest that}} {{carefully}} integrated and implemented vocational training and re-entry programs for youthful property offenders can reduce {{the rate at which}} such individuals are arrested after release. This result is important since most evaluations of programs for such offenders show no significant effects. The question has been "Why have programs rarely been shown to have significant effects on the behavior of offenders?". Our results suggest that the major reasons may be that programs evaluated to date have been weak and implementation poor. Even with substantial backing from correctional management only 16 percent of the experimental group participated in all aspects of the vocational Delivery System (VDS). Members of the experimental group were most likely to participate in early aspects of the VDS (e. g., a three-week evaluation of <b>vocational</b> interests and <b>aptitudes)</b> than in later elements (e. g., work with the Employment Security Commission to find a job). Even with relatively weak implementation, the experimental group subjects were significantly less likely to be arrested that control group subjects. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the relationship of general <b>aptitude,</b> <b>vocational</b> attitudes, and occupational values to scoring above or below the 75 th percentile on the Kuder Preference Record by ninth grade students in rural southwestern Utah and southeastern Idaho. The sample consisted of a group of 248 students who participated in Project Mace. The students were divided into two groups according to their Kuder percentile scores. The G scale of the General Aptitude Test Battery, the Vocational Development Inventory, and the Occupational Values Inventory were also administered to the subjects. The data were analyzed by a simple correlation matrix and analysis of variance. The results of the study indicated {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups on any of the instruments. The implications from the results indicated that: The 75 th percentile probably should not be used as a criterion for strong interests, at least when an attempt is being made to relate interests to the general aptitude, attitudes, and values measured in this study. More research is needed in order to fully understand the relationship of interests, aptitudes, attitudes and values.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{few studies}} that have tracked {{children}} with developmental language disorder to adulthood have found that these individuals experience considerable difficulties with psychosocial adjustment (for example, academic, <b>vocational</b> and social <b>aptitude).</b> Evidence that some children also develop autistic symptomatology over time has raised suggestions that developmental language disorder may be a high-functioning form of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It {{is not yet clear}} whether these outcomes vary between individuals with different subtypes of language impairment. AIMS: To compare the adult psychosocial outcomes of children with specific language impairment (SLI), pragmatic language impairment (PLI) and ASD. METHODS and PROCEDURES: All participants took part in research as children. In total, there were 19 young adults with a childhood history of Specific Language Impairment (M age = 24; 8), seven with PLI (M age = 22; 3), 11 with high functioning ASD (M age = 21; 9) and 12 adults with no history of developmental disorder (Typical; n = 12; M age = 21; 6). At follow-up, participants and their parents were interviewed to elicit information about psychosocial outcomes. OUTCOMES and RESULTS: Participants in the SLI group were most likely to pursue vocational training and work in jobs not requiring a high level of language/literacy ability. The PLI group tended to obtain higher levels of education and work in 'skilled' professions. The ASD participants had lower levels of independence and more difficulty obtaining employment than the PLI and SLI participants. All groups had problems establishing social relationships, but these difficulties were most prominent in the PLI and ASD groups. A small number of participants in each group were found to experience affective disturbances. The PLI and SLI groups showed lower levels of autistic symptomatology than the ASD group. CONCLUSIONS and IMPLICATIONS: The between-group differences in autistic symptomatology provide further evidence that SLI, PLI, and ASD are related disorders that vary along qualitative dimensions of language structure, language use and circumscribed interests. Childhood diagnosis showed some relation to adult psychosocial outcome. However, within-group variation highlights the importance of evaluating children on a case-by-case basis...|$|R
