50|$|The {{interior}} of the third generation Saga has been revamped and updated in line with Proton's current design language and technical capabilities. Nonetheless, the mounting points for the dashboard, <b>vents,</b> <b>seats</b> and other key modules in the cabin remained largely unchanged {{as a result of}} the platform carryover. The {{interior of}} the new Saga consists of all-new parts and components, as well as borrowed ones, with only minimal carryovers from the outgoing generation. Proton had also invested considerably in solutions to reduce transmissions of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) into the cabin, in an effort to create a more mature and refined Saga.|$|R

5000|$|When Consolidated Amusement Company {{opened it}} in 1922, local {{newspapers}} called it [...] "The Pride of the Pacific" [...] and considered it the equal in opulence to any theatre in San Francisco or beyond. [...] Honolulu architects Walter Emory and Marshall Webb employed elements of Neoclassical architecture for the exterior - with Byzantine, Corinthian, and Moorish ornamentation - and a rich panoply of Beaux-Arts architecture inside - Corinthian columns, a gilded dome, marble statuary, plush carpets, silk hangings, and a Lionel Walden mural on the proscenium. They also installed an innovative cooling system that allowed air from an {{ice storage room}} under the stage to flow through <b>vents</b> beneath the <b>seats.</b> The large neon marquee was the largest ever built in Honolulu.|$|R

40|$|This report {{covers the}} work {{carried out in}} {{cooperation}} with Kongsberg Automotive AB during the thesis work performed by all third year students at Jönköping University. During the project a measurement equipment for testing {{the capacity of the}} fans, I. E their flow and pressure, was to be generated and examples for constructions given. The fans which were to be tested has the function to <b>vent</b> the car <b>seats.</b> Similar products are already on the market and this work was how to find new innovative solutions to simplify the construction, installation, and improve the design of the product to meet the employer's requirements. In addition to Kongsberg’s requirements the equipment had to be designed after an ANSI standard to meet Kongsberg’s customers’ demands. This report will examine the steps taken to generate new solutions through various concept generating methods and how these are then screened out to find the best concept. In connection with this a detailed specification of requirements which the development of test equipment is based on was created. The report then describes the design process of the product which was carried out. The work was based also on several different theories about materials and the choice of production method and will be described {{in the early stages of}} the report. As this work does not include the physical manufacturing of the prototype, only the steps leading up to a final concept drawings and selection of the purchased components required is described. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{suite of}} {{ferromanganese}} nodules were sampled during the MVSEIS- 2008 cruise aboard of the R/V Hespérides in the flanks of Meknes mud volcano (Moroccan margin, NE Central Atlantic). The nodules were collected at water depths between 750 - 850 m within a seabed area characterized by high acoustic backscatter values. Debris {{of cold water}} corals and hydrocarbon-derived authigenic carbonate crusts were sampled at same time. The nodules show tabular morphology, up to 20 cm in maximum diameter and 2 kg of weight, brown-reddish external color and they are internally composed by a concentric to complex arrangement of laminae. The results of X-ray diffraction analysis show that these ferromanganese nodules are essentially composed of goethite and lepidocrocite, being Mn-oxides, silicates (quartz and clay minerals) and carbonates (calcite, dolomite and siderite) accessory to occasional minerals. All the samples display micritic to micro-sparitic mosaic under the petrographic microscope which forms massive, laminated or dendritic-mottled textures. The nodules show a high abundance of Fe, minor Mn and low contents of trace metals and REEs. Mature hydrocarbons, as n-alkanes derived from marine bacterial activity, and phenanthrene have been detected in all the ferromanganese nodules analyzed. These nodules display analogous characteristics (textural, mineralogical and geochemical) to the nodules studied by González et al (2009) in the carbonate mud-mounds in the Gulf of Cadiz, offshore Iberian margin. In this way, the same preliminary genetic model proposed for these nodules might be applicable to those find in the Meknes mud volcano. Therefore, the anaerobic oxidation of hydrocarbon-rich fluids within the mud-breccia sediments in the flanks of Meknes mud volcano would induce the formation of early diagenetic Fe-(Mn) carbonate nodules. Thus, the nodules were later exhumed by the erosive action of sea bottom currents generating the replacement of ferromanganese carbonates by Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxides. Thus, the hydrocarbon-rich fluid <b>venting</b> from deep <b>seated</b> reservoirs and erosive action of bottom currents must have been essential actors, as mineralization controls, for ferromanganese nodules generation and evolution. These findings imply {{that this type of}} nodules must be considered as new product as derived from the anaerobic/aerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons in areas of active seepages...|$|R
