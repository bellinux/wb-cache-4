The AC power was converted on board to power two 60 horsepower DC electric motors. The system used regenerative braking, converting the energy back through the DC motors to AC into the lines. Another rail, above the power rails, carried multiplexed frequency 'tones' that were decoded by the vehicles on-board controller into a 3-of-5 command sequence that was used to control all vehicle movement and station cycle functions. The heart of the on-board controller was a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer which interfaced with various vehicle subsystems via dual-redundant fail-safe <b>vital</b> <b>relay</b> logic.|$|R

50|$|Other NX style {{systems were}} {{implemented}} by other railroad signal providers. For example, Union Route (UR) was {{the brand name}} of their Entrance-Exit system supplied by Union Switch & Signal Co. (US&S), and introduced in 1951. NX type systems and their costly pre-solid state control logic only tended to be installed in the busier or more complicated terminal areas where it could increase capacity and reduce staffing requirements. In a move that was popular in Europe, the signalling for an entire area was condensed into a single large power signal box with a control panel in the operator's area and {{the equivalent of a}} telephone exchange in the floors below that combined the <b>vital</b> <b>relay</b> based interlocking logic and non-vital control logic in one place. Such advanced schemes would also include train describer and train tracking technologies. Away from complex terminals unit lever control systems remained popular until the 1980s when solid state interlocking and control systems began to replace the older relay plants of all types.|$|R

Manned space exploration has ceased due to the ease of life on Earth. The Second Doctor, Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Herriot arrive in a museum on Earth run by Professor Daniel Eldred dedicated to the obsolete technology of rockets. However, something goes amiss at the T-Mat <b>vital</b> <b>relay</b> station on the Moon and the system breaks down. With communications out, and no way to reach the Moon without T-Mat, those responsible for the system, Commander Radnor and his assistant Gia Kelly, turn to Professor Eldred to help. He has been privately building a rocket in hopes of re-igniting interest in space travel. In the absence of a space program to provide trained astronauts, the Doctor and his companions volunteer to crew the rocket. The Doctor also comments that the TARDIS is not suitable for short range use after Zoe informs Jamie that the TARDIS would most likely overshoot by a couple of million years.|$|R

40|$|The major pathwayfor visual {{information}} reaching cerebralcortex isthrough thelateralgeniculate nucleus(LGN) ofthethalamus. Acting on this <b>vital</b> <b>relay</b> is another thalamic nucleus, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). This nucleus receives topographically organized collaterals from both thalamus and cortex and sends similarly organized projections back to thalamus. The inputs to the TRN are excitatory, but the output {{back to the}} thalamic relay is inhibitory, providing an ideal organization for modulating visual activity during early processing. This functional architecture led Crick in 1984 to hypothesize that TRN serves to direct a searchlight of attention to {{different regions of the}} topographic map; however, despite the substantial influence of this hypothesis, the activity of TRN neurons has never been determined during an attention task. We have determined the nature of the response of visual TRN neurons in awake monkeys, and the modulation of that response as the monkeys shifted attention between visual and auditory stimuli. Visual TRN neurons had a strong (194 spikes/s) and fast (25 ms latency) transient increase of activity to spots of light falling in their receptive fields, as well as high background firing rate (45 spikes/s). When attention shifted to the spots of light, the amplitude of the transient visual response typically increased, whereas other neuronal response characteristics remained unchanged. Thus, as predicted previously, TRN activity is modified by shifts of visual attention, and these attentional changes could influence visual processing in LGN via the inhibitory connections back to the thalamus.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Britain was {{struggling}} with its Egyptian colony. Wilfrid Blunt was sent to notify Sir Edward Malet, the British agent, as to the Egyptian public opinion concerning the recent changes in government and development policies. In mid-December 1881, Blunt met with Ahmed ‘Urabi, known as Arabi or 'El Wahid' (the Only One) due to his popularity with the Egyptians. Arabi was impressed with Blunt's enthusiasm and appreciation of his culture. Their mutual respect created {{an environment in which}} Arabi could peacefully explain the reasoning behind a new patriotic movement, 'Egypt for the Egyptians'. Over the course of several days, Arabi explained the complicated background of the revolutionaries and their determination to rid themselves of the Turkish oligarchy.

40|$|The use of {{wireless}} mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) has gained rapid momentum, {{both in the}} commercial and non-commercial sectors. In the commercial sector, sensor networks are being considered for deployment {{for a wide variety}} of purposes including to sense robustness of elevators, bridges, and other structures and to explore the earth (e. g., oil, soil type, etc.). Examples in the noncommercial (military) sector include the use of MANETs in the battlefield. Regardless of the particular sector in which MANETs are being employed, one thing is common: MANETs are being used to collect, process, and <b>relay</b> <b>vital</b> information. As a result, it is critical that nodes in these networks be equipped to make decisions to ensure the integrity of information in an inherently unreliable environment. In this paper, we propose a Cross-layer Approach To Self-healing (CATS), in which nodes use information from each layer of the protocol stack to help the routing protocol maintain network reliability in the presence of failures. These actions serve both to provide uninterrupted communications amidst unforeseen failures and also to reduce packet latency and energy consumption. 1...|$|R
40|$|For {{practical}} use of safety-critical railway signalling systems, the system configurations that specific applications {{are created by}} customising a generic application according to track layouts and different local conditions are needed. In the 1980 s, computerised systems {{were introduced to the}} safety-critical field where the customisation had previously been carried out by means of using <b>vital</b> (fail-safe) <b>relays.</b> As a result, some problems have arisen: the conventional know-how that targets relay-circuit logic becomes ineffective, it is difficult to ensure the reliability of the configuration whose contents tend to be in a black box. To solve these problems, this study is intended to realise high-reliability and facilitation of the configurations by developing easy-to-understand and manageable technologies for general railway signalling engineers. First, this study proposes a method that the configuration data is represented as "relay-wiring data 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 by logical expressions in accordance with the relay-circuit logic. In this method, entered configuration data can be checked quickly in the relay-wiring diagram form on display and printout. Further, an algorithm represented in a table form is developed to automatically generate the relay-wiring data according to specifications data. Secondly, the study introduces the design diversity method into the configuration processes to ensure the validity of configuration data. This proposal shows practical applications of the design diversity fitting with the characteristics for each process, and provides a model representation that makes it easy to check the diversity process by using directed graph. In recent years, meanwhile, low-level configuration data is required in large numbers to create specific applications of the new type of automatic train control (ATC) system which generates train protection profile on onboard equipment where dynamic testing is not necessarily applicable. To solve this problem, new data validation methods by static analysis are proposed, using Extensible Markup Language (XML) technologies. These methods cover not only syntax but also semantic validations without custom application programming. Furthermore, the study analyses the error-proofing cases which are introduced to the Tokaido Shinkansen ATC data management system in order to ensure the reliability of the configuration, and proposes metrics to review and evaluate error-proofing systems by assigning hazard levels and work phases and by mapping the error-proofing principles. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{explore the}} lay {{understanding}} of cancer. Background Lay understanding of illness {{is shaped by}} social identity, personal biography and experience. It informs how ill health is defined, concerns are managed and interventions evaluated. An appreciation of lay understanding is therefore <b>vital</b> to enable <b>relay</b> of effective and appropriate health {{information to the public}} and care provision and support to patients. Design A qualitative systematic review using Thomas and Harden's (2008) approach to thematic synthesis. Data sources Key social science, nursing and medical databases, cancer organization websites for grey literature and a hand search of references retrieved from particularly relevant articles and journals. Review methods Thematic synthesis of eligible papers (studies on adults without a cancer diagnosis, generated from WHO-defined ‘high-income’ countries and published between 1990 – 2011). Only those focusing on the understanding of cancer, rather than screening or cancer genetics, were included. Results Six analytical themes were identified from 26 papers, generated from 25 studies. Explorations of the causes of cancer and interpretation of personal risk dominated the published work. These revealed a significant complexity in lay understanding. This review has also highlighted the need for additional work, particularly in gaining an understanding of the stigma and fear that surround cancer. Conclusion The themes identified by this review have the potential to inform the development of appropriate health promotion strategies and clinical services for those living with cancer and lead {{to a better understanding of}} problematic areas, such as late presentation, which continues to impede efforts to improve cancer survival...|$|R
40|$|Radiotelephony between {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} and pilots utilises standard phraseology as the medium of communications. Standard phraseology employs specific structure, terminology and pronunciation to ensure effectiveness and accuracy. On occasions when standard phraseology is found insufficient, plain language is used to efficiently <b>relay</b> <b>vital</b> information. By default, English is the designated language of communication between controllers and pilots of international flights. Deviations from the usage of standard phraseology and lack of language proficiency had been identified {{as one of the}} causal factors in safety occurrences. Language deficiencies, specifically of the non-native speakers of the English language, had raised much concern but there is limited information in the area. This research attempted to fill a small segment of this knowledge gap. It was focussed on the usage of standard phraseology and English language in an air traffic control environment involving English Second Language users. Audio data was sourced from routine radiotelephony recordings of ‘live’ air traffic control facilities in Malaysia to capture realistic communications between controllers and pilots in the Terminal Approach Radar, Area Radar and Aerodrome Control environments. A detailed cross sectional investigation of the radiotelephony characteristics, deficiencies and errors of transmitted messages revealed the radiotelephony performances of controllers and pilots in the environments. The recurrence of deviations from standards and occurrence of errors implied the likelihood of such deficiencies taking place. Demographic groups’ descriptions complemented the radiotelephony analyses as background information on language related training. The results were comparative to other similar studies and offered new information on English Second Language speakers in the Air Traffic Control environment.
