40|$|Broadcasting is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} method for disseminating information in vehicular networks. At high <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities,</b> the so-called broadcast storm problem degrades the efficiency of broadcasting. A so-called Irresponsible Forwarding (IF) scheme has recently been proposed in the literature that can effectively combat the broadcast storm problem. For messages consisting of multiple packets, the coupon collector problem also degrades the broadcast efficiency at all <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities.</b> In this paper, we extend the basic IF scheme to multi-packet messages, which we call the max-min IF, and combine it with Random Linear Coding (RLC) of packets at the source to solve the coupon collector problem and improve the broadcast efficiency of IF. Through discrete event simulations, with a widely accepted realistic vehicular mobility model based on cellular automata, we demonstrate that our IF+RLC scheme can significantly improve the reachability in sparsely connected vehicular networks at low <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities</b> as well as reduce the mean delay under high probability of collisions at high <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities...</b>|$|R

Such {{information can be}} obtained from a number of traffic management organizations. These organizations regularly collect information on <b>vehicle</b> volumes, <b>densities,</b> and speeds along road segments to improve congestion control, signalling, accident management, and other traffic attributes. A number of recent studies also propose innovative and accurate approaches to obtain such information including deployment of road side sensors and remote sensing imagery to obtain such information [37 – 40].|$|R

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory about 2D region of steady states of synchronized flow {{is contrary to}} the {{hypothesis of}} earlier traffic flow theories involving the fundamental diagram of traffic flow, which suppose a one-dimensional relationship between <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> and flow rate.|$|E
30|$|In SUMO, {{every street}} is {{assigned}} minimum and maximum speeds {{according to the}} digital map, and a functionality defines whether the street is a plain street, a source street or a sink street. For any given number of vehicles, every vehicle is randomly injected {{into one of the}} source streets. When it reaches a sink street, it is removed from the network and randomly regenerated in another source street, and this procedure continues over the simulation runtime. In order to generate realistic vehicular mobility traces, SUMO supports right-of-way rules at junctions, traffic regulations, and traffic lights. Also, additional weights are assigned to different streets to make them more or less attractive for vehicles when they arrive at junctions. We assigned the weights proportional to the average <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities</b> in the road topology stored in the digital map. We observed that after 2000 s the errors between the <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities</b> obtained in SUMO and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities</b> stored in the digital map became smaller than 5 % of the stored values for all the streets in the simulation area. Thus, we start sending packets in the network after 2000 s. All vehicle traces during the simulation time are saved in a log file, which is then used in the network simulator.|$|R

For this purpose the foremost emphasis is given on evaluating the delay, reliability, scalability, and mobility support criteria in realistic simulation environment with varying <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities,</b> transmission frequency, and average vehicle speed.|$|R
5000|$|In free traffic flow, {{empirical}} data show {{a positive correlation}} between the flow rate [...] (in vehicles per unit time) and <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> [...] (in vehicles per unit distance). This relationship stops at the maximum free flow [...] with a corresponding critical density [...] (See Figure 1.) ...|$|E
5000|$|There can {{be several}} {{mechanisms}} of vehicle over-acceleration. It {{can be assumed}} that on a multi-lane road the most probable mechanism of over-acceleration is lane changing to a faster lane. In this case, the F → S phase transitions are explained by an interplay of acceleration while overtaking a slower vehicle (over-acceleration) and deceleration to {{the speed of a}} slower-moving vehicle ahead (speed adaptation). Overtaking supports the maintenance of free flow. [...] "Speed adaptation" [...] on the other hand leads to synchronized flow. Speed adaptation will occur if overtaking is not possible. Kerner states that the probability of overtaking is an interrupted function of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> (Figure 6): at a given <b>vehicle</b> <b>density,</b> the probability of overtaking in free flow is much higher than in synchronized flow.|$|E
50|$|State A {{represents}} normal approaching traffic flow, {{again at}} speed vf. State U, with flowrate qu, {{corresponds to the}} queuing upstream of the truck. On the fundamental diagram, vehicle speed vu is slower than speed vf. But once drivers have navigated around the truck, they can again speed up and transition to downstream state D. While this state travels at free flow, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> is less because fewer vehicles get around the bottleneck.|$|E
30|$|The {{vehicular}} density β. The {{probability of}} having connectivity increases with the vehicular density. The density {{depends on the}} traffic conditions (i.e., {{the time of the}} day and road) and the type of road (i.e., there are roads more congested than others). <b>Vehicles</b> <b>density</b> and speed are usually correlated as well, since the minimum safety distance between vehicles depends on the speed [18].|$|R

30|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new model based {{approach}} and investigate its potential for the congestion detection in airborne optical remote sensing data. Instead of detecting each individual vehicle and then estimating its speed (microscopic model) as e.g. in [10, 11] we exploit a linear vehicle density-speed relationship for a road segment (macroscopic model) to derive vehicle speed from the estimated <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities</b> in an image.|$|R
50|$|Traffic behaves in {{a complex}} and {{nonlinear}} way, depending on the interactions {{of a large number}} of vehicles. Due to the individual reactions of human drivers, vehicles do not interact simply following the laws of mechanics, but rather display cluster formation and shock wave propagation, both forward and backward, depending on <b>vehicle</b> <b>density.</b> Some mathematical models of traffic flow use a vertical queue assumption, in which the vehicles along a congested link do not spill back along the length of the link.|$|E
5000|$|A {{macroscopic}} {{fundamental diagram}} (MFD) is {{type of traffic}} flow fundamental diagram that relates space-mean flow, density and speed of an entire network with n number of links as shown in Figure 1. The MFD thus represents the capacity, , of the network in terms of <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> with [...] being the maximum capacity of the network and [...] being the jam density of the network. The maximum capacity or “sweet spot” of the network is the region {{at the peak of}} the MFD function.|$|E
50|$|Kerner’s {{hypothesis}} is that homogeneous synchronized flow can occur anywhere in a two-dimensional region (2D) of the flow-density plane (2D-region S in Figure 4(a)). The set of possible free flow states (F) overlaps in <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> the set of possible states of homogeneous synchronized flow. The free flow states on a multi-lane road and states of homogeneous synchronized flow are separated by {{a gap in the}} flow rate and, therefore, by a gap in the speed at a given density: at each given density the synchronized flow speed is lower than the free flow speed.|$|E

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} network partitions, caused by low <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities,</b> {{on the performance of}} Vehicular Named- Data Networking (VNDN) applications. We target scenarios with high mobility and propose two different solutions. For cases with infrastructure support, we present the idea of VNDN agent delegation. For this approach, we develop a VNDN communication mechanism for Road Side Units (RSUs), we deploy it in RSUs along roads, and delegate content retrieval to these VNDN enabled RSUs. For cases with lack of infrastructure support, we propose a new solution called VNDN store carry forward (VNDN-SCF). In VNDN-SCF, we develop a new store-carry- forward mechanism for VNDN message retransmissions by vehicles, in the case of network partitions occurrence. Simulation results show that both solutions are scalable and efficient for mitigating the negative effects on communication links between vehicles, caused by low <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities</b> and high speeds simultaneously. Besides, our solutions also avoid the well-known problems of broadcast storms and message redundancy and address the effects of reverse path partitioning...|$|R
500|$|The {{research}} was conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory, and the findings were published in 2011. The study found little correlation between pedestrian <b>vehicle</b> involvement <b>density</b> and noise level {{for the majority of}} vehicles. In addition, the analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian <b>vehicle</b> involvement <b>densities</b> when only considering those accidents occurring on [...] or slower roads, or where the pedestrian was disabled. A previous study did not find an increased pedestrian <b>vehicle</b> involvement <b>density</b> for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts, which raised the question as to whether added sound is necessarily required. The study also noted that some modern conventional cars are as quiet as their electric counterparts, even at low speeds.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the various}} {{hovertrain}} systems were developing, a major energy use issue cropped up. Hovercraft generate lift by providing pressure, {{as opposed to}} generating lift due to the momentum of air flowing over an airfoil. The pressure of the air required {{is a function of}} the vehicle weight and the size of the lift pad, essentially a measure of overall <b>vehicle</b> <b>density.</b> A non-moving vehicle only loses this air due to leakage around the pads, which can be very low depending on the relative pressure between the pad and the outside atmosphere, and further reduced by introducing a [...] "skirt" [...] to close the gap between the pad and running surface as much as possible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{solution}} {{appeared to}} be a [...] "mini-subway", one that was small enough that the routes did not require the same sort of capital costs as a conventional system. However, using traditional technology to implement such a system would not work, as the required distance between vehicles on a subway system, known as headway, was often several minutes. [...] This would mean a low <b>vehicle</b> <b>density,</b> and, if this was combined with a small number of passengers per vehicle, a very low overall passenger capacity. If such a system was to be practical, the distance between the vehicles had to be reduced, something that the emerging computer market appeared able to address.|$|E
5000|$|Kerner’s jam feature J can be {{explained}} as follows. The motion of the downstream jam front results from acceleration of drivers from a standstill within the jam to traffic flow downstream of the jam. After a vehicle has begun to accelerate escaping from the jam, to satisfy safety driving, the following vehicle begins to accelerate with a time delay. We denote the mean value of this time delay in vehicle acceleration at the downstream jam front by [...] Because the average distance between vehicles within the jam, including average vehicle length, equals [...] (where [...] is the average <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> within the jam), the mean velocity of the downstream jam front [...] is ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Communication is {{essential}} for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Vehicular network have envisioned various applications that greatly improve traffic safety and efficiency along the roads and highways. Vehicular networks could use both short-range (e. g. Wi-Fi, DSCR) and long-range (e. g. 2 G, 3 G, 4 G) communication technologies for sharing and distributing information among vehicles. Despite it?s promising; it is not fully deployed to benefit from it. One reason is the different challenges of vehicular network communication that should be answered and solved. Among the major challenging issue of vehicular network is capacity. Many information services and applications compete for the available network capacity, especially in urban areas i. e. high <b>vehicles</b> <b>density.</b> The guaranteed network capacity per each vehicle depends on <b>vehicles</b> <b>density,</b> different information source, and mobility, and used wireless technologies. It is a difficult task to estimate the individual vehicles? available network capacity. This thesis examines different aspects that affect available network capacity. Then design a simulation model, which comprises all aspects that affect network capacity. And Using different simulation scenario, we analyzed the performance experienced by individual vehicles and also study the effect of different aspects that affects network capacity. </p...|$|R

In our future study, we study how duty cycle of CCH/SCH improve the performance of the network. In addition, we will study the optimal deployment of RSUs in a VANET to enhance the network performance. The RSUs' optimal deployment is required because of variable <b>vehicle</b> <b>densities</b> in different geographical areas.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{modes of}} public {{transport}} in the Philippines are jeepneys, buses, taxis, trains and tricycles, {{all of which}} are readily available in Metro Manila. The introduction of transportation apps Grab and Uber came in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and further widening the options of public transport. The Philippine traffic is considered as the world’s 9th worst in 2015 by Numbeo despite this range of public transport options. Although there is a wide array of choices, the public still spend an average of 45.5 minutes before reaching their workspace. This is why most Filipinos still find travelling inconvenient via public transport due to the high <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> and the unavoidable traffic congestion according to Euromonitor’s Consumer Lifestyles in the Philippines (2015).|$|E
5000|$|Kerner {{explains}} {{the nature of}} the F → S phase transitions by a competition of [...] "speed adaptation" [...] and [...] "over-acceleration". Speed adaptation is defined as the vehicle deceleration to the speed of a slower moving preceding vehicle. Over-acceleration is defined as the vehicle acceleration occurring even if the preceding vehicle does not drive faster than the vehicle and the preceding vehicle additionally does not accelerate. In Kerner’s theory, the probability of over-acceleration is a discontinuous function of the vehicle speed: At the same <b>vehicle</b> <b>density,</b> probability of over-acceleration in free flow is greater than in synchronized flow. When within a local speed disturbance speed adaptation is stronger than over-acceleration, an F → S phase transition occurs. Otherwise, when over-acceleration is stronger than speed adaptation the initial disturbance decays over time. Within a region of synchronized flow, a strong over-acceleration is responsible for a return transition from synchronized flow to free flow (S → F transition).|$|E
5000|$|Yves Boquet, in {{his paper}} Battling Congestion in Manila: The EDSA Problem, quotes Robert Cervero in saying globalization, {{outsourcing}} and relocating {{much of the}} manufacturing activities {{are just some of}} the other causes that add to the high population in Metro Manila. These activities are mainly responsible for the influx that was previously mentioned. These activities are creating the job that appeal to people in the province to make the move. More people in the city plus the rise in the purchasing power of most people in developing Asian countries, added to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>density</b> of in Metro Manila. [...] An example of this purchasing power, according to Euromonitor’s Consumer Lifestyles in the Philippines (2015), is that young professionals in the Metro tend to buy smaller cars such as Toyota Wigo, Mitsubishi Mirage and Honda Jazz. This is due to the affordability of said cars but also the added bonus of not using public transport.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we present}} an {{experiment}} {{that was designed}} to investigate the performance gain introduced by our solution. Compared to the ETSI standards, our packets are 4 bytes longer for CAM messages (single hop topology broadcast), but 44 bytes shorter for DENM messages (multi-hop geo-broadcast). This difference in size is the result of our specific header design and removal of unnecessary data redundancy.
