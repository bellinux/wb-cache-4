40|$|Here, Ground {{moving target}} {{indication}} (GMTI) using {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) is considered. SAR GMTI requires that <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> between the target and the SAR platform {{is included in the}} detection algorithm. A separation between the true <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> and the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> used in the SAR process will cause unfocused targets, and decrease detectability. Blind hypotheses of <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> are used in the detection phase of moving targets in SAR. The step size between the hypotheses (or discretisation step) in <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> involves a trade off between the number of hypotheses to test and detectability. A large number of tests will increase detectability but will also increase computation load and vice versa. The relevance of <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> increases as the azimuth integration time gets larger. Long integration time is associated with low signature moving target detection in strong clutter environments, or for SAR GMTI at low frequencies. The optimum discretisation of normalised <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> for moving target detection has been determined. The optimum discretisation is derived from the moving target impulse response. Use of optimum discretisation reduces the computation burden in SAR GMTI and secures the detectability. [URL]...|$|R
30|$|Scene {{selection}} was retrieved by the crowding {{degree in the}} shuttle bus and <b>relative</b> <b>speed.</b> This survey provided two levels of in-vehicle congestion and three levels of <b>relative</b> <b>speed.</b> According to passenger behavior survey, the paper assumed the crowding degree in URT was crowded and two levels of crowding in the shuttle bus were set: abundant standing space and crowed. In addition, as the average travel speed of URT is 3 – 4 {{times higher than the}} bus and 88  % of the respondents in passenger behavior survey expect the <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> is 1 / 2 or more of the URT, three levels of <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> were set: 1 / 2, 1 / 4, 1 / 6.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{influence}} of performance level, age and gender on pacing during a 100 -km ultramarathon. Results of a 100 -km race incorporating the World Masters Championships were used to identify differences in <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> in each 10 -km segment between participants finishing in the first, second, third and fourth quartiles of overall positions (Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Similar analyses were performed between the top and bottom 50 % of finishers in each age category, as well as within male and female categories. Pacing varied between athletes achieving different absolute performance levels. Group 1 ran at significantly lower <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than all other groups in the first three 10 -km segments (all P < 0. 01), and significantly higher <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than Group 4 in the 6 th and 10 th (both P < 0. 01), and Group 2 in the 8 th (P = 0. 04). Group 4 displayed significantly higher <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than Group 2 and 3 in the first three segments (all P < 0. 01). Overall strategies remained consistent across age categories, although a similar phenomenon was observed within each category whereby ‘top’ competitors displayed lower <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> than ‘bottom’ competitors in the early stages, but higher <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> in the later stages. Females showed lower <b>relative</b> starting <b>speeds</b> and higher finishing speeds than males. ‘Top’ and ‘bottom’ finishing males displayed differing strategies, but this was not the case within females. Although pacing remained consistent across age categories, it differed with level of performance within each, possibly suggesting strategies are anchored on direct competitors. Strategy differs between genders and differs depending on performance level achieved in males but not females...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) a {{specific}} wire run-off speed {{is applied to}} compensate wear and avoid wire breakage. Since the workpiece generally stays stationary and short discharge durations are applied, the relative displacement between wire and workpiece during one single discharge is very small. In Wire Electrical Discharge Dressing (WEDD), however, the workpiece rotates at very high circumferential speeds, since dressing is usually performed at grinding speeds. In this work the influence of <b>relative</b> <b>speed</b> in WEDM is assessed. Single discharge experiments were first carried out using circumferential speeds up to 80 m/s. The plasma channel was found to easily slide over the anode, creating elongated craters, and higher removal per single discharge was measured for higher <b>relative</b> <b>speeds.</b> A thermo-electrical model was used to help understand the process, showing that higher melting efficiencies can be reach as <b>relative</b> <b>speeds</b> are increased. The model was also used to predict damages to diamonds grains used in metal bonded grinding wheels.
