5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and <b>visual</b> <b>performance</b> with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E

25|$|VJing (pronounced: VEE-JAY-ing) {{is a broad}} {{designation}} for realtime <b>visual</b> <b>performance.</b> Characteristics of VJing are {{the creation}} or manipulation of imagery in realtime through technological mediation and for an audience, in synchronization to music. VJing often takes place at events such as concerts, nightclubs, music festivals and sometimes {{in combination with other}} performative arts. This results in a live multimedia performance that can include music, actors and dancers. The term VJing became popular in its association with MTV's Video Jockey but its origins date back to the New York club scene of the 70s. In both situations VJing is the manipulation or selection of visuals, the same way DJing is a selection and manipulation of audio.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{attention}} {{is the process}} where objects in one location are chosen for processing over objects in another location. This would imply that neglect is more intentional. The patient has an affinity to direct attention to the unaffected side. Neglect {{is caused by a}} decrease in stimuli in the contralesional side {{because of a lack of}} ipsilesional stimulation of the visual cortex and an increased inhibition of the contralesional side. In this theory neglect is seen as disorder of attention and orientation caused by disruption of the visual cortex. Patients with this disorder will direct attention and movements to the ipsilesional side and neglect stimuli in the contralesional side despite having preserved visual fields. The result of all of this is an increased sensitivity of <b>visual</b> <b>performance</b> in the unaffected side. The patient shows an affinity to the ipsilesional side being unable to disengage attention from that side.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, under {{different}} titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to twisted nematic field effect LCDs (TN- and STN- LCDs). One approach {{was to use}} interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To {{take full advantage of}} the properties of this In Plane Switching (IPS) technology further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable <b>visual</b> <b>performance</b> for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E

[...] And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his debt.

[...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work.

The lack of character development for the protagonist Ethan Winters was disparaged as well, with Reiner stating that the plot suffered flaws of inconsistency from this approach. Also subject to criticism was the required body movements while in seated VR mode, which were described as stomach-churning.
