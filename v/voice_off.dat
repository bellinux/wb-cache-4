500|$|In 1999, Spears {{began work}} on her second studio album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), in Sweden and Switzerland. After meeting with Robert Lange in Switzerland, the singer started to record several songs for the album, {{including}} [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know". After finishing the track, Spears revealed {{in an interview with}} Billboard that [...] "with the first album, I didn't get to show my <b>voice</b> <b>off.</b> The songs were great, but they weren't very challenging. This song is incredible. It's going to surprise people in the best way." [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was written and produced by Robert Lange, while additional lyrics were written by his then-wife Shania Twain and Keith Scott. Spears recorded her vocals for the song between November and December 1999 at Robert Lange's and Shania Twain's chateau in La-Tour-de Peilz, Switzerland, and it was later mixed by Nigel Green and programmed by Cory Churko, Kevin Churko and Richard Meyer. During a live concert at Hawaii, included on her second home video release Live and More! (2000), Spears said the song is one of her favourites on Oops!... I Did It Again. [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was released on January 17, 2001 as the final single from the album.|$|E

"In {{contrast}} to the general run of lecturer, who might read from a sheaf of tattered pages in a monologue or employ distracting bombast—or make failed attempts at humor—a driven Williams would engage his auditors with rapid-fire volleys in a conversational <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> the cuff without lectern, text, or notes. He {{knew what he wanted}} to say, and he said it without missing a beat. He used simple declaratory sentences with hardly a dependent clause and no filler-type utterances such as 'uh', 'as it were', or 'you know'. If transcribed, his fast 50-minute expositions might have required twice the pages of those of others, so much ground he covered." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "A full-chorded {{grand piano}} gives the song a rolling, even motion {{and a certain}} {{austerity}} of mood. Browne plays his <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> the piano's restrained tone, soaring up from his own basically understated vocal in mid-verse and chorus. This underplaying of mood lights Jackson's simple but evocative images with a muted radiance that aurally captures the look of McCabe and Mrs. Miller. While the music sets the tone, Browne deftly tells the tale, his imagery charged with vivid suggestion. ... Much of the dramatic force of [...] "Jamaica" [...] derives from its gorgeous choruses.

He reacted: [...] "I was into that, man", and said he understood why the cover became a viral video. However, Derulo was unfamiliar with the group's music {{at the time and}} had to [...] "research" [...] their discography which he ultimately became fond of. Group member Jade Thirlwall felt the song's slow tempo was [...] "a nice change" [...] for Derulo and [...] "showed his <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> a lot". A piano-driven solo sequel of the song, [...] "Secret Love Song Pt. II", was included on the deluxe version of Get Weird.|$|E
50|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{the arrival of}} sound brought a revolution in film-making. But (...) the early times were marked by disorientation on how to master the new technique. The cinematographic idiom, having reached a splendorous high by those years, was made to regress almost to its early stages by {{the demands of the}} complicated sound machinery, still cameras restricted to the recording of long dialogue declamations in tedious closeups, such that some commentators did not anticipate a sustained future for the “talkies”. Mamoulian’s role in inverting the slippage was profound, eventually making sound and talk an essential element of the narrative in cinema. Applause, his first work in Hollywood, is from the outset an inescapable witness of this process of change, exploring <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> and sound overlay, which, at the time, technicians considered impossible. (...) Applause became (...) the true “first great sound picture in the world”.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States presidential election, 1964, {{aggressive}} advertising {{paved the}} way for a landslide victory for Lyndon B. Johnson. One of the first negative and maybe the most controversial commercial, perhaps of all time, was an advertisement dubbed [...] "The Daisy Girl." [...] The commercial showed a young girl picking the petals off a daisy. After she finishes counting, a <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> camera begins a countdown to a nuclear explosion. The ad ends with an appeal to vote Johnson, [...] "because the stakes are too high for you to stay home." [...] The commercial used fear and guilt, an effective advertising principle, to make people take action to protect the next generation. The ad ran for under a minute and only aired once, but due to the right wing, pro-war views of Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate, it resulted in a 44 to 6 state victory for Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E

First, Mr. Tinkles makes his sinister and talking side known to Sophie, causing her to faint, then he and his cats take Mr Mason's comatose body to Mason's Christmas tree flocking plant, where Tinkles passes his <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> as Mr Mason to send the employees home and commandeer the factory for the next plot. The cats send soccer tickets to an exhibition game between Uruguay and Chad to the Brody family, obviously a ruse. The cats make a fake entry and when the Brody family pulls up, the cats throw a gas bomb into their car, which goes off in a tremendous explosion and leaves the family unconscious.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with WiLD 94.9, Skylar Grey revealed that {{the genesis of the}} song's recording was when Eminem invited her and Alex da Kid to Detroit to work on his upcoming studio album with him and Dr. Dre. She said that she and da Kid came to the studio with the hook and [...] "the track" [...] prepared; and Eminem loved it. Eminem had then gone into the back room, and came out two hours later, and said that he was done writing his verses. Grey also said that she was in tears when she heard Eminem's verses {{for the first time and}} that da Kid initially proposed featuring Lady Gaga on the hook, but Eminem insisted on having Grey's vocals, and said that they were not taking her <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> the track. In the song Eminem raps two verses about his mentor, thanking Dre for believing in him in his early days and returning the favor, before Dre delivers the song's final verse.|$|E

5000|$|The song first {{appeared}} in Streets of Fire, where it was performed by the fictional group The Sorels.

In a Songfacts interview with the film's musical director, Kenny Vance, he recalled [...] "The same guy that sings lead on that and [...] "Countdown to Love," [...] a song that I wrote for the film, was a guy working at a Radio Shack (Winston Ford), and I think {{when you look at}} the film and The Sorels are singing it live in the movie, that was the version that was supposed to come out, and I recorded that version. But then when Dan Hartman heard it, I don't know what happened next, but I know that he took that guy's <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> and he put his own on, and he had a hit with it.

Toby's been with the band for a long time. Toby has written songs forever ... One day he asked me, 'Is it all right if I go out to Belmont and record?' I said yeah. I knew he was out here messing around, and one night I get a phone call. He says, 'Hey, come out here, I want you to listen to something I wrote.' My reaction was, 'I'm having dinner. I had planned to play with the boys.' He said, 'It would really mean a lot to me.' So I come out here. He's out here by himself and he's got all the machines going. I came out here and he said, 'Help me write this song.' So we wrote a song and it wasn't very good. I said, 'Is this all you've got done?' And he said, 'No, I've got something I want to play you.' He played me 'Emotional Love,' and I (couldn't believe it)[...] [...] [...] We took his track, took his <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> and put mine on, added some guitars and some background vocal parts.

The [...] "hits" [...] serve as a series of references which survey the literary and philosophical landscape as relates to drugs. [...] "Toward a Narcoanalysis" [...] consolidates the text's itinerary to an account of the sort of analysis Ronell begins to explore by appealing to Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary.

[...] "Shame" [...] highlights something like the downsizing of interpretation as it only occupies eight pages and draws the reader's attention to the possibility that the text experiments with the potential indifference between drugs and texts. [...] "Scoring Literature" [...] makes up the largest portion of the text and includes nineteen subsections along with a [...] "Doctor's Report" [...] of E. Bovary. [...] "Cold Turkey: or, The Transcendental Aesthetic to be Eaten" [...] is formatted as three installations, three nano-installations, and two nano-intervals of a theatrical play where Ronell convokes Ernst Jünger, Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Marguerite Faust, Marguerite Duras, Freud, Irma, <b>Voice</b> <b>Off,</b> Nietzsche, Saint Theresa, Emma B, Walter Benjamin, chorus, priest, and delusions of a non-addict.|$|E

[...] —Spears {{reflects}} on ...Baby One More Time in December 1999. Spears was credited with leading the revival of teen pop. The Daily Yomiuri reported that [...] "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just {{has to make a}} scene." [...] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, [...] "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." [...] Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, [...] "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice ... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single ... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a [...] "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." [...] Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album [...] "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." [...] In 2010, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E

As a hearing man in a deaf family, he is called upon to interpret speech into sign language, [...] "voice" [...] ASL into speech, or switch his <b>voice</b> <b>off</b> completely and purely sign. Whenever Dan is alone with any member of his deaf family, he would only sign and not use his voice (unless indicated). All the deaf characters of the play - Laura, Max, Sally, Adam, Dr. Walters - use only American Sign Language. They are simultaneously [...] "voiced" [...] or [...] "voice acted" [...] {{from the side of the}} stage by a member of the company. When Dan switches off his voice and purely signs, he is simultaneously [...] "voiced" [...] by a company member. The company must be four hearing actors who sign.

They perform three functions: to [...] "voice" [...] the actors who sign, to sign the actors who speak and to step forward as the supporting players. Deaf audience member experience this play signed entirely in their language. Hearing audience members - most who know nothing about sign language - have the experience of watching the play in sign language while hearing it acted at the same time. Two languages become one."

50|$|Cumming’s first video, A Prayer for Nettie (1995, winner, Telefilm Canada Video Prize for Canadian Discoveries, 1996), was an elegiac work {{produced}} {{following the}} death of Cumming’s long-time subject and collaborator, Nettie Harris, who also featured centrally in Pretty Ribbons. A Prayer for Nettie also marks Cumming’s transition from photography to video, and features several of the individuals who had figured in Cumming’s photographic work, including Albert Ross Smith, Raymond Beaudoin, Joyce Donnison, Nelson Coombs, Gerald Harvey, and Geoffrey Bates. An additional cast of characters is introduced in Cumming’s 1996 video, Cut the Parrot, a video produced for the deceased Albert and introducing Beatrice Johnson, Elizabeth Barclay, Susan Thomson, James Carter, and Gordon Alexander. In the 1997 After Brenda (winner, Barbara Aronofsky Latham Memorial Award, 11th Annual Dallas Video Festival, 1998), Cumming introduces Colin Kane and Pierre Lamarche, who figure centrally in subsequent video works Erratic Angel (1998, winner, Telefilm Canada Prize for the best Canadian Short or Medium-Length Film or Video, 1998) and Petit Jésus, respectively. Four Storeys (1999) focuses on Colleen Faber who, with Kane, is a lead character in the 2000 work if only I. Martin Corbin, who makes a short appearance in if only I, is the main focus of My Dinner With Weegee (2001, winner, Best Quebec Documentary, Quebec Cinema Critics Award, 2002). Harvey returns in <b>Voice</b> <b>Off</b> (2003), accompanied by Gordon Verge, who was featured in the short video Wrap (2000). Cumming’s subjects regularly make cameo appearances in the form of photographs and voice-overs in many of Cumming’s other videos, reflecting what Marcy Goldberg has written about Cumming’s work: “…it wouldn’t be a classic Cumming work if it weren’t also a commentary on the activity of capturing other people in still and moving images. The multiple meanings of the film’s title—anthropological, aesthetic and scientific-biological—hint at the multifaceted nature of the impulse to document other people’s lives.” Cumming’s video works from 2005 to 2009, which include Fountain (2005), 3 (2007), Monument (2008), and Pencils, Ashes, Matches & Dust (2009) take on more abstract and conceptual forms, his 2010 Too Many Things marking a return to his long-time community of human subjects. In the tragi-comedy Exit Interview (2014), this shrinking community's resident documentary filmmaker is being fired. Out of Kerr's Suitcase (2016) reunites Cumming with two characters who first appeared in his photographic cycle Reality and Motive in Documentary Photography (1986) as they reminisce about lives lived before the camera.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} turn {{children}} into consumers, the audiovisual medium drives their attention by resorting to {{any number of}} techniques using colour, sound, images, simple rhymes and brief messages, as well as quick cuts, which are conducive to automatic processing. The {{aim of this study}} is to study what elements boys and girls perceive in the advertising of products, and if there are any differences in the elements perceived by each gender. The study was carried out on 22 boys and 16 girls aged 10 to 11 years old. Four audiovisual (TV) commercials for products targeted at a young audience, broadcast in time bands devoted to children's television programmes, were chosen: 1) a commercial for a toy commonly consumed by boys, 2) a commercial for a toy commonly consumed by girls, and 3) and 4) commercials for sports shoes used by both boys and girls. After the commercial was shown, the subjects were asked to answer a questionnaire on the elements perceived. The results show the visual and auditory elements children perceived in each commercial, as well as the differences in audiovisual processing between boys and girls. Thus, while boys visually perceived the product itself (the tangible), girls perceived the action (the intangible), and while boys auditorily perceived the <b>voice</b> <b>off,</b> girls more commonly perceived the sounds of music...|$|E
