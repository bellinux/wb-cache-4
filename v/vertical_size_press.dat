40|$|AbstractThe {{ratio of}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>sizes</b> of {{corresponding}} features in the two eyes' retinal images depends both on the associated object's distance and on its horizontal direction relative to the head (eccentricity). It is known that manipulations of <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratio can affect perceived distance, size, depth and shape. We examined how observers use the <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratio to determine the viewing distance. Do they use the horizontal gradient of <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratio, or do they combine the <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratio itself with the eccentricity at which it is found? Distance scaling (as measured by having subjects set an ellipsoid's size and shape to match a tennis ball) was no better when the judged object was 30 ° {{to the right of}} the head (where <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratios vary considerably with distance) than when it was located straight ahead. Distance scaling improved when vertical disparities were presented within larger visual fields, irrespective of where this was relative to the head. Our results support the proposal that subjects use the horizontal gradient of <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratio to estimate the distance of an object that they are looking at...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe azimuth of a {{stimulus}} {{relative to the}} head can be determined from an extra-retinal, eye-position signal plus {{an estimate of the}} retinal eccentricity of the image. Alternatively, azimuth could be determined from retinal-image information alone. Specifically, stimulus azimuth could be estimated from two derivatives of <b>vertical</b> disparity: <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratio (which varies with azimuth), and the horizontal gradient of <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> ratio (a measure of distance). Here we examine the determinants of perceived azimuth in viewing conditions that, theoretically, should favor the use of vertical disparity. We find no evidence that vertical disparity is used.

40|$|Abstract“da Vinci stereopsis” {{is defined}} as depth seen in a monocular object {{occluded}} by a binocular one, and the visual system must solve its depth ambiguity [Nakayama, K., & Shimojo, S. (1990). da Vinci stereopsis: Depth and subjective occluding contours from unpaired image points. Vision Research, 30, 1811 – 1825]. Although fused images include various pictorial features, effects of pictorial depth cues have never been systematically investigated in da Vinci stereopsis. To examine this, we created stereograms consisting of a monocular bar flanked by binocular bars with a fixed large horizontal separation, in which the monocular bar induced a subjective occluding edge. Manipulating <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> or contrast of the bars could affect {{the depth of the}} monocular bar. Conflicting these cues revealed that the effect of <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> was stronger than that of contrast in all our subjects. Measurements of the depth indicated that the relative <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> of the bars quantitatively determined the perceived depth, of which levels had large inter-subject differences. All these experiments indicate that the visual system can use the pictorial depth cues as a constraint to determine the depth of monocular elements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Linear transformations (shear or scale transformations) {{of either}} {{horizontal}} or vertical disparity {{give rise to}} the percept of slant or inclination. It has been proposed that the percept of slant induced by <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> disparity, known as Ogle's induced-size effect, and the analogous induced-shear effect, compensate for scale and shear distortions arising from aniseikonia, eccentric viewing, and cyclodisparity. We hypothesised that these linear transformations of vertical disparity are processed more slowly than equivalent transformations of horizontal disparity (horizontal shear and size disparity). We studied the temporal properties of the stereoscopic slant and inclination percepts that arose when subjects viewed stereograms with various combinations of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> or shear disparities. We found {{no evidence to support}} our hypothesis. There were no clear differences in the build-up of percepts of slant or inclination induced by step changes in horizontal size or shear disparity and those induced by step changes in <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> or shear disparity. Perceived slant and inclination decreased in a similar manner with increasing temporal frequency for modulations of transformations of both horizontal and vertical disparity. Considerable individual differences were found and several subjects experienced slant reversal, particularly with oscillating stimuli. An interesting finding was that perceived slant induced b...|$|R

The horizontal-vertical betatron coupling and vertical dispersion were measured and corrected to small values in the TLS 1. 5 GeV storage ring. Estimated beam sizes are compared with the measured values. By employing an effective transverse damping system, the vertical beam blow-up due to transverse coherent instabilities, such as the fast-ion beam instability, was suppressed. As a result, the light source is very stable. In NSRRC we are designing an ultra low emittance 3 -GeV storage ring and its designed <b>vertical</b> beam <b>size</b> could be as small as a few microns.

This cell called '"integrated cascode"' has been designed in order to propose a strong decrease in term of circuit size for Power Amplifier (PA). The technology used relies on 0. 25 -µm GaAs Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistors (PHEMT) of United Monolithic Semiconductors (UMS) foundry. A distributed approach is proposed in order to model this power cell. The challenge consists to obtain, with a better shape factor (ratio between the <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>sizes</b> of the transistor), the same performances than a single transistor with the same gate development. In order to design a 2 W amplifier, we have used two 12 × 100 µm transistors. Cascode <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> is 413 µm whereas a transistor with the same gate development exhibits a <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> of 790 µm. Therefore the shape factor is nearly one as compared to a shape factor of 4 for a classical parallel architecture.

40|$|Anterior – either {{alveolar}} or skeletal – infraocclusions {{are known}} as recurrent pathologies, creating problems of etiological, functional and aesthetic type. Aim. The study aims at evidencing the difficulties of the treatment of anterior infraocclusions {{and the impact of}} the premolar or molar extractions upon facial and profile aesthetics. Materials and method. The study was performed on a reference group of 12 patients with infraocclusions associated to a skeletal class III, with a hyper-divergent growth scheme. The cephalometric architectural study of the <b>vertical</b> <b>size</b> by the Danguy method permitted evaluation of the various therapeutical effects upon the <b>vertical</b> <b>size.</b> Results and discussion. The possibility of a precocious interception of an infraocclusion, concomitantly with the interception of a skeletal class III, modifies the intermaxillary ratios, re-establishes the prehension organ and reduces the masticator angle. Reduction of the NpEs-Tm masticator angle was observed both in patients with premolar and molar extractions, being less important in cases of molar extractions, as due to the pressure of lingual interposition. As a matter of fact, similar skeletal modifications could be observed in the patients with molar extractions, the skeletal modifications in the patients with premolar extraction being slightly different. No matter if the patient was a child or an adolescent, correction of an anterior infraocclusion has always improved facial and smile aesthetics. Conclusions. Trophic infraocclusions represent a real challenge for the realization of an orthodontic treatment. Premolar extractions improve the prehension organ, while molar extractions solve the problems of the posterior and anterior direction, even if it is not certain whether these extractions could change the <b>vertical</b> <b>size...</b>|$|R
