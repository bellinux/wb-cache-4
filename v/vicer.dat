50|$|By some joke, Iconah {{comes back}} to the day of his fifth {{birthday}} in his child form. His father explains they have to repeat everything again. After destroying two waves of organic ships, Iconah then enters another portal. There, he finds the rest of his fleet who he manages to convince he is real. Defeating the three gate guardians, the fleet escapes the time zone created by the Heart. Iconah is then reunited with Juno who had spent 50 years in the distant past, planning on eliminating all aliens before they can attack Earth in the future. Iconah attacks the Juno but he escapes. He then makes contact with the Lapis. He goes to the Lapis homeworld and makes an alliance with the Lapis. The Lapis and Iconah defeat the Inquisition. He stops the mad <b>vicer</b> and restores the time line.|$|E
