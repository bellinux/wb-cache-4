40|$|Advanced {{emphysema}} is a {{lung disease}} in which alveolar capillary units are destroyed and supporting tissue is lost. The combined effect of reduced gas exchange {{and changes in}} airway dynamics impairs expiratory airflow and leads to progressive air trapping. Pharmacological therapies have limited effects. Surgical resection of the most destroyed sections of the lung can improve pulmonary function and exercise capacity but its benefit is tempered by significant morbidity.

During dehiscence, mechanical energy stored in specialized tissues is transferred to the seeds to increase their kinetic and potential energies. The resulting seed dispersal patterns have been investigated in some ballistic dispersers, but the mechanical performance of a launch mechanism of this type has not been measured. The properties of the energy storage tissue and the energy transfer efficiency of the launch mechanism were quantified in Impatiens capensis. In this species the valves forming the seed pod wall store mechanical energy. Their mass specific energy storage capacity (124 [*]J kg− 1) was comparable with that of elastin and spring steel. The energy storage capacity of the pod tissues was determined by their level of hydration, suggesting a role for turgor pressure in the energy storage mechanism.

This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the energy cost impacts of a range of common system faults in variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems, which are widely adopted for their good part-load energy efficiency. The faults studied include room air temperature sensor offset, stuck VAV box damper, supply air temperature sensor offset, stuck outdoor air damper and stuck/leaking cooling <b>coil</b> <b>valve.</b> The simulation results indicate that some faults may significantly increase energy use in buildings, for example, negative room air temperature sensor offset, stuck open VAV box damper, negative supply air temperature sensor offset, stuck open outdoor air damper and stuck open and leaking cooling <b>coil</b> <b>valve.</b> Since building occupants may adapt to the symptoms of these faults, such as reduced room air temperature, and thus may not complain about them, the occurrence of such faults are not immediately apparent unless a FDD system is available.

Landward {{of the shelf}} margin on the shallow marine Comanche Shelf rudists built circular and elongate bioherms with coarse-grained flank deposits.

40|$|In the U. S. A Variable Air Volume (VAV) {{system is}} one of most {{commonly}} used air system for multiple-zone commercial buildings due to its capability to meet the varying heating and cooling loads of different building thermal zones. One of key component of VAV system is the terminal VAV box. There are an air damper and a reheat coil in the box. How to effectively and efficiently control the VAV box {{plays a significant role}} to reduce energy consumption and maintain acceptable indoor environment in buildings. Currently, there are two control logics used for controlling VAV box, namely, single maximum and dual maximum control logics. The single maximum logic is the most common, where the room temperature setpoint is maintained by only adjusting the reheat <b>coil</b> <b>valve</b> position in the heating model. The damper position is kept as the minimal to satisfy the ventilation requirement only. On the other hand, the more advanced dual maximum control logic realizes the room air temperature control by adjusting both damper position and reheat <b>coil</b> <b>valve</b> position in the heating model. For the cooling model, both control logics have the same action to maintain room air temperature setpoint through adjusting the damper position. Â In this study, a model-based optimal control is explored to minimize the energy consumption of the VAV box with a hot water reheat coil. Data driven approach based on an Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model is investigated to represent dynamics of the room thermal response.

Endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) has been proposed for the treatment of advanced emphysema, with the aim of obtaining the same clinical and functional advantages of surgical lung volume reduction whilst potentially reducing risks and costs. There is a growing body of evidence that certain well-defined sub-groups of patients with advanced emphysema may benefit from ELVR, provided the selection criteria are met and a systematic approach is followed.

40|$|Computer {{modeling}} {{is quickly}} becoming a more accessible method {{to evaluate the}} performance of complex building systems, {{due in part to}} the recent advance in computing power over the last decade. Rising energy costs, stricter building codes, the threat of global climate change and governmental pressure have all influenced building owners, architects, engineers and system operators to design and operate the world 2 ̆ 7 s building stock in a more energy efficient manner. Particularly important in large buildings and campuses are the hydronic flow networks that deliver chilled water to the cooling coils in air handling units for the purpose of regulating temperature and humidity in occupied spaces. Large buildings are especially dominated by cooling loads, thus making it a priority for many to evaluate such hydronic systems for their energy performance characteristics. The design and operation of these hydronic systems are being optimized with the help of computers, in both new building stock and retrofits in order to reduce energy consumption. A common problem that has been well documented over the last few decades is that of delta-T degradation, the decrease in the temperature difference between the supply and return flow of water from the design value over time. Most central plants are designed to deliver chilled water to respective buildings or air handling units at a relatively constant temperature. Typically chilled water is delivered to each branch circuit, which for this example will consist of piping, a cooling coil and a control <b>valve.</b> <b>Coils</b> are selected based on the cooling power needed and a design delta-T value. The flow rate of water through each cooling coil is adjusted to meet demand; therefore with a constant delta-T, an increase in cooling demand would necessitate a proportional increase in the flow rate of water. There is a slight disconnect between manufacturer data on cooling coils and what actually happens in real systems. Coils are selected based on design values and assumed supply conditions, although installed characteristics of the coil can be quite different from that of the manufacturer specification sheet. For instance, a coil may be selected based on a specific supply water temperature, but if the supply water temperature rises, due to an overloaded central plant, the amount of cooling power delivered will be considerably less then design value. Coil performance can also degrade over time due to coil fouling on either the waterside or airside. Many causes of these parameter fluctuations are well known, however the consequences of such fluctuations are not fully documented. In order to better design and optimize intelligent control devices, a better understanding of the performance of cooling coils is needed. This documentation attempts to combine experimental data with computer simulation to provide a visual guide to how fluctuations in supply water flow rate, supply water temperature, supply air temperature, supply air flow rate and supply air humidity affect cooling power achieved from various cooling coils in operation. Experimental data is used in conjunction with computer simulation to investigate how performances of these coils are affected...|$|R
