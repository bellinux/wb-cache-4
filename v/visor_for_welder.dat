40|$|Inhalation {{exposure}} to total and hexavalent chromium (TCr and HCr) {{was assessed by}} personal air sampling and biological monitoring in 53 welders and 20 references. Median inhalation exposure levels of TCr were 1. 3, 6. 0, and 5. 4 microg/m(3) <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> of mild steel (MS, 5 % alloys), and stainless steel (SS, > 26 % alloys), respectively. The median exposures to HCr compounds were 0. 23, 0. 20, and 0. 08 microg/m(3), respectively. Median concentrations of TCr in urine, blood plasma and erythrocytes were elevated in all welders, compared with the corresponding median concentrations in the reference group (p< 0. 005). The TCr levels observed in plasma were two-fold higher in welders of SS and HAS than in welders of MS (p< 0. 01). Exposure to HCr as indicated by median total content of Cr in erythrocytes was 10 microg/L in welders of SS, MS and HAS. Uptake of TCr during the shift was confirmed <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> of SS by a median increase of urinary TCr from pre- to post-shift of 0. 30 microg/g creatinine. <b>For</b> <b>welders</b> of MS and HAS as a group TCr was not increased...|$|R

40|$|The {{personal}} {{ultraviolet radiation}} exposure levels {{of a group}} of welders and nearby workers were estimated using a photosensitive polymer film, polysulphone. The polysulphone film was attached to the inner and outer surfaces of eye protection, the workers' clothing, and also placed throughout the work area. The estimated average ocular exposures (inside the helmets) <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> and boiler-makers were between four and five times the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limit, and the estimated exposures at the spectacles of nonwelders were around 9 times MPE. Body exposures (at the clothing surface) <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> were estimated to be around 3000 times MPE and for nonwelders around 13 times MPE. The ambient ultraviolet radiation levels in the factory were found to exceed the MPE by an average of 5. 5 times, even in nonwelding areas. The results suggest that welders require additional ocular protection to supplement conventional welding helmets, and any exposed skin areas of workers in this environment should also be protected...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize personal exposures to welding-related metals and gases <b>for</b> production <b>welders</b> and non-welders in a large manufacturing facility. Welding fume metals and irritant gases nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) were sampled for thirty-eight workers. Personal exposure air samples for welding fume metals were collected on 37 mm open face cassettes and nitrogen dioxide and ozone exposure samples were collected with diffusive passive samplers. Samples were analyzed for metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and welding fume metal exposure concentrations were defined as the sum of welding-related metals mass per volume of air sampled. Welding fume metal exposures were highly variable among similar types of welding while NO 2 and O 3 exposure were less variable. Welding fume metal exposures were significantly higher 474 µg/m 3 <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> than non-welders 60 µg/m 3 (p= 0. 001). Welders were exposed to higher concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 than non-welders but the differences were not statistically significant. Welding fume metal exposure concentrations <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> performing gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) were higher than welders performing gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Non-welders experienced exposures similar to GTAW welders despite a curtain wall barrier separating welding and non-welding work areas...|$|R

40|$|A {{mortality}} {{study was}} carried out in conjunction with the European mortality study among welders coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The study was aimed at assessing risks for lung cancer in relation to exposure to asbestos, welding fumes containing chromium and nickel, and tobacco smoke. The study included a cohort of 2721 welders and an internal comparison group of 6683 manual workers employed in 13 factories in France. The mortality of the two cohorts was studied from 1975 to 1988 by the historical prospective method. Job histories of welders were traced including welding processes used, metals welded, and proportion of worktime spent in welding. Data on smoking habits were collected from medical records. The observed number of deaths were compared with those expected (standardised mortality ratio (SMR)) based on national rates with adjustments for age, sex, and calendar time. The smoking habits of 87 % of the whole study population were known. The distribution of welders and controls according to smoking was not statistically different. The overall mortality was slightly higher <b>for</b> <b>welders</b> (SMR = 1. 02, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 89 - 1. 18) than for controls (SMR = 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 84 - 0. 99). For lung cancer, the SMR was 1. 24 (95 % CI 0. 75 - 1. 94) <b>for</b> <b>welders,</b> whereas the corresponding value was lower for controls (SMR = 0. 94, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 1. 26). The SMR for lung cancer was 1. 59 among non-shipyard mild steel welders (95 % CI 0. 73 - 3. 02). This contrasted with the results for all stainless steel welders (SMR = 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 19 - 2. 69), and <b>for</b> stainless steel <b>welders</b> predominantly exposed to chromium VI (SMR = 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 12 - 3. 71). Moreover, SMRs for lung cancer <b>for</b> mild steel <b>welders</b> tended to increase with duration of exposure and time since first exposure, leading to significant excesses for duration > or = 20 years and latency > or = 20 years.
