This is a star that exhibits <b>variability</b> {{because of the presence}} of star spots combined with the rotation of the star.

40|$|The {{emission}} {{from black}} hole binaries (BHBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) displays significant aperiodic <b>variabilities.</b> The most promising explanation for these <b>variabilities</b> is the propagating {{fluctuations in the}} accretion flow. It is natural to expect that the mechanism driving <b>variabilities</b> in BHBs and AGNs may operate in a black hole hyper-accretion disk, which is believed to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We study the <b>variabilities</b> of jet power in GRBs based {{on the model of}} propagating fluctuations. It is found that the <b>variabilities</b> of jet power and the temporal profile of erratic spikes in this scenario are similar to those in observed light curves of prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs. Our results show that the mechanism driving X-ray <b>variabilities</b> in BHBs and AGNs may operate in the central engine to drive the <b>variabilities</b> of GRBs.

40|$|In {{the case}} of gravitationally-lensed quasars, it is {{well-known}} {{that there is a}} time delay between occurrence of the intrinsic <b>variabilities</b> in each split image. Generally, the source of <b>variabilities</b> has a finite size, and there are time delays even in one image. If the origin of <b>variabilities</b> is widely distributed, say over ∼ 100 pc as whole, <b>variabilities</b> between split images will not show a good correlation even though their origin is identical. Using this fact, we are able to limit the whole source size of <b>variabilities</b> in a quasar below the limit of direct resolution by today’s observational instruments...|$|R

Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of aspect-oriented (AO) techniques, crosscutting concerns can be now explicitly modularized and exposed as additional <b>variabilities</b> in program families. Hence, the development of highly customizable software family architectures requires the explicit handling of crosscutting <b>variabilities</b> through domain engineering and application engineering steps. In this context, this paper presents a generative model that addresses the implementation and instantiation of <b>variabilities</b> encountered in AO software family architectures. The use of our model allows for an early specification and preparation of AO <b>variabilities,</b> which in turn can be explicitly customized by means of domain engineering activities. All the <b>variabilities</b> of the architecture are modeled using feature models. In application engineering, developers can request an instance of the AO architecture {{in a process of}} two stages: (i) the definition of a feature model instance which specifies the resolution of <b>variabilities</b> for the AO family architecture; and (ii) the definition of a set of crosscutting relationships between features. 1...|$|R
40|$|Pavement {{design is}} a {{probabilistic}} process as it involves many random variables. Through {{the incorporation of}} reliability, pavement design methods consider input parameters <b>variabilities</b> effect on pavement performance. Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) is a typical example of reliability-based design procedure. In LRFD, a set of partial safety factors are developed by modelling input parameters <b>variabilities</b> with representative average conditions. This paper evaluates the impact input parameters <b>variabilities</b> have on estimated target reliability in the case when actual <b>variabilities</b> are different from assumed conditions. This was achieved by evaluating a field pavement section with various combinations of input parameters <b>variabilities.</b> The optimized section for a given target reliability was achieved through the mechanics-based LRFD procedure and the actual reliabilities of the various cases were obtained using a methodology that uses response surface approach and first order reliability method (FORM).

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of speech-intrinsic <b>variabilities</b> such as {{speaking}} rate, effort and speaking style on automatic speech recognition (ASR) is investigated. We analyze the influence of such <b>variabilities</b> as well as extrinsic factors (i. e., additive noise) on the most common features in ASR (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and perceptual linear prediction features) and spectro-temporal Gabor features. MFCCs performed best for clean speech, whereas Gabors {{were found to be}} the most robust feature in extrinsic <b>variabilities.</b> Intrinsic variations were found to have a strong impact on error rates. While performance with MFCCs and PLPs was degraded in much the same way, Gabor features exhibit a different sensivity towards these <b>variabilities</b> and are, e. g., well-suited to recognize speech with varying pitch. The results suggest that spectro-temporal and classic features carry complementary information, which could be exploited in feature-stream experiments.

40|$|Abstract. Software Product Lines (SPLs) {{encompass}} {{a family}} of software-intensive systems developed from reusable assets. One major issue during SPL development is the decision about which technique {{should be used to}} implement <b>variabilities.</b> Although Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) has been used to this purpose, we still need to identify in which situations it is suitable or not.

Our analysis provides intuitive insight about the social welfare impact of economic shocks affecting levels, <b>variabilities,</b> and correlation of prices and incomes. The roles of price and income <b>variabilities</b> for poverty and inequality are exhibited, with the possibility of several variation regimes. ...|$|R

One approach to evaluating internal <b>variability</b> is to use long integrations of coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate models. They have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero, but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality. The variations may result from chaos-driven changes in the oceans, the atmosphere, or interactions between the two.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} how to measure the VO 2 and VCO 2 <b>variabilities</b> in indirect calorimetry (IC) since we believe they can explain the high variation in the resting energy expenditure (REE) estimation. We propose that <b>variabilities</b> should be separately measured from the VO 2 and VCO 2 averages to understand technological differences among metabolic monitors when they estimate the REE. To prove this hypothesis the mixing chamber (MC) and the breath-by-breath (BbB) techniques measured the VO 2 and VCO 2 averages and their <b>variabilities.</b> Variances and power spectrum energies in the 0 – 0.5 Hertz band were measured to establish technique differences in steady and non-steady state. A hybrid calorimeter with both IC techniques studied a population of 15 volunteers that underwent the clino-orthostatic maneuver in order to produce the two physiological stages. The results showed that inter-individual VO 2 and VCO 2 <b>variabilities</b> measured as variances were negligible using the MC while <b>variabilities</b> measured as spectral energies using the BbB underwent 71 and 56 % (p[*]<[*] 0.05), increase respectively. Additionally, the energy analysis showed an unexpected cyclic rhythm at 0.025 Hertz only during the orthostatic stage, which is new physiological information, not reported previusly. The VO 2 and VCO 2 inter-individual averages increased to 63 and 39 % by the MC (p[*]<[*] 0.05) and 32 and 40 % using the BbB (p[*]<[*] 0.1), respectively, without noticeable statistical differences among techniques. The conclusions are: (a) metabolic monitors should simultaneously include the MC and the BbB techniques to correctly interpret the steady or non-steady state <b>variabilities</b> effect in the REE estimation, (b) the MC is the appropriate technique to compute averages since it behaves as a low-pass filter that minimizes variances, (c) the BbB is the ideal technique to measure the <b>variabilities</b> since it can work as a high-pass filter to generate discrete time series able to accomplish spectral analysis, and (d) the new physiological information in the VO 2 and VCO 2 <b>variabilities</b> can help to understand why metabolic monitors with dissimilar IC techniques give different results in the REE estimation.|$|R
