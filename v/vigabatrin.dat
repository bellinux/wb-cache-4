25|$|The retinal {{toxicity}} of <b>vigabatrin</b> {{can be attributed}} to a taurine depletion.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2002 found that <b>vigabatrin</b> causes a statistically significant increase in plasma clearance of carbamazepine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vigabatrin</b> reduced {{cholecystokinin}} tetrapeptide-induced {{symptoms of}} panic disorder, {{in addition to}} elevated cortisol and ACTH levels, in healthy volunteers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vigabatrin</b> is {{also used}} to treat {{seizures}} in succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD), which is an inborn GABA metabolism defect that causes intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, speech disturbance, and ataxia through the accumulation of γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). <b>Vigabatrin</b> helps lower GHB levels through GABA transaminase inhibition. However, this is in the brain only; it has no effect on peripheral GABA transaminase, so the GHB keeps building up and eventually reaches the brain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vigabatrin</b> is also {{indicated}} for monotherapy use in secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, partial seizures, and in infantile spasms due to West syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Feucht and Brantner-Inthaler {{reported}} that <b>vigabatrin</b> reduced seizures by 50-100% in 85% {{of children with}} Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had poor results with sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vigabatrin</b> {{was found}} by Feucht et al. to be an {{effective}} add-on in patients whose seizures were not satisfactorily controlled by valproate. Out of 20 children, only 1 experienced a serious side effect (dyskinesia).|$|E
25|$|In Canada, <b>vigabatrin</b> is {{approved}} {{for use as}} an adjunctive treatment (with other drugs) in treatment resistant epilepsy, complex partial seizures, secondary generalized seizures, and for monotherapy use in infantile spasms in West syndrome.|$|E
25|$|As of 2003, <b>vigabatrin</b> is {{approved}} in Mexico {{for the treatment}} of epilepsy that is not satisfactorily controlled by conventional therapy (adjunctive or monotherapy) or in recently diagnosed patients who have not tried other agents (monotherapy).|$|E
25|$|<b>Vigabatrin</b> was {{developed}} in the 1980s with the specific goal of increasing GABA concentrations in the brain in order to stop an epileptic seizure. To do this, the drug was designed to irreversibly inhibit the GABA transaminase, which degrades the GABA substrate. Although the drug was approved for treatment in the United Kingdom in 1989, the authorized use of <b>Vigabatrin</b> by US Food and Drug Administration was delayed twice in the United States before 2009. It was delayed in 1983 because animal trials produced intramyelinic edema, however, the effects were not apparent in human trials so the drug design continued. In 1997, the trials were temporarily suspended because it was linked to peripheral visual field defects in humans.|$|E
25|$|Visual field defects {{had been}} {{reported}} as early as 1997 by Tom Eke and others, in the UK. Some authors, including Comaish et al. believe that visual field loss and electrophysiological changes may be demonstrable in up to 50% of <b>Vigabatrin</b> users.|$|E
25|$|Less than 1% of {{primidone}} {{users will}} experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, {{this is very}} low. The rate is {{comparable to that of}} felbamate, <b>vigabatrin,</b> and topiramate. Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.|$|E
25|$|With most drugs, {{elimination}} half-life is {{a useful}} predictor of dosing schedules and {{the time needed to}} reach steady state concentrations. In the case of <b>vigabatrin,</b> however, it has been found that the half-life of biologic activity is far longer than the elimination half-life.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} develop psychosis {{during the}} course of <b>vigabatrin</b> therapy, which is more common in adults than in children. This can happen even in patients with no prior history of psychosis. Other rare CNS side effects include anxiety, emotional lability, irritability, tremor, abnormal gait, and speech disorder.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, <b>vigabatrin</b> {{was shown}} by Frisén and Malmgren to cause {{irreversible}} diffuse atrophy of the retinal nerve fiber {{layer in a}} retrospective study of 25 patients. This has the most effect on the outer area (as opposed to the macular, or central area) of the retina.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vigabatrin,</b> {{brand name}} Sabril, is an {{antiepileptic}} drug that inhibits {{the breakdown of}} γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by acting as a suicide inhibitor of the enzyme GABA transaminase (GABA-T). It {{is also known as}} γ-vinyl-GABA, and is a structural analogue of GABA, but does not bind to GABA receptors.|$|E
25|$|Administration, or {{sometimes}} withdrawal, {{of a large}} number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms. Drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally or in a significant proportion of people include amphetamine and other sympathomimetics, dopamine agonists, ketamine, corticosteroids (often with mood changes in addition), and some anticonvulsants such as <b>vigabatrin.</b> Stimulants that may cause this include lisdexamfetamine.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Drs Rimmer and Richens at the University of Wales {{reported}} that administering <b>vigabatrin</b> with phenytoin lowered the serum phenytoin concentration {{in patients with}} treatment-resistant epilepsy. Five years later, the same two scientists reported a fall in concentration of phenytoin of 23% within five weeks in a paper describing their failed attempt at elucidating the mechanism behind this interaction.|$|E
25|$|For <b>vigabatrin,</b> {{there is}} no range of target {{concentrations}} because researchers found {{no difference between the}} serum concentration levels of responders and those of non-responders. Instead, the duration of action is believed to be more a function of the GABA-T resynthesis rate; levels of GABA-T do not usually return to their normal state until six days after stopping the medication.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, primidone, {{along with}} phenobarbital, was a second-line agent in partial {{epilepsy}} {{with or without}} secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures {{and was one of}} four agents (the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) that was used along with ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine for any absence or myoclonic seizures when valproate failed to control tonic-clonics (at least in the United States). After zonisamide, other new anticonvulsants came onto the market: felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and <b>vigabatrin.</b> All four were structurally distinct both from other anticonvulsants already on the market. They all had larger protective indexes than conventional agents and unlike these agents, the new ones did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals or antagonize folic acid. They seemed to be relatively mild in terms of side effects. Out of all of them lamotrigine was the most similar to phenytoin in its pattern of efficacy. Felbamate was the most effective for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and was seen as a second-line agent in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after valproate. These new agents were aggressively marketed. In 1994, felbamate became the anticonvulsant of last resort after ten people out of 100,000 came down with aplastic anemia.|$|E
500|$|... 1990: <b>Vigabatrin</b> {{was found}} to be a highly {{effective}} antiepileptic treatment for infantile spasms, particularly in children with TSC. Following the discovery in 1997 of severe persistent visual field constriction as a possible side-effect, <b>vigabatrin</b> monotherapy is now largely restricted to this patient group.|$|E

50|$|Carbamazepine, <b>vigabatrin,</b> and {{tiagabine}} are contraindicated in {{the treatment}} of absence seizures, irrespective of cause and severity.

Similarly, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, gabapentin, and pregabalin should not be used {{in the treatment}} of absence seizures because these medications may worsen absence seizures.|$|E
