5|$|In modern Serbian {{adjective}} alav still signifies <b>voracious</b> appetite.|$|E
5|$|A <b>voracious</b> reader, Procter {{was largely}} self-taught, though she studied at Queen's College in Harley Street in 1850. The college had been founded in 1848 by Frederick Maurice, a Christian Socialist; the faculty {{included}} novelist Charles Kingsley, composer John Hullah, and writer Henry Morley.|$|E
5|$|Schuur is a <b>voracious</b> {{reader and}} a cat owner. She is an ardent {{fan of the}} American daytime {{television}} series The Young and the Restless, {{to the extent of}} personally visiting the set on at least three occasions. Her Grammy awards, one inscribed in braille, sit on a Baldwin piano given to her by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are <b>voracious</b> predators, eating most {{living things}} that are smaller than they are. Their staple diet is mostly bloodworms and other insect larvae, but they also feed on tadpoles and small fish. A few species, {{especially}} those that live in temporary waters, are likely to leave water. Nymphs of Cordulegaster bidentata sometimes hunt small arthropods {{on the ground at}} night.|$|E
5|$|Ala can “sneak” into humans, {{gaining a}} human form while {{retaining}} their own properties. A tradition {{has it that}} an ala sneaked into St. Simeon, which made him <b>voracious,</b> but St. Sava took her out of him. In a tale recorded in eastern Serbia and Bulgaria, a farmer killed an ala who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village, because the ala destroyed his vineyard. In another story, an ala gets into a deceased princess and devours the soldiers on watch.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{are mainly}} {{free-living}} species that directly consume {{a large number}} of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are <b>voracious</b> predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|That same year, Hawks was {{accepted}} to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he majored {{in mechanical engineering}} {{and was a member}} of Delta Kappa Epsilon. College friend Ray S. Ashbury remembered Hawks spending more of his time playing craps and drinking alcohol than studying, although Hawks was also known to be a <b>voracious</b> reader of popular American and English novels in college.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} leaf midge {{can cause}} browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at {{the tips of}} shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the <b>voracious</b> larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E
5|$|The larva is a <b>voracious</b> predator. Within a {{few minutes}} of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, it begins to suck out the {{digestion}} products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of hairs {{on the sides of the}} two hindmost thoracic segments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>voracious</b> {{adults have}} very broad diets, {{including}} insects such as crickets, larvae, mosquito wrigglers, dragonflies, earthworms, cockroaches, flies, and grasshoppers. They are also known to eat freshwater crayfish and slugs, and other frogs, {{even of the}} same species. They have a strong tendency for cannibalism, and frequently these in the same enclosure devour each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown cannibalism also occurs in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are <b>voracious</b> eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, {{although}} this is mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
5|$|Coward {{was born}} in 1899 in Teddington, Middlesex, a {{south-western}} suburb of London. His parents were Arthur Sabin Coward (18561937), a piano salesman, and Violet Agnes Coward (18631954), daughter of , a captain and surveyor in the Royal Navy. Violet's cousin, Rachel Veitch, was mother of Field-Marshal Douglas Haig. Noël Coward was the second of their three sons, the eldest of whom had died in 1898 {{at the age of}} six. Coward's father lacked ambition and industry, and family finances were often poor. Coward was bitten by the performing bug early and appeared in amateur concerts by the age of seven. He attended the Chapel Royal Choir School as a young child. He had little formal schooling but was a <b>voracious</b> reader.|$|E
5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} <b>voracious</b> reader with an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward the Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its <b>voracious</b> appetite, the cane toad has been {{introduced}} to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands {{as a method of}} agricultural pest control. The species derives its common name from its use against the cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum). The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Voracious</b> and {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, the blotchy swellshark {{is known}} to consume numerous types of fishes and invertebrates, including an unusually high diversity of cartilaginous fishes. Like other Cephaloscyllium species, {{it is capable of}} rapidly inflating its body as a defense against predators. This species is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs two at a time. There is no well-defined breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. The eggs hatch after approximately one year. The blotchy swellshark is harmless and fares well in captivity. It is caught as bycatch in commercial bottom trawls, though its population {{does not seem to have}} suffered from fishing activity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely <b>voracious,</b> ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a <b>voracious</b> {{appetite}} for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or more. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1910, Mao {{requested}} that his father permit him to attend the Dongshan Higher Primary School, which was located fifteen miles from Shaoshan; unlike the Shaoshan Primary School, this establishment taught modern subjects such as natural sciences. Yichang agreed to fund his son's tuition and dormitory space, and so the sixteen-year-old Mao set off to Dongshan with his older cousin, Wen Yunchang, who was also enrolled there. His two best friends at the school were Yunchang and Xiao Zizhang (also known as Xiao San), who would later join Mao in the communist movement and {{would become one of}} his first biographers. However, he was bullied for being rural and unsophisticated by many of his classmates, who were typically the sons of wealthy landlords from Xiangxiang district. He nevertheless proved to be a successful student, gaining the respect of his teachers through hard work, an ability to compose essays in the classical style, and <b>voracious</b> reading. Here, he first learned about geography, and increased his knowledge of ancient Chinese history.|$|E
5|$|McAloney {{retired to}} his home in Sandringham, Victoria, where he indulged his passions in {{gardening}} and golf. He was also an active Freemason, and a <b>voracious</b> reader. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and significance of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would be abolished and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were according invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients living at the time opted to accept the offer, McAloney and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack Chalmers, Stanley Gibbs, Robert Kavanaugh, Dick Richards and McAloney, were presented with their George Crosses by Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture ceremony in Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1972. McAloney later donated his Albert Medal to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook in 1987, where it was placed on display.|$|E
5|$|The {{sluggish}} and nocturnal coffin ray frequents sandy or muddy habitats, {{where it}} can bury itself during daytime. It can produce a powerful electric shock reaching 200 volts for attack and defense. This species is a <b>voracious</b> predator that feeds mainly on benthic bony fishes, often tackling fish approaching or exceeding itself in size. On occasion, it may also consume invertebrates and even small penguins and rats. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). The female gives birth to 4–8 pups during summer. The coffin ray can deliver a severe, albeit non-fatal, shock to a human. Not valued commercially, it is very hardy and can usually survive being captured and discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as its population does not seem threatened by human activity.|$|E
5|$|Many {{factors are}} thought to be {{responsible}} for the dramatic decline of this species in Australia, including habitat fragmentation, erosion and sedimentation of soil, insecticides and fertilisers contaminating water systems, the introduction of predatory fish, and alteration of drainage regimes. Population declines are closely related to the introduction of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a species native to North America that was introduced to control mosquito larvae. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the eggs and tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are extremely susceptible to predation by this fish, and in 77 of the 93 sites in New South Wales where the green and golden bell frog was known to have disappeared before 1990, eastern mosquitofish were found to be present. The frogs have been known to inhabit waters containing the fish, but breeding is rarely successful there, pointing to the fish's <b>voracious</b> eating of eggs and tadpoles. The fish are not yet present in eastern Victoria, where green and golden bell frog numbers have remained solid, but the fish likely will spread to rivers there, possibly inflicting heavy losses on the frogs.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a <b>voracious</b> predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
25|$|As a young woman, Julia was {{a skilled}} pianist, an expert horsewoman, and a <b>voracious</b> reader of novels.|$|E
25|$|Jim Reese (voiced by Skyler Page and Donovan Patton) – The gruff yet dim-witted school secretary. He is {{a former}} police officer with a <b>voracious</b> appetite.|$|E
25|$|Abhinavagupta {{is famous}} for his <b>voracious</b> thirst of knowledge. To study he took many {{teachers}} (as many as 15), both mystical philosophers and scholars. He approached Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Śiddhānta Śaivists and the Trika scholars.|$|E
25|$|Like most caterpillars, the mopane worm is a <b>voracious</b> eater, {{and will}} {{continue}} to eat - almost non-stop - until it reaches the next stage of its life cycle, when it burrows underground to undergo metamorphosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{desert locust}} (Schistocerca gregaria) is {{a species of}} locust. Plagues of desert locusts have {{threatened}} agricultural production in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia for centuries. The livelihood of at least one-tenth of the world’s human population can be affected by this <b>voracious</b> insect.|$|E
25|$|Hero {{in battle}} {{corresponds}} to the Bull of Heaven episode standard version tablet VI) in the Akkadian version. The Bull's <b>voracious</b> appetite causes drought and hardship in the land while Gilgamesh feasts. Lugalbanda convinces him to face the beast and fights it alongside Enkidu.|$|E
25|$|The {{cargo hold}} of the C-5 is one foot longer than {{the entire length of}} the first powered flight by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk. For its <b>voracious</b> {{consumption}} of fuel and its maintenance and reliability issues the Galaxy's aircrews have nicknamed it FRED, for: Fucking Ridiculous, Economic/Environmental Disaster.|$|E
25|$|The female {{has been}} {{observed}} inspecting Aristolochiaceae plants and selecting healthy plants with verdant growth to ensure adequacy of food for its <b>voracious</b> caterpillars. It lays round and reddish eggs with fine black markings. The eggs are laid singly on top, the underside of leaves or even on shoots.|$|E
25|$|Educated by tutors and at Starke's University School in Montgomery, Jones was a <b>voracious</b> {{reader who}} tackled {{everything}} from Tom Swift and Tarzan to Walter Scott and Foxe's Book of Martyrs. As a ten-year-old, his father gave him 50 missionary biographies for Christmas—which the boy finished by February.|$|E
25|$|The young Goddard was a {{thin and}} frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He {{suffered}} from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds and bronchitis, and fell two years behind his classmates. He became a <b>voracious</b> reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.|$|E
25|$|To call a woman 'a Messalina' {{indicates}} a devious and sexually <b>voracious</b> personality. The historical figure and her fate were {{often used in}} the arts to make a moral point, but there was often as well a prurient fascination with her sexually-liberated behaviour. In modern times, {{that has led to}} exaggerated works which have been described as romps.|$|E
25|$|Although Bar-Jonah {{was known}} to be a <b>voracious</b> eater who weighed in excess of 300 lbs, {{financial}} records indicated that he had not made any significant grocery store purchases for nearly a month after Zach Ramsay disappeared. However, he could have also paid for any groceries using cash or have been well-stocked on food and meat.|$|E
25|$|On August 23, 2029, the {{asteroid}} 99942 Apophis collides with Earth, effectively destroying human civilization and turning {{the world into}} a wasteland. Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by various bandits clans, and mutants, which attack all normal humans in a <b>voracious</b> horde.|$|E
25|$|In her teens, Addams had big dreams—to do {{something}} {{useful in the}} world. Long interested in the poor from her reading of Dickens and inspired by her mother's kindness to the Cedarville poor, she {{decided to become a}} doctor so that she could live and work among the poor. It was a vague idea, nurtured by literary fiction. She was a <b>voracious</b> reader.|$|E
