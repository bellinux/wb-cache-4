50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{locomotives}} having Stephenson {{valve gear}} normally had this mounted {{in between the}} locomotive frames. In 1947, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway built a series of their Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 locomotives, most of which had the Walschaerts' valve gear that was normal for this class, but one of them, no. 4767, had Stephenson valve gear mounted outside the wheels and frames. Instead of eccentrics, double return cranks were used to drive the eccentric rods, and a launch-type expansion link was used.

5000|$|During the 1830s {{the most}} popular valve drive for {{locomotives}} was known as gab motion in the U.K. and V-hook motion in the U.S.A. The gab motion incorporated two sets of eccentrics and rods for each cylinder; one eccentric was set to give forward and the other backwards motion to the engine and {{one or the other}} could accordingly engage with a pin driving the distribution valve by means of the gabs: - vee-shaped ends to the eccentric rods supposed to catch the rocker driving the valve rod whatever its position. It was a clumsy mechanism, difficult to operate, and only gave fixed valve events. In 1841 two employees in Stephenson’s locomotive works, draughtsman William Howe and pattern-maker William Williams, suggested the simple expedient of replacing the gabs with a vertical slotted link, pivoted at both ends to the tips of the eccentric rods. To change direction, the link and rod ends were bodily raised or lowered by means of a counterbalanced bell crank worked by a reach rod that connected it to the reversing lever. This not only simplified reversing but it was realised that the gear could be raised or lowered in small increments, and thus the combined motion from the “forward” and “back” eccentrics in differing proportions would impart shorter travel to the valve, cutting off admission steam earlier in the stroke and using a smaller amount steam expansively in the cylinder, using its own energy rather than continuing to draw from the boiler. It became the practice to start the engine or climb gradients at long cutoff, usually about 70-80% maximum of the power stroke and to shorten the cutoff as momentum was gained to benefit from the economy of expansive working and the effect of increased lead and higher compression {{at the end of each}} stroke. This process was popularly known as [...] "linking up" [...] or “notching up”, the latter because the reversing lever could be held in precise positions by means of a catch on the lever engaging notches in a quadrant; the term stuck even after the introduction of the screw reverser. A further intrinsic advantage of the Stephenson gear not found in most other types was <b>variable</b> <b>lead.</b> Depending on how the gear was laid out, it was possible to considerably reduce compression and back pressure at the end of each piston stroke when working at low speed in full gear; once again as momentum was gained and cutoff shortened, so lead was automatically advanced and compression increased, cushioning the piston at the end of each stroke and heating the remaining trapped steam in order to avoid temperature drop in the fresh charge of incoming admission steam.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} grid generation and numerical methods for predicting the flow in variable geometry, positive displacement screw machines. It has been shown, from a review of available literature, that the two main approaches available to generate deforming grids for the CFD analysis of 3 D transient flow in screw machines are algebraic and differential. Grids that maintain the cell count and connectivity, during solution, provide the highest accuracy and customised grid generation tools {{have the capability to}} accommodate large mesh deformations. For the analysis of screw rotors with a <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> or varying profile, these techniques are suitable but are required to be developed further with new procedures that can define the three dimensional variation of geometry of the rotors onto the computational grid. An algebraic grid generation method was used for deforming grid generation of <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> and varying profile rotors. Functions were developed for correlating a specified lead variation along the rotor axis with the grid spacing. These can be used to build a continuously <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> with linear, quadratic or higher order functions. For variable profile rotors, a novel approach has been developed for three dimensional grid structuring. This can be used to specify a continuously variable rotor profile, a <b>variable</b> <b>lead,</b> and both internal and external rotor engagement, thus making it possible to generate rotor domains with conical and <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> geometries. New grid distribution techniques were developed to distribute boundary points on the rotors from the fixed points on the rack and the casing. These can refine the grid in the region of interlobe leakage gaps between the rotors, produce a one to one connected interface between them and improve the cell quality. Inflation layers were applied and tested for mesh refinement near the rotor boundaries. Case studies have been presented to validate the proposed grid generation techniques and the results have been compared with experimental data. Simulated results agreed well with measured data and highlighted the conditions where deviations are highest. Results with variable geometry rotors showed that they achieve steeper internal pressure rise and a larger discharge port area could be used. With <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> rotors the volumetric efficiency could be improved by reducing the sealing line length in the high pressure zone. Calculations with inflation layers showed that local velocities were better predicted but there was no substantial influence on the integral performance parameters...|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} axisymmetric forward spiral extrusion (AFSE) {{has been}} proposed recently to enhance the strain accumulation during the process. The new technique is called <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> axisymmetric forward spiral extrusion (VLAFSE) that features a <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> along the extrusion direction. To assess the effect of design modification on plastic deformation, a comprehensive study has been performed here using a 3 D transient finite element (FE) model. The FE results established the shear deformation as the dominant mode of deformation which has been confirmed experimentally. The <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> die extends strain accumulation in the radial and longitudinal directions over the entire grooved section of the die and eliminates the rigid body rotation which occurs {{in the case of}} a constant lead die, AFSE. A comparison of forming loads for VLAFSE and AFSE proved the advantages of the former design in the reduction of the forming load which is more pronounced under higher frictional coefficients. This finding proves that the efficiency of VLAFSE is higher than that of AFSE. Besides, the significant amount of accumulated shear strain in VLAFSE along with non-axisymmetric distribution of friction creates a surface feature in the processed sample called zipper effect that has been investigated. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of "Helical Interference" in milled slots is examined and a coherent theory for {{the geometry of}} such surfaces is presented. An examination of the relevant literature shows a fragmented approach to the problem owing to its normally destructive nature, so a complete analysis is developed for slots of constant lead, thus giving a united and exact theory for many different setting parameters {{and a range of}} cutter shapes. For the first time, a theory is developed to explain the "Interference Surface" generated in <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> slots for cylindrical work and attention is drawn to other practical surfaces, such as cones, where variable leads are encountered. Although generally outside the scope of this work, an introductory analysis of these cases is considered in order to develop the cylindrical theory. Special emphasis is laid upon practical areas where the interference mechanism can be used constructively and its application as the rake face of a cutting tool is discussed. A theory of rake angle for such cutting tools is given for commonly used planes, and relative variations in calculated rake angle between planes is examined. Practical tests are conducted to validate both constant lead and <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> theories and some design improvements to the conventional dividing head are suggested in order to manufacture <b>variable</b> <b>lead</b> workpieces, by use of a "superposed" rotation. A prototype machine is manufactured and its kinematic principle given for both linear and non-linearly varying superposed rotations. Practical workpieces of the former type are manufactured and compared with analytical predictions,while theoretical curves are generated for non-linear workpieces and then compared with those of linear geometry. Finally suggestions are made for the application of these principles to the manufacture of spiral bevel gears, using the "Interference Surface" along a cone as the tooth form...|$|E
