25|$|Whitman was re-elected in 1997, {{narrowly}} defeating Jim McGreevey, {{the mayor}} of Woodbridge Township, who criticized Whitman's record on property taxes and automobile insurance rates.

In the 1997 election, the early prediction was that Whitman, as an incumbent, would have an easy win.

About 20 percent of Ivy City residents received public assistance, and infant mortality was 38.3 per thousand, double that of the rest of the District of Columbia.
