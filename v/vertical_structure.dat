5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E

25|$|The Boussinesq {{approximation}} {{for water}} waves {{takes into account}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> of the horizontal and vertical flow velocity. This results in non-linear partial differential equations, called Boussinesq-type equations, which incorporate frequency dispersion (as opposite to the shallow water equations, which are not frequency-dispersive). In coastal engineering, Boussinesq-type equations are frequently used in computer models for the simulation of water waves in shallow seas and harbours.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{idea in the}} Boussinesq approximation is {{the elimination}} of the vertical coordinate from the flow equations, while retaining some of the influences of the <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> of the flow under water waves. This is useful because the waves propagate in the horizontal plane and have a different (not wave-like) behaviour in the vertical direction. Often, as in Boussinesq's case, the interest is primarily in the wave propagation.|$|E

Its base includes four vertical columns, each composed of two pillars. The largest part of the structure runs parallel to the Rua de Santa Justa. With a height of 45 metres, covering seven stories, the tower includes two elevator cabins, decorated in wood, mirrors and windows, and with an initial capacity for 24 passengers in each (updated to 29 people later). The structure includes a dozen transverse beams, forming a double lattice, supported at the top by foundations at the Escadinhas de Santa Justa.

25|$|There {{are both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages of the matrix structure; some of the disadvantages are an increase in the complexity of the chain of command. This occurs because of the differentiation between functional managers and project managers, which can be confusing for employees to understand who is next in the chain of command. An additional disadvantage of the matrix structure is higher manager to worker ratio that results in conflicting loyalties of employees. However the matrix structure also has significant advantages that make it valuable for companies to use. The matrix structure improves upon the “silo” critique of functional management in that it diminishes the <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> of functional and creates a more horizontal structure which allows the spread of information across task boundaries to happen much quicker. Moreover, matrix structure allows for specialization that can increase depth of knowledge & allows individuals to be chosen according to project needs. This correlation between individuals and project needs is what produces the concept of maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses.|$|E

500|$|As {{air flows}} {{radially}} inward at low levels, {{it begins to}} rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly, as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the tropopause, its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius, resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone. [...] The result is a <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from thermal wind balance, this corresponds to {{a system that is}} warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. “warm-core”).

These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and underlying ocean dynamics), background near-surface wind speed, and the <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> of atmospheric radiative heating. The nature of this modulation is complex, particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer). [...] On shorter time-scales, variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical mean, as regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water. However, this relationship is indirect via the large-scale dynamics of the tropics; the direct influence of the absolute sea surface temperature on [...] is weak in comparison.|$|E

However, during intense sporadic E events, the Es layer can reflect frequencies up to 50nbsp&MHz and higher. The <b>vertical</b> <b>structure</b> of the E layer is primarily determined by the competing effects of ionization and recombination.
