Non-reacting gas compression tests indicate that the current piston/ring design is capable of achieving pressures as high as 90 % of their isentropic values (based on volume) with a repeatability of about 1 %. These values are more than adequate for a systematic investigation of combustion at extreme states. Two preliminary, light-load combustion tests have just been conducted using methanol and diesel as fuels. While these initial results are more symbolic than systematic, they indicate that our strategies for fuel injection, injection synchronization, and energy (work) extraction are also functioning correctly, {{and that we are}} well positioned to investigate the requirements for combustion under very high-speed, extreme compression conditions. In a parallel effort, we continue to investigate what is possible in the design space of ultra-high efficiency engines. While previous efforts focused on batch engine geometries (i. e., piston-cylinder), efforts during the past year have focused on understanding efficiency optimization for steady-flow (i. e., turbine) engines. Although similar in many respects, a key difference is the inability of these engines to provide reversible work interactions. Although still leading to a form of the same extreme-states principle that led to the experimental work cited above, this research shows that there exist intrinsic limitations on the state to which the working fluid may be compressed due to the inherent irreversibilities of the turbomachinery. Equally important, is that our preliminary assessment indicates that these states are well outside of the current engine operating envelope such that the possibility exists for significant improvement in the efficiency of steady flow combustion engines...|$|R

The advantages of using ethanol as SI engine fuel include its greenness, renewability, higher availability and usability in near future, higher octane number, higher <b>volumetric</b> efficiency, higher <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> and biodegradability. Ethanol can be produced biologically from sugarcane, crop residues, cellulose, agricultural biomass, municipal waste etc. The experiment conducted by different researchers and their experimental results shows that brake specific fuel consumption, brake torque, indicated power, thermal efficiency increases or decreases depending upon the operating condition of the engine and ethanol percentage in the ethanol-gasoline blends. However, the <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> always increases due to enhancement of the octane number of the blend. On the other hand volumetric efficiency increases with the increase in ethanol percentage in the blends.

40|$|Auxetic {{materials}} are modern class of materials fabricated by altering the material microstructure. Unlike conventional materials, they exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio when {{subjected to a}} uniaxial loading. These materials have recently been gaining popularity within the research community due to their enhanced mechanical properties. High energy-absorption and impact-resistance are of primary interests of applying in automotive systems. In this study, the auxetic foam made of aluminium is used in vehicle bumpers. Initially, the auxetic aluminium foam is fabricated using tri-axial compression followed by heating to softening temperature and cooling down gradually to ambient temperature. The amount of energyabsorption and impact-resistance of the auxetic is then measured. The effect of auxetic fabrication parameters such as heating time, heating temperature and <b>volumetric</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> on energy-absorption and impact-resistance have been examined in this research. The optimized auxetic foam could then be adopted into the bumper system. Investigation on the energy absorbing system is carried out experimentally in two different loadings namely uniaxial compression and three-point bending test. Finite element model of the bumper system using commercial nonlinear finite element code is validated by using experimental test on the bumper system. Subsequently, the validated numerical model is employed to investigate and compare the energy absorption performance of conventional foam bumper and auxetic foam bumper.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with a}} {{comparative}} evaluation of a single-zone (SZ) thermodynamic model and a 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for heat release calculation in internal combustion engines. The first law, SZ, model {{is based on the}} first law of thermodynamics. This model is characterized by a very simplified modeling of the combustion phenomenon allowing for a great simplicity in the mathematical formulation and very low computational time. The CFD 3 D models, instead, are able to solve the chemistry of the combustion process, the interaction between turbulence and flame propagation, the heat exchange with walls and the dissociation and re-association of chemical species. They provide a high spatial resolution of the combustion chamber as well. Nevertheless, the computation requirements of CFD models are enormously larger than the SZ techniques. However, the SZ model needs accurate experimental in-cylinder pressure data for initializing the heat release calculation. Therefore, the main objective of an SZ model is to evaluate the heat release, which is very difficult to measure in experiments, starting from the knowledge of the in-cylinder pressure data. Nevertheless, the great simplicity of the SZ numerical formulation has a margin of uncertainty which cannot be known a priori. The objective of this paper was, therefore, to evaluate the level of accuracy and reliability of the SZ model comparing the results with those obtained with a CFD 3 D model. The CFD model was developed and validated using cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine experimental in-cylinder pressure data. The CFR engine was fueled with 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, at a rotational speed of 600  r/min, an equivalence ratio equal to 1 and a <b>volumetric</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> of 5.8. The analysis demonstrates that, considering the simplicity and speed of the SZ model, the heat release calculation is sufficiently accurate and thus can be used for a first investigation of the combustion process.|$|E
40|$|Blunt body trauma, {{due to a}} heavy impact or blow, has the {{potential}} to cause catastrophic injury in a broad range of professions and workplace environments. At particular risk are those who work in areas such as the military, the engineering and construction industries, contact sports (such as American football or rugby) or indeed any other area where an individual has {{the potential}} to come into physical contact with other moving objects. Unlike other occupations, the primary cause of blunt trauma in the military is associated with high impact kinetic energies transferred onto the body through the deformation and displacement of body armour. To date, the effects of behind armour blunt trauma (BABT) are counteracted by materials known as Trauma Attenuating Backings (TABs), which have the ability to dissipate and redistributed the impact energy. Unlike currently available TABs that utilise conventional materials, this thesis explores the feasibility of reducing the effects of BABT through the employment of auxetic foams. In contrast to conventional materials, auxetics exhibit a negative Poisson’s ratio when subjected to both tensile and compressive loading, whilst also exhibiting a range of enhanced mechanical properties. Utilising the well-established three-step auxetic foam fabrication process, the influence of fabrication parameters with key focus on Poisson’s ratio and energy absorption have been explored. Auxetic foams were produced for a number of fabrication parameter combinations, where heating time and <b>volumetric</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> were identified to be codependentin determining Poisson’s ratio and energy absorption behaviour. While many individual samples demonstrated a negative Poisson’s ratio with enhanced energy absorption, due to the presence of defective and/or damaged cellular structures throughout the foam structures, large variability and little sample repeatability were shown to exist between samples produced from the same combination of fabrication parameters. A novel 3 D printing approach was then developed to produce two types of repeatable pliable polymeric foam structures (re-entrant and honeycomb, auxetic and conventional, respectively) where the majority of geometric features have a dimensional error between 0. 5 % - 5. 0 % and exhibited negative Poisson’s ratios under both tensile and compressive loading. Interestingly under direct impact conditions (7. 2 J of impact energy under freefall) no discernible difference regarding energy absorption was shown between the auxetic and conventional systems. However, when considered with respect to the peak force, the auxetic systems exhibited a lower overall mean peak force by a factor of two. Whilst the auxetic system significantly reduced the transmitted peak force but maintained similar energy absorption when compared to the conventional system, it was difficult to surmise whether or not the auxetic system performed better than the conventional system. However, with respect to the quasi-static testing (where the auxetics exhibited a greater energy absorption per unit volume due to both systems having an approximately same relative density), for a like-for-like weight basis the auxetic foams absorb more energy than their conventional counterparts due to their structure and {{not just because of the}} increase in relative density that the classic auxetic fabrication process instils. Therefore, it may be concluded that auxetics are potentially suitable for the application as a trauma attenuating backing material as they demonstrated that they satisfy the two key requirements that TAB materials must possess: the ability to absorb energy and reduce the transferable force. However, due to a current lack of understanding on the effects governing BABT, particularly in the area of mechanical and biophysical interactions that take place, it is important that more rigorous testing is undertaken to explore other effects, including pressure wave propagation, ergonomics and replicating in-field conditions before committing auxetic foams to a TAB application...|$|E

To {{study the}} {{mechanical}} properties of CFPR steel tube composite columns filled with steel reinforced concrete under different axis <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> by adopting 3 specimens of theirs quasistatic tests are carried out. The failure mechanism and test results are analyzed with {{member of the}} load-displacement hysteretic curves, skeleton curves. The {{results show that the}} axial <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases conducive to the improvement of the bearing capacity of specimens. Axial <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> has a great influence on the skeleton curve and ductility. Axial <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> is higher, the descent stage of the skeleton curve is steeper, the ductility is better. With the increase of the axial <b>compression</b> <b>ratio,</b> the ductility coefficient and energy dissipation capacity is lower...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Compression</b> <b>ratio</b> is an {{important}} factor affecting engine performance and emission characteristics since thermal efficiency of spark ignition engine can be theoretically improved by increasing <b>compression</b> <b>ratio.</b> In order to evaluate the effect of <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> change in HCNG engine, natural gas engine was employed using HCNG 30 (CNG 70 vol%, hydrogen 30 vol%). Combustion and emission characteristics of CNG and HCNG fuel was analyzed with respect to the change of <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> at each operating condition. The results showed that thermal efficiency improved and CH 4, CO 2 emission decreased with the increase in <b>compression</b> <b>ratio</b> while NOx emissions were decreased at a certain excess air ratio condition. Higher thermal efficiency and further reduction of exhaust emission...|$|R
