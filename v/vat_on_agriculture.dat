40|$|Econometric {{models can}} be a very good tool for the {{introductory}} estimation of the in fluence of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> the <b>agriculture.</b> However, owing to the fact that regulations concerning VAT in the agriculture came into effect only a few years ago, using classic methods of econometric models estimation for this purpose is very difficult. In order {{to deal with the problem}} of investigations with results presented in this paper, two approaches were applied. First of all, annual time series of macroeconomic values characterizing Polish agriculture were used and models estimating effects of the <b>VAT</b> operation <b>on</b> functioning of the agriculture sector were built by means of LSM. Second of all, on the basis of section-time series built on the ground of data of the agricultural accounting, panel models estimation for the need of the estimation of VAT consequences for individual farmers in the microeconomic scale was conducted. These models were used for the estimation of the influence of indirect taxation on such agricultural categories as: production, expenditures, income, investments as well as concentration processes in the agriculture.

40|$|What {{attribute}} affects salience on {{a political}} agenda? How come some reforms are implemented while others are not? These are essential and central questions for our society. Our society, our democracy and our everyday life are dependent of these factors; communication is the condition. In the 2011 budget from the Swedish conservative government, the question of lowering the <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> restaurant- and catering services was the single most debated reform. This was occasioned from 2009 when the European Union allowed, {{for the first time}} since Swedish entry in 2005, a lower <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> restaurant services. Since then Finland, Belgium and France had lowered their <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> restaurant services and now Sweden had decided to follow suit. On January 2012 the Swedish government halved the <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> restaurant services from 25 per cent to 12 per cent. This essay deals with the processes that lead up to the implementation earlier this year, from a media- and communications perspective. For this purpose, central players of the VAT reform have been interviewed as well as a comprehensive study of the relevant documents on this subject. Agenda setting theory derived from John W. Kingdon and Maxwell McCombs makes up the theoretical framework for this essay in its endeavour to seek out answers to who, why and what lead up to the lowering of the Swedish <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> restaurant services in 2012. In the beginning of the 1990 s the question of a lowered <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> restaurant service was raised when the <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> groceries was lowered which created an unfair competition between restaurants and supermarkets. The restaurant enterprises have since lobbied for a lowering of the restaurant VAT. With the new conservative government coming to power in 2006 a change of political agenda followed which resulted in a new approach towards the issue. With regards to Kingdons agenda setting theory this essay conclude that the single most important issue for the reduction of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> restaurant services was to tackle the high levels of unemployment. In particular for those with a weak position in the labour market, such as adolescents, immigrants and uneducated citizens. While among the most important actors in the issue where the conservative coalition government as well as the socialist opposition, the restaurant enterprise organization SHR and the restaurant union HRF...|$|R

40|$|MCom (South African and International Taxation), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 This {{research}} {{identified that}} e-commerce is growing annually {{and has a}} significant impact on the South African economy. When the Minister of Finance announced that VAT registration would become compulsory for foreign suppliers importing e-commerce transactions into South Africa, there were many speculations regarding the implication this will have for South Africa. The main objectives for the research are to determine whether the current VAT structure and VAT Act in South Africa will be able to support the proposal made by the Minister of Finance and what possible challenges should be considered regarding <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> e-commerce transactions that were already identified by other countries. It will further be considered whether the proposal is in line with current international legislation and trends. Therefore, the development and implementation of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> e-commerce transactions in the European Union and New Zealand were researched and discussed to obtain an understanding of the similar current VAT systems in other parts of the world. It was identified during the research that there are still challenges experienced with the implementation of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> e-commerce transactions. The challenges range from the anonymity of the parties to the identification of the permanent establishment of the supplier, which are discussed in detail. These challenges can lead to tax evasion and the erosion of a country’s revenue base. The proposal by the Minister of Finance is found to be in line with other countries’ implementation of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> e-commerce transactions. Furthermore, South Africa’s current VAT system was analysed to ascertain whether it is sufficient to implement <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> e-commerce transactions. Currently, SARS is dependent on the consumer’s honesty to declare the <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> all e-commerce transactions. It was further identified that there are challenges relating to the implementation of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> ecommerce transactions as it is lacking place of supply rules, which often creates uncertainty about whether a product is subject to VAT. It was found in the study that the current VAT system would not be sufficient to support the proposal made by the Minister of Finance without an amendment to the VAT system to secure the income from the consumption tax on e-commerce transactions. It was further found that there are worldwide still challenges experienced with the implementation of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> e-commerce transactions. Recommendations were made for further research relating to the new Tax Bill that is due to be released in 2014 and the impact it will have on the South African economy. Master...|$|R
