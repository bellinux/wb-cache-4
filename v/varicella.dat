5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow <b>varicella</b> virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed {{that there were a}} few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The <b>varicella</b> cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E
5|$|As {{an example}} of viral classification, the chicken pox virus, <b>varicella</b> zoster (VZV), belongs to the order Herpesvirales, family Herpesviridae, {{subfamily}} Alphaherpesvirinae, and genus Varicellovirus. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification {{because it is a}} dsDNA virus that does not use reverse transcriptase.|$|E
5|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with conditions caused by other viruses in the herpesviridae family such as herpes zoster, which is caused by <b>varicella</b> zoster virus. The differential diagnosis includes hand, foot and mouth disease due to similar lesions on the skin.|$|E
5|$|Links between other {{infections and}} GBS are less certain. Two other herpesviruses (Epstein–Barr virus/HHV-4 and <b>varicella</b> zoster virus/HHV-3) and the {{bacterium}} Mycoplasma pneumoniae {{have been associated}} with GBS. The tropical viral infection dengue fever and Zika virus have also been associated with episodes of GBS. Previous hepatitis E virus infection {{has been found to be}} more common in people with Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the <b>varicella</b> zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and <b>varicella</b> zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and <b>varicella.</b> Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Varicella</b> zoster {{vaccine is}} made from the Oka/Merck strain of live {{attenuated}} <b>varicella</b> virus. The virus was initially obtained from a child with natural <b>varicella,</b> introduced into human embryonic lung cell cultures, adapted to and propagated in embryonic guinea pig cell cultures, and finally propagated in human diploid cell cultures.|$|E
25|$|Other countries, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, have {{targeted}} {{recommendations for}} the vaccine, e.g., for susceptible health care workers at risk of <b>varicella</b> exposure. In the UK, <b>varicella</b> antibodies are measured {{as part of the}} routine of prenatal care, and by 2005 all National Health Service personnel had determined their immunity and been immunized if they were non-immune and have direct patient contact. Population-based immunization against <b>varicella</b> is not otherwise practised in the UK.|$|E
25|$|<b>Varicella</b> can be lethal {{to adults}} with {{impaired}} immunity. The {{number of people}} in this high-risk group has increased, due to the HIV epidemic and the increased use of immunosuppressive therapies. <b>Varicella</b> is a particular problem in hospitals, when there are patients with immune systems weakened by drugs (e.g., high-dose steroids) or HIV.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection of skin lesions, manifesting as impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas, {{is the most}} common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary <b>varicella</b> infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of <b>varicella</b> pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{diagnosis}} of fetal <b>varicella</b> infection {{can be performed}} using ultrasound, though a delay of 5 weeks following primary maternal infection is advised. A PCR (DNA) test of the mother's amniotic fluid can also be performed, though the risk of spontaneous abortion due to the amniocentesis procedure {{is higher than the}} risk of the baby's developing fetal <b>varicella</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The <b>varicella</b> {{vaccine is}} {{recommended}} in many countries. Some countries require the <b>varicella</b> vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A second dose is recommended {{five years after}} the initial immunization. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected. Immunization within three days following household contact reduces infection rates and severity in children.|$|E
25|$|Paracetamol (acetaminophen) but not aspirin {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} fever. Aspirin use by someone with {{chickenpox}} may cause the serious, sometimes fatal disease of the liver and brain, Reye syndrome. People at risk of developing severe complications who have had significant exposure to the virus may be given intra-muscular <b>varicella</b> zoster immune globulin (VZIG), a preparation containing high titres of antibodies to <b>varicella</b> zoster virus, to ward off the disease.|$|E
25|$|The MMRV vaccine, a {{combined}} measles, mumps, rubella and <b>varicella</b> (chickenpox) vaccine, {{has been proposed}} {{as a replacement for}} the MMR vaccine to simplify administration of the vaccines. Preliminary data indicate a rate of Febrile seizures of 9 per 10,000 vaccinations with MMRV, as opposed to 4 per 10,000 for separate MMR and <b>varicella</b> shots; U.S. health officials therefore do not express a preference for use of MMRV vaccine over separate injections.|$|E
25|$|Genes for virus {{specific}} thymidine kinases {{have been}} identified in Herpes simplex virus, <b>Varicella</b> zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus.|$|E
25|$|Primary <b>varicella</b> {{occurs in}} all {{countries}} worldwide. In 2013 the disease resulted in 7,000 deaths – down from 8,900 in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Between 1953 and 1964 Dr Robert Hope-Simpson, a GP, {{carried out}} {{painstaking}} research establishing that shingles is the reactivation of previously acquired chickenpox (<b>varicella)</b> virus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Varicella</b> by Adam Cadre (1999). It {{won four}} XYZZY Awards in 1999 {{including}} the XYZZY Award for Best Game, {{and had a}} scholarly essay written about it.|$|E
25|$|After {{recovering}} from chickenpox, {{it is recommended}} by doctors that adults take one injection of VZV immune globulin and one injection of <b>varicella</b> vaccine or herpes zoster vaccine.|$|E
25|$|The most {{specific}} laboratory {{marker of}} MS reported to date, as of 2016, is the intrathecal MRZ (Measles, Rubella and <b>Varicella)</b> reaction showing 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{was among}} the first {{countries}} to vaccinate for chickenpox. Routine vaccination against <b>varicella</b> zoster virus is also performed in the United States, and the incidence of chickenpox has been dramatically reduced there (from 4 million cases per year in the pre-vaccine era to approximately 400,000 cases per year as of 2005). In Europe most countries do not currently vaccinate against <b>varicella,</b> though the vaccine is gaining wider acceptance. Australia, Canada, and other countries have now adopted recommendations for routine immunization of children and susceptible adults against chickenpox.|$|E
25|$|Sorivudine, a {{nucleoside}} analogue, {{has been}} reported to be effective in the treatment of primary <b>varicella</b> in healthy adults (case reports only), but large-scale clinical trials are still needed to demonstrate its efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Chickenpox, {{also known}} as <b>varicella,</b> is a highly {{contagious}} disease caused by the initial infection with <b>varicella</b> zoster virus (VZV). The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over. It usually starts on the chest, back, and face then spreads {{to the rest of}} the body. Other symptoms may include fever, tiredness, and headaches. Symptoms usually last five to seven days. Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections. The disease is often more severe in adults than in children. Symptoms begin 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus.|$|E
25|$|As measles and rubella cause upper {{respiratory}} disease {{that leads to}} complications of pneumonia and bronchitis which are also caused by <b>varicella,</b> MMR vaccine is beneficial to control exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma.|$|E
25|$|They are {{commonly}} prescribed {{due to a}} theoretical link between Bell's palsy and the herpes simplex and <b>varicella</b> zoster virus. There is still {{the possibility that they}} might result in a benefit less than 7% as this has not been ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to VZV in {{a healthy}} child initiates the {{production}} of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies; IgG antibodies persist for life and confer immunity. Cell-mediated immune responses are also important in limiting the scope and the duration of primary <b>varicella</b> infection. After primary infection, VZV is hypothesized to spread from mucosal and epidermal lesions to local sensory nerves. VZV then remains latent in the dorsal ganglion cells of the sensory nerves. Reactivation of VZV results in the clinically distinct syndrome of herpes zoster (i.e., shingles), postherpetic neuralgia, and sometimes Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. <b>Varicella</b> zoster can affect the arteries in the neck and head, producing stroke, either during childhood, or after a latency period of many years.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine kinase {{is present}} in animals, plants, some bacteria, archeans and virus. The {{thymidine}} kinases from pox viruses, African swine fever virus, Herpes simplex virus, <b>Varicella</b> zoster virus and Epstein- Barr virus have been identified and to a varying degree characterized. The enzyme form in virus {{is different from that}} in other organisms. Thymidine kinase is not present in fungi.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} the <b>Varicella</b> vaccine to prevent chickenpox. Its effect on postherpetic neuralgia is still unknown. The vaccine—made from a weakened {{form of the}} varicella-zoster virus—may keep chickenpox from occurring in nonimmune children and adults, or at least lessen {{the risk of the}} chickenpox virus lying dormant in the body and reactivating later as shingles. If shingles could be prevented, postherpetic neuralgia could be completely avoided.|$|E
25|$|Enríquez de Almanza brought medical {{attention}} to the unprotected and helped those in critical conditions. He established hospitals {{in the city to}} treat the victims of a terrible epidemic (thought to be chicken pox or <b>varicella)</b> that left 3,000 people dead. He published regulations in which the social protection of the Indians was guaranteed against their Spanish patrons, and a fair salary was assured for those who worked as peasants and farmers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Varicella</b> vaccine, {{also known}} as {{chickenpox}} vaccine, is a vaccine that protects against chickenpox. One dose of vaccine prevents 95% of moderate disease and 100% of severe disease. Two doses of vaccine are more effective than one. If given {{to those who are}} not immune within five days of exposure to chickenpox it prevents most cases of disease. Vaccinating {{a large portion of the}} population also protects those who are not vaccinated. It is given by injection just under the skin.|$|E
25|$|Chickenpox {{is rarely}} fatal, {{although}} it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications. Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with chickenpox {{in the previous year}} accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the <b>varicella</b> zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} countries, chickenpox {{is primarily}} a disease of children, with most cases occurring during the winter and spring, most likely due to school contact. It {{is one of the}} classic diseases of childhood, with the highest prevalence in the 4–10-year-old age group. Like rubella, it is uncommon in preschool children. <b>Varicella</b> is highly communicable, with an infection rate of 90% in close contacts. In temperate countries, most people become infected before adulthood, and 10% of young adults remain susceptible.|$|E
25|$|A {{preceding}} antigenic challenge can {{be identified}} in approximately two-thirds of people. Viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, <b>varicella</b> zoster, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus; while the bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. The only vaccine proven to induce ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, <b>varicella,</b> influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use small samples or case studies. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than {{the risk of developing}} ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600.|$|E
25|$|The {{chickenpox}} vaccine {{first became}} commercially available in 1984. A mean of 2,350 reports per year of an adverse event the occurs {{some time after}} <b>varicella</b> vaccine is administered, based on 20,004 cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database from May 1995 through December 2003; however, this includes all adverse events, whether or not caused by the vaccine and some events are to be statistically expected regardless (independent of any vaccine administration). VAERS reports do not imply any finding of causation. Minor events {{are known to be}} underreported to VAERS.|$|E
25|$|Mumps is {{preventable}} by two {{doses of}} the mumps vaccine. Most of the developed world includes it in their immunization programs, often in combination with measles, rubella, and <b>varicella</b> vaccine. Countries that have low immunization rates may see an increase in cases among older age groups and thus worse outcomes. There is no specific treatment. Efforts involve controlling symptoms with pain medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). Intravenous immunoglobulin {{may be useful in}} certain complications. Hospitalization may be required if meningitis or pancreatitis develops. About one per ten thousand people who are infected die.|$|E
