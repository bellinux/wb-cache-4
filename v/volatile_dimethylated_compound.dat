40|$|Abstract Temporal {{changes in}} the {{concentration}} profiles of dimethylsulfide (DMS), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were measured in pack ice from the Bellingshausen Sea (Antarctica) during the winter-spring transition of 2007. Two sites with contrasting snow and ice thicknesses were sampled, with high concentrations of DMS, DMSP, and DMSO observed at both sites, especially in surface ice. These high concentrations were shown to correspond {{to the development of}} a surface ice microalgal community dominated by strong DMSP producers (flagellates and dinoflagellates) following flooding of the ice cover. Several short-term synoptic events were observed and shown to influence strongly the dynamics of sea ice DMS, DMSP, and DMSO. In particular, a cold spell event was associated with drastic {{changes in the}} environmental conditions for the sea ice microbial communities and to a remarkable increase in the production of <b>dimethylated</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> at both sites. A good correlation between all <b>dimethylated</b> sulfur <b>compounds,</b> sea ice temperature, and brine salinity suggested that the observed increase was triggered mainly by increased thermal and osmotic stresses on microalgal cells. Atmospheric forcing, by controlling sea ice temperature and hence the connectivity and instability of the brine network, was also shown to constrain the transfer of <b>dimethylated</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> in the ice towards the ocean via brine drainage. Analysis of the two contrasting sampling sites shed light on the key role played by the snow cover in the sea ice DMS cycle. Thicker snow cover, by insulating the underlying sea ice, reduced the amplitude of environmental changes associated with the cold spell, leading to a weaker physiological response and DMS, DMSP, and DMSO production. Thicker snow also hampered the development of steep gradients in sea ice temperature and brine salinity, thereby decreasing the potential for the release of <b>dimethylated</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> to the ocean via brine drainage...|$|R

The {{product of the}} reaction, methanethiol, was detected by a radiometric assay and by a gas-chromatographic assay coupled to a sulfur-selective chemiluminescence detector. Extracts also catalyzed the methylation of selenide, and the product was shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be methaneselenol. The sulfide and selenide methyltransferase activities copurified with the aromatic thiol methyltransferase previously characterized from this organism (A. -M. Drotar and R. Fall, Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 25 : 396 - 406, 1986), but heat inactivation experiments suggested the involvement of distinct sulfide and selenide methyltransferases. Short-term toxicity tests were carried out for sulfide, selenide, and their methylated derivatives; the monomethylated forms were somewhat more toxic than the nonmethylated or <b>dimethylated</b> <b>compounds.</b> Cell suspensions of T. thermophila exposed to sulfide, methanethiol, or their selenium analogs emitted methylated derivatives into the headspace. These results suggest that this freshwater protozoan is capable of the stepwise methylation of sulfide and selenide, leading {{to the release of}} volatile methylated sulfur or selenium gases...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of molecular hydrogen as a fuel source to replace traditional carbon-based sources {{is key to}} the world's environment and the national security of the United States. Production of molecular hydrogen by energy efficient means with abundant (inexpensive) materials is a recently emerged field throughout science. One approach is to look to nature for inspiration, and this is indeed what our research group has done by mimicking the active site of [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Unfortunately all current models operate at a potential considerably more negative than the thermodynamic potential of hydrogen production. This work attempts to address this deficiency by modulating the reduction/oxidation potentials of the 2 Fe 2 S core by binding it to non-innocent ligands. Non-innocent ligands are ligands which have redox behavior coupled to the reduction/oxidation events of the metal center to which they are bound. This includes ligands which are chromophores, potentially allowing for the reduction of excited states at a less negative potential than the ground state of the complex. One group of catalysts examined in this work is a series of substituted (μ-S₂- 1, 4 -quinone) Fe₂ (CO) ₄L₂ complexes where L= CO, or PR₃. The electronic communication between the disulfide ligands and the metal centers where catalysis occurs dictates the reactivity of a catalytic complex, and thus knowledge of this interaction is vital to construct more efficient catalysts for hydrogen production. These complexes are found to go through two separate one-electron reductions analogous to their parent 1, 4 -quinone compounds but with much less negative reduction potentials. The once-reduced quinone complex is relatively stable and gives the ability to study the electronic communication of the radical species via electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR). Delocalization to the iron centers is demonstrated visibly by the ³¹P hyperfine splitting in the EPR spectrum of a phosphine-substituted derivative. Modeling these EPR spectra with DFT calculations indicates about 20 % spin electron delocalization from the semiquinone anion radical to the iron centers, and changing the functionality of the quinone gives the ability to tune spin density at the metal centers. In the presence of excess acid, the electrochemically produced semiquinone reacts to form the hydroquinone derivatives which subsequently form molecular hydrogen. One possible way of lowering the overpotential of hydrogen producing catalysts is to use a chromophore to capture the energy contained in light, and then transfer the energy to the catalyst active site. One example of a chromophore, which also happens to be capable of binding metal centers is 2 -phenylazopyridine. In order to study the interplay between this chromophore and 2 Fe 2 S catalysts, of the study of two compounds, 1, 2 -(µ-benzenedithiolato) - 2 '-phenylazopyridinediiron-tetracarbonyl and 1, 3 -(µ-propanedithiolato) - 2 '-phenylazopyridinediiron-tetraacarbonyl, was undertaken. The UV-Vis spectra of both complexes show an intense absorption with a molar extinction coefficient in the range of a ligand-to-metal charge transfer; however the wavelength of maximum absorption does not show a dependence on solvent polarity for either complex. Time-dependent-DFT calculations predict the UV-Vis spectra well and show the transition to indeed be a ligand-to-metal charge transfer. DFT calculations show that the difference between the energy of the ground state and excited state has little variance with solvent polarity. Additionally molecular orbital correlation diagrams are constructed to illustrate the relative orbital energies and intramolecular interactions of the complex. Of particular interest is that the LUMO of 2 -phenylazopyridine is relatively low lying in energy, and mixes to comprise approximately 65 % of the LUMO of each complex. Modeling the electronic structure of a non-innocent ligand when not ligated can aid in understanding the electronics of a complex containing the ligand. With the aim of eventually synthesizing a series of [FeFe]-hydrogenase mimics with non-innocent 4, 4 '-bipyridine 3, 3 '-dithiolato ligands; the behavior upon reduction of a series of three 4, 4 '-bipyridine 3, 3 '-disulfide compounds has been investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations. These complexes contain two possible redox active sites; the disulfide bond and the bipyridine/bipyridinium ring. The three compounds show distinct cyclic voltammograms. The nonmethylated compound goes through an irreversible two-electron reduction followed by a two electron oxidation. The monomethylated compound undergoes two quasi-reversible one-electron reductions, while the <b>dimethylated</b> <b>compound</b> undergoes four reversible one-electron reductions. DFT calculations show that both reductions of the nonmethylated compound are centered around the disulfide bond with S-S cleavage occurring after insertion of the second electron. The LUMO of the monomethylated and <b>dimethylated</b> <b>compounds</b> is centered on the bipyridine rings, and consequently that is where initial reduction occurs. Evidence of intramolecular electron transfer is observed after the first reduction of the monomethylated and the second reduction of the <b>dimethylated</b> <b>compound.</b> The experimental cyclic voltammograms can be simulated in agreement with the proposed DFT mechanisms. Non-innocent ligands show rich and complex redox behavior which allow for modulating the redox potentials of catalytic 2 Fe 2 S centers; understanding the interaction between the two redox centers allows for better design of catalytic systems, and is a promising approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} steric bulk on {{electron}} delocalization in 4 -arylpyridines {{has been studied}} by computational methods. Ab initio (HF, UHF, ROHF, MP 2, UMP 2, and ROMP 2) as well as density functional theory (USVWN and UB-LYP) approaches were applied {{to a series of}} molecules and their corresponding anions. These molecules are put forth as models for the ground and MLCT excited states of three polypyridyl ligands that were the subject of a recent report on the effects of sterics and delocalization on the photophysics of several RuII complexes (Damrauer, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 8253). The present study finds that, in the series 4 -phenylpyridine, 4 -(o-tolyl) pyridine, and 4 -(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) pyridine, the steric effect of the ortho-methyl groups serves to increase the dihedral angle between the pyridyl and phenyl rings of the neutral compounds from ca. 45 ° in the case of 4 -phenylpyridine to ca. 65 ° and 90 ° in the mono- and <b>dimethylated</b> <b>compounds,</b> respectively. These results are generally consistent with the single-crystal X-ray structures of the three corresponding bipyridines, also reported herein. Upon one-electron reduction, calculations on all three model ligands reveal a preference for a coplanar structure, with the optimized geometries reflecting a balance between an energetic stabilization gained via conjugation in the planar form and unfavorable steric interactions between the methyl group(s) of the 4 -aryl substituent and the pyridyl protons ortho to the central C-C bond. Calculated dihedral angles were 0 °, 25 °, and 45 ° for 4 -phenyl-, 4 -(o-tolyl) -, and 4 -(2, 6...|$|R
40|$|Symposium on Microscale Interactions in Aquatic Environments - Interactions à microéchelle dans milieux aquatiques, 10 - 15 March 2013, Les Houches, FranceA {{major portion}} of the {{biogeochemical}} cycling of organic sulfur in the pelagic ocean occurs through dimethylated forms: dimethylsulfide (DMS), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The burst of interest in these compounds began with the hypothesized involvement of the volatile species, DMS, in aerosol and cloud formation, hence in climate regulation, over the oceans. This set the need for elucidating and understanding their spatial distribution and temporal dynamics at the global scale, which was hampered {{by the notion that}} most of the mechanistic bases occur at the microscale. Indeed, extensive research has revealed that <b>dimethylated</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> are involved in mechanisms against ecophysiological stress, chemotaxis among plankton microbes, and sulfur transference among trophic levels of planktonic food webs. Molecular tools (including genomics), single cell biogeochemistry methods, and microscale behavior observation techniques are being used to understand the bases of large-­scale patterns that are to be related to climate forcing.

40|$|One {{fifth of}} Mediterranean waters can be {{classified}} as shelf—much higher than the global average. Consequently, the shelf/coastal zone plays a proportionally greater biogeochemical role than in the major oceans, including {{the support of a}} wide range of range of endemic or culturally important species and ecosystems. However, despite their known importance in regulating ecosystem function and the marine sulfur cycle, our understanding of the dynamics of <b>dimethylated</b> sulfur <b>compounds</b> such as dimethylsulphide (DMS) and dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) in Mediterranean benthic habitats is limited. Here, a community-level approach was adopted to quantify DMS and DMSP dynamics in Mediterranean ecosystems including seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows, coralligène (an algal carbonate reef found along the Mediterranean shelf) and macroalgal stands. It was found that P. oceanica and coralligène are likely to act as significant benthic stocks of DMSP in the coastal/shelf environment. “Hotspots” of water column DMS and DMSP processing were observed where net benthic production was high (e. g., P. oceanica meadows), demonstrating that benthic communities are able to modify DMS biogeochemistry in the overlying water column. High variability between, and within, habitat types illustrates the importance of ecosystem structure and light availability in determining benthic DMS and DMSP accumulation, and highlights a previously under-appreciated complexity in benthic dimethylated sulfur dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is a <b>dimethylated</b> sulphur <b>compound</b> {{that appears}} to be {{produced}} by most marine algae and is a major component of the marine sulphur cycle. The majority of research to date has focused on the production of DMSP and its major breakdown product, the climatically important gas dimethylsulphide (DMS) (collectively DMS/P), by phytoplankton in the open ocean. A number of functions for intracellular DMSP (DMSPi) in phytoplankton have been identified and the cycling of DMS/P appears to be critical for ecosystem function. However, mechanisms for the production and release of DMS/P in the coastal ocean are poorly understood, despite the region’s economic and ecological importance. Coralline algal habitats (e. g. maerl beds, coral reefs, seagrass meadows, kelp forests) are distributed throughout the coastal oceans worldwide. Their three-dimensional structure supports high biodiversity and provides numerous services, generating considerable economic wealth. DMSPi in coralline algae is known to be high, thus coralline algal habitats may be critical components of the coastal sulphur cycle. This research aimed to improve our understanding of the production of DMS/P by coralline algal habitats by investigating (1) natural spatiotemporal variation and (2) the influence of environmental pressures. This was achieved through a number of laboratory and field-based studies, utilising modern and well-established techniques. The first objective of this research was to better understand the photosynthesis of red coralline algae (Chapter 3), as the algal precursor to DMSPi is methionine, a product of photosynthesis. The photosynthetic characteristics of coralline algae exhibited acclimation to changing light conditions (e. g. over a diurnal cycle or between natural and static lighting conditions). Further, for the species tested, coralline algae are often subjected to light-saturating natural conditions, therefore requiring efficient photo-protective mechanisms, which may include DMSPi regulation. On a global scale, DMSPi in coralline algae may decline with latitude, reinforcing the role of DMSPi as an antioxidant (Chapter 4). At smaller spatial scales, DMS/P production, release and recycling mechanisms were apparent in a number of habitat types (Chapter 4). A strong seasonal trend in DMS/P was also observed at a Scottish maerl bed, driven by water temperature and cloud cover (Chapter 5). Annually averaged DMS and DMSP concentrations were 230...|$|R

Section-I begins with a brief introduction to Pfaffic acid 1, a naturally occurring hexacyclic nortriterpene, in particular to its isolation, structural elucidation and antitumor activity. The antitumor activities of the Pfafosides A, B, C, D, E and F, the glycosides of pfaffic acid 1, isolated from the same plant is also described. The discussion presents the synthetic strategy developed to construct the AB ring system along with the results of the attempted synthesis of DEF ring of Pfaffic acid 1. The retrosynthetic analysis of 1 identified the key intermediates as AB synthon 2, and the DEF synthon 3, Regioselective hydride reduction of Wieland-Mischer ketone, followed by hydroxyl protection and Woodward methylation gave the <b>dimethylated</b> <b>compound</b> 4 Deprotection of the hydroxyl group and reduction of the carbonyl followed by acetylation resulted in the diacetate 5 Oxidation of the diacetate 5 with PDC-/BuOOH-celite system followed by lithium-liquid ammonia reduction yielded the saturated keto diol 6, which on dehydration and subsequent acetylation afforded the enone acetate 2, which formed the AB ring of Pfaffic acid 1 The synthetic studies towards the construction of DEF rings of Pfaffic acid commenced with the preparation of the indane methanol 7 The alcohol 7 was synthesized starting from 5 -methoxyindan-l-one Thus 5 -methoxyindanone was converted into the hydroxymethyl compound 8 by Wittig reaction and subsequent hydroboration Swern oxidation of 7, followed by methylation and reduction resulted in the indane methanol 7 Lithium-ammonia reduction of 7 gave a dihydrocompound, which on hydrolysis with oxalic acid gave the isomeric enones 9 and 10 in 1 1 ratio On the other hand, hydrolysis of the dihydrocompound with 5 N HC 1 in methanol afforded the isomers 9 and 10 in 85 15 ratio Addition of KCN to the isomeric enone mixture (85 15) resulted in the lactone 11 in 60 % yield. The formation of the lactone 11 clearly established that the major isomer of the mixture has the angular hydrogen and hydroxymethyl group in as orientation as represented in 9, but unfortunately this geometry is unfavorable for the construction of the DEF ring of Pfaffic acid Similar Birch reduction of the alcohol 8 gave the corresponding dihydrocompound, which on hydrolysis with 5 N HC 1 in methanol afforded the isomeric alcohols 12 and 13 in 92 8 ratio Hydrogenation of the mixture followed by tosylation yielded the tosylates 14 and 15 in the same ratio Attempted intramolecular cyclisation of the tosylate mixture with different bases failed to yield any tricyclic compound, indicating that the major isomer has the unfavorable geometry for intramolecular alkylation. The origin of stereoselectivity during the hydrolysis of the enol-ether leading to the formation of the isomers 9 and 12 in major amount, was found to be due to a novel hydroxyl directed protonataon as represented in 16 Section-ll describes a novel oxidative C-C bond cleavage reaction with chromium reagents The alcohol 8 when oxidized with a variety of chromium reagents gave 5 -methoxyindan- 1 -one in good yields. The mechanism of this reaction seems to go via the enol 17, which undergoes C-C bond cleavage to afford 5 -methoxyindan-l-one.
