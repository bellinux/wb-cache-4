40|$|Sprouting is a {{key factor}} {{affecting}} the quality of potato tubers. The present study aimed to compare the differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the apical meristem during the dormancy release and sprouting stages by using lncRNA sequencing. Microscopic observations and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed {{the changes in the}} morphology and expression of lncRNAs in potato tubers during sprouting. Meristematic cells of potato tuber apical buds divided continuously and exhibited <b>vegetative</b> <b>cone</b> bulging and vascularisation. In all, 3175 lncRNAs were identified from the apical buds of potato tubers, among which 383 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 340 were down-regulated during sprouting. The GO enrichment analysis revealed that sprouting mainly influenced the expression of lncRNAs related to the cellular components of potato apical buds (e. g., cytoplasm and organelles) and cellular metabolic processes. The KEGG enrichment analysis also showed significant enrichment of specific metabolic pathways. In addition, 386 differentially expressed lncRNAs during sprouting were identified as putative targets of 235 potato miRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results agreed with the sequencing data. Our study provides the first systematic study of numerous lncRNAs involved in the potato tuber sprouting process and lays the foundation for further studies to elucidate their precise functions...|$|E

5000|$|Lobb {{immediately}} realised {{the impact}} such a tree {{would have on}} British gardens and the importance that his employers would attach to being the first nursery to offer it for sale. After the meeting, he quickly headed to Calaveras Grove where he had the good luck to find a recently fallen tree, which he measured as [...] "about 300 feet in length, 29 feet 2 inches, at 5 feet above the ground...". In his notebooks, Lobb recorded: [...] "From 80 to 90 trees exist all within circuit of a mile, from 250ft. to 320ft. in height, 10-12ft. in diameter." [...] He collected as many seeds, <b>cones,</b> <b>vegetative</b> shoots and seedlings as he could carry back to San Francisco, including two small living trees. He then returned to England on the first available boat arriving back in Exeter on 15 December 1853, a year earlier than expected. Lobb had taken a gamble cutting short his contract, knowing that, {{at the risk of}} angering his employer, he had to get the seeds to England before anyone else could get back first. The gamble paid off as Veitch was delighted, abandoning all other projects to concentrate on raising the seedlings in commercial quantities. According to Hortus Veitchii, the two sapling trees [...] "survived but three or four years, nor was there at any time much hope of their living." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of heterosis at isozyme loci on inbreeding and crossbreeding was studied in 10 -yr-old trees of knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata Lemm.). Heterozygosity was determined at 24 polymorphic isozyme loci {{and related to}} the rate of <b>vegetative</b> growth and <b>cone</b> production. The inbreds, created by selfpollination, had 46 % of the heterozygosity of their mothers; the crossbreds, created by interpopulation crossing, had 155 % of the heterozygosity of their mothers. Within the crossbreds, heterozygosity {{was positively correlated with}} trunk growth, but negatively correlated with cone production. Results in the crossbreds, however, were strongly influenced by a few individuals that showed unusually slow growth, high reproduction and low heterozygosity. Without those individuals, there was no relationship of heterozygosity to either growth or reproduction. â€”Within the inbreds, heterozygosity was positively correlated with both trunk growth and cone production. Each locus that was heterozygous in the mothers was calculated to mark about 3 % of the genome for identity by descent in the inbred progeny; the total proportion of the genome marked was between 10 and 11 %. Using these estimates to relate heterozygosity to the inbreeding coefficient (F) gave estimates of inbreeding depression per unit of F that fell within the range of published values for conifers. The strength of heterosis found among the inbreds suggests that single-locus or multilocus overdominance should be exceedingly difficult to detect in natural populations of predominantly outcrossing species...|$|R
