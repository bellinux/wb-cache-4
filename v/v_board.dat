5|$|Constitutional amendments, {{such as the}} 1868 Fourteenth Amendment, {{according}} to Scalia, were to be interpreted based on their meaning {{at the time of}} ratification. Scalia was often asked how that approach justified the result in the 1954 case of Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education, which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and which relied on the Fourteenth Amendment for the result.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between church and state.

5|$|Black's {{majority}} opinion in McCollum <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education (1948) {{held that the}} government could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the {{majority opinion}} in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E

5|$|Following the Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education Supreme Court decision, Manual became racially {{integrated}} without {{controversy and}} graduated {{its first two}} black students in 1958. Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was exempt from court-ordered busing in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for {{black and white students}} was unconstitutional. Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, Brown <b>vs.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education was a {{landmark}} decision because it found and declared that, “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal”. [...] This {{began the process}} of desegregation in many schools that had not desegregated yet. [...] The significance of Brown <b>vs.</b> <b>Board</b> was the universal right of all students to attend educational institutions equally rather than separately based on their race. Jonathan Kozol, author of The Shame of the Nation, talks about how “physical conditions in these newly integrated schools were generally more cheerful…state of mind among the teachers and the children was more high-spirited” {{in the aftermath of}} desegregation.|$|R
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment, {{particularly}} {{its first}} section, {{is one of}} the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education (1954) regarding racial segregation, Roe v. Wade (1973) regarding abortion, Bush v. Gore (2000) regarding the 2000 presidential election, and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, including those acting on behalf of such an official.|$|E
5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good {{physical and mental}} condition {{for most of the}} last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of judicial activism, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education, which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E
