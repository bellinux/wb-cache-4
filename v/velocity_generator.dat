40|$|Abstract—This work paper {{refers to}} a {{specific}} type of machines functioning known as granular materials separator, which are using vibratory motion for their working elements (sieves). An efficient vibratory motion for this type of machines produces a process of self-sorting for granules of different masses and sizes in the nearby surface of the sieve. Therefore mechanical systems of separating machines are using an adequate supporting system and a specified generative force system in order to produce a certain trajectory for the center of mass of the working element (Lissajous elliptic type curves). For this not only stiffness constants (influenced by material characteristics and shape) of supporting elements but also damping constants is a very important factor that influence motion. stiffness coefficients, and c x, z damping coefficients in Ox and Oz direction of supporting elements, e is radius of the center of mass position of non-equilibrated mass of generators, � is angular <b>velocity</b> of <b>generators</b> motors and therefore pulsation of generative centrifugal force which is directed constantly at � angle to horizontal direction Oz as it is presented in Fig. 2...|$|R
40|$|The power {{electronic}} interface to a vibration energy harvester not only provides ac-dc conversion, {{but can also}} set the electrical damping to maximize output power under displacement-constrained operation. This is commonly exploited for linear two-port harvesters by synchronous switching to realize a Coulomb-damped resonant generator, but has not been fully explored when the harvester is asynchronously switched to emulate a resistive load. In {{order to understand the}} potential of such an approach, the optimal values of load resistance and other control parameters need to be known. In this paper we determine analytically the optimal load and stiffness of a harmonically driven two-port harvester with displacement constraints. For weak-coupling devices, we do not find any benefit of load and stiffness adjustment beyond maintaining a saturated power level. For strong coupling we find that the power can be optimized to agree with the <b>velocity</b> damped <b>generator</b> beyond the first critical force for displacement-constrained operation. This can be sustained up to a second critical force, determined by a resonator figure-of-merit, at which the power ultimately levels out. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

40|$|The MAVIS II {{computer}} program {{provides for the}} modeling and analysis of explosive valve interactions. This report describes the individual components {{of the program and}} how MAVIS II is used with other available tools to integrate the design and understanding of explosive valves. The rationale and model used for each valve interaction is described. Comparisons of the calculated results with available data have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of using MAVIS II for analytical studies of explosive valve interactions. The model used for the explosive or pyrotechnic used as the driving force in explosive valves is the most critical to be understood and modeled. MAVIS II is an advanced version that incorporates a plastic, as well as elastic, modeling of the deformations experienced when plungers are forced into a bore. The inclusion of a plastic model has greatly expanded the use of MAVIS for all categories (opening, closure, or combined) of valves, especially for the closure valves in which the sealing operation requires the plastic deformation of either a plunger or bore over a relatively large area. In order to increase its effectiveness, the use of MAVIS II should be integrated with the results from available experimental hardware. Test hardware such as the Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR) and <b>Velocity</b> <b>Generator</b> test provide experimental data for accurate comparison of the actual valve functions. Variable Explosive Chamber (VEC) and Constant Explosive Volume (CEV) tests are used to provide the proper explosive equation-of-state for the MAVIS calculations of the explosive driving forces.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on control of the power take off (PTO) element of a point {{absorber}} wave energy converter. The research {{is based on a}} nonlinear simulation of a PTO hydraulic circuit, in which the piston <b>velocity</b> and <b>generator</b> torque act as `disturbance' and control actuator variables respectively, whilst the damping force is the controlled output variable. The piston velocity is generated by a hydrodynamic simulation model that reacts to both the damping force and sea wave profile. The damping force set point will be obtained from an associated power capture optimisation module and may be time varying. However, it is clear that such an adaptive tuning system also requires high performance `low-level' control of the device actuators, in order to fully realise the benefits of optimisation. In this regard, the present article illustrates use of the Proportional-Integral-Plus (PIP) control methodology as applied to the PTO simulation. In their simplest linear form, such PIP controllers do not account for the interconnected system variables mentioned above. For this reason, the research also considers `feed-forward' and `state-dependent' forms of PIP control, in which the piston velocity is appended to a non-minimal state space representation of the system...|$|R

Utilizing wind power generation and thermal power plants together create new concerns for operation engineers of power systems. In this paper, a model {{is presented to}} implement the {{uncertainty of}} load and generated wind power which can be utilized in power system operation planning. Stochastic behavior of parameters is simulated by generating scenarios that can be solved by deterministic method. A mixed-integer linear programming method is used for solving deterministic generation scheduling problem. The proposed approach is applied to a 12 -unit test system including 10 thermal units and 2 wind farms. The results show affectivity of piecewise linear model in unit commitment problems. Also using linear programming causes a considerable reduction in calculation times and guarantees convergence to the global optimum.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{time scale}} of axisymmetric vortex rings is studied numerically for relatively long discharge times. Experimental {{findings on the}} existence and universality of a formation time scale, {{referred to as the}} `formation number', are confirmed. The formation number is indicative of the time at which a vortex ring acquires its maximal circulation. For vortex rings generated by impulsive motion of a piston, the formation number was found to be approximately four, in very good agreement with experimental results. Numerical extensions of the experimental study to other cases, including cases with thick shear layers, show that the scaled circulation of the pinched-off vortex is relatively insensitive to the details of the formation process, such as the velocity programme, <b>velocity</b> profile, vortex <b>generator</b> geometry and the Reynolds number. This finding might also indicate that the properly scaled circulation of steady vortex rings varies very little. The formation number does depend on the velocity profile. Non-impulsive velocity programmes slightly increase the formation number, while non-uniform velocity profiles may decrease it significantly. In the case of a parabolic velocity profile of the discharged flow, for example, the formation number decreases by a factor as large as four. These findings indicate that a major source of the experimentally found small variations in the formation number is the different evolution of the velocity profile of the discharged flow...|$|R
