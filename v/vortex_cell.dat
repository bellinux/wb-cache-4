40|$|Flow past {{circular}} cylinders with stepwise discontinuities {{in diameter}} was investigated experimentally and numerically for the diameter ratio D/d = 2 and three Reynolds numbers, Re = 150, 300, and 1050. The investigation {{was focused on}} the vortex shedding phenomena occurring {{in the wake of the}} cylinders. In the first series of experimental and numerical studies, the flow development past a single step cylinder was investigated. The single step cylinder model is comprised of a small diameter cylinder (d) attached coaxially to a large diameter cylinder (D). The results show that three distinct spanwise <b>vortex</b> <b>cells</b> form in the step cylinder wake: a single <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cell</b> in the wake of the small cylinder (the S-cell) and two <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cells</b> in the wake of the large cylinder, one in the region downstream of the step (the N-cell) and the other away from the step (the L-cell). Due to the differences in vortex shedding frequencies between the three <b>cells,</b> complex <b>vortex</b> connections occur in two vortex-interaction regions located between the adjacent cells. The region at the boundary between the S-cell and the N-cell is relatively narrow and its spanwise extent does not fluctuate significantly. In this region, vortex dislocations manifested as half-loop connections between two S-cell vortices of opposite sign. In contrast, the region at the boundary between the N-cell and the L-cell exhibits a transient behavior, with large scale vortex dislocations causing cyclic variation in the extent of N-cell vortices. For Re = 300 and 1050, small scale streamwise vortices forming in the wake complicate the vortex dynamics within the adjacent S-cell and L-cell. There is no significant Reynolds number effect on the average spanwise extent of the <b>vortex</b> <b>cells</b> and the two transition regions between neighboring cells. Finally, formation of N-cell vortices is linked to downwash fluctuations near the step. The flow development past a dual step cylinder was studied experimentally for Re = 1050. The dual step cylinder model is comprised of a small diameter cylinder (d) and a large diameter cylinder (D) mounted at the mid-span of the small cylinder. The experiments were completed for a range of large cylinder aspect ratios 0. 2 ≤ L/D ≤ 17. The flow development is highly dependent on the aspect ratio of the large cylinder, L/D. The results identify four distinct flow regimes: (i) for L/D = 17, three <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cells</b> form in the wake of the large cylinder, one central cell and two cells of lower frequency extending over about 4. 5 D from the large cylinder ends, (ii) for 7 < L/D ≤ 14, a single <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cell</b> forms in the wake of the large cylinder, whose shedding frequency decreases with decreasing L/D, (iii) for 2 ≤ L/D ≤ 7, vortex shedding in the wake of the large cylinder is highly three-dimensional, with vortices deforming in the near wake, (iv) for 0. 2 ≤ L/D ≤ 1, only small cylinder vortices are shed in the wake and can form vortex connections across the wake of the large cylinder...|$|R

Both of these mechanisms mix the upper layer of oceans and lakes, but since the mixing efficiency of Langmuir cells is unknown, their relevance to mixed layer deepening is still an open question. In order to estimate the contribution to mixing by Langmuir <b>vortex</b> <b>cells</b> relative to shear‐induced mixing, we employ results on entrainment rate obtained from laboratory experiments with turbulent Taylor <b>vortex</b> <b>cells.</b> These are coherent horizontal vortices analogous to Langmuir cells. To relate the two, we define a surface friction velocity u* that {{would be necessary to}} drive cells of strength equivalent to the Taylor vortices.

For Richardson numbers Ri* > 120, the entrainment rate decreases, but there is no criterion for the arrest of mixing by turbulent Langmuir cells as was previously suggested. The present results confirm observations that shear‐generated turbulence dominates during initial layer deepening under relatively weak buoyancy effects and that subsequently Langmuir cell mixing dominates the mixed layer deepening. The entrainment rates obtained from laboratory experiments are discussed and predict values for the mixed layer deepening that are in good agreement with in situ observations...|$|R

The single step cylinder model is comprised of a small-diameter cylinder (d) attached coaxially to a large-diameter cylinder (D). In this study vortex shedding from such a bluff body is investigated experimentally using Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TOMO PIV). Experiments are conducted in the low-speed w-tunnel of the aerospace engineering department of TU Delft. The cylinders' diameter ratio D/d is ranging from 1. 14 to 2. 67, and the Reynolds numbers based on the large cylinder are ranging from 2000 to 5100. The TOMO PIV system consists of six CCD cameras subtending an arc and a Nd:YAG laser. LaVision Davis 8 is used for image acquisition and processing. The use of TOMO PIV enables quantitative visualization {{and analysis of the}} intricate vortex topology and vortex dynamics. The aim of the study is the exploration of the near wake of the step cylinder, focusing on the region of stepwise discontinuity. Considering history of the investigations for this geometry, there is no study available for this range of Reynolds number, and this range of the diameter ratios. For the range of the parameters investigated, turbulent vortex shedding occurs in the single-step cylinder wake. Thus, the investigations will put more insight into the flow development in the wake of this bluff body. The results showed that distinct spanwise <b>vortex</b> <b>cells</b> form in the step cylinder wake: a single <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cell</b> {{in the wake of the}} small cylinder, and one <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cell</b> in the wake of the large cylinder. However, in the wake of the large cylinder wake an interaction region is also introduced. The difference in the diameters leads to a variation in the vortex shedding frequency, which introduces intricate three-dimensional vortex interactions in the wake of the step cylinder. Once in a while, the vortex shedding becomes out of phase, which introduces a dislocation at the boundary of two cells. The dislocation is exhibited by a half-loop connection, in which two vortices within the same cell connect to each other. Results showed that there is no significant Reynolds number effect on the average spanwise extent of the <b>vortex</b> <b>cells</b> and the transition region between neighboring cells.

This study investigates by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) the wavy Taylor vortex flow that develops in the gap between concentric rotating cylinders of low aspect ratio and low radius ratio, which is a configuration relevant to oil bearing chambers in turbomachinery. The configuration is characterised by a larger annular gap width than in classical journal bearing and by a Taylor number (Ta) of 2. 47 × 10 ^ 6, which is 1000 {{times higher than the}} first critical Taylor number.

30|$|Effective {{lubrication}} under {{extreme conditions}} such as high temperature is of considerable importance to ensure the reliability of a mechanical system. New lubricants that can endure high temperatures should be studied and employed as alternatives to traditional oil-based lubricant. In this paper, a thermocapillary model of a silicone-oil droplet is developed by solving the Navier–Stokes and energy equations to obtain the flow, pressure, and temperature fields. This is accomplished using a conservative microfluidic two-phase flow level set method designed to track the interface between two immiscible fluids. The numerical simulation accuracy is examined by comparing the numerical results with experimental results obtained for a silicone-oil droplet. Hence, the movement and deformation of molten silicon droplets on graphite and corundum are numerically simulated. The results show that a temperature gradient causes a tension gradient on the droplet surface, which in turn creates a thermocapillary vortex. As the vortex develops, the droplet migrates to the low-temperature zone. In the initial stage, the molten silicon droplet on the corundum substrate forms two opposite vortex cells, whereas two pairs of opposite vortices are formed in the silicone fluid on the graphite substrate. Multiple vortex cells gradually develop into a single <b>vortex</b> <b>cell,</b> and the migration velocity tends to be stable.

Of main interest were the influences of step size and Reynolds number on the formation of <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cells.</b> Mean flow characteristics and instantaneous captures of the flow field were analyzed in order to gain insight into vortex development in the wake. Spectral analysis was applied to obtain information on the number of forming <b>vortex</b> shedding <b>cells.</b> It was found that an increase in Re_D leads to a decrease in eddy formation length $L_f$. At the largest investigated Reynolds number, turbulence gained strong influence on the flow characteristics. An increase in stepsize leads to the development of a large and a small diameter wake with distinct eddy formation lengths L_{f,L} and L_{f,S}. Due to a mismatch in vortex shedding frequencies in the two wakes, vortices that come out of phase connect to subsequent vortices on the same side of the step.

The present treatment develops a full symbolic computational package which takes a desired waveform at the anti-continuum limit of uncoupled sites, performs a required number of Lyapunov [...] Schmidt reductions and outputs the predictions on whether the configuration persists, for finite coupling, in the three-dimensional lattice and whether it is stable or unstable. It also provides approximations for the eigenvalues of the linearized stability problem. We report a number of applications of the algorithm to important multi-site configurations, such as the simple cube, the double cross, and the diamond. For each three-dimensional configuration, we identify exactly one solution, which is stable for small coupling between lattice nodes. Comment: 21 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

[URL] study investigates by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) the wavy Taylor vortex flow that develops {{in the gap}} between concentric rotating cylinders of low aspect ratio and low radius ratio, which is a configuration relevant to oil bearing chambers in turbomachinery. The configuration is characterised by a larger annular gap width than the one typically used in journal bearings and by a Taylor number (a) of 2. 47 x 10 ^ 6, which is 1000 {{times higher than the}} first critical Taylor number. It is found that the non-uniform axial spacing of the vortex cores induces an asymmetric radial velocity profile and an inflected axial velocity profile close to the cylindrical walls. The outflow at the centre of each pair of Taylor vortices that make up a <b>vortex</b> <b>cell</b> is strong and it is characterised by a sharp radial velocity peak. The inflow between pairs of Taylor vortex cells is unconventional in that it is characterised by pairs of confluent streams from the outer cylinder that merge towards the inner cylinder. These results form a body of experimental evidence on the flow features that may occur in engineering practice in oil bearing chamber flows, with relevance to lubrication and wear.

A series of laboratory experiments were conducted in a glass wave tank to investigate the propagation of internal gravity waves up a sloping bottom in a fluid with constant Brunt- Vaisala frequency. Measurements of the wave motion in the fluid interior were primarily taken with electrical conductivity probes; measurements in the boundary layer were made with dye streaks and neutrally buoyant particles. The results indicate that, outside of the breaking zone, the amplitude and horizontal wave number of the high-frequency waves increase linearly with decreasing depth; this is shown to agree with existing linear, inviscid solutions. A zone of breaking or runup is induced by these high-frequency waves well upslope. Shadowgraph observations show that, if the wave characteristics are coincident, or nearly so, with the bottom slope, the upslope propagation of the lowfrequency waves causes a line of regularly spaced vortices to form along the slope. Subsequent mixing in the <b>vortex</b> <b>cells</b> creates thin horizontal laminae that are more homogeneous than the adjacent layers. These laminae slowly penetrate the fluid interior, creating a step-like vertical density structure. [URL]...|$|R
