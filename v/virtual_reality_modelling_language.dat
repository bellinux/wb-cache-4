5000|$|The <b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality</b> <b>Modelling</b> <b>Language</b> (VRML), first {{introduced}} in 1994, {{was intended for}} the development of [...] "virtual worlds" [...] without dependency on headsets. The Web3D consortium was subsequently founded in 1997 {{for the development of}} industry standards for web-based 3D graphics. The consortium subsequently developed X3D from the VRML framework as an archival, open-source standard for web-based distribution of VR content. All modern VR displays are based on technology developed for smartphones including: gyroscopes and motion sensors for tracking head, hand, and body positions; small HD screens for stereoscopic displays; and small, lightweight and fast processors. These components led to relative affordability for independent VR developers, and lead to the 2012 Oculus Rift kickstarter offering the first independently developed VR headset.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{interactive}} environments. One is to re-create 3D space with visual representations of the museum by a 3D architectural metaphor, which provides {{a sense of place}} using various spatial references. They usually use 3D modelling, VRML (<b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality</b> <b>Modelling</b> <b>Language)</b> and now X3D(successor to VRML) for viewing. There have been introduced various kinds of imaging techniques for building virtual museums, such as infrared reflectography, X-ray imaging, 3D laser scanning, IBMR (Image Based Rendering and Modeling) techniques. In the case of EU-funded projects, the ViHAP3D, a new virtual reality system for scanning museum artifacts, has been developed by EU researchers. Another interactive three-dimensional spatial environment is QTVR. Being a pre-rendered, fixed environment it is more restricted in regards to moving freely around in 3D space but the image quality can be superior to that of real-time rendered environments. This was especially the case in the mid-1990s when computing power and online speeds were limited.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{object-oriented}} language called VRML++ which extends the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality</b> <b>Modeling</b> <b>Language</b> (VRML 2. 0), a specification language for interactive three-dimensional scenes on the internet. The new features of VRML++ are classes and inheritance, an improved type system, and dynamic routing. As a net result we get type-safe inclusion polymorphism and dynamic binding. We argue, that these features are essentials of object-oriented programming languages. Furthermore using these new features {{it is possible}} to define abstractions of routing structures which we call connection classes. VRML++ increases reuseability, readability, and extensibility of specifications while reducing run-time errors.
