50|$|An α-amino acid has {{a central}} carbon (the α or alpha carbon) which is covalently bonded to a {{carboxyl}} group (thus they are carboxylic acids), an amino group, a hydrogen atom and a <b>variable</b> <b>group.</b> The <b>variable</b> <b>group,</b> {{also called the}} R group or side chain, determines the identity {{and many of the}} properties of a specific amino acid. In glycine, the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the L-configuration. Peptidoglycan, found in some bacterial cell walls contains some D-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO−) and the basic amine group (-NH2) gains a proton (-NH). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion, with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. Aspartic acid, for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH.|$|E

40|$|The {{publicity}} {{surrounding the}} low graduation rate of some collegiate student athletes {{has resulted in}} a number of studies attempting to discover significant predictors of student athlete graduation. Previous studies have relied upon relationships developed from zero-order correlation and multiple regression on a single dependent variable; either a dichotomously scored variable reflecting whether or not the student athlete graduated or cumulative grade point average (GPA). Too often, by the time the independent variables have manifested themselves, {{it was too late for}} the student athlete to successfully complete the academic requirements for graduation;This study hypothesized that (1) academic success consisted of two dependent variables: cumulative GPA and total college credits earned, (2) three <b>variable</b> <b>groups</b> could predict academic success, and (3) individual variables within the three groups found to be significant could be used to develop a causal model of academic success tested by path analysis. The three independent <b>variable</b> <b>groups</b> were pre-college <b>variables,</b> collegiate athletic success, and collegiate academic variables. Canonical analysis was used to study the effect of the <b>variable</b> <b>groups</b> on each of the dependent variables both individually and combined;Results indicated each of the <b>variable</b> <b>groups</b> was a significant predictor of student athlete academic success. Contrary to what would be expected based upon the established social theories of locus of control or attributional theory, athletic success as measured by amount of athletic grant-in-aid, conference standing of the team or athletic letters earned was a significant and negative predictor of academic success. The team graduation rate over a 6 -year period was found to be a significant predictor of academic success of current team members. Each of the dependent variables was found to have different independent variables acting upon them, challenging the assumption that graduation is a unitary concept. The proposed causal model was not fully supported. Finally, this study suggests further research is needed to describe latent factors of academic success and graduation in order to understand student athlete and general student body attrition...|$|R

Data was collect within various museums in the city, by touring and observing different paintings by European artists. These museums included Musée de Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, Musée National Picasso, and Musée National D’Art Modern. It was noted which era the paintings were constructed in and what medium was used in their creation, in each of the museums. Also, consideration from artists and paint supply stores was taken. Two trends were directly compared. The control group being the adaptation from tempra medium to oil, in comparison with the <b>variable</b> <b>group,</b> oil medium to acrylic.

In this paper two variants of an agglomerative method for learning a hierarchy of IVGA groupings are presented. The method resembles hierarchical clustering, but the choice of clusters to merge is based on variational Bayesian model comparison. This is approximately equivalent to using a distance measure based on a model-based approximation of mutual information between groups of variables. The approach also allows determining optimal cutoff points for the hierarchy.
