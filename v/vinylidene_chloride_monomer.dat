The treated specimens were tested as to their static and dynamic bending strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity in bending and internal friction, surface hardness, hygroscopicity, dimensional stabilities, and their flame-retardancy. The specific gravity, surface hardness and dynamic bending strength of the composite were apparently increased {{with an increase in}} the polymer loading, but the polymerization of the <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>monomer</b> in wood by - radiation had negligible effect on the bending strength, modulus of elasticity in bending and internal friction.

Thorough investigations were therefore made at the two temperatures, 25 ⁰ C and 42. 6 ⁰ C, and in the pressure range 20 torr to 600 torr, with the following results: (i) Attainment of equilibrium, especially at the higher pressures, was very slow and as a result only approximate isotherms could be obtained. These isotherms were shown to exhibit hysteresis. Comparison of the amount of monomer adsorbed at the higher pressures within the above limits, with the amount of krypton required to cover the surface with a monolayer, indicated that multimolecular adsorption occurred. The ascending branches of the isotherms appeared to obey the Freundlich isotherm and the approximate isosteric heats of adsorption calculated from the equilibrium data fell off linearly as the logarithm of the amount of monomer adsorbed increased; as would be expected if the Freundlich isotherm were obeyed. The values of the heats of adsorption found were such that comparison between them and the latent heat of vapourisation of the monomer made it difficult to decide whether the first layer on the surface was chemisorbed or physically adsorbed. (ii) The kinetic data showed that there was always an initial instantaneous adsorption which was reversible towards pressure, followed by a very much slower uptake of monomer. The kinetics of the slow uptake of monomer was studied, at the two temperatures, under both constant pressure and constant volume conditions and was shown to consist of two processes...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{because of}} the {{increase}} of environmental concerns in process design, the need to enhance conversion to product and prevent generation of wasteful byproducts in the reactor network has become urgent. This prevents high cost treatment and separation costs downstream in the process. Therefore, in this thesis I focus on making production of vinyl <b>chloride</b> <b>monomer</b> (VCM) more efficient and on possible ways of industrial organochlorine waste (OCW) recycling. In particular, in the first experiment, we investigate how catalyst and its structure can affect product output. Infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis were utilized to investigate {{the structure of the}} γ-Al 2 O 3 carrier with CuCl 2 catalyst on its surface. Structure of the two catalysts, HarshowX 1 and MEDC-B, and their effect on the mechanism of ethylene oxidative chlorination reaction into 1, 2 -dichlorethane were studied. Differential thermal analysis and mass spectroscopy were applied to study the structure and the mechanism differences between the deposited and permeated CuCl 2 catalysts. The second experiment deals with ecological processing and recycling methods of wasteful byproduct that can be called chlororganic wastes. Typical waste products are 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, <b>vinylidene,</b> and vinyl <b>chloride</b> <b>monomer.</b> Polymerization and copolymerization of typical waste products with their C 5 -C 9 fraction resulted in non-toxic polymer products {{that can be used in}} construction and road-building industries. The possibility of joint chlorine and sulfide-containing chemical wastes recycling into polysulfide oligomeric products is discussed. This comprehensive recycling allows utilizing 80 - 90 % of all wastes generated during synthesis of chlorinated products in the chemical industry. The results of the studies aim to improve the conversion of ethylene to vinyl chloride and minimize the formation of byproducts...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{copolymerisation}} behaviour of acrylonitrile with the monomers methyl acrylate and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> respectively. The project arose from reports by workers at Courtauld's Ltd. that the lengths of the sequences of the monomer units in certain copolymers of acrylonitrile and <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> were longer than predicted by statistical considerations. The copolymerisation of methyl acrylate with acrylonitrile was studied to examine the possibility of a preferential swelling of polymer particles by one monomer during polymerisation. Copolymerisation was carried out in three different solvents, and unsuccessful attempts were made to measure the sequence lengths in the polymers directly using NMR spectroscopy. Only compositional analysis was possible by this means, but measurements of the thermal properties of the polymers indicated that the sequence lengths were short in all cases. It was found that the Alfrey-Lewis copolymerisation equation was obeyed when the reaction was carried out homogeneously in dimethylformamide, but it was not obeyed when it was carried out heterogeneously in hexane or butanol. The copolymerisation of acrylonitrile with <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> was studied in several different solvents, and also in mixed solvent systems. Sequence lengths were measured by NMR spectroscopy, and were found to be short for all methods of preparation. In no case was the Alfrey-Lewis copolymer equation obeyed, even in those solvent systems for which the reaction was homogeneous. The preparation of copolymers homogeneously in dimethylformamide showed the least deviation from the simple copolymer equation; for some of the systems used the results could be fitted to the equation derived by Merz et al. in which the effect of the penultimate group in the polymer chain is considered. The problems in setting up a model for heterogeneous polymerisation have been discussed...|$|R

40|$|Results of a {{study on}} Wistar rats {{regarding}} a possible carcinogenic effect of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> (VDC) were presented previously {{by one of the}} authors. Due to the unclear character of these results, a second inhalation study was initiated with Sprague-Dawley rats. Groups of 60 animals were exposed to 100 and 75 ppm VDC, along with one control group. A final report on the pathological results must await completion of the microscopic examination of the tissues and organs from all the animals. Nevertheless, it seems clear that there is no grossly observable interrelation between tumor production and VDC inhalation. As in the case of vinyl chloride, the problem of <b>vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> (VDC) is of primary importance in the field of environmental health research. <b>Vinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> produces no clear signs of toxicity apart from a reduced growth rate observed in some animal species by Prendergast et al. (1) and the production of several types of liver damage after 3 months exposure (24 hr/day to 47 ppm). At VDC concentrations of 500 ppm, Cage (2) reported that rats exposed to 6 hr/day for 20 days had nose irritation, retarded growth rate, and histologically proven liver cell degeneration. This lesion disappeared when the concentration was lowered to 200 ppm. At this lower concentration a complete autopsy found all organs normal, while in the living animals only a slight nose irritation was observed. Carpenter et al. (3) reported that the LC 50 of VDC is 32, 000 ppm in Sherman rats repeatedly exposed for 4 hr/day. No effects were seen by Norris in rats exposed from 10 to 40 ppm VDC vapors for 30 days (4). The only significant finding in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed for 30 or 90 days to 25 or 75 ppm was a minimal vacuolation of cytoplasm in hepatocytes. This lesion reversed when the animals were removed from VDC exposure. Subsequent interim kills at 6 and 12 months confirmed the occurrence of minimal liver injury...|$|R
