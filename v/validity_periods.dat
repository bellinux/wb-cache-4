The present study integrated the face value and <b>validity</b> <b>period</b> of coupons into {{a model that}} determines customer satisfaction and repurchase intention in online tourism and hospitality service recovery. A randomly assigned scenario-based experiment was conducted with 196 respondents. Six scenarios involving a coupon remedy were developed, simulating two factorial dimensions: coupon <b>validity</b> <b>period</b> (half year vs. one year) and coupon face value (RMB 450 / 135 / 5). Empirical findings revealed that face value and <b>validity</b> <b>period</b> are significantly correlated with satisfaction after recovery. However, no significant correlation exists between face value and <b>validity</b> <b>period,</b> and repurchase intention. This study can help online vendors understand customers' perceptions of coupons when an online service failure occurs.

50|$|There are no {{restrictions}} on missionary activities. Historically, unrecognized religious groups had problems obtaining resident permits for foreign religious workers. Unlike visas for religious workers of recognized religions, religious {{workers who are}} members of unrecognized religions are subject to a numerical cap for what is technically a nonpreference immigrant visa category. Administrative procedures adopted in 1997 for certain unrecognized groups, which exempt these workers from having to obtain governmental permission to work, helped to address this problem in part. These procedures allowed for application under an immigrant visa category that is neither employment nor family-based. New visa laws that became effective in January 2006 brought certain changes in the implementation for a number of visa categories. New poverty guidelines and shortened visa <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> {{make it more difficult for}} some members of this group to obtain resident permits.|$|E
50|$|Since June 1995, {{the central}} weather office of Fiji, Nadi, {{has been one}} of six Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers within the World Weather Watch program of the World Meteorological Organization. Its {{specialty}} is forecasting tropical cyclones south of the equator to the 25th parallel south, and between the 160th meridian east and 120th meridian west longitude. FMS issues public and marine weather bulletins for Kiribati, Northern Cooks, Southern Cooks, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Niue, Nauru and Fiji. The Fiji Meteorological Services, as per agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization, functions as the Meteorological Watch Office for the Nadi Flight Information Region (FIR), whichextends from Western Kiribati to Tuvalu, Fiji, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia.However, it still provides certain aviation forecast services to Cook Islands, Christmas Island (Line Islands), Samoa, Niue and Tonga which are situated outside the Nadi FIR boundary. Aviation products issued by FMS include Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF), Trend Type Forecasts (TTF), Area Forecasts, Route Forecasts, Inclement Weather Warnings for Nadi and Nausori Airports, Sigmets and Tropical Cyclone Advisories (TCA). Routine 24 hour TAF's are issued for Nadi (NFFN), Nausori (NFNA), Rarotonga (NCRG), Fuamotu (NFTF), Vavau (NFTV), Faleolo (NFSA), Niue, Tarawa (NGTA), and Christmas Island (PLCH) airports. 24 hour TAF's are also issued for Funafuti (NGFU) airport on certain days. TAF's (<b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> of less than 24 hours) are also issued for Aitutaki (NCAI), Manihiki (NCMH), Penrhyn (NCPY), Haapai (NFTL), Labasa (NFNL) and Rotuma (NFNR) airports.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of web service {{procurement}} (WSP), temporal–awareness refers to managing service demands and offers which are subject to <b>validity</b> <b>periods,</b> i. e. their evaluation depends not only on quality of service (QoS) values but also on time. For example, the QoS of some web services can be considered critical in working hours (9 : 00 to 17 : 00 from Monday to Friday) and irrelevant at any other moment. Until now, the expressiveness of such temporal–aware specifications has been quite limited. As far as we know, most proposals have considered <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> to be composed of a single temporal interval. Other proposals, which could allow more expressive time–dependent specifications, have not performed a detailed study about all the underlying complexities of such approach, {{in spite of the}} fact that dealing with complex expressions on temporality is not a trivial task at all. As a matter of fact, it requires a special design of the so–called procurement tasks (consistency and conformance checking, and optimal selection). In this paper, we present a constraint–based approach to temporal–aware WSP. Using constraints allows a great deal of expressiveness, so that not only demands and offers can be assigned <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> but also their conditions can be assigned (possibly multiple) validity temporal subintervals. Apart from revising the semantics of procurement tasks, which we previously presented in the first edition of the ICSOC conferences, we also introduce the notion of the covering set of a demand, a topic which is closely related to temporality.

40|$|The validness of the {{expiration}} dates (validity period) that manufacturers provide on food product labels {{is a crucial}} food safety problem. Governments must study how to use their authority by implementing fair awards and punishments to prompt manufacturers into adopting rigorous considerations, such as the effect of adopting new storage methods for extending product <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> on expected costs. Assuming that a manufacturer sells fresh food or drugs, this manufacturer must respond to current stochastic demands at each unit of time to determine the purchase amount of products for sale. If this decision maker is capable and an opportunity arises, new packaging methods (e. g., aluminum foil packaging, vacuum packaging, high-temperature sterilization after glass packaging, or packaging with various degrees of dryness) or storage methods (i. e., adding desiccants or various antioxidants) can be chosen to extend the <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> of products. To minimize expected costs, this decision maker {{must be aware of}} the processing costs of new storage methods, inventory standards, inventory cycle lengths, and changes in relationships between factors such as stochastic demand functions in a cycle.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} for the conventional X. 509 Public Key Infrastructures (PKI). Our goal {{is to reduce the}} effort to handle sig-natures in the long term. The novelty is that a Root CA reissues subordinate certificates of final users, but adjusting <b>validity</b> <b>periods</b> to exclude the periods after a revocation. The Root CA also authenticates timestamps. The result is the cleaned PKI, which is simpler than the conventional PKI because: a) there is no revocation; b) there is no intermediary Certification Authority; c) signatures are trustworthy as long as the used cryptographic algorithms remain secure. As benefits, we reduce the need of timestamps and consequently the demand for storage space and processing time to use signed documents. 1...|$|E
