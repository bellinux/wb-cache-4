40|$|Environmental {{influences}} on organisms were studied on most common mollusks in the mangrove swamp and lower intertidal zone of Atlantic Ocean, Nigeria. Samples were collected between January and December, 2016. Five samples each of common whelk and Littorina littorea of relatively equal {{size and weight}} were collected at night from different stations and transported to the laboratory in a well <b>ventilated</b> <b>container.</b> Heavy metals in the tissues were digested with 5 mL of HNO 3 and 3 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 5 : 1 ratio and analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Marine environment had higher metals residue than the brackish water in both organisms and both seasons. The order of accumulation of metals in the soft tissues of L. littorea and B. undatum from both sampling environments were; Fe > Zn >Mn >Pb > Cd. The concentrations of heavy metals in the soft tissues of L. littorea and B. undatum revealed that, the geochemical composition had great effects on metal accumulation, with Fe, the most dominant elements in the Earth’s Crust, having the highest concentrations. Cadmium the least metal reported in this study has no known biological functions. The adverse human health effects associated with exposure to heavy metals, even at low concentrations are diverse, hence the needs for thorough investigation of the water qualities in this region to ascertain the degree of the toxicity of heavy metals pollution and {{the response of the}} environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{identity}} of the host plants and the feeding site of adults and juveniles are important aspects of herbivore biology, but many published “host records ” of thrips species are {{based solely on the}} presence of winged adults with no evidence of any biological dependence by the thrips on the named plants. Teulon and Penman (1990) produced the most comprehensive list of host plants of any thrips species worldwide, recording larvae of the native New Zealand species, Thrips obscuratus, from more than 50 plant species. The available information on host associations of the other indigenous and exotic thrips in New Zealand was summarised by Mound and Walker (1982, 1986). This note reports new host information for eight species, including the first hosts recorded for two native species. Adult and larval thrips were collected while searching native plants for herbivores. Typical signs of thrips feeding are leaf ‘silvering ’ or leaves with chlorotic speckling. Black faecal spots {{may or may not be}} present. Larvae were reared to adults because few larval thrips can be identified to species and successful development to adult confirmed that a plant was a ‘true ’ host and not a chance association. Larvae were reared in either sealed plastic bags or a <b>ventilated</b> <b>container</b> with part of the original host plant and tissue paper, which absorbed excess moisture and provided a suitable site for pupation. Adult thrips collected from plants and reared from larvae were mounted on microscope slides, identified using Mound and Walker (1982) and deposited in the New Zealan...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The European earwig (Forficula auricularia) is {{potentially}} a predator {{of a number}} of insect pests in apple orchards. However, its effectiveness as a natural enemy in apple orchards may be compromised by insecticide sprays. A laboratory bioassay of eight insecticides currently used in Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) apple orchards and one as-yet unregistered product was undertaken to determine their effects on earwigs. Adult earwigs were placed in <b>ventilated</b> <b>containers</b> where they were exposed to insecticide residues on apple leaves and monitored on four occasions over 10 days. Indoxacarb, thiacloprid, spinosad and diazinon caused the greatest mortality to earwigs while carbaryl appeared to be less harmful. Chlorantraniliprole, spirotetramat, emamectin benzoate and methoxyfenozide caused no increased mortality of earwigs compared with the control. Identification and avoidance of harmful insecticides may help to enhance the potential of earwigs as natural enemies in apple orchards...|$|R
40|$|Two storage {{methods for}} chipped willows (Salix spp.), cold air {{ventilation}} and sealed storage, were tested at laboratory scale. Fresh chips were stored in six insulated containers for 62 {{days in a}} store-room. Temperature development during storage was continuously monitored. Dry matter losses and fungal spore counts, in {{the central part of}} the containers, were determined. Two 1. 7 m 3 <b>containers</b> were continuously <b>ventilated</b> with ambient air (mean temperature 2. 7 ° C) at a rate of 175 m 3 ∙h^- 1 ∙t^- 1 dry matter. As a control, a third unventilated identical container was used. To test sealed storage, a similar experiment was conducted using two containers of 0. 63 m 3. A third, unsealed, container served as a control. These three containers were placed in a room where the average temperature during storage was 14. 7 ° C. In {{the central part of the}} <b>ventilated</b> <b>containers,</b> the average temperature of the chips was close to ambient temperature (average 4 ° C) during most of the storage period while the temperature in the unventilated container averaged at 32. 4 ° C and a maximum of 42 ° C. The dry matter losses were 5. 2 % and 13. 3 % by weight in the ventilated and the control containers respectively. The total number of micro fungal spores increased by 3 - 5 times in the chips stored in the <b>ventilated</b> <b>containers</b> but, in the control, it increased more than 100 times. The temperature in the central part of the sealed containers was close to ambient (14 ° C), while the maximum temperature of the control was 59. 3 ° C with an average of 28. 8 ° C. Different dry matter losses were measured in the two sealed containers, 2. 7 % and 6. 0 %. However, higher loss of dry matter (8. 2 %) was determined in the control. The fungal growth in the test containers was less intensive than that in the control. The total number of spores was increased by 3 - 4 folds in the sealed material compared to 60 times in the control...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 2007 and 2008 to evaluate heat treatment for disinfestations of empty concrete elevator silos. A Mobile Heat Treatment Unit was used to introduce heat into silos to attain target conditions of 50 °C for at least 6 h. <b>Ventilated</b> plastic <b>containers</b> with a capacity of 100 g of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., held Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Polyvinyl chloride containers with a capacity of 300 g of wheat held adults of Liposcelis corrodens (Heymons) (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae) and Liposcelis decolor (Pearman), which were contained in 35 -mm Petri dishes within the grain. Containers were fastened to a rope suspended {{from the top of}} the silo at depths of 0 m (just under the top manhole), 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m (silo floor). When the highest temperature achieved was ≍ 50 °C for 6 h, parental mortality of R. dominica and T. castaneum, and both psocid species was 98 - 100 %. Progeny production of R. dominica occurred when there was parental survival, but in general R. dominica seemed less impacted by the heat treatment than T. castaneum. There was 100 % mortality of L. corrodens at all depths in the heat treatments but only 92. 5 % mortality for L. decolor, with most survivors located in the bioassay containers at the top of the silo. Results show wheat kernels may have an insulating effect and heat treatment might be more effective when used in conjunction with sanitation and cleaning procedures...|$|R
40|$|Green {{bell peppers}} (Capsicum annuum cv. Cardio) were stored in open crates at 5 degreesC, using a novel system for {{maintenance}} of relative humidity (RH). A hollow fiber membrane contactor allowed adequate transfer of water vapor between {{the air in}} the storage room and a liquid desiccant. The membrane was made of polyetherimide (PEI), coated on the inside with a thin non-porous silicone layer. The desiccant was a dilute aqueous glycerol solution, which was pumped through the hollow fibers at a low flow rate. Produce was placed in <b>ventilated</b> 5001 <b>containers</b> with a closed lid. During the 3 weeks of the experiment, RH could be maintained within a narrow range each day (e. g. 90. 5 +/- 0. 1 %). RH could be changed by adjusting the glycerol concentration and/or the temperature of the desiccant. The control was a 5501 container connected to the hollow fiber membrane set up which had no glycerol solution (average RH 93 %). The contactor thus removed water vapor in this set up. The quality of the bell peppers (visible peel shrivelling and fungus development), after 3 weeks of storage, was highly dependent on RH. Compared with the control container and with packaging in conventional cardboard boxes for bell peppers (average RH 86 %), the contactor system reduced fungus development without increasing shrivelling. The improvement compared with cardboard boxes was presumably due to reduction of local differences in RH. Such differences were avoided in the containers where the packaging was very open (open crates, with space in between them, and only two layers of fruit) and where the airflow was rather high. In preliminary experiments with red currants and pears the contactor system also functioned well (a) at subzero temperatures, (b) when it was combined with controlled atmosphere (7. 5 % oxygen and 20 % carbon dioxide), or (c) when it released water vapor. It is concluded that the system is promising for the large-scale storage of several fresh commodities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{of quality}} {{maintenance}} are {{encountered in the}} marine transport from tropical and sub-tropical to temperate climatic zones, of hygroscopic durable foods such as cocoa beans and similar commodities, particularly in winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Cargoes frequently display damaging mould formation and insect infestation on unloading. This publication indicates {{the likelihood of the}} incidence of these problems for different modes of transport by ship (bulk, bag and box container). Interpretations are based upon the principles of heat and moisture transfer and experimental observations of several shipments. The mould problem is usually interpreted as arising from the migration of moisture from the interior of the cargo to its sides. It occurs when a temperature difference develops between the cargo interior and the frame of the ship's hold. With bulk commodities, the moisture problem can occur at the sides of the cargo if this is in direct contact with the sides of the ship. With bagged commodities, similar difficulties can arise, but they are less pronounced because of the beneficial effect of air circulation around the bags, particularly if dunnage is present. For box-container transport, the major risk of quality deterioration occurs in winter following offloading on the dockside. Dew can rapidly form {{on the underside of the}} container roof, and 'internal raining' with subsequent wetting and mould formation can occur with the associated risk of mycotoxin production. Closed box containers present the greatest hazard. Naturally <b>ventilated</b> and open-sided <b>containers</b> together with suitable modifications to handling practices are considered to be more suitable for the avoidance of this problem. General recommendations for good practice are also included in the text...|$|R
40|$|Export onion bulbs are {{predominantly}} transported from New Zealand loose in sacks which are bulk loaded into intermodal transport containers. Product respiratory heat, water vapour, and volatiles are dispensed of by a fan unit {{installed in the}} end of the <b>container,</b> <b>ventilating</b> the stow by forcing ambient air from a false floor up through the crop and exhausting the air from a head space. The objective {{of this study was to}} mathematically model this system with respect to onion bulb temperature and weight loss, and internal container air temperature and relative humidity. These product and flowfield variables were predicted at different locations within the transport vessel. Bulb temperature and weight loss were simulated as dynamic variables using ordinary differential equations, and air temperature and relative humidity were simulated as quasi steady state variables using algebraic equations. A validation experiment was conducted to evaluate the simulation model by placing temperature and humidity sensors throughout the product and flowfield space measuring the respective properties. Onion and air temperatures were predicted with satisfactory accuracy in almost all measured locations of the container. Prediction of relative humidity varied considerably throughout the container, although excessive sensor errors were identified casting suspicion on some validation measurements. Simulated relative humidity could not therefore be fully verified. Bulb weight loss was predicted with variable levels of accuracy. Significant variability in the validation data was evident in the upper and lower regions of the container preventing complete model validation. Central regions of the container were simulated with satisfactory accuracy. A model sensitivity analysis revealed that container ventilation rate strongly influenced model performance with respect to temperature and relative humidity. The mass transfer coefficient, as expected, was most influential over product weight loss...|$|R
