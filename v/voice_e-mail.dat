40|$|Supervisor: Susan MoiseyAdults with {{developmental}} disabilities are often excluded from participating {{in a variety of}} online activities, including e-learning, which are part of everyday life in our digital, knowledge-based society. Numerous barriers are associated with their non-participation, including a lack of basic computer and Internet skills. In recognition of these limitations, a multiple-case study was conducted; 11 adults {{with developmental}} disabilities were provided with access to individualized training and appropriate regular and assistive technologies so they could go online, using e-mail to increase social networks and accessing web-based informational resources. The study contributes to the scarce literature on online inclusion by offering protocols for setting up and conducting e-mail and Internet training. The outcomes show that the subjects gained basic information and communication technology skills while engaging in recreational online activities, and that appropriate assistive technologies (<b>voice</b> <b>e-mail</b> and text-to-speech software) compensated for low literacy skills. This study makes recommendations for future research and advocates for the further inclusion of adults {{with developmental disabilities}} into the ”global community” where ICT can be a life-enhancing and even a life-altering tool...|$|E

Through field work and participatory co-design with homeless shelter residents and care providers we have explored design at the common boundary of these two “publics. ” We describe the design of the Community Resource Messenger (CRM), an ICT that supports both those in need and those attempting to provide care in a challenging environment. The CRM consists of three components: 1) a message center that pools messages to and from mobile users into a shared, persistent forum; 2) a text and voice messaging gateway linking the mobile phones of the homeless with the web-enabled computer facilities of the care providers; 3) a shared message display accessible from mobile texting, <b>voice,</b> <b>e-mail,</b> and the web, helping the two groups communicate and coordinate for mutual good.

40|$|With the {{convergence}} of Internet and telephony, new applications (e. g., WhatsApp) have emerged as an important means of communication for billions of users. These applications are becoming an attractive medium for attackers to deliver spam and carry out more targeted attacks. Since such applications rely on phone numbers, we explore the feasibility, automation, and scalability of phishing attacks that {{can be carried out}} by abusing a phone number. We demonstrate a novel system that takes a potential victim's phone number as an input, leverages information from applications like Truecaller and Facebook about the victim and his / her social network, checks the presence of phone number's owner (victim) on the attack channels (over-the-top or OTT messaging applications, <b>voice,</b> <b>e-mail,</b> or SMS), and finally targets the victim on the chosen channel. As a proof of concept, we enumerate through a random pool of 1. 16 million phone numbers. By using information provided by popular applications, we show that social and spear phishing attacks can be launched against 51, 409 and 180, 000 users respectively. Furthermore, voice phishing or vishing attacks can be launched against 722, 696 users. We also found 91, 487 highly attractive targets who can be attacked by crafting whaling attacks. We show the effectiveness of one of these attacks, phishing, by conducting an online roleplay user study. We found that social (69. 2 %) and spear (54. 3 %) phishing attacks are more successful than non-targeted phishing attacks (35. 5 %) on OTT messaging applications. Although similar results were found for other mediums like e-mail, we demonstrate that due to the significantly increased user engagement via new communication applications and the ease with which phone numbers allow collection of information necessary for these attacks, there is a clear need for better protection of OTT messaging applications.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the 			study was Developing a Model for Student Support Services at Allama 			Iqbal Open University 			The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to evaluate the existing facilities 			available in student support services at AIOU, review various models 			used in developing and developed countries and to develop student 			support services model for AIOU. 			The population of the study was the students, tutors, RDs, DRDs, 			ARDs, academicians, and policy makers of AIOU, UKOU and OUSL. The 			sample comprised of 200 students of AIOU, 200 of UKOU and 200 OUSL 			semester Spring 2003 of B. Ed programme. 50 tutors of AIOU, UKOU and 			OUSL, 20 RDs, DRDs, ARDs of AIOU, 20 OUSL and 20 RDs of UKOU, 10 			policy makes of AIOU, UKOU and 10 OUSL, 50 academicians of AIOU, 			UKOU and OUSL. 			To achieve the objectives of the study, five questionnaires were 			constructed for students, tutors, RDs/DRDs/ARDs, policy makers and 			academicians of AIOU and UKOU, consisting of four parts: (i) general 			services (ii) tutorial services (iii) counselling services and (iv) 			library services. All questions were designed at five point rating 			scale; however, one last question was open ended. 			The score on each item was analyzed by applying chi square, 			percentage and mean score formula to determine the objectives of the 			study. 			The major findings were, (i) Regional campuses of UKOU worked 			independently as mini university while AIOU regional centre/ campus 			worked under the main campus, (ii) UKOU students enjoyed the 			facility of Open University Student Association while AIOU did not 			form such an association, (iii) UKOU Regional Campuses provided 			number of better quality student support services than AIOU. 			On the basis of data analysis, it was found that in general AIOU, 			UKOU and OUSL cumulatively, resembled in their student support and 			they had attained great popularity by dint of their broadcast TV and 			radio programmes. Also, most of the students were highly satisfied 			with the media support services. However, AIOU exceeded in half of 			the categories of facilities in establishment and administration as 			regards enrollment in comparison to UKOU and OUSL. There was no 			significant difference in the performance of tutors, quality of face 			to face meetings, standard of resource centers and techniques of 			media support, but AIOU could not show high standards of counseling 			as compared to UKOU. Three universities could not achieve some of 			their claimed targets and needed improvement in order to maintain 			the  quality of their education through effective training of 			their personnel and evaluating the provisions presently made. 			The findings of the study have led the researcher to recommend that 			(i) regional campuses should be made independent like UKOU (ii) 			counselling and guidance cell should be established in every 			regional campus (iii) modern communication faculties like toll free 			phones or auto answer should be provided at AIOU regional campus 			(iv) Allama Iqbal Open University Student Association should be 			founded on the lines of Open University Student Association of UKOU. 			After analyzing and interpretation of data and document, the main 			conclusions were; UKOU, OUSL and AIOU provide a number of student 			support services through their regional campuses but UKOU regional 			campuses work independently like mini university. However, OUSL and 			AIOU regional campuses work under the main campus. 			For the contact facilities, OUSL and AIOU students rely only upon 			mail and telephone, while UKOU students enjoy a number of different 			facilities, for example, toll free phones and <b>voice</b> <b>e-mail</b> etc. 			The major recommendations of the study are that the AIOU regional 			centres should appoint tutors on merit and should intimate tutors in 			time. There may be arrangements for comprehensive training of tutors 			for the betterment of tutorial support system. It was also 			recommended that AIOU may be affiliated with all the public and 			institutional libraries in big districts for the facilitation of the 			students. The tutors may be trained effectively for solving the 			problems clientele as counselors more considerately and 			sympathetically. Assignments may be given specific and encouraging 			remarks to ensure the improvement on part of the students. Computer 			assisted learning programmes may be introduced on higher level 			courses and media support may be made interactive for getting 			opinions from students...|$|E
