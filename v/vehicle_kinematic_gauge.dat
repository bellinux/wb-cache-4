40|$|The {{presence}} of highly non-linear friction damping in the suspensions of many freight vehicles reduces prediction accuracy when using traditional <b>kinematic</b> <b>gauging</b> techniques. These techniques, {{which are often}} applied to the more linear behaving passenger vehicles, {{are based on the}} quasi-static suspension behaviour. Due to this limitation and a market requirement for cost effective and rapid vehicle gauging, the current approach in the UK for freight vehicles is to use static vehicle gauges. This method can be very conservative and lead to in-efficient use of the available space between vehicle and infrastructure. Computer simulation-based dynamic gauging techniques offer a way to maximize the use of the space available, by introducing into the gauging analysis, the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. This paper describes the process of dynamic gauging for friction damped freight vehicles. The benefits of this method in terms of potential increase of the vehicle size are shown, but also difficulties within the process, especially concerning the adequate validation of the simulation models...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Intersections are {{the most}} {{accident-prone}} spots in the road network. In order to assist the driver in complex urban intersection situations, an ADAS will be required not only to recognize current but also to anticipate future maneuvers of the involved road users. Current approaches for intention estimation focus mainly on discerning only two intentions based on a vehicle’s behavior. We argue that for distinguishing between more than two intentions not just a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>kinematic</b> behavior but also its driving situation {{needs to be taken}} into account. In our system we estimate four different intentions by modeling and recognizing driving situations in a Bayesian Network and using the behavior as additional evidence. For the behavior based estimation we present a newly engineered feature, the Anticipated Velocity at Stop line, {{that turned out to be}} a very strong indicator for the intention.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel Vision-based Nonlin-ear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for an under-actuated underwater robotic vehicle. In this scheme, the control loop does not close periodically, but instead a self-triggering framework decides when {{to provide the}} next control update. Be-tween two consecutive triggering instants, the control sequence computed by the NMPC {{is applied to the}} system in an open-loop fashion, i. e, no state measurements are required during that period. This results to a significant smaller number of requested measurements from the vision system, as well as less frequent computations of the control law, reducing in that way the processing time and the energy consumption. The image constraints (i. e preserving the target inside the camera’s field of view), the external disturbances induced by currents and waves, as well as the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>kinematic</b> constraints due to under-actuation, are being considered during the control design.

40|$|Chapter 6 ISBN: 1 - 59454 - 594 - 4 The {{development}} of automatic guidance systems for agricultural vehicles is receiving a large attention from both researchers and manufacturers. The motivations in such automated devices are, on one hand, to reduce considerably the arduous driving task, {{and on the}} other hand, to improve the efficiency {{and the quality of the}} agronomic work carried out. Such guidance devices require realtime vehicle localization on an unstructured area, such as agricultural fields. Nowadays, RTK GPS sensor appears as a very suitable sensor for these applications, since it can supply this information with a satisfactory centimeter accuracy at a high 10 Hz frequency, without requiring any preliminary equipment of the field. In this chapter, it is demonstrated that very accurate curved path following can actually be achieved by agricultural vehicles, even on slippery ground, relying on a single RTK GPS sensor. In a first step, in order to benefit from recent advances in Control Theory, sliding effects have been omitted, and therefore guidance laws have first been designed relying on a <b>vehicle</b> <b>kinematic</b> model. More precisely, taking advantage from structural properties of these models (they can be converted into a so-called chained form), curved path following has been achieved by designing a non-linear control law. Full-scale experiments reveal a very satisfactory guidance accuracy, except when the vehicle enters into sharp curves or when it moves on sloping fields. In these two latter situations, guidance accuracy is damaged since the vehicle undergoes sliding effects. In agricultural applications, vehicle dynamic models appear untractable from the control design point of view. Therefore, it is here proposed to describe sliding effects as a structured perturbation acting on <b>vehicle</b> <b>kinematic</b> model. Adaptive Control framework, and more precisely Internal Model techniques, can then be used jointly with the above mentioned non-linear control law to reject sliding effects, when still preserving all the advantages of the previously designed non-linear guidance law. Experiments demonstrate satisfactory guidance accuracy when the vehicle moves along a slope or when it executes sharp curves, excepted at their beginning or end. These transient guidance errors mainly ensue from delays introduced by the actuation device. Since the shape of the path to be followed is known, beginning/end of curves or slopes can be anticipated. Model Predictive Control framework is here used to provide such an anticipation. Satisfactory experimental results display the performances of the overall control scheme...|$|R

The motion planning {{is based on a}} vision vector space (V 2 -Space), which is an unitary vector set that represents local collision-free directions in the image coordinate system. V 2 -Space is constructed by extracting the vectors based on the similarity of adjacent pixels, which captures both the color information and the directional information from prior vehicle tire tracks and pedestrian footsteps. We report how V 2 -Space is constructed to reduce the impact of varying lighting conditions in outdoor environments.

40|$|Abstract: We are {{developing}} a novel framework, PRIDE (PRediction In Dynamic Environments), to perform moving object prediction (MOP) for autonomous ground vehicles. The underlying concept is based upon a multi-resolutional, hierarchical approach which incorporates multiple prediction algorithms into a single, unifying framework. The lower levels of the framework utilize estimation-theoretic short-term predictions while the upper levels utilize a probabilistic prediction approach based on situation recognition with an underlying cost model. The estimation-theoretic short-term prediction is via an extended Kalman filterbased algorithm using sensor data {{to predict the future}} location of moving objects with an associated confidence measure. The proposed estimation-theoretic approach does not incorporate a priori knowledge such as road networks and traffic signage and assumes uninfluenced constant trajectory and is thus suited for short-term prediction in both on-road and off-road driving. In this article, we analyze the complementary role played by <b>vehicle</b> <b>kinematic</b> models in such short-term prediction of moving objects. In particular, the importance of vehicle process models and their effect on predicting the positions and orientations of moving objects for autonomous ground vehicle navigation are examined.
