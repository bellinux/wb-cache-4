The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major role}} in <b>visual</b> <b>control</b> of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex.

A {{search and rescue}} crew took off from the 37th AARS based at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. It consisted of two HH-53 rescue helicopters, Jolly Green 65 and 67, and two A-1 Skyraiders, Sandy 07 and 08. Sandy 05 and 06 joined them on the scene. The area was covered in a solid overcast, preventing <b>visual</b> <b>control</b> of air strikes by the on-scene OV-10A FAC, Nail 25. Capt. Rocky Smith and Capt. Rick Atchison coordinated the work of several F-4s who were directed to drop CBU-42 anti-personnel cluster bombs around Hambleton to help protect his position. When Nail 25 ran low on fuel, it was replaced by an OV-10 (Nail 38) from the 23rd TASS flown by Capt. William J. Henderson (Nail 38 Alpha) and 1st Lt. Mark Clark (Nail 38 Bravo, and grandson of World War II General Mark Clark).|$|E

25|$|According to the report, an {{instrument}} {{in the cockpit}} displayed false information, causing the aircraft to deviate from the prescribed flight path specified by the instrument landing system, flying above its glide path. As the aircraft broke free of the cloud cover and switched from instrument controlled flight to <b>visual</b> <b>control,</b> the captain presumably estimated the altitude incorrectly due to darkness and poor visibility, causing the aircraft to come in too far, which made the final approach too late. The captain decided to abort because the little remaining runway {{would not have been}} sufficient to allow for braking the aircraft. At this point, he maneuvered the Convair into an extreme flight attitude, leading to a stall and the aircraft striking the ground with its left wing first. The aircraft burned completely except for the tail section and the right wing. When the rescue team arrived they could only sort through the wreckage.|$|E
40|$|Visual Management (VM) is a {{fundamental}} element of the lean production system that relies {{on the effectiveness of}} sensory communication to realise the lean production/construction goals. VM can be implemented by following certain frameworks in an incremental fashion. <b>Visual</b> <b>controls</b> are one of the main tools of VM that are used to limit and guide process outcomes. They are generally adopted in production management, process, safety, quality, and maintenance management efforts. VM and <b>visual</b> <b>controls</b> have extensively been an important part of lean construction initiatives for a while. Their implementation is also envisioned to be relevant to highway construction and maintenance projects. A set of critical points, general recommendations and possible areas of implementation for VM and <b>visual</b> <b>controls</b> identified from both research and practical experience are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|Performance in a non-symbolic {{comparison}} task {{in which}} participants are asked to indicate the larger numerosity of two dot arrays, {{is assumed to be}} supported by the Approximate Number System (ANS). This system allows participants to judge numerosity independently from other visual cues. Supporting this idea, previous studies indicated that numerosity can be processed when <b>visual</b> cues are <b>controlled</b> for. Consequently, distinct types of <b>visual</b> cue <b>control</b> are assumed to be interchangeable. However, a previous study contrasting different types of <b>visual</b> cue <b>control</b> showed that the type of <b>visual</b> cue <b>control</b> affected performance using a simultaneous presentation of the stimuli in numerosity comparison. In the current study, we explored whether the influence of the type of <b>visual</b> cue <b>control</b> on performance disappeared when sequentially presenting each stimulus in numerosity comparison. While the influence of the applied type of <b>visual</b> cue <b>control</b> was significantly more evident in the simultaneous condition, sequentially presenting the stimuli did not completely exclude the influence of distinct types of <b>visual</b> cue <b>control.</b> Altogether, these results indicate that the implicit assumption {{that it is possible to}} compare performances across studies with a differential <b>visual</b> cue <b>control</b> is unwarranted and that the influence of the type of <b>visual</b> cue <b>control</b> partly depends on the presentation format of the stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Current {{research}} in the number development field has focused in individual differences regarding the acuity of children’s Approximate Number System. The most common task to evaluate children’s acuity is through non-symbolic numerical comparison. Efforts {{have been made to}} prevent children from using perceptual cues by <b>controlling</b> the <b>visual</b> properties of the stimuli (e. g. density, contour length and area); nevertheless, researchers have used these <b>visual</b> <b>controls</b> interchangeably. Studies have also tried to understand the relation between children’s cardinality knowledge and their performance in a number comparison task; divergent results may in fact be rooted in the use of different <b>visual</b> <b>controls.</b> The main goal of the present study is to explore how the usage of different <b>visual</b> <b>controls</b> (Density, Total filled area, and Correlated and anti-correlated area) affects children’s performance in a number comparison task, and its relationship to children’s cardinality knowledge. For that purpose, 77 preschoolers participated in three tasks: 1) Counting List Elicitation to test whether children could recite the counting list up to ten, 2) Give a Number to evaluate children’s cardinality knowledge, and 3) Number Comparison to evaluate their ability to compare two quantities. During this last task, children were asked to point at the set with more geometric figures when two sets were displayed on a screen. Children were exposed only to one of the three <b>visual</b> <b>controls.</b> Results showed that overall, children performed above chance in the Number Comparison task; nonetheless, Density was the easiest control, while Correlated and anti-correlated area was the most difficult in most cases. Only Total filled area was sensitive to discriminate Cardinal Principal knowers from Non-Cardinal Principal knowers. How this finding helps to explain conflicting evidence from previous research, and how the present outcome relates to children’s number word knowledge is discussed...|$|R

In addition, that research has focused primarily on static targets.

Another simple example of a common <b>visual</b> <b>control</b> is to have reminders posted on cubicle walls so that they remain in plain sight. Visual signs and signals communicate information that is needed to make effective decisions. These decisions may be safety oriented or they may give reminders as to what steps should be taken to resolve a problem. Most companies use visual controls in one degree or another, many of them not even realizing that the visual controls that they are making have a name and a function in the workplace. Whether it is recognized by the name of [...] "visual control" [...] or not, the fact is that replacing text or number with graphics makes a set of information easier to understand with only a glance, making it a more efficient way of communicating a message.|$|E
