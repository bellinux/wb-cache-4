50|$|The use of vacuum for {{switching}} electric currents {{was motivated by}} the observation that a 1 cm gap in an X-ray tube could withstand {{tens of thousands of}} volts. Some <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices were patented in the 19th century but were never commercially available. In 1926, at California Institute of Technology a group lead by Professor Royal Sorensen investigated <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> and tested several devices. Sorenson presented the results at an AIEE meeting that year, and predicted the commercial use of vacuum switches. Many fundamental aspects of arc interruption in vacuum were investigated. In 1927, the General Electric corporation purchased patent rights and began commercial development. However, the Depression and development of oil-filled switchgear caused General Electric to reduce development work. Little commercially important work was done for vacuum power switichgear until the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) {{controls}} the position {{of one or more}} air control valves based on input signals from throttle angle and engine RPM. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> valve (VSV) which controls the vacuum supply to the actuator is normally closed and passes vacuum to the actuator when it is energized by the ECU. By energizing the VSV vacuum is passed to the actuator, closing the air control valve. This effectively lengthens the intake manifold run. By de-energizing the VSV, vacuum to the actuator is blocked and trapped vacuum is bled off of the actuator diaphragm. Toyota ACIS is an On/Off system. The valve (or valves in newer models with multiple valves to create more than 2 lengths) is either fully opened or fully closed.An example of early single-valve ACIS programming would be the 3.0L 3VZ-FE engine. The ECU actuates the VSV to close the valve when the throttle position is 60% or greater and engine speed is 3,900 RPM or more.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental studies of voltage phenomena in the switching operations of <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices made by various manufacturers in several different configurations of 6 kV, 10 kV, 20 kV and 35 kV networks. During switching-on operations of the inductive loads, re-ignition of the electric arc between the contacts of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices appears. Each arc ignition appearance leads to overvoltages with gradients close to those of lightning overvoltages. Switching-off operations of the inductive loads with <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices leads to the cutting of the current before it passed through a natural zero and the appearance of multiple re-ignition of the arc between their contacts. All this leads to significant overvoltages on the equipment insulation. The analysis of surges in the studied networks, and the measures and means to reduce the stress of isolation are proposed...|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{effective}} {{engine control unit}} computers, engine vacuum was used for many functions in an automobile. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>switches</b> were employed to regulate this flow. For instance a dual port <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> located in a port on the intake manifold monitored the coolant temperature in the coolant crossover. It received vacuum (port E on the switch) from the carburetor. The vacuum flowed through the <b>switch</b> to a <b>vacuum</b> solenoid (such as a heat riser, used to restrict exhaust allowing the engine to heat up faster). When the coolant heated to operating temperature the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch</b> closed off the port (port S on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switch)</b> turning off the vacuum to the heat riser. The result is to clear the exhaust restriction. The switch monitored the temperature and when conditions were right it performed its designed function.|$|R

40|$|In the {{international}} IEC standards for medium and HV switching devices no distinction in test requirements is made between switching devices with different arc-quenching media, like SF 6, oil and vacuum. This {{had led to}} the situation that due to the different technology of arc interruption applied, {{various aspects of the}} prescribed test-procedures have a different weight in terms of severity for various types of breakers. Additional test-requirements and interpretations that are specific to <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices have been formulated commonly by the joint major test laboratories. In this contribution, the background and practical application of several procedures, now generally adopted by certifying test-laboratories, regarding the peculiarities of <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> devices are elucidated. Because the <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> device has an excellent capability to interrupt current of high frequency, the main part of this contribution will be related to the consequences for test procedures of this aspect that is not encountered in SF 6 or oil breakers. In particular, the judgment of non-sustained disruptive discharges, multiple re-ignition and virtual current chopping in test-circuits is addressed. Results of a new high-resolution high-frequency current-zero measuring system are presented. This system is able to give insight into the high-frequency arc phenomena in the immediate vicinity of are interruption, and is designed to get more specific information on arc behavior during standard high-power test...|$|E

40|$|The Procyon high {{explosive}} pulsed power (HEPP) system {{was designed to}} drive plasma z-pinch experiments that produce Megajoule soft x-ray pulses when the plasma stagnates on axis. In {{the proceedings of the}} Ninth IEEE Pulsed Power Conference, we published results from system development tests. At this time, we have fielded seven tests in which the focus was on either <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> or load physics. Four of the tests concentrated on the performance of a Plasma Flow Switch (PFS) which employed a 1 /r mass distribution in the PFS barrel. Of the four tests, two had dummy loads and one had an implosion load. In addition, one of the tests broke down near the vacuum dielectric interface, and the result demonstrated what Procyon could deliver to an 18 nH load. We will summarize PFS results and the 18 nH test which is pertinent to upcoming solid/liquid liner experiments. On our other three tests, we eliminated the PFS switching and powered the z-pinch directly with the HEPP system. From the best of these direct drive tests we obtained 1. 5 MJ of radiation in a 250 ns pulse, our best radiation pulse to date. We will also summarize direct drive test results. More details are given in other papers in this conference for both the PFS and direct drive experiments, and an updated analysis of our opening switch performed is also included.

40|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>switching</b> {{technology}} is preferred {{used in the}} medium voltage level due to its high reliability, {{the high number of}} switching operations, its free-maintenance as well as its long term durability. Contrary to gas-insulated switches, the contact surface of a vacuum circuit breaker has a substantial influence on the withstand voltage. Charge carriers, escaped from the contacts due to an electrical field stress, will be accelerated in the contact gap, whereas the absorbed energy could not be reduced significantly, because of the marginal number of collisions. Caused by the impact on the contact surface, additional charge carriers may be generated with a subsequent breakdown. The required withstand voltage of a vacuum circuit breaker is reached by a conditioning of the metallic surfaces inside the vacuum circuit breaker. A mechanical handling alone is not sufficient. All established procedures for conditioning vacuum circuit breakers to reach a required withstand voltage use current limited breakdowns to remove emission centers which are the origin of a breakdown. In this work, a conditioning process for industrial type vacuum circuit breakers is investigated, using high-frequency currents in the kHz-range. Due to high current rises before and high voltage rises after a current interruption during a current zero crossing, a reignition of a vacuum insulation can be enforced. On the one hand the high-frequency conditioning process has been evaluated if the required lightning impulse withstand voltage can be reached reliably, on the other hand it has been investigated, how far the lightning impulse withstand voltage can be increased beyond it. It is investigated, to what extend the voltage and current distribution, measured during a high frequency conditioning process, can be used to specify the reached lightning impulse withstand voltage. The conditioning process is successful only, if every critical emission centre is removed. Therefore the spatial distribution of the arcs is an important information for the evaluation of the conditioning process. Here, a circuit breaker model is used for optical investigations of the conditioning arcs. The surfaces of the contacts are investigated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy...|$|E
