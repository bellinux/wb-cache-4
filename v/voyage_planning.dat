40|$|The {{waterborne}} sector faces nowadays significant challenges due {{to several}} environmental, financial and other concerns. Such challenges may be addressed, among others, by optimising <b>voyage</b> <b>plans,</b> and diagnosing {{as early as}} possible engine failures that may lead to performance degradation. These two issues are addressed by the Decision Support System (DSS) presented herein, which focuses on the operation of merchant ships. For the development of <b>voyage</b> <b>plans,</b> a multicriteria decision problem is developed and handled with the PROMETHE method, while a multivariable control chart is used for the fault diagnosis problem. A MATLAB-based software implementation of the DSS has been developed adopting a modular architecture, while, in order to provide a generic software solution, the required input data are retrieved from dedicated web-services, following specific communication and data exchange protocols...|$|R
2500|$|Passage {{planning}} {{consists of}} four stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring. [...] These stages are specified in International Maritime Organization Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines For <b>Voyage</b> <b>Planning,</b> which are, in turn, reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries. [...] The Guidelines specify fifty elements of passage planning, {{some of which are}} only applicable in certain situations.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Voyage</b> <b>planning</b> {{starts with}} the {{appraisal}} stage.

Scheyfve had spoken to Cabot and pointed out that China {{ought to be a}} {{possession}} of the Empire. Cabot replied {{that he would like to}} have an audience with Charles V regarding his future employment by the Empire. A month later Scheyfve found himself discussing this voyage with a Portuguese messenger.|$|R
2500|$|All graduating cadets earn {{commissions}} as ensigns in the United States Coast Guard, {{as well as}} Bachelor of Science degrees. For {{that reason}} the academy maintains a core curriculum of science and professional development courses in addition to major-specific courses. Each cadet takes two semesters of classes {{during the school year}} and then spends the majority of the summer in military training to produce officers of character with the requisite professional skills. Among these are courses in leadership, ethics, organizational behavior, and nautical science. The majority of cadets report to their first units after graduating, which are either afloat units, shore units, or basic flight training as student naval aviators, with the training conducted {{under the auspices of the}} U.S. Navy. [...] Those that are assigned afloat serve as either deck watch officers or student engineers. [...] Professional maritime studies courses help prepare cadets in piloting, <b>voyage</b> <b>planning,</b> deck seamanship, and all aspects of shiphandling, as well as Coast Guard leadership and administrative duties.|$|E

50|$|The {{appraisal}} stage {{deals with}} the collection of information relevant to the proposed voyage as well as ascertaining risks and assessing the key features of the voyage. This will involve considering the type of navigation required e.g. Ice navigation, the region the ship will be passing through and the hydrographic information on the route. In the next stage, the written plan is created. The third stage is {{the execution of the}} finalised <b>voyage</b> <b>plan,</b> taking into account any special circumstances which may arise such as changes in the weather, which may require the plan to be reviewed or altered. The final stage of passage planning consists of monitoring the vessel's progress in relation to the plan and responding to deviations and unforeseen circumstances.|$|R

50|$|The main {{challenge}} of the Open Division was <b>voyage</b> <b>planning</b> and getting the Plymouth departure date right. Whilst all of the 25 November finishers scored the maximum of 100 points, Max Shean {{proved to be the}} best planner. Bluebell virtually raced all the way and had the best Corrected Time to win the Overall trophy. Despite having to slow down in Leg 2 Perie Banou held onto second place and Gypsy Moth V was third. Wojewoda Pomorski was Fastest.|$|E
40|$|EU {{has promised}} to reduce {{emissions}} by 80 % by 2050. For the shipping industry “slow steaming” for just-in-time arrival promises reductions of emissions. But a rapid increase {{in the construction of}} offshore wind farms planned in the North Sea may lead to ships facing a very complex and safety critical traffic environment in the future. Both of these issues bring ship traffic management to attention. In the Baltic Sea, the EU project MONALISA has been looking at a <b>voyage</b> <b>plan</b> coordination system where a Ship Traffic Coordination Centre (STCC) handles a specific area, e. g. the Baltic Sea. A prototype system was developed and tested in a full mission bridge simulator environment for some simple scenarios. Qualitative data was collected; the main aim was to test mariners’ acceptance of such a system. The participants were in general positive to the tested system; younger somewhat more than older. Some concern was expressed over risks of de-skilling and a common concern was the importance of that the final control of the vessel should rest with the captain onboard...|$|R

5000|$|In spring 2007, Cypress {{completed}} her first extended Alien Migration Interdiction Operations (AMIO) patrol for Coast Guard District Seven. During this patrol, {{she set the}} standard for other cutters by successfully chasing and interdicting two go-fast smuggler vessels and seven suspected smugglers; as well as processing over 75 illegal migrants. In addition to routine and emergency servicing of approximately 120 federal aids-to- navigation, Cypress also assists the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) by servicing approximately twenty weather buoys throughout the Gulf of Mexico, critical to assisting professional mariners with <b>voyage</b> <b>planning</b> as well as tracking and predicting hurricanes. CYPRESS has also operated in support of her secondary missions, engaging in Maritime Law Enforcement patrols and conducting search and rescue (SAR). In one recent SAR case, Cypress successfully rescued 8 people from their recreational boat just minutes before it sank.|$|E

50|$|By 1993 Carnival {{wanted to}} update their fleet by {{ordering}} new tonnage {{so she was}} sold to Epirotiki in that year, and was renamed Olympic, Star of Texas, Lucky Star and finally Apollon. In 1995 Epirotiki merged its operations with Sun Line, creating a new company named Royal Olympic Cruise Lines. For a while she sailed for this line and was later chartered by Direct Cruises (division of Direct Holidays) for voyages around the United Kingdom. Direct Holidays was purchased by the tour operator Airtours in 1999 (later MyTravel then Thomas Cook). Coincidentally perhaps, around this time Carnival acquired a share of Airtours plc (around 23%) - though primarily to secure distribution of the Carnival brand through the tour operator. This was a relatively short lived liaison. A quid-pro-quo agreement was made between Royal Olympic and Airtours to scrap the five-year Apollon charter agreement and in 2000 all <b>voyages</b> <b>planned</b> for the vessel were cancelled and she was returned to Greece where she was laid up. This agreement saw the Airtours vessel MS Seawing transferred from Airtours Sun Cruises (the Airtours in-house cruise division) management to Royal Olympic under a 3rd party management agreement. This agreement also included an option to purchase {{at the end of}} the newly agreed management deal.|$|R
