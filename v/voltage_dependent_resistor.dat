The computed I-V_b(current as a function of bias voltage) characteristic of the studied systems showed the tunneling phenomenon in bias and gate voltages considered. Along with the transport properties, electronic properties including density of states (DOS) were calculated in the studied systems. A close examination of the results showed that the I-V_b curve for graphene behaved I∝ V_be^λ V_b like at some bias voltages, while for the oxidized graphene-containing form, its trend was {{the same as that of}} a <b>Voltage</b> <b>Dependent</b> <b>Resistor</b> (VDR-VARiable resISTOR), I∝ V_b^β, at the whole range of the applied bias.

40|$|Transients of {{the voltage}} between a {{tantalum}} foil and an aqueous electro-lyte have been i duced by application of d-c current or else a-c voltage steps during {{the growth of}} a thin protective oxide film. These transients were ana-lyzed in terms of the dependences on voltage and oxide thickness of (a) the ionic current causing the oxide growth and (b) the current required for charge neutralization. Certain discrepancies between the theoretical model used to analyze the transients and the experimental data indicate a more com-plex behavior of the oxide than that of an ideal capacitor shunted by a <b>voltage</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> responding instantaneously to changes in the voltage.

We identified some members of the solid solution series of ilmenite (FeTiO 3) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3), abbreviated as (IH) for simplicity, for our investigations based on their ferromagnetic and semiconducting properties. With this objective in focus we limited our investigations to the following members of the modified Fe-titanates: IH 33 (ilmenitehematite with 33 atomic percent hematite), IH 45 (ilmenite-hematite with 45 atomic percent hematite), Mn-substituted ilmenite (Mn-FeTiO 3), and Mn-substituted pseudobrookite (Mn- Fe 2 TiO 5). All of them are: 1. wide bandgap semiconductors with band gaps ranging in values between 2. 5 to 3. 5 eV; 2. n-type semiconductors; 3. they exhibit well defined magnetic hysteresis loops and 4. their magnetic Curie points are greater than 400 K. Ceramic, film and single crystal samples were studied and based on their properties we produced varistors (also known as <b>voltage</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>resistors)</b> for microelectronic circuit protection from power surges, three-terminal microelectronic devices capable of generating bipolar currents, and an integrated structured device with controlled magnetic switching of spins. Eleven refereed journal papers, three refereed conference papers and three invention disclosures resulted from our investigations. We also presented invited papers in three international conferences and one national conference. Furthermore two students graduated with Ph. D. degrees, three with M. S. degrees and one with B. S. degree. Also two post-doctoral fellows were actively involved in this research. We established the radiation hardness of our devices in collaboration with a colleague in an HBCU institution, at the Cyclotron Center at Texas A&M University, and at DOE National Labs (Los Alamos and Brookhaven). It is to be appreciated that we met most of our goals and expanded vastly the scope of research by including investigations of Mn-FeTiO 3, Mn-Fe 2 TiO 5 and by producing a novel three terminal device capable of generating bipolar currents besides producing radiation resistant varistors and a magnetically switchable device.

40|$|<b>Voltage</b> <b>dependent</b> loads can collectively {{provide a}} certain amount of power reserve (by virtue of the ability to change their power {{consumption}} within the stipulated voltage tolerance) which could be exploited for grid frequency regulation through voltage control at the substation/feeder or at the point of load. The amount of such power reserve would vary with time of the day depending on the incidence of different types of <b>voltage</b> <b>dependent</b> loads and also the voltage profile across the feeders. It is important for the grid operators to know the aggregate power reserve from the <b>voltage</b> <b>dependent</b> loads during different times of the day in order to schedule other forms of reserves accordingly. This paper presents a methodology to estimate such power reserve from the measured power and voltage at the bulk supply points without knowing the actual distribution network topology and/or load profile of individual customers. The proposed method is applied to estimate the time variation of the aggregate reserve offered by the <b>voltage</b> <b>dependent</b> loads within the domestic sector in Great Britain (GB). Studies on a standard IEEE distribution network are presented to validate the estimated reserve margins under typical voltage profiles across the distribution feeders...|$|R
