5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E

5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were <b>very</b> <b>specific.</b> Any differences in possible interpretation must be resolved {{in favor of the}} tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated that the Supreme Court would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016 {{there was}} a rare {{sighting}} of a Sumatran Rhino in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. The last time {{there was a}} Sumatran Rhino in the Kalimantan area was approximately 40 years ago. This optimism was met with despair as that <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> Sumatran Rhino was found dead several weeks later after the sighting. The reason of the death is currently unknown.|$|E

5|$|Some Russulaceae are {{associated}} with myco-heterotrophic plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Monotropoideae, forming monotropoid mycorrhiza. This is an epiparasitic relationship, where the heterotrophic plant ultimately derives its carbon from the primary, ectomycorrhizal plant partner of the fungus. The association is often <b>very</b> <b>specific,</b> with the heterotrophic plants only associating with selected fungus partners, including Russulaceae.|$|E
5|$|Some {{groups in}} Japan, {{particularly}} those active in Tokyo, also {{emphasize the importance}} of the lively and spirited iki aesthetic.

5|$|Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, {{and the two}} chat in a hot tub. While {{reaching}} for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish must be <b>very</b> <b>specific,</b> as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection of his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} constitutional activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by the General Assembly for <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has {{been sent to the}} voters for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but women could vote beginning in 1920.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{were among}} the {{earliest}} terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins {{to protect themselves from}} their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this has led to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution has {{led to the development of}} <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> mutualisms in such systems.|$|E

5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use {{to protect themselves from}} herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine. These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways similar to that of insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E
5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
5|$|Poetic diction {{treats the}} manner in which {{language}} is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form. Many languages and poetic forms have <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} Nyuserre Ini {{witnessed}} the unabated {{growth of the}} priesthood and state bureaucracy, a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty in particular under Neferirkare Kakai. Changes in the Egyptian administration during this period are manifested by a multiplication {{in the number of}} titles, reflecting the creation of new administrative offices. These in turn, reflect a movement to better organise the administration of the state with the new titles corresponding to charges attached to <b>very</b> <b>specific</b> duties.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing. Fever is not <b>very</b> <b>specific,</b> as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this work}} is to collect a complete, mass [...] {{selected}} sample of galaxies with <b>very</b> low <b>specific</b> star formation rate, for a comparison with the prediction of recent theoretical models. Method: We use the 24 /K flux ratio, complemented by the SED fitting to the full 0. 35 - 8. 0 mum spectral distribution, to select quiescent galaxies from z~ 0. 4 to z~ 4 in the GOODS [...] MUSIC sample. Our observational selection can be translated into thresholds on the specific star formation rate SFR/M_*, {{that can be used}} to compare with the theoretical predictions. Results: We find that, in the framework of the well known global decline of the quiescent fraction with redshift, a non-negligible fraction ~ 15 - 20 % of massive galaxies with <b>very</b> low <b>specific</b> star formation rate exists up to z~ 4, including a tail of "Red&Dead" galaxies with SFR/M_*< 10 ^{- 11 }/yr.
