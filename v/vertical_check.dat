40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the political and}} security impacts of the devolution of power to Russiagass regions since 1993. By reviewing the basis of Russiagass federal structure the author identifies how {{the nature of the}} structure {{and the manner in which}} it evolved have led to the emergence of local tsars who have few horizontal or <b>vertical</b> <b>checks</b> on their power. The thesis analyzes the impact that strong regional leaders have had within their regions, to include their impact on free and fair elections, free press, individualsgas rights, and rule of law. The author finds that the lack of checks on the regional leadersgas abuses of power within the regions destabilizes the country by only further encouraging them to expand their power into realms intended to be under the control of the federal government, to include the military and foreign policy. The resultant injection of regional leadership into these matters threatens the security of Russia by inhibiting the ability of the central government to field a cohesive military force and pursue cogent foreign policy. The thesis further {{examines the}} prospects for regional tsars in light of recent efforts to rein in the regions. The author determines that these reforms, though resulting in a degree of centralization, also target some of the key problems in Russiagass federation, to include the dearth of checks on regional power and the contradictions in the legal framework guiding center-periphery relations. However, further reforms targeting Russiagass antiquated federal structure and enforcement mechanisms are recommended...|$|R

40|$|This {{symposium}} contribution explores molecular federalism, an idea floated {{briefly in}} the author 2 ̆ 7 s earlier work on private lawmaking. The many private lawmakers - ranging from familiar organizations like the American Law Institute and the New York Stock Exchange to less well known ones, like the International Chamber of Commerce and associations of banks - are here envisioned {{as part of a}} federalist scheme that operates at a molecular level rather than {{at the level of the}} state. Assuming that many private entities have de facto lawmaking power, as suggested in the earlier paper, their function and legitimacy, and the strengths and weaknesses of private lawmaking, are assessed under the rubric of federalism. The paper takes up both horizontal and vertical aspects of molecular federalism, considering the possibilities of competitive private lawmaking and the potential for (and limits of) governmental control. The article accounts for the extraterritoriality of private lawmaking and considers how private legislation may escape some of the <b>vertical</b> <b>checks</b> and balances associated with state-based federalism, not only through extraterritoriality, but also through some surprising shifts in the federalist hierarchy. The paper also explores the question of how one legal regime can become dominant, while other contexts may suffer legal fragmentation. The paper attempts to place its analysis within the context of some prominent U. S. theorists of federalism, including Herbert Wechsler and Justice Brennan, and contemporary European theorists, such as Gunther Teubner. The conclusion is that molecular federalism, like its state-based counterpart, produces mixed results, and often in a way that accentuates both the strengths and the weaknesses of state-based federalism. The paper also suggests that a constitution for private lawmaking, or a similar system of meta-rules, may be necessary to allow private lawmaking to come closest to its potential...|$|R

40|$|In a {{preemption}} case decided over {{a decade}} ago, Justice Breyer wrote that “in today’s world, filled with legal complexity, the true test of federalist principle may lie... in those many statutory cases where courts interpret the mass of technical detail that is the ordinary diet of the law. ” This article surveys the Roberts Court’s preemption jurisprudence, focusing on five cases decided in OT 2010. Young argues that Justice Breyer was right — that is, that because current federalism jurisprudence largely eschews any effort to define exclusive spheres {{of state and federal}} regulatory jurisdiction, the most important federalism cases involve efforts to determine the preemptive scope of federal legislation. The key doctrinal tool in preemption cases is the “presumption against preemption” — a canon of statutory construction recognized by the Court in the 1947 case of Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. The Rice presumption is under nearly constant siege today from both litigants and commentators. This article explores the Roberts Court’s use (and non-use) of the presumption and defends the presumption against its academic critics. In particular, the author addresses Caleb Nelson’s important argument that Rice’s presumption is inconsistent with the original meaning of the Supremacy Clause, concluding that Professor Nelson’s historical argument does not rule out the presumption as it is presently applied. Even if the original history did disfavor the presumption, Rice is a necessary doctrinal innovation that balances other developments in federalism doctrine, such as the contemporary Court’s unwillingness to enforce a robust enumerated powers doctrine. Nelson’s argument has a second aspect, however, which would considerably raise the bar for conflict preemption. In a series of separate opinions, Justice Thomas has adopted this approach and rejected the contemporary notion of “purposes and objects” preemption. Young argues that this approach can and should coexist with Rice’s presumption against preemption in express preemption cases, and that in any event one cannot consistently cite Nelson’s historical argument to reject Rice and, at the same time, maintain broad notions of implied preemption. The article concludes with a discussion of the politics of preemption cases, which frequently find conservative and liberal justices reversing their usual stances on federalism. Although a number of factors contribute to this ironic reversal, the fact that federal preemption is generally de-regulatory in its effect. Young suggests that a libertarian theory of federalism favoring widespread preemption is shortsighted, because robust state institutions remain necessary to our system of <b>vertical</b> <b>checks</b> and balances...|$|R
40|$|Linear pushbroom {{satellite}} imagery acquired in either along-track or cross-track mode, {{based on the}} projection reference plane in object space. A new method for epipolar resampling of satellite stereo imagery based on this model is then developed. In this method, the pixel-to-pixel relationship between the original image and the generated epipolar image is established directly by the geometric sensor model. The approximate epipolar images are generated in amanner similar to digital image rectification. In addition, by arranging the approximate epipolar lines on the defined projection reference plane, a stereoscopic model with consistent ground sampling distance and parallel to the object space is thus available, which is more convenient for three-dimensional measurement and interpretation. The results obtained from SPOT 5, IKONOS, IRS-P 5, and QuickBird stereo images indicate that the generated epipolar images all achieve high accuracy. Moreover, the <b>vertical</b> parallaxes at <b>check</b> points are at sub-pixel level, thus proving the feasibility, correctness, and applicability of the method...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{database of}} meteorological data {{is essential for}} designing any aerospace vehicle and for preparing launch commit criteria. Meteorological instrumentation were recently placed on the three Lightning Protection System (LPS) towers at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) launch complex 39 B (LC- 39 B), which provide a unique meteorological dataset existing at the launch complex over an extensive altitude range. Data records of temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction are produced at 40, 78, 116, and 139 m at each tower. The Marshall Space Flight Center Natural Environments Branch (EV 44) received an archive that consists of one-minute averaged measurements {{for the period of}} record of January 2011 - April 2015. However, before the received database could be used EV 44 needed to remove any erroneous data from within the database through a comprehensive quality control (QC) process. The QC process applied to the LPS towers' meteorological data is similar to other QC processes developed by EV 44, which were used in the creation of meteorological databases for other towers at KSC. The QC process utilized in this study has been modified specifically for use with the LPS tower database. The QC process first includes a check of each individual sensor. This check includes removing any unrealistic data and checking the temporal consistency of each variable. Next, data from all three sensors at each height are checked against each other, checked against climatology, and checked for sensors that erroneously report a constant value. Then, a <b>vertical</b> consistency <b>check</b> of each variable at each tower is completed. Last, the upwind sensor at each level is selected to minimize the influence of the towers and other structures at LC- 39 B on the measurements. The selection process for the upwind sensor implemented a study of tower-induced turbulence. This paper describes in detail the QC process, QC results, and the attributes of the LPS towers meteorological database...|$|R

The Interactive Graphics Intersection Design System (IGIDS) is a computer software program developed for TxDOT that assists engineers in the analysis and design of individual, at-grade intersections. IGIDS was initially developed under several RMC 3 – Geometric Design, Environmental, Hydraulics, and Right-of-Way projects. IGIDS is a MicroStation application which contains (1) geometric, traffic data, and signalization definition tools; (2) built-in analysis tools for vehicle turning templates; horizontal sight distance checking for stop sign, yield sign, and no control; and “Highway Capacity Manual” (HCM), Chapter 9 procedures; and (3) interfaces to external analysis programs for the TEXAS Model for Intersection Traffic (TEXAS), the TxDOT Automated Plan Preparation System (APP), and the Signal Operations and Analysis Package (SOAP). IGIDS can operate in English or metric units. IGIDS was recently enhanced by the addition of <b>vertical</b> sight distance <b>checking</b> within the horizontal sight triangle, the inclusion of pavement striping definition and tabulation, and the development of training materials. Most TxDOT engineers now use GEOPAK for the geometric design of intersections. TxDOT Traffic Operations personnel generally have access to the GEOPAK design files for an intersection.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the marginal fit and surface roughness of complete cast crowns made by a conventional and an accelerated casting technique. Settings and Design: This study was divided into three parts. In Part I, the marginal fit of full metal crowns made by both casting techniques in the <b>vertical</b> direction was <b>checked,</b> in Part II, the fit of sectional metal crowns in the horizontal direction made by both casting techniques was checked, and in Part III, the surface roughness of disc-shaped metal plate specimens made by both casting techniques was checked. Materials and Methods: A conventional technique was compared with an accelerated technique. In Part I of the study, the marginal fit of the full metal crowns as well as in Part II, the horizontal fit of sectional metal crowns made by both casting techniques was determined, and in Part III, the surface roughness of castings made with the same techniques was compared. Statistical Analysis Used: The results of the t-test and independent sample test do not indicate statistically significant differences in the marginal discrepancy detected between the two casting techniques. Results: For the marginal discrepancy and surface roughness, crowns fabricated with the accelerated technique were significantly different from those fabricated with the conventional technique. Conclusions: Accelerated casting technique showed quite satisfactory results, but the conventional technique was superior in terms of marginal fit and surface roughness...|$|R

Tara Oceans Data are particularly suited to study the genetic, morphological and functional diversity of plankton. The present data set includes properties of seawater, particulate matter and dissolved matter from physical, optical and imaging sensors mounted on a vertical sampling system (Rosette) used during the 2009 - 2013 tara Oceans Expedition. It comprised 2 pairs of conductivity and temperature sensors (SEABIRD components), and {{a complete set of}} WEtLabs optical sensors, including chrorophyll and CDOM fluorometers, a 25 cm transmissiometer, and a one-wavelength backscatter meter. In addition, a SATLANTIC ISUS nitrate sensor and a Hydroptic Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP) were mounted on the rosette.

40|$|Mapping channel geomorphology, {{riparian}} vegetation {{and the extent}} of anthropogenic disturbance of river corridors has traditionally been conducted laboriously in the field. With the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), member states are mandated to complete river basin management plans requiring such fieldwork in order to achieve good ecological status by 2015. Thus, deriving wider land cover information from remotely sensed data will be an integral addition to fieldwork {{in order to meet the}} requirements of the WFD. The objective of this study was to use two types of remote sensing data, LiDAR and ortho-imagery, to delineate channel morphologies and to field check the analysis in the field to test the accuracy of the remote sensing techniques and assess their applicability for the WFD. Using Carneros Creek, in Napa, CA as a testing ground because of the publicly available LiDAR and ortho-imagery datasets, I achieved 80 % accuracy in identifying large terrace features from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and a lower percentage at 66 % accuracy in identifying steep or <b>vertical</b> banks. Field <b>checking</b> the data not only helped clarify existence of the morphological feature but it also allowed for more complex data gathering such vegetation patterns and species, bedrock outcroppings and land use evidence such as outlets of drainage systems and in-stream pumps, all of which I could not see from the DEM.
