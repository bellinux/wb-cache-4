The lens is fed at its base by a 5 pixel array, each one producing an output beam after the reflector with near 61 dBi directivity. The lens is designed {{in such a way}} that it produces <b>virtual</b> <b>foci</b> outside the lens body, close to the reflector focal arch. The lens plus reflector system provides a maximum scanning angle of α = ± 0. 36 º in elevation with gain scan loss below 1. 1 dB, while a mechanical rotation of the reflector produces azimuth scan.

40|$|Subject guides {{are often}} used as an {{alternative}} to in-person library instruction for distance education students. However, when students are not on-campus, {{it can be difficult to}} assess if they are getting all of the relevant information they need. In an organization that serves students located across the United States and even outside of the country, a method was needed to assess the effectiveness of library information provided to distance learners on specific topics. The William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration (Hotel College) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), offers a number of on-campus and distance education courses, including classes taught at a satellite campus in Singapore. With diverse course offerings via distance education, the conventions and exhibitions subject area was chosen as a case study. Often referred to as M. I. C. E., the study of meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions in a hospitality context is a major subdiscipline within the Hotel College. After researching different approaches to studying the effectiveness of subject guides, a <b>virtual</b> <b>focus</b> group was chosen to gather feedback from students. This paper will demonstrate how focus groups can be created and how the information gathered can be used to increase effectiveness of subject guides.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study on}} the design of broadbeam leakywave antennas (LWAs) of uniform type and rectilinear geometry is presented. A new broadbeam LWA structure based on the hybrid printed-circuit waveguide is proposed, which allows for the necessary flexible and independent control of the leaky-wave phase and leakage constants. The study shows that both the real and <b>virtual</b> <b>focus</b> LWAs can be synthesized in a simple manner by tapering the printed-slot along the LWA properly, but the real focus LWA is preferred in practice. Practical issues concerning the tapering of these LWA are investigated, including the tuning of the radiation pattern asymmetry level and beamwidth, the control of the ripple level inside the broad radiated main beam, and the frequency response of the broadbeam LWA. The paper provides new insight and guidance for the design of this type of LWAs. 9 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of a comparative analysis of Hettrick Bowyer Type II (HBII) and Wolter-Schwarzschild Type II (WSII) optics {{for use with}} Rowland circle spectrometers. The HBII can substitute, with few exceptions, for a WSII in any Rowland circle with little change in spectrometer performance or design. However, the HBII telescope offers several clear advantages over the WSII in these configurations. Because the HBII employs a <b>virtual</b> <b>focus,</b> it requires a much shorter instrument length than a WSII. For example, a 3 -m Rowland circle spectrometer, fed by an optimized, f/ 10, 1 -m diameter WSII, has a total instrument length of 6 m. If a HBII is used to feed the identical spectrometer, the entire instrument length can {{be as little as}} 3 m. In addition, the improved imaging gained with the larger graze angles of the HBII design results in better resolution in slitless operation modes...|$|E
