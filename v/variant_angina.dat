Plasma cholesterol level in patients with <b>variant</b> form of <b>angina</b> was significantly lower than that in patients with fixed coronary artery stenosis. When patients with <b>variant</b> form of <b>angina</b> was divided to two groups, one with fixed stenosis and the other with no significant stenosis, aortic stiffness in <b>variant</b> form of <b>angina</b> patients without fixed stenosis is lower than that in <b>variant</b> form of <b>angina</b> patients with significant stenosis.

40|$|SUMMARY Among {{the first}} 83 {{patients}} treated with {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) at our institution, typical <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> was recognized beforehand in five cases and was discov-ered within 4 months of PTCA in six others. All patients had a 65 - 95 % proximal left anterior descending {{coronary artery stenosis}} and only one had a coronary lesion> 50 % in other coronary arteries. Before PTCA, all patients were premedicated with calcium-antagonist drugs. Thirteen of 15 PTCAs, including three of four repeat PTCAs, were technically successful. However, <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> recurred after successful PTCA in three of the five patients in whom it was documented beforehand and in an additional two of two patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> before a successful repeat PTCA. Overall, among the nine patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> after successful PTCA, five had restenosis at the site of PTCA and two others developed severe lesions adjacent to the site of PTCA within 4 months of the procedure. The three patients without restenosis have been treated with calcium-antagonist drugs from soon after PTCA and have remained angina-free. These results suggest that PTCA is technically feasible in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> who have organic lesions, but symptoms due to coronary spasm usually persist or recur, often with restenosis.

SP and ACH were infused into the coronary arteries in nine patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> in whom coronary arteriograms showed normal or mild atherosclerotic lesions. The vasomotor responses of coronary arteries were assessed by quantitative arteriography. ACH at a high dose (100 micrograms/min) provoked coronary vasospasm associated with anginal attack in all patients. In contrast, SP at graded doses (13. 5, 40, and 135 ng/min) caused the dose-dependent and comparable increases in the coronary diameter at the spastic and control sites. ACH at a low dose (10 micrograms/min) also caused comparable vasodilation at the spastic and control sites in patients with normal coronary arteries. Coronary vasodilating responses to SP were comparable in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> and those with atypical chest pain. The results indicate that endothelium-dependent vasodilation evoked with SP and ACH at the low dose was present at the vasospastic site in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina.</b> These findings suggest that the ACH-induced coronary vasospasm in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> results from hyperreactivity of vascular smooth muscle to ACH but not from endothelial dysfunction...|$|E

Considering the possibility of bupropion-associated negative impact on coronary vasospasm, the antidepressant therapy was adjusted to exclude this drug. Although Prinzmetal’s angina is relatively uncommon, we suspect that a routine use of cardiac event monitors in subjects with panic disorder might reveal a greater incidence of coronary vasospasm in this patient population.

40|$|Background. A <b>variant</b> form of <b>angina</b> pectoris (VAP) {{is caused}} by {{coronary}} vessel spasm and occures in patients with and without varying degrees of obstructive coronary artery disease. Although the prognosis of VAP without significant organic stenosis is generally good, multivessel spasm {{is associated with a}} high risk of life-threatening abnormalities of rhythm and conduction. Patient and methods. We describe a patient who presented with prolonged chest pain, associated with hypotension, lost of consciousness, complete AV block and widespread ST segment elevations consistent with inferoanterior acute myocardial infarction. Urgent selective coronary angiography revealed spasms in right coronary artery and in left circumflex artery that were relieved by intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin. All coronary arteries were otherwise patient, without signs of atherosclerosis. The patient was treated with diltiazem and nitrates. She made a complete recovery and resumed her normal activities. Conclusions. Simultaneous multiple spasms of native coronary arteries represent a rare syndrome characterized by significantly higher incidence of potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. Less commonly, prolonged coronary spasm may mimic acute myocardial infarction. Modern management of acute coronary syndromes, including urgent coronarography, enables a prompt differentiation between prolonged coronary spasm and atherosclerotic coronary disease, warranting different treatment strategies. Medical treatment with nitrates and calcium channel blockers in most cases prevents recurrence of vasospasms and arrhythmias. </p...|$|R

Prinzmetal's Angina Pectoris To the Editor: A very {{interesting}} paper by Yasue and associates concerning the role of the autonomic nervous system in the pathogenesis of Prinzmetal's angina pectoris appeared in the September 1974 issue of Circulation. The authors report their ability to precipitate at-tacks of angina pectoris with the choline ester methacholine and were able to block this response by prior administration of atropine. Although the authors did not demonstrate coronary artery spasm in their patients at the time of coronary arteriography, the literature now contains enough reports of non-catheter-induced spasm in the large coronary vessels in individuals with this syndrome to support Prinz-metal's original thoughts about the etiology of this un-usual and interesting form of angina pectoris. Aside from the obvious therapeutic implications of parasympathetic triggering of coronary artery spasm, {{it is quite possible that}} many episodes of coronary artery spasm which would otherwise be noted at the time of coronary arteriography are thwarted by prior administration of atropine which many cardiovascular laboratories give prior to injecting the coronary arteries in order to diminish bradycardia.

BackgroundOxidized or modified low density lipoprotein can impair endothelium-dependent vasoregulation and has atherogenic properties; it may be related to the genesis of coronary artery spasm by potentiating agonist-induced vasoconstriction. MethodsThe sensitivity of plasma low density lipoprotein for cupric ion (Cu 2 +) —induced peroxidation was examined. Low density lipoprotein was isolated from plasma in 112 patients: 21 with active <b>variant</b> <b>angina,</b> 18 with inactive <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> without anginal attacks during the preceding 6 months, 39 with significant organic coronary artery stenoses but without rest angina and 34 control subjects without coronary artery disease. Lipid peroxidation products in low density lipoprotein were assayed as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances before and after incubation with various concentrations of Cu 2 +at 37 °C for 24 h. ResultsSignificantly higher levels of generation of thiobarbituric acid—reactive substances from plasma low density lipoprotein after incubation with Cu 2 +were seen in patients with active <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> than in patients in the other three groups. The dose-response curve of low density lipoprotein peroxidation induced by Cu 2 +shifted to the left in this group as compared with the curve in the other three groups.

40|$|SUMMARY Myocardial {{thallium}} scintigraphy {{was performed}} in four subjects with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> and in one subject with isolated, fixed coronary obstruction. Three subjects with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> had short episodes of ischemic ST-segment elevation that lasted 20 - 100 seconds. Thallium scintigrams demonstrated excess uptake in regions judged to be ischemic by angiographic and electrocardiographic criteria. Two subjects, one with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> {{and the other with}} a fixed coronary lesion, had prolonged episodes of ischemia that lasted 390 - 900 seconds. Both had reduced thallium uptake in the ischemic regions. We conclude that myocardial reactive hyperemia is the cause of excess thallium uptake in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> who have short episodes of myocardial ischemia. MYOCARDIAL reactive hyperemia occurs after tran-sient coronary occlusion. ' The hyperemic response produces a considerable increase in flow in the normal coronary bed after release of an occlusion. However, with severe coronary stenosis, vasodilatory reserve is exhausted and reactive hyperemia is abolished. Myo-cardial thallium- 201 (201 TI) uptake is related to myo-cardial blood flow, 5 ' 6 and in canine studies, regional myocardial thallium uptake is high when the isotope is injected in the hyperemic state. 69 Patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> have episodes of tran-sient myocardial ischemia due to transient coronary artery occlusion.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the basal release of nitric oxide at spastic sites in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina.</b> Background. We previously reported that endothelium-dependent dilator responses to acetylcholine, substance P and bradykinin are preserved at the site of coronary artery spasm. However, it is not known whether the basal release of endothelium- derived nitric oxide is altered at the spastic site. Methods. The effects of intracoronary NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis) at cumulative doses of 50, 100 and 200 μmol on basal coronary artery tone were investigated in eight patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> and normal coronary angiograms and in eight control subjects. The lumen diameters of large epicardial coronary arteries were assessed by quantitative coronary arteriography. Results. Coronary spasm was provoked by the intracoronary administration of acetylcholine in all patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina.</b> l-NMMA did not alter the arterial pressure and heart rate but significantly decreased the coronary artery diameter at spastic and nonspastic sites. Constrictive responses to l-NMMA were significantly greater (p < 0. 01) at the spastic site (constriction by 200 μmol, 22 ± 7 %, mean ± SD) than at the nonspastic site (10 ± 7 %). Constrictive responses to l-NNMA at the nonspastic site in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> were comparable to those in the control subjects. Conclusions.

Symptom-limited bicycle exercise and thallium- 201 myocardial scintigraphy were performed after intravenous administration of 0. 27 mmol/ kg body weight of magnesium sulfate and after placebo on different days. In all patients, serum magnesium levels after administration of magnesium sulfate were about twofold higher than levels after placebo. Exercise-induced angina associated with transient ST segment elevation occurred in 11 patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> receiving placebo and in only 2 of these patients receiving magnesium (p < 0. 005). On the other hand, exercise-induced angina was not suppressed by magnesium in any patient with stable effort angina. In these patients {{there was no significant difference}} in exercise duration after administration of placebo versus after administration of magnesium. The size of the perfusion defect as measured by thallium- 201 scintigraphy was significantly less in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> receiving magnesium than that in those receiving placebo (p < 0. 001), whereas it was not significantly different in patients with stable effort angina receiving placebo versus magnesium. In conclusion, exercise-induced angina is suppressed by intravenous magnesium in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> but not in patients with stable effort angina. This beneficial effect of magnesium in patients with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> is most likely due to improvement of regional myocardial blood flow by suppression of coronary artery spasm...|$|E

Mean baseline intraluminal diameter of proximal and distal coronary segments was not significantly different in control patients and those with <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> (nonspastic segments only) or coronary artery disease (proximal 2. 89 ± 0. 15, 2. 83 ± 0. 14 and 2. 82 ± 0. 09 mm; distal 1. 60 ± 0. 08, 1. 63 ± 0. 07 and 1. 62 ± 0. 06 mm, respectively). After ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 ± 2 %, 15 ± 3 % and 11 ± 4 % and distal segments by 11 ± 3 %, 11 ± 2 % and 14 ± 3 % in control, <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> and coronary artery disease groups, respectively (p = NS). After isosorbide dinitrate, proximal coronary segments dilated by 13 ± 2 %, 11 ± 3 % and 8 ± 2 % (p = NS) and distal segments by 13 ± 3 %, 14 ± 4 % and 15 ± 2 % (p = NS) in control, <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> and coronary artery disease groups, respectively. The results {{of this study indicate that}} rest baseline coronary tone and the vasomotor response of angiographically normal coronary artery segments to ergonovine and isosorbide dinitrate are similar in patients with noncardiac chest pain, Prinzmetal's <b>variant</b> <b>angina</b> and coronary artery disease. Evaluation of basal coronary artery diameter, therefore, is not useful for predicting the occurrence or location of coronary spasm...|$|E
