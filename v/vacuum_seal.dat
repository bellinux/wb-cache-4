Indium is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators.|$|E

2500|$|On Thursday at 12:00, Popov {{reported}} to the General Staff of the Navy that {{there had not been}} an explosion aboard Kursk, the sub was intact on the seafloor, and that an [...] "external influence" [...] may have caused a leak {{between the first and second}} compartment.

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage in the patients with osteofascial compart-ment syndrome in comparison to conventional treatment. Methods: Fifty-two patients diagnosed with osteofascial compartment syndrome were enrolled in this study. They were randomly {{divided into two groups}} based on treat-ments: <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage and conventional treatment. After operation, the length of hospital stay and anti-biotics administration were recorded in the two groups, as well as swelling elimination and wound closure. Results: No significant difference was observed in terms of the baseline characteristics between the two groups. There are no obvious local or systemic complications in all cases. In contrast to conventional treatment group, the time of swelling elimination, wound closure, hospital stay and antibiotics application were reduced significantly in <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage group. No allergic reactions or other side effects were observed after the application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage material, indicating its safety. Conclusion: <b>Vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> drainage is effective in treating osteo-fascial compartment syndrome with better clinical outcomes than conventional therapy...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most common}} is the side entry holder, where the {{specimen}} is placed near {{the tip of}} a long metal (brass or stainless steel) rod, with the specimen placed flat in a small bore. Along the rod are several polymer vacuum rings to allow for the formation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>seal</b> of sufficient quality, when inserted into the stage. The stage is thus designed to accommodate the rod, placing the sample either in between or near the objective lens, dependent upon the objective design. When inserted into the stage, the side entry holder has its tip contained within the TEM vacuum, and the base is presented to atmosphere, the airlock formed by the vacuum rings.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} surface {{activated}} bonding (SAB) through Au thin films with {{the thickness of}} a few tens of nanometers {{can be applied to}} room temperature <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) packaging. In previous study, it was found that room temperature bonding of Si/Si and Si/chemical mechanical polished (CMP) electroplated Cu could be successfully applied to <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> of micro cavities. However this method needs high vacuum in bonding process for keeping activated surfaces and the surfaces should be cleaned by wet processes. In this study we attempt to realize room temperature <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> in low <b>vacuum</b> without any wet surface pre-treatments utilizing Au thin films with controlled surface roughness. We propose and develop packaging structures with comb-drive resonators for characterization of sealing quality and show the applicability of SAB of Au-Au thin films to vacuum-seal packaging...|$|R

50|$|A vacuum {{variable}} capacitor is a {{variable capacitor}} {{which uses a}} high vacuum as the dielectric instead of air or other insulating material. This allows for a higher voltage rating using a smaller total volume. There are several different designs in vacuum variables.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of <b>vacuum</b> <b>sealing</b> {{drainage}} combined with biological dressings on the angiogenesis and inflammatory response after diabetic foot ulcer wound grafting.
