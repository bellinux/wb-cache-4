50|$|For the {{vineyard}} Côte-Rôties, Guigal {{has received more}} 100 point ratings by Robert M. Parker {{than any other single}} wine producer. As of 2009, this meant 21 wines, consisting of seven <b>vintages</b> of La Landonne (1985-2005), nine <b>vintages</b> of La Mouline (1976-2005), and five <b>vintages</b> of La Turque (1985-2005).|$|R
5000|$|The wines {{typically}} {{traded on}} Liv-ex are collectible or investment grade [...] "fine wine" [...] {{that have a}} significant trading volume on the second-hand market, and these wines are traded by the case. This largely means a number of high-end French wines of highly rated <b>vintages,</b> mainly recent <b>vintages</b> and <b>vintages</b> in early maturity. In difference from wine auctions, private collectors can not trade directly on Liv-ex, and older <b>vintages</b> or otherwise very rare collectible wines are not traded.|$|R

5000|$|Comet <b>vintages</b> are {{years during}} which an astronomical event, {{involving}} generally a [...] "Great Comet", occurs prior to harvest. Throughout {{the history of}} wine, winemakers have attributed successful <b>vintages</b> and ideal weather conditions to the unexplained effects caused by the comets. Some of the most heralded <b>vintages</b> {{in the last couple}} of centuries - such as the 1811, 1826, 1839, 1845, 1852, 1858, 1861, 1985 & 1989 <b>vintages</b> - have coincided with a notable appearance of a comet. There is no scientific basis for any effect of comets on viticulture, but the term nevertheless remains in use.|$|R

5000|$|Like Sherry, Vernaccia di Oristano {{wines are}} often made {{utilizing}} a solera system of [...] "fractional blending" [...] where new wine {{is added to}} barrels at the [...] "top" [...] of the solera and then gradually blended into barrels of wine from other <b>vintages</b> as it works it way down through the solera and eventually being bottled. This means that within a single bottle of Vernaccia di Oristano could be blends of wines from several decades of <b>vintages</b> with one Sardinian producer having a solera that contains wine from over a 100 different <b>vintages.</b>|$|R

25|$|While {{very hot}} <b>vintages</b> (such as 2003 and 2009) can create {{problems}} of over-ripeness in Merlot, the Pomerol region (and the Right Bank as a whole) tend to fare better during cooler years (such as 2006 and 2008).

50|$|Many {{examples}} exist where a vintage-to-vintage {{variation of}} yields {{is in fact}} positively related with quality, since the low yields can be due to loss of grapes due to adverse conditions such as hail or grey rot. For the Bordeaux <b>vintages</b> of the 1980s, it is generally recognized that the most abundant harvests also gave the best <b>vintages.</b>|$|R
