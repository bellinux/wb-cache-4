50|$|A VIPoma (also {{known as}} <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome,</b> after the {{physicians}} who first described it) {{is a rare}} (1 per 10,000,000 per year) endocrine tumor, usually (about 90%) originating from non-Î² islet cell of the pancreas, that produce vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It {{may be associated with}} multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.|$|E
40|$|Graded {{doses of}} 0. 6, 1. 3, and 3. 3 pmol/kg/min of {{vasoactive}} intestinal peptide (VIP) were intravenously infused over 30 minute periods in four healthy volunteers and plasma VIP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Even {{with the smallest}} dose of VIP, plasma concentrations rose markedly above normal values. Infusion of higher VIP doses resulted in mean plateau levels of circulating VIP which were {{in the range of}} VIP values found in the <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome.</b> After cessation of the VIP infusions, plasma VIP levels fell strikingly by first order kinetics with an average disappearance half-time of one minute. The apparent metabolic clearance rate was about 9 ml/kg/min and the apparent volume of distribution for VIP was approximately 14 ml/kg. During infusion of the highest VIP dose, previously shown to induce one-fifth maximum pancreatic juice secretion, plasma concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids, and calcium were slightly but significantly raised, the pulse rate and the amplitude of blood pressure were increased, and cutaneous flushing occurred. The spectrum of effects accords well with some abnormalities seen in the <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The present data, however, do not support a role for VIP as a circulating hormone, at least under physiological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic {{endocrine}} tumors (PETs) can {{be divided}} on a clinical and pathologic basis into ten classes [insulinomas, gastrinomas (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), VIPomas (<b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome,</b> WDHA, pancreatic cholera), glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, ACTH-releasing tumors (ACTHomas), growth hormone-releasing factor secreting tumors (GRFomas), nonfunctioning or pancreatic polypeptide secreting tumors (non-functioning PET), PETs causing carcinoid syndrome and PETs causing hypercalcemia) ]. Recent reports suggest calcitonin-secreting PETs also rarely occur but whether they cause a distinct clinical syndrome is unclear. PETs resemble carcinoid tumors histologically; {{in their ability to}} synthesize and frequently secrete multiple peptides such as neuroendocrine cell markers (chromogranins); their biologic behavior and their tumor growth patterns. Both groups of tumors are highly vascular, have hig...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient is}} {{described}} who {{presented with the}} classical symptomatology and profound electrolyte disturbance of the <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome</b> due to a pancreatic apudoma secreting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Diagnosis was confirmed by plasma VIP as measured by a radio-immunoassay technique now available. It is suggested that the cyclical nature of the symptoms {{in this case was}} due to cyclical release of VIP from the tumour in response to an unknown stimulus. Perfusion studies confirmed the excess secretory state of water, sodium and chloride in the small intestine. Symptoms were completely abolished by surgery and the progress is being monitored by means of serial plasma VIP estimations to detect any early recurrence of metastatic disease...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypochlorhydria, and a non-beta islet cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas (<b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome)</b> {{was found to have}} an elevated vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) concentration in the plasma {{as well as in the}} tumor. Treatment with streptozocin resulted in a dramatic subjective and objective tumor response in this patient. Plasma VIP concentration fell into the normal range after four courses of treatment, diarrhea ceased after the third course of therapy, and measurable tumor mass markedly decreased during that same period of time. The patient remains in clinical remission with no evidence of tumor regrowth 18 months after the beginning of treatment. In this patient, plasma VIP measurements were an excellent marker of tumor activity and correlated well with objective disease measurements and clinical response...|$|E
40|$|Neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) {{tumors are}} rather rare {{neoplasms}} with an incidence of 1 - 2 cases per 100, 000 people [1, 2, 3, 4]. They originate {{from any of}} the various cell types belonging to the neuroendocrine system. A general characteristic of GEP endocrine tumors is that the vast majority produce and secrete a multitude of peptide hormones and amines. Several syndromes can be associated with GEP endocrine tumors, caused by hyperproduction of a specific hormone, and usually liver metastases are pre sent in patients because of the malignancy of the tumors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The syndromes include: carcinoid syndrome [10], Zollinger- Ellison syndrome [6], the so-called "insulinoma syndrome" [5], "glucagonoma syndrome" [7], <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which is brought about by high circulating levels of vasointestinal peptide (VIP) [8], and finally the "somatostatinoma syndrome" [9]...|$|E
40|$|P ancreatic cholera syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome</b> 1 and WDHA syn-drome, is a {{constellation}} of symptoms caused by VIPomas, a rare subtype of neuroendo-crine tumor (NET) that typically originates in the pancreas. In this syndrome, excessive production of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) provokes secre-tory diarrhea with associated electrolyte imbalance. VIPomas account for less than 1 % of all pancreatic tu-mors and are usually solitary lesions larger than 3 cm, with 75 % occurring in {{the tail of the}} pancreas. More than 60 % of VIPomas metastasize by the time of diag-nosis. 2 Diagnosis is dependent on confirming the pres-ence of hormone hypersecretion and localizing the tumor using available imaging modalities. This article presents the case of a woman with the classic presenta-tion of VIPoma who required multiple hospitalizations due to life-threatening hypokalemia. The approach to diagnosis of VIPoma and management of components of pancreatic cholera syndrome are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Vasoactive {{intestinal}} peptide-producing tumour (VIPoma) or <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{very rare}} neuroendocrine tumour. It occurs in less than ten percent of all pancreatic islet cell tumours, and about 70 percent to 80 percent of these tumours originate from the pancreas. Diagnosis is characteristically delayed. The first-line treatment is surgical. It may be curative in forty percent of patients with benign and non-metastatic disease. Palliative surgery is indicated in extensive disease, followed by conventional somatostatin analogue (octreotide) therapy. Somatostatin analogues improve hormone-mediated symptoms, reduce tumour bulk and prevent local and systemic effects. We present a female patient with VIPoma syndrome, which had metastasised to the liver at diagnosis. The patient underwent palliative Whipple procedure and subsequent cytoreductive radiofrequency ablations to her liver metastases. Unfortunately, after symptomatic improvement for three years, her disease progressed. Currently, she is on daily octreotide, achieving partial control of her symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) {{neoplasms}} {{originate from}} any of the various cell types belonging to the neuroendocrine system. A general characteristic of GEP endocrine tumours is that the vast majority produce and secrete a multitude of peptide hormones and amines. Many patients with malignant metastasising tumours present clinical symptoms related to hormone hyperproduction. These include the so-called carci-noid syndrome, characterised by flushing, diarrhoea, wheezing and right heart disease, which is predominantly associated with the serotonin- and tachykinins-producing carcinoids of the midgut. Several types of syndrome associated with GEP endocrine tumors are caused by overproduction of a specific hormone. For instance, the well-known Zollinger-Ellison syn-drome is gastrin-mediated. The so-called 'insulinoma syndrome' depends on excessive production of insulin and proinsulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. The 'glucagonoma syndrome ' is characterised by necrolytic migratory erythema, diabetes and diarrhoea. The <b>Verner-Morrison</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which is brought about by high circulating levels of vasointestinal peptide (VIP), produces severe secretory diarrhoea. Finally the 'somatostati-noma syndrome ' involves gallbladder dysfunction and gall-stones, diarrhoea with or without steatorrhea, and impaired glucose tolerance. The biochemical diagnosis of endocrine digestive tumors is based on general and specific markers. The best general markers are chromogranin A (CgA) and pancreatic polypep-tide (PP). Specific markers for endocrine tumors include in-sulin, gastrin, glucagon, vaso intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin and the primary cathabolic product of serotonin, 5 -hydroxyndoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA). Localisation procedures commonly applied, in the diagnosis of endocrine tumours include ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) ...|$|E
