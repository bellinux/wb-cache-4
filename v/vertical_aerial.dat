40|$|Autonomous <b>vertical</b> lift <b>aerial</b> {{vehicles}} (such as rotorcraft or powered-lift vehicles) hold considerable {{potential for}} supporting planetary science and exploration missions. <b>Vertical</b> lift <b>aerial</b> vehicles {{would have the}} following advantages/attributes for planetary exploration: (1) low-speed and low-altitude detailed aerial surveys; (2) remote-site sample return to lander platforms; (3) precision placement of scientific probes; (4) soft landing capability for vehicle reuse (multiple flights) and remote-site monitoring; (5) greater range, speed, and access to hazardous terrain than a surface rover; and (6) greater resolution of surface details than an orbiter or balloons.

40|$|SUMMARY: Otago has {{a wealth}} of engineering, goldmining and {{agricultural}} sites. Aerial photographs are essential to recognise and map sites and helpful in interpreting the meaning of patterns. The patterns may reflect a range of underlying variables such as the exploited resource, the facilities needed to exploit it, transport and social {{factors such as the}} supporting settlements, and also modern heritage management issues. Aerial photographs may also be used in illustrating and dramatising sites. Conventional wide-area aerial photographic coverage is useful but, for detail, custom-flown <b>vertical</b> <b>aerials</b> in medium format film and digital media are better. Historical aerial photographs (which date back to about 1945) also have applications, especially where there has been substantial landscape change. On the upper Shotover River, historical processes depended on settlement enclosure and mining capital investment all of which can be investigated using aerial photographs. In addition, examples of aerial photographs of a range of engineering subjects in Otago are shown...|$|R
50|$|Moore-Brabazon also {{pioneered the}} {{incorporation}} of stereoscopic techniques into aerial photography, allowing the height of objects on the landscape to be discerned by comparing photographs taken at different angles. In 1916, the Austro-Hungarian Empire made <b>vertical</b> camera axis <b>aerial</b> photos above Italy for map-making.|$|R
50|$|Of great {{significance}} for the future were the trials which the Commission made in the early 1970s {{of the use of}} <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photography to speed up the survey of nationally important sites: of the Pembrokeshire hillforts Gaer Fawr and Carn lngli in 1973, and in 1974 of Carn Goch, a hillfort in Carmarthenshire. The methodology was also adopted for the medieval site of Cefnllys Castle in Radnorshire.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} {{land-based}} D/F stations preferred by the Allies in World War II was the U-Adcock system, {{which consisted of}} a small, central operators' hut that was surrounded by four 10 m <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> poles, usually placed at the four compass points. Aerial feeders ran underground and {{came up in the}} centre of the hut and were connected to a direction finding goniometer and a wireless receiver, that allowed the bearing of the signal source to be measured. In the UK some operators were located in an underground metal tank. These stations were usually in remote places, often in the middle of farmers' fields. Traces of World War II D/F stations can be seen as circles in the fields surrounding the village of Goonhavern in Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} scheduled carriers at {{the airport}} included Western Air Express, Maddox Air Lines, and Century Pacific Lines. United Airlines was formed in 1934 and quickly became the key carrier {{at the airport}}, with Douglas DC-3 service to Los Angeles and New York beginning in January 1937. A new passenger terminal opened in 1937, constructed with Public Works Administration funding. The March 1939 Official Aviation Guide shows 18 airline departures on weekdays— seventeen United flights and one TWA flight.

50|$|In 1938, AOC {{purchased}} a Swiss-made Wild A5 Autograph photogrammetric plotting machine that could minimise {{the effects of}} optical distortion and perspective in magnified aerial photographs. In early 1939, Sidney Cotton employed the facilities of AOC for production and interpretation of both <b>vertical</b> and oblique <b>aerial</b> photographs taken of ground installations in Germany and elsewhere in clandestine flight operations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> {{photographs}} {{secured by}} the group were a valuable source of positive information. During the six weeks spent by III Corps group on the Vesle the entire sector opposite the corps front was photographed {{to a depth of}} 12 kilometers. This work was accomplished by formations of three or five airplanes. Numerous missions failed because of the active resistance of enemy pursuit, which attacked in vastly superior numbers. The average altitude was 3,000 meters. Upon one or two occasions close pursuit protection was secured from the neighboring French pursuit group 22. Ordinarily, pursuit protection was not available owing to the insufficient effectiveness of group 22, which was responsible alone {{for the protection of the}} entire Army front. It was found also that the delays encountered inmeeting protecting airplanes were responsible for the failure of missions which started during perfect weather and ran into fog or clouds before the protection could be obtained and the lines reached.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the automated characterization {{of real estate}} (real property) for Internet mapping. It proposes a processing framework to achieve this task from <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photography and associated property information. A demonstration of the feasibility of an automated solution builds on test data from the Austrian City of Graz. Information is extracted from <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photography and various data products derived from that photography {{in the form of}} a true orthophoto, a dense digital surface model and digital terrain model, and a classification of land cover. Maps of cadastral property boundaries aid in defining real properties. Our goal is to develop a table for each property with descriptive numbers about the buildings, their dimensions, number of floors, number of windows, roof shapes, impervious surfaces, garages, sheds, vegetation, presence of a basement floor, and other descriptors of interest for each and every property of a city. From aerial sources, at a pixel size of 10 cm, we show that we have obtained positional accuracies in the range of a single pixel, an accuracy of areas in the 10 % range, floor counts at an accuracy of 93 % and window counts at 86 % accuracy. We also introduce 3 D point clouds of facades and their creation from <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photography, and how these point clouds can support the definition of complex facades...|$|E

5000|$|The {{largest of}} these World War II FFW {{vehicles}} were the 3-ton command vehicles on lorry chassis and the 6×6 AEC Armoured Command Vehicle. [...] These were {{built for the}} use of staff officers and carried map tables, several telephones and other equipment, with space for a senior officer and his staff in command.
