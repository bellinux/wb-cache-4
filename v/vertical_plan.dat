50|$|The {{propulsion}} system of Osprey class submersible {{is the most}} significant features that differentiate it from other conventional submarines. Instead of using electric motor as most other submersibles in the world, the {{propulsion system}} is hybrid electrical - hydraulic system with the thrusts powered by a hydraulic system. The main shrouded propeller is located {{in the center of the}} crucifix control surfaces at the stern, which enables the submersible to turn in the horizontal plan, but the main shrouded propeller cannot control the motion in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plan,</b> which is controlled by auxiliary propellers. These auxiliary propulsion systems also enable the submersibles to move sideways. Hydraulic system is selected for its high efficiency, compact size, light weight and the ease of installation, and with the thrusters installed outside the pressure hull, there no need to penetrate the pressure hull like the main propulsion axis of the conventional submarines. The operation of the submersible is different from that of a submarine, but somewhat similar to that of a helicopter instead.|$|E

30|$|Sacrocolpopexy is a {{particular}} risk for vaginal rupture because it is usually performed in patients who have vaginal vault prolapse often with several previous pelvic surgeries, commonly in post-menopausal patients, and usually, it is associated with enterocele. Insertion of synthetic mesh in sacrocolpopexy may lead to further weakness of the vaginal fasci{{a particular}}ly if it is complicated with infection and mesh erosion. Furthermore, sacrocolpopexy changes the normal axis of the vagina as it brings the vagina in a more <b>vertical</b> <b>plan</b> rather than its normal anatomical almost horizontal plan resting on the levator plate. The angle of inclination of the upper vagina to the horizontal is normally less than 45 Â° [4]. During increased intra-abdominal pressure, the vaginal axis becomes even more horizontal, and the angle of inclination is reduced to virtually zero so that the vagina is maintained well supported above the levator plate [5]. This important mechanism protects the vaginal vault, which is the weakest part of the vagina, during straining. Moreover, the tension created by the mesh of the sacrocolpopexy on the vaginal apex adds to {{the weakness of the}} vaginal vault and increases the risk of tearing and rupture of the vagina.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{we present}} a {{numerical}} study of heat transfer by natural convection in a two-dimensional closed room, containing air, {{in the presence of}} a thin heater plate. The vertical walls are kept adiabatic, while the horizontal ones are isothermal. The equations governing the natural convection in the room are solved using a finite difference technique based on the control volume approach and the SIMPLEC (Semi-Implicit-Method for Pressure-Linked Equations Corrected) algorithm. A non-uniform mesh in both directions, constructed by using a geometric progression, is adopted. The square room contains a thin heated plate located at the room center with an aspect ratio equal to 0. 5. The heater plate is positioned horizontally and has a higher temperature than the isothermal walls. The simulation results are obtained in terms of velocity vectors and isotherms for different Rayleigh numbers values ranging from 104 to 106. The symmetric boundary conditions produce a symmetric behaviour of temperature and velocity fields according to the central <b>vertical</b> <b>plan.</b> The increase of Rayleigh number leads to increasing importance of convection heat transfer relative to the conduction heat transfer. The fact is more marked for the regions above the heater plate. It is shown that for high Rayleigh numbers, heat transfer from the heater plate to the isothermal horizontal walls is mainly directed towards the top wall...|$|E
40|$|Partially {{premixed}} combustion (PPC) {{is used to}} {{meet the}} increasing demands of emission legislation and to improve fuel efficiency. With gasoline fuels, PPC {{has the advantage of}} a longer premixed duration of the fuel/air mixture, which prevents soot formation. In addition, the overall combustion stability can be increased with a longer ignition delay, providing proper fuel injection strategies. In this work, the effects of multiple injections on the generation of in-cylinder turbulence at a single swirl ratio are investigated. High-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) is conducted in an optical direct-injection (DI) engine to obtain the turbulence structure during fired conditions. Primary reference fuel (PRF) 70 (30 % n-heptane and 70 % iso-octane) is used as the PPC fuel. In order to maintain the in-cylinder flow as similarly as possible to the flow that would exist in a production engine, the quartz piston retains a realistic bowl geometry. The distortion caused by the complex shape of the optical piston is corrected by an advanced image-dewarping algorithm. The in-cylinder charge motion is evaluated and investigated over a range of crank angles in the compression and expansion strokes {{in order to understand the}} turbulence level, especially the late-cycle turbulence.

40|$|This {{program was}} {{developed}} to fill a need within the Wallops Flight Facility workflow for automation {{of the development of}} <b>vertical</b> <b>plan</b> limit lines used by flight safety officers during the conduct of expendable launch vehicle missions. Vertical plane present-position-based destruct lines have been used by range safety organizations at numerous launch ranges to mitigate launch vehicle risks during the early phase of flight. Various ranges have implemented data submittal and processing workflows to develop these destruct lines. As such, there is significant prior art in this field. The ElLimits program was developed at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility to automate the process for developing vertical plane limit lines using current computing technologies. The ElLimits program is used to configure launch-phase range safety flight control lines for guided missiles. The name of the program derives itself from the fundamental quantity that is computed - flight elevation limits. The user specifies the extent and resolution of a grid in the vertical plane oriented along the launch azimuth. At each grid point, the program computes the maximum velocity vector flight elevation that can be permitted without endangering a specified back-range location. Vertical plane x-y limit lines that can be utilized on a present position display are derived from the flight elevation limit data by numerically propagating 'streamlines' through the grid. The failure turn and debris propagation simulation technique used by the application is common to all of its analysis options. A simulation is initialized at a vertical plane grid point chosen by the program. A powered flight failure turn is then propagated in the plane {{for the duration of the}} so-called RSO reaction time. At the end of the turn, a delta-velocity is imparted, and a ballistic trajectory is propagated to impact. While the program possesses capability for powered flight failure turn modeling, it does not require extensive user inputs of vehicle characteristics (e. g., thrust and aerodynamic data), nor does it require reams of turn data after the traditional fashion of the Air Force ranges. The program requires a nominal trajectory table (time, altitude, range, velocity, and flight elevation) and makes heavy use of it to initialize and model a failure turn...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{vulnerability}} from geohazards such as submarine landslides and earthquakes requires identifying susceptible {{regions and}} modeling the consequences. We introduce innovative instruments and techniques {{that have the}} potential to advance preparedness and mitigation efforts. We develop optical fiber strainmeters to monitor deformation along unstable slopes and in a vertical borehole at the SAFOD observatory. With this latter strainmeter, we record coseismic strain-steps from local microearthquakes in addition to teleseismic events, which we compare to accelerations from a nearby seismometer to derive local phase velocities. We also study a seafloor crack within the Santa Barbara Basin that might be the beginning of an imminent submarine landslide. We deployed a new seafloor acoustic ranging system which detected no motion across the crack above a 99 % confidence level of Â± 7 mm/yr over two years of monitoring. Combined with sub- bottom CHIRP profiles with < 1 m accuracy exhibiting no evidence of internal deformation, we conclude that the elongated scarp-like crack is most likely a relict feature from a previous failure. Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis suggests that an ÌƒMÌƒ <Ì² 7 earthquake is required within the basin to explain a previous landslide, arguing against a recent relocation of the 21 Dec. 1812 earthquake (M 7. 1) to the San Andreas Fault. Finally, we study the anomalous Ms 5. 3 earthquake of 10 Feb. 2006 in the Gulf of Mexico. Surface wave full-waveform inversion suggested a source of either a shallow landslide translating on a near sub-horizontal surface, or sub-horizontal or vertical faulting within shallow, low velocity sediments. We integrated the results of two industrial seismic exploration surveys to relocate the epicenter. The geology around the relocation is consistent with the sliding source model, and geotechnical modeling suggests that the sharp relief is capable of producing a large landslide. To test the landslide hypothesis, we surveyed the region acquiring multibeam, sidescan, and sub-bottom seismic profiles. The results of that survey indicate no evidence of a large debris flow. This suggests a source mechanism within the shallow sedimentary section on either a near sub-horizontal or near <b>vertical</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|E

Starting from the initial position the subjects made movements in the three ta:Ã§gets direction as fast as possible. No instructions were given as to the trajectory of the movement to be made. Results. The neurologically normal subjects obtained straighter trajectories differentiation in the articulate movement pattem between the shoulder and the elbow, differentiation in the musc 1 e torque pattem among the articulation and the index of linear correlation among the musc 1 e torque. However, the subjects with peripheral neuropathies could not make straight trajectories. They presented some compromise in the articulate movement of the elbow, similar to the shoulder pattem. They obtained an altemation in the muscle torque pattem of the elbow, establishing behavior similar to the one the shoulder presents. They determined high index of linear correlation. Discussion. Summarizing, the subjects could not dissociate the articulate dislocation patterns among the articulations of shoulder and elbow to guarantee the execution of a straight trajectory. This behavior would only be possible if the linear correlation index among the muscle torque was reduced. However, the subjects with peripheral neuropathy could not establish the same index present in the neur 9 logically normal subjects.
