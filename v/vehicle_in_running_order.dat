5000|$|Beginning in 2009, the Japanese Big Four {{manufacturers}} and BMW began publishing the wet weight rather than dry, usually providing some explanation for what this means. Since then most other manufacturers have followed, {{in order to}} comply with EC directives that explicitly state that the values pertain to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order.</b> Honda describes it as curb weight (aka kerb weight) and says this means the bike is [...] "ready to ride." [...] Others say all fluids are included and the fuel tank is at least 90% full. Erik Buell Racing gives [...] "wet weight (no fuel)" [...] for the 2012 1190RS motorcycle, while KTM gives a [...] "weight without fuel approx." ...|$|E

40|$|In 2011 Crick Smith {{conservation}} were contracted by the Weald Foundation {{in association}} with the Bovington Tank Museum to research and investigate traces of extremely degraded paint layers on the panels of two dismantled FT-­‐ 17 tanks used during the First World War Introduced in 1918 the Renault FT-­‐ 17 was the world’s first tank produced with a rotating turret and had a major impact on the success of the allied campaign at the end of WW 1. Nothing is known about the true camouflage colours used by the allies at this time and the science of effective camouflage was very much in its infancy, which was very much trial and error. Removed samples were examined by both optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy to positively identify the chemical elements contained within the paint films assisting The tanks sampled had spent many years buried in concrete as fixed gun emplacements resulting in extremely degraded and denatured paint layers. This research positively identified the colours used for the first time. Further archival research was carried out in France by an undergraduate student. Collating both aspects of this research will allow the Tank Museum to faithfully recreate an example of the camouflage scheme in time for the centenary anniversary of the first world war in 2014 with a plan to display the <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> <b>running</b> <b>order</b> to the public. Sharing the research will also assist other custodians of this type of vehicle to present them with a historically accurate appearance...|$|R
