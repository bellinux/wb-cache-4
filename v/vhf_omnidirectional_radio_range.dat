40|$|Field {{strength}} or signal-in-space (SIS) measurements {{have been performed}} by using manned helicopters, aircrafts or from ground level using extendable masts. With the availability of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) such as multicopters a new versatile platform for SIS measurements is deployable. Larger types show up to eight individually driven electric motors and controllers (therefore called octocopter). They provide the ability to fly along predefined traces, to hover at waypoints and to initiate other actions when those have been reached. They provide self-levelling and stabilisation and moreover, they may gear at a point of interest regardless of their actual position, e. g. during their flight around a tower. Their payload mainly depends on the platform size and allows integration of complex measurement equipment. Upgrading their navigation capabilities including state-of-the-art global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and ground station transmitter (real-time kinematic – RTK) enables precise localisation of the UAS. For operation in electromagnetic harsh environments a shielding can be considered and integrated into the concept. This paper describes concept and design of an octocopter and its instrumentation, along with applications in recent projects, in which we measure and validate terrestrial navigation systems applied in air traffic and the weather forecast services. Among those are instrumentation landing systems (ILS), <b>VHF</b> <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>ranges</b> (VOR), airport traffic and weather radars as well as military surveillance radars, and UHF wind profilers.

50|$|RNAV systems {{evolved in}} a manner similar to {{conventional}} ground-based routes and procedures. A specific RNAV system was identified and its performance was evaluated through a combination of analysis and flight testing. For land-based operations, the initial systems used very high frequency <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) for estimating position; for oceanic operations, inertial navigation systems (INS) were employed. Airspace and obstacle clearance criteria were developed based on the performance of available equipment, and specifications for requirements were based on available capabilities. Such prescriptive requirements resulted in delays to the introduction of new RNAV system capabilities and higher costs for maintaining appropriate certification. To avoid such prescriptive specifications of requirements, an alternative method for defining equipment requirements has been introduced. This enables the specification of performance requirements, independent of available equipment capabilities, and is termed performance-based navigation (PBN). Thus, RNAV is now one of the navigation techniques of PBN; currently the only other is required navigation performance (RNP).|$|R

40|$|The communication, {{navigation}} and surveillance (CNS) {{structure in the}} civil aviation sector is currently undergoing a major modernization process: A large number of old, analog systems have either already reached their capacity limit or are expected {{to do so in}} the near future. As for communication aspects, the current analog voice radio system will have to be substituted by a more efficient system to be able to keep pace with the current growth of the civil air traffic. One of the most promising candidates for the future air traffic management (ATM) data link is the L-band digital aeronautical communication system – type 1 (LDACS 1) [1]. LDACS 1 is largely based on 4 th generation telecommunication technology and employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (OFDM) as modulation. Compared to the current analogue systems, it offers a vastly increased capacity, scalability, and efficiency. In the sector of aircraft navigation, currently also a change of paradigm is happening. In the past, pilots had to rely on DME (distance measuring equipment) and VOR (<b>VHF</b> <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>range).</b> Compared to state-of-the-art navigation aids, these systems offer only a poor performance while being spectrally inefficient. Therefore, in the future the aircraft will increasingly rely on GNSS (global navigation satellite systems) offering a highly superior navigation performance compared to the legacy systems. To guarantee the required degree of integrity, the GNSS systems will be accompanied with a ground or satellite based augmentation system (G/SBAS). However, an increased use of GNSS brings new challenges with regard to integrity, continuity and availability of the navigational information. Due to the low power levels received from a distant satellite, navigation is susceptible to intentional or unintentional interference. Hence a parallel backup navigational infrastructure, referred to as alternative positioning, {{navigation and}} timing (APNT), needs to be employed. This system can be used when GNSS services are temporary unavailable. Currently, different approaches to design a backup system for GNSS exist. Most proposals rely on an increased use of the DME technology. However, this exhibits different drawbacks: First of all, a costly extension of the infrastructure is required. Secondly, the spectrally inefficient DME system would be expanded and use additional spectrum resources needed for the deployment of the required new communication system in the L-band. Therefore, the approach of using the future communication system LDACS 1 for navigation is evaluated in this paper. As shown in [2], positioning with an OFDM system is generally possible with high precision. Navigation using LDACS 1 has been proposed in [3], where the theoretically possible bounds for precision of range measurements are assessed. To verify the practical ability of LDACS 1 to act as an APNT system for GNSS backup, DLR has carried out a measurement campaign in November 2012. Four LDACS 1 ground stations were set up in a rectangular shape about 40 kilometers apart from each other. For the measurement a Dassault Falcon 20 aircraft with an onboard receiver flew several patterns within the test area at various altitudes. According to the theoretical limits for transmission at a reduced power of 39 dBm, LDACS 1 should deliver reliable and precise navigation for aircraft between the stations. Typical challenges for navigation with LDACS 1 are similar to those of GNSS systems, e. g. multipath resolution or interference of other systems. In particular, the LDACS 1 bandwidth of 500 kHz makes the resolution of close multi-paths troublesome. A major challenge during the campaign was the synchronization of the ground stations. A synchronization accuracy in the range of nanoseconds was desired to avoid concealment of measurement errors by synchronization errors. To make statements about the impact on positioning precision, both synchronization error and variance have to be assessed for every point in time during the campaign. For this purpose, oven-controlled Rubidium clocks at the stations were monitored in a calibrated setup by high precision dual frequency GNSS timing receivers. The calibrated setup is required to mitigate the effect of hardware biases affecting the synchronization performance. This approach allows an analysis of the clock biases and drifts up to nanosecond level by the application of a common-view time transfer technique. It is independent from the GNSS receivers’ position, velocity, and time (PVT) solutions, which merely served as backup [4]. A first analysis of the data indicates that under good conditions the LDACS 1 system offers a performance considerably better than DME systems. However, the performance may be degraded in cases of strong interference by other systems or strong multipath situations. The final paper starts with a brief description of the LDACS 1 standard. It is followed by a detailed description of the measurement campaign setup, including the specific challenges which had to be solved to conduct the campaign. This is followed by an assessment of the performance of the ground station synchronization, and the presentation of first results for the pseudo range generation and position determination. Therefore an elaborate description and discussion of the employed algorithms is necessary. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future work to be conducted in the field of LDACS 1 navigation...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the last years, civil {{aeronautics}} have been undergoing a perpetual innovation: the way we communicate, navigate, and survey the airspace is currently being redefined. In the past, pilots mainly relied on DME (distance measuring equipment) and VOR (<b>VHF</b> <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>range)</b> for navigation. Compared to state-of-the-art navigation aids these systems offer only a limited performance while being spectrally inefficient. Therefore, it is planned in the future to rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for navigation. GNSS offers a highly superior navigation performance as compared to that obtained with legacy DME/VOR infrastructure. To guarantee the required degree of integrity, GNSS systems will be accompanied with ground or satellite based augmentation systems (G/SBAS). However, an increased use of GNSS for aviation brings new challenges. Especially integrity, continuity, and availability of navigational information are of exceptional importance in a safety-of-life environment. Due to the low power levels received from in-orbit satellites, GNSS signals are susceptible interferences, both intentional and unintentional. Hence a ground based navigational backup system, referred to as alternative positioning, navigation and timing (APNT), needs to be employed. These systems should be used when GNSS services become temporarily unavailable. Different proposals for APNT are currently being discussed. One approach is based on the legacy system DME. The major advantage of DME is that it allows reusing the existing infrastructure; in fact, DMEs can be currently used as an APNT system. However, a large drawback of this solution is the continued use of old, spectrally-inefficient technology. But, what is more important, is that once the transition to GNSS-based air traffic management has been realized, a DME-based APNT solution will not be able to support the same level of navigational information in terms of accuracy or precision. Thus, alternative APNT approaches that provide accurate positioning, while at the same time allowing for a “gentle” phasing out of DMEs, are needed. One such example is the future communication system LDACS 1, which signals can be also used for ranging and positioning. Hereby, communication infrastructure can also be employed for navigation purposes. Independently of the underlying technology, the majority of the APNT proposals are ground-based systems with planned allocation in the L-band. If, however, the future APNT systems are to deliver highly accurate positioning information, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of the ground-to-air (G 2 A) L-band wireless propagation channel in more detail. Yet this remains a challenging task as channel models for L-band G 2 A useable for testing and validation of range estimators are sparse. The existing models are extensions of classical statistical channel models developed for wireless communication applications. Thus, dependable simulations of the navigation performance of the proposed systems are hard to realize. To address this challenge, DLR has conducted in 2013 an extensive channel measurement campaign in the L-band. To this end, the setup consisted of a ground-based transmitter located on top of a building in an airport, and a receiver in a research aircraft Dassault Falcon 20 E. For both the transmitter and receiver commercial L-band antennas were employed. The measurement bandwidth was set to 10 MHz with a center frequency at the lower end of the L-band at 965 MHz; the transmit power was set to 39 dBm. Different flight patterns were tested in order to allow an extensive investigation of the channel characteristics. These include flights at different altitudes and transmitter-receiver separations, approach on the airport, take-off and landing. First preliminary analysis of the recorded data identifies an interesting characteristic of the L-band G 2 A channel relevant for navigation applications: for all altitudes multiple propagation paths can be observed. This effect is especially profound at low altitudes. The multipath is prone to occur in close vicinity to the transmitter, but excess delays sometimes reaching up to a few kilometers. The additional propagation paths are also strongly correlated in Doppler domain. As the result, for ranging and positioning applications such multipaths cause a strong interference to the direct path, significantly biasing the output of the correlator tuned to the line of sight (LOS) path. Furthermore, the spatial proximity of the different propagation paths complicates their separation and detection. This makes the compensation of the multipath effects a very challenging task. Especially for systems with low bandwidths, such as DME or LDACS 1 that are considered for APNT services, multiple propagation paths represent a significant error source. Data collected in previous flight trials show that errors in the region of hundreds of meters are possible when ranging with a low bandwidth system in strong multipath environment. In the final paper we will discuss the above mentioned problems in more details. We will begin by outlining the goals of the channel measurement campaigns and explain the measurement setup used in our measurements. The latter includes a short description of both the hardware and software employed during the campaign as well as the applied algorithms. Then, we will concentrate on the analysis of the measurement data. Hereby a special focus is placed on the multipath characterization of the G 2 A channel using a novel superresolution multipath estimation algorithm. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the obtained results and outline of the future investigation directions...|$|E
40|$|Civil avionic {{systems have}} been {{undergoing}} a major transformation {{during the past few}} years. To keep up with the growing demand for higher capacity and efficiency, the analog aeronautical communication systems have to be exchanged with a more efficient digital transmission. Moreover, the civil air traffic navigation systems need to be improved to provide more precise and reliable navigation information for the aircraft to improve the operation efficiency. The L-band digital aeronautical communication system – type 1 (LDACS 1) {{is one of the most}} promising candidates for the future air traffic management data link. The LDACS 1 signal has 500 kHz effective bandwidth and shall be allocated in the lower part of L-band (960 - 1164 MHz). One of the key advantages of LDACS 1 is its spectral deployment: it is foreseen to allocate the LDACS 1 channels in spectral gaps between two adjacent channels distance measuring equipment (DME) – a currently used radio navigation system. The civil aeronautics relies heavily on DME and <b>VHF</b> <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> (VOR). These legacy systems were established over several decades ago. They have limited performance that does not meet the future demands. Hence, the future navigation system is planned to rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The fields of GNSS navigation have been improved greatly during the last decades, and validations of flight procedures using GPS have already been done. However, integrity, continuity and availability of the navigation information are also important factors. These topics are major concerns for the use of GNSS navigation because of the large distance between the satellites and the aircrafts. The received signal can be interrupted by intentional or unintentional interference. Consequently, the GNSS failures might temporary occur. Therefore, there is a need for a parallel backup navigational infrastructure. This backup is commonly referred to as alternative positioning, navigation and timing (APNT). At the moment, several APNT solutions are being considered. One possible solution is to intensify the use of the DME system by increasing the density of the DME stations. However, this solution has some major disadvantages. First, the additional infrastructure might involve costly installation. Moreover, large portion of the L-band spectrum will be assigned to an old and spectrally inefficient technology. This gives difficulty for the frequency allocation of the mid- and long-term future communications in L-band. To support efficient spectrum usage, we propose to consider the future communication system LDACS 1 as APNT solution. LDACS 1 is a ground-based cellular communications system. Using ground stations (GS) as pseudolites, an airplane can exploit trilateration to estimate its position. The LDACS 1 system is not optimized for ranging, yet it can be well exploited for navigation with only a few minor modifications. The deployment of LDACS 1 GSs is planned for the future aeronautical communication systems and no additional infrastructure is needed for enabling navigational functionality. The LDACS 1 system is also planned to be able to work in parallel with DME, and therefore it is possible to combine the range calculation from both systems in the situations where not a sufficient number of LDACS 1 stations is visible. To assess the usability of the LDACS 1 system as APNT solution, two measurement campaigns were conducted by DLR in November 2012 and 2013. The analysis of the measurement data gave the conclusion that LDACS 1 signals offer an excellent ranging source. However, the results also indicate that multipath propagation can have a significant impact to the ranging performance, especially at low altitudes [1]. With the signal bandwidth of 500 kHz, the multipath in the range of few hundreds of meters are not easily resolvable. It is well-known that in such situation the ranging performance of the conventional correlation-based technique such as delayed lock loop (DLL) are largely biased. Unresolvable multipath environments cannot be easily avoided and would be a major problem for any low bandwidth ground-based APNT solutions (DME, LDACS 1). Multipath mitigation is a very challenging task as the propagation channel is dynamic with the number of paths varies with time. A new algorithm that can perform robust range estimation under such dynamic multipath channels is needed to ensure good accuracy and integrity of the LDACS 1 -based APNT system. One of the considered algorithms for multipath mitigation in LDACS 1 -based APNT is particle filtering, which is a variant of sequential Bayesian filter implemented by Monte Carlo methods. For this algorithm, the underlying process model can be non-linear/non-Gaussian and is especially designed for dynamic channel conditions. The parameters estimation is based on a posterior density, and it uses a movement model to incorporate the temporal correlation of the change of the estimated parameters. It was demonstrated in [2] that this method can be efficiently used for the pseudo-range estimation of LOS component in dense and dynamic multipath environments in the GNSS receiver platform. The algorithm can correct the range error bias introduced by unresolvable multipath and give a much better ranging performance compared to the conventional DLL receiver. The fundamental drawback of the particle filtering is the complexity but it has been shown in [2] that the computation effort can be reduced greatly through the use of two-fold Bayesian filtering methods involving Kalman filter, Grid-based method and the particle filter. Here we propose to exploit this technique for LDACS 1 ranging applications and demonstrate the algorithm performance on measured signals. The final paper starts with a brief description of the LDACS 1 signal model, measurement campaign setup and the channel conditions. The detailed descriptions of the applied algorithm based on sequential Bayesian filtering and the application in the LDACS 1 platform are then discussed. The analysis of the measurement data is focused on the dynamic multipath scenarios. Finally the obtained results and the future investigation directions are discussed...|$|E

To support sustainable spectrum usage, we propose to consider the future communication system LDACS 1 as APNT solution. To verify the practical ability of LDACS 1 to act as APNT system for GNSS backup, DLR has carried out a measurement campaign in November 2012. The goal of the campaign is to examine whether LDACS 1 is capable to deliver ranging/positioning results with sufficient accuracy as required for APNT. For the measurements, four LDACS 1 ground stations were set up in a quadrangular shape about 40 kilometers apart from each other and used as transmitters. A Dassault Falcon 20 aircraft with respective onboard equipment served as receiver. Several patterns were flown within the test area at several altitudes. This allows an evaluation of the systems performance for various real world geometries. According to the Cramer-Rao lower bound the nominal LDACS 1 transmit power 43 dBm should deliver reliable and precise navigation for the aircraft. Nevertheless in any real measurement different error sources exist. Therefore, the main question of the campaign is, how much the performance is degraded due to those various error sources. Firstly, the requirement of synchronization accuracy in the range of nanoseconds in order to avoid concealment of measurement errors put hard constraints on the synchronization setup of the four ground stations. Thus, the station setup included oven-controlled Rubidium clocks at the stations as well as dual frequency GNSS timing receivers, the latter serving to monitor those clocks. The setup of each station was calibrated individually to mitigate the effect of hardware biases affecting synchronization performance. Application of a common-view time transfer technique independent of the GNSS receiver's position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution allows an analysis of the clock biases and drifts up to nanosecond level. Secondly, the typical challenges known from GNSS systems exist, e. g. multipath resolution or interference from other systems like the onboard DME. In particular, the LDACS 1 bandwidth of 500 kHz makes the resolution of close multi-paths challenging. The analysis so far gives very promising results. With the four stations visible from the aircraft the LDACS 1 system offers a performance considerably better than DME systems in almost all cases. However, under certain conditions, and without applying appropriate countermeasures, the performance may be degraded, e. g. in cases of strong interference or strong multipath situations. The final paper starts with a brief review of the LDACS 1 system. This is followed by a description of the measurement campaign setup, including the specific challenges which had to be solved to conduct the campaign. Hereby, a detailed analysis of the different error sources and their influence on the performance of the measurement system is given. This includes errors due to clock synchronization and unknown hardware delays. In addition, the error sources which would impair the ranging performance also in an operational system are assessed, like Doppler effects, multipath propagation, and interference from onboard systems. Taking those error sources into consideration information on both positioning precision as well as integrity is presented. This includes a discussion of the employed algorithms and methods. The paper concludes with an outlook on future work to be conducted in the field of LDACS 1 navigation...|$|E
