40|$|Dynamic {{behaviour}} of <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> {{systems with}} uncertain properties is comprehensively studied. Prediction {{of the dynamic}} responses of a bridge excited by moving vehicles {{is crucial to the}} bridge design as the deterioration and reduction in long-term serviceability of a bridge are mainly caused by its vibration. It is vital to provide insight into the influences of unavoidable uncertainties of system parameters on the dynamic behaviour of vehicle-bridge coupling systems which are commonplace in structural engineering. This thesis aims to develop a rational non-deterministic framework for dynamic analysis of <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> systems including the uncertainties in all the system parameters. Probabilistic analyses are firstly implemented to calculate the statistical moments of bridge responses considering all the system parameters as random variables. Random variable functional moment method, combined with modal analysis, is extended to develop the expressions for calculating the mean value and variance of bridge dynamic response. Non-probabilistic approaches are also proposed to account for the uncertainties in the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> systems when sufficient statistical data are unavailable. Interval operations, Taylor expansions and perturbation theory are integrated to analyse the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> dynamic problems with predefined small intervals of system parameters. Mathematical formulations are formed for the midpoint value, interval width, lower and upper bounds of interval bridge dynamic response. A novel particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to capture the extreme values of bridge responses regardless of the interval width of system parameters. Finally, the hybrid probabilistic and non-probabilistic analysis are introduced into the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> dynamic system when a mixture of random and interval uncertainties in the system is present. The random interval perturbation method and random interval moment method are incorporated in the implementations to obtain the intervals of the first two statistical moments of bridge response. Investigations into the effects of the individual system parameter on the bridge response are carried out extensively. The effectiveness and accuracy of the presented approaches are demonstrated through comparisons with reference methods. The reported work will assist engineers to perform the cost effective design and assessment of non-deterministic dynamic response of <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> systems with uncertain properties...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on energy}} approach, the {{equations}} of motion in matrix form for the railway freight <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> system are derived, in which the dynamic contact forces between vehicle and bridge are considered as internal forces. The freight vehicle is modelled as a multi-rigid-body system, which comprises one car body, two bogie frames and four wheelsets. The bogie frame is linked with the car body through spring-dashpot suspension systems, and the bogie frame is rigidly linked with wheelsets. The bridge deck, together with railway track resting on bridge, is modelled as a simply supported Bernoulli-Euler beam and its deflection is described by superimposing modes. The direct time integration method is applied to obtain the dynamic response of the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> system at each time step. A computer program has been developed for analyzing this system. The correctness of the proposed procedure is confirmed by one numerical example. The effect of different beam mode numbers and various surface irregularities of beam on the dynamic responses of the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> system are investigated...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} for the most common classes of vehicle such as the 5 -axle articulated truck. However, the dynamic response of bridges {{to this type of}} trucks is quite different to the response to the vehicles more likely to feature in maximum-in-lifetime traffic loading events. This paper focuses on large (> 100 tonne) cranes and crane-type vehicles that have been recorded at Weigh-in-Motion sites in Europe. This paper analyses the total bending moment due to these vehicles on short to medium span bridges and compare them to 5 - axle articulated trucks. To account for the variability in vehicle characteristics, more than 40, 000 <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> events are computed using Monte Carlo simulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>vehicle-bridge</b> dynamic <b>interaction</b> system under {{articulated}} high speed trains is studied in this paper. A dynamic interaction {{model of the}} bridge-articulated train system is established, which is composed of an articulated vehicle element model and a finite element bridge model. The vehicle model is established according to the structure and suspending properties of the articulated vehicles. A computer simulation program is worked out. As an example, {{the case of the}} Thalys articulated train passing along the Antoing Bridge on the Paris-Brussels high speed railway line is analyzed. The dynamic responses of the bridge and the vehicles are calculated. The proposed analysis model and the solution method are verified through the comparison between the calculated results and the in situ measured data. The vibration behaviour of the articulated trains is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an analytical {{approach to the}} problem of <b>vehicle-bridge</b> dynamic <b>interaction.</b> Starting from early studies based on a simply supported beam interacting with a lumped mass moving at constant speed, in recent years researchers have improved the models of both the bridge and the vehicle. On this basis, the bridge is modelled here as a multi-span continuous isotropic plate; its response to external loads is defined by applying the mode superposition principle and takes into account both flexural and torsional mode shapes, the latter being usually neglected in the literature. The plate is considered proportionally damped and its modes are computed by means of the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The scheme adopted for the vehicle consists of a seven degrees-of-freedom system moving at constant speed over the isotropic rough bridge surface. The numerical investigation, based on these analytical models, refers to a three-span bridge and includes the importance of torsional mode shapes, of road surface irregularities and of vehicle speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of characteristic bridge load {{effect is a}} complex problem. Usually, statistical extrapolation of simulated static load effects is used to derive a lifetime characteristic static load effect. However, when a vehicle crosses a bridge, dynamic interaction occurs which often causes a greater total load effect. This total load effect {{is related to the}} static load effect through a dynamic amplification factor (DAF). Specifications often recommend a conservative level for DAF, based on bridge length, number of lanes, and type of load effect only. Therefore significant improvements in the accuracy of this calculation are possible if a DAF, specific to the considered bridge, is applied. In this paper, the authors develop a novel method that considers site-specific bridge and traffic load conditions and allows for the reduced probability of both high static loading and high dynamic interaction occurring simultaneously. This approach utilises multivariate extreme value theory, in conjunction with static simulations and finite element <b>vehicle-bridge</b> dynamic <b>interaction</b> models. It is found that the dynamic allowance for the sample bridge and traffic considered, is significantly less than recommended by bridge codes. This finding can have significant implications for the assessment of existing bridge stock...|$|R
40|$|Bridge {{parameter}} identification based on <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> theory and da-ta {{extracted from the}} vehicle response has many potential applications. However, its real ap-plication is restricted, {{partly due to the}} bridge surface roughness, which can significantly contaminate the vehicle response data and make {{parameter identification}} hard or even im-possible. If the bridge surface roughness can be detected with satisfactory accuracy, then it is possible to eliminate its uncertain effect on the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction,</b> which will facili-tate more accurate identification. This study aims to provide a way to estimate the surface roughness profile of a bridge using the acceleration data gathered from a vehicle running on the bridge twice with different masses. The mass-spring-damper model is used to simulate the moving vehicle. Finite element simulation results show that this method is able to estimate the surface roughness profile accurately...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{to carry out}} monitoring of transport infrastructure such as pavements and bridges through the analysis of vehicle accelerations. An algorithm is developed for the identification of dynamic <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> forces using the vehicle response. Moving force identification theory is applied to a vehicle model {{in order to identify}} these dynamic forces between the vehicle and the road and/or bridge. A coupled half-car <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> model is used in theoretical simulations to test the effectiveness of the approach in identifying the forces. The potential of the method to identify the global bending stiffness of the bridge and to predict the pavement roughness is presented. The method is tested for a range of bridge spans using theoretical simulations and the influences of road roughness and signal noise on the accuracy of the results are investigated...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} damage {{detection}} of a simply supported concrete bridge structure in time domain is presented using the interaction {{forces from the}} moving vehicles as excitation. The vehicular loads are modeled {{as a group of}} <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> forces moving at a prescribed velocity, and the bridge is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam simply supported at both ends. A damage function is used to simulate the crack damage in the reinforced concrete beam. The <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> forces and the structural damage in the bridge deck are identified from the measured responses in sequence of iteration without prior knowledge of the moving loads. The effects of parameters of the vehicle-bridge system and measurement noise on the damage detection result are studied Simulation results show that the method is effective and noise insensitive to damage detection in the concrete bridge structure under moving vehicular loads.

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of <b>vehicle-bridge</b> dynamic <b>interaction</b> in time domain, the Authors {{proposed}} an uncoupled formulation of the equations of motion, that retains a sufficient generality in modelling the subsystems, and includes the effects of the pavement roughness. Based on this formulation, two iterative procedures were developed and coded, differing in the iteration scheme. The first one analyses separately the two sub-systems over the whole time history (WTH) and relies on a general purpose FE code for the structure. The second one analyses the two sub-systems {{at the same time and}} within the same code. Iteration is performed on each single time step (STS), according to a predictor-corrector scheme implemented in an ad-hoc code. Aim of this work is to investigate the stability properties of the iterative numerical methods, according to classical techniques: a general stability condition for procedure WTH is obtained, and then analysed more in detail for the case of a beam travelled by an oscillator. The analytical results obtained in the 2 D case suggest the detection of an instability example for the 3 D procedure, that is anyway outside of the range of interest of the model parameters. Preliminary studies show that the stability condition for procedure STS could present similar properties...|$|R
40|$|Underspanned {{suspension}} bridges are structures {{with important}} economical and aesthetic advantages, {{due to their}} high structural efficiency. However, road bridges of this typology are still uncommon because of limited knowledge about this structural system. In particular, there remains some uncertainty over the dynamic behaviour of these bridges, due to their extreme lightness. The vibrations produced by vehicles crossing the viaduct {{are one of the}} main concerns. In this work, traffic-induced dynamic effects on this kind of viaduct are addressed by means of <b>vehicle-bridge</b> dynamic <b>interaction</b> models. A finite element method is used for the structure, and multibody dynamic models for the vehicles, while interaction is represented by means of the penalty method. Road roughness is included in this model {{in such a way that}} the fact that profiles under left and right tyres are different, but not independent, is taken into account. In addition, free software {PRPgenerator) to generate these profiles is presented in this paper. The structural dynamic sensitivity of underspanned suspension bridges was found to be considerable, as well as the dynamic amplification factors and deck accelerations. It was also found that vehicle speed has a relevant influence on the results. In addition, the impact of bridge deformation on vehicle vibration was addressed, and the effect on the comfort of vehicle users was shown to be negligible...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises the {{developments}} in the dynamic response of bridges to traffic loading based on {{a large amount of}} simulations and field tests carried out within the 6 th EU framework ARCHES (2006 - 2009). When assessing the total traffic load effect on a bridge, there is a number of alternatives to characterise the associated dynamic component depending on the information available to the engineer. The simplest approach is to adopt the conservative values provided in bridge codes covering for many uncertainties. Nevertheless, if bridge drawings, bridge properties, updated weigh-in-motion data and road profile were known, then validated <b>vehicle-bridge</b> finite element <b>interaction</b> models can be used to reduce these uncertainties. Dynamic allowance can also be experimentally derived from measured total load effects using modern bridge weigh-in-motion technology. Guidelines are provided on how to obtain a site-specific value of dynamic allowance, both numerically and experimentally...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the self-excited vibration problems of maglev <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> system which greatly degrades {{the stability of}} the levitation control, decreases the ride comfort, and restricts the cost of the whole system. Firstly, two levitation models with different complexity are developed, and the comparison of the energy curves associated with the two models is carried out. We conclude that the interaction model with a single levitation control unit is sufficient {{for the study of the}} self-excited vibration. Then, the principle underlying the self-excited vibration is explored from the standpoint of work acting on the bridge done by the levitation system. Furthermore, the influences of the parameters, including the modal frequency and modal damping of bridge, the gain of the controller, the sprung mass, and the unsprung mass, on {{the stability of the}} interaction system are carried out. The study provides a theoretical guidance for solving the self-excited vibration problems of the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> systems...|$|E

Different vehicle models with varying degrees of sophistication are presented to reproduce more accurately the effects of a train crossing a bridge.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} {{the application of the}} spatial system of finite element modeling for the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> on reinforced concrete US Girder Bridge in order to obtain the effect of surface roughness. Single vehicle and multiple vehicles on reinforced concrete T beam bridge were studied with variable surface roughness profiles. The effects of six different surface roughness profiles (very good, good, measured, average, poor, and very poor) were investigated for <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction.</b> The values of the Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) were obtained for single and multiple vehicles on T Beam Bridge for different surface roughness profiles, along with the distances between the axles of heavy vehicle. It was observed that when the bridge has very good, good, measured, and average surface roughness, the DAF values for the single vehicle over the bridge were observed to be within acceptable limits specified by AASHTO. However, for the bridge with multiple vehicles only very good and measured surface roughness profiles showed a DAF and vehicle axle distances within the acceptable limits. From the current studies, it was observed that the spatial system showed reliable responses for predicting the behavior of the bridge under variable road surface roughness conditions and was reliable in vehicle axle detection, and therefore, it has a potential to be use for realistic simulations...|$|E
40|$|Empirical mode {{decomposition}} (EMD)  is used to {{detect and}} locate damage in a bridge using its acceleration {{response to the}} crossing of a vehicle. EMD is a technique that converts the measured signal {{into a number of}} basic functions that make up the original signal. These functions are obtained purely from the original signal in a sequential procedure, where lower order basic functions contain a range of high frequency components of the signal and higher order basic functions contain the low frequency components. Damage is identified through a distinctive peak in the decomposed signal resulting from applying EMD. Recent studies have shown the potential of this tool to detect single and multiple damages when using the response of a one-dimensional beam model to the crossing of a constant load. In this paper, the technique is further developed using simulations from a quarter-car <b>vehicle-bridge</b> dynamic <b>interaction</b> finite element model. The vehicle model is composed of mass elements, which represent the tyre and body masses, and stiffness and damping elements, which represent tyre and suspension systems. The bridge deck is modelled using plate elements with typical properties found on site and the road profile is generated stochastically from power spectral density functions based on ISO standard guidelines. Different levels of damage are simulated as localised losses of stiffness at random locations within the bridge and a number of longitudinal and transverse locations are used as observation points. The ability of the EMD algorithm to detect damage is analysed for a variety of scenarios including two vehicle configurations (light and heavy), a range of speeds between 5 and 15 m/s, and smooth and rough road surfaces. The influence of the distance from the simulated acceleration points to the damage locations, on the accuracy of the predicted damage, is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{based on}} theoretical simulations {{has shown the}} potential of the wavelet transform to detect damage in a beam by analysing the time-deflection response due to a constant moving load. However, its application to identify damage from the response of a bridge to a vehicle raises a number of questions. Firstly, {{it may be difficult to}} record the difference in the deflection signal between a healthy and a slightly damaged structure to the required level of accuracy and high scanning frequencies in the field. Secondly, the bridge is going to have a road profile and it will be loaded by a sprung vehicle and time-varying forces rather than a constant load. Therefore, an algorithm based on a plot of wavelet coefficients versus time to detect damage (a singularity in the plot) appears to be very sensitive to noise. This paper addresses these questions by: (a) using the acceleration signal, instead of the deflection signal, (b) employing a <b>vehicle-bridge</b> finite element <b>interaction</b> model, and (c) developing a novel wavelet-based approach using wavelet energy content at each bridge section, which proves to be more sensitive to damage than a wavelet coefficient line plot at a given scale as employed by others. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} for engineers and designers {{to be able to}} accurately estimate the damping within a structure; however, this is not a trivial task. Simplifications are often made {{in an effort to make}} damping estimation easier, but these simplifications rely on assumptions that may not be universally true. One important assumption is that the excitation input for a structure may be modeled as broad-band noise, but traffic loading on a bridge likely violates that assumption. Traffic loads are characterized by the velocities of the vehicles and trains crossing the bridge, which gives the input specific frequency content. This added complexity increases the difficulty in accurately estimating the damping. The problem of traffic crossing a bridge was studied by creating a finite element model of a bridge using a beam system that consisted of a series of stringers resting on top of a larger girder. Traffic loads were then simulated using moving point loads and moving masses to represent cars and trains crossing the bridge. In addition to the traffic loading case, an ambient loading case was conducted using uniform broad-band noise as a means of comparison. The accelerations at several locations along the bridge span were recorded and used as input for a variety of operational modal analysis (OMA) methods. The OMA methods included both frequency domain techniques, such as Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD), and time domain based identification, such as blind source separation (BSS). The results from the various OMA methods demonstrated how traffic loading creates distortion in the frequency response spectra of the bridge. This distortion had adverse effects for damping ratio estimation and in certain cases led to extreme errors. The mode shape estimates were not found to be affected by the distortion, but that meant that mode shape estimates could not be used to identify potentially erroneous damping estimates. The cause for the distortion was later identified as the driving frequencies produced by the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interactions.</b> The term ``driving frequency'' refers to the frequency created by a car traveling over a bridge or, by analogy, by a moving load traveling over a beam. This frequency is directly correlated with the speed of the vehicle and the length of the bridge. By considering a single moving point load traveling across the bridge, the responses of the stringers and girder were studied and the effects of the driving frequencies were better quantified in both the time and frequency domains. It was found that peaks in frequency domain appear at the even multiples of each car's driving frequency, and as more cars travel across the bridge the peaks of closely spaced driving frequency multiples begin to merge. As the number of cars increases to a full hour-long simulation and the car velocities become uniformly distributed over a given interval, numerous peaks merge together to form sustained regions of elevated energy in the frequency domain. These regions distort the frequency response spectra of the bridge and obscure the modal information. In order to deal with these distorted regions, a new approach to modal identification was proposed that focused on using partial information from the modal peaks. The peaks in the frequency domain were divided into left- and right-side spectra in order to take advantage of any undistorted portions of the modal peaks. These side spectra were analyzed using a curve-fitting approach based on combining optimization methods with clustering analysis. The presence of distortion presented certain challenges to traditional curve-fitting approaches, such as polynomial least squares, but the optimization algorithm was able to overcome these issues while also adding efficiency to the curve-fitting process. The clustering analysis was used to quickly find the optimal subsets within the optimization-based curve-fitting results. By performing curve-fitting to side spectra, different sets of modal parameters were produced that fit each side. It was found that the modal parameters for the intact or undistorted side compared favorably with the true modal parameters. While this optimization and clustering methodology could not account for all types of distortion, it demonstrated large improvements as compared to traditional OMA approaches for the modes most severely impacted by the distortion. Another potential benefit of this method is that the distributions within the final clusters could be used to provide ranges of possible values for the damping ratios instead of only a single value...|$|R

The pseudo excitation method (PEM) is extended to handle the random analysis of time-dependent vehicle–bridge systems, for which the statistical characteristics of dynamic responses are computed. A <b>vehicle–bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> element is adopted to reduce the computational effort. In the numerical examples, the proposed method is justified by comparing with Monte Carlo simulation results. Also, a method to estimate maximum responses is suggested.

40|$|Bridge codes adopt {{values for}} dynamic {{allowance}} in traffic load models that are necessarily conservative {{to cover for}} an entire range of bridges with different mechanical characteristics, boundary conditions, and {{the large number of}} uncertainties associated to the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> problem. A further level of conservatism occurs due to the independent manner in which the governing static load and the corresponding allowance for dynamics are specified. In particular, certain bridges are not susceptible to high levels of <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> when loaded by a critically heavy vehicle or a critical combination of vehicles. Recent advances in Bridge Weigh-In-Motion technology allow not only to collect information on the weights, spacings and speeds of the traffic loads traversing a bridge, but also to separate the maximum static strain from the total measured strain using a filtering procedure. In this paper, maximum static and total load effects are collected and analysed for three different sites as part of the European project ARCHES (6 th RTD framework programme). Bridge measurements are used to discuss the dynamics of the most frequent truck classes and the entire traffic sample. The measurements reveal a decrease in percentage increment in dynamics and a reduction on the variability of the dynamic increment as the static load effect increases. This phenomenon can be of particular relevance in the assessment of the dynamics of extreme loading cases...|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} driving over {{a bridge}} create a complex dynamic {{phenomenon known as}} <b>vehicle–bridge</b> <b>interaction.</b> In recent years, interest in <b>vehicle–bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> has grown because {{a deeper understanding of}} the phenomena can lead to improvements in bridge design methods while enhancing the accuracy of structural health monitoring techniques. The mobility of wireless sensors can be leveraged to directly monitor the dynamic coupling between the moving vehicle and the bridge. In this study, a mobile wireless sensor network is proposed for installation on a heavy truck to capture the vertical acceleration, horizontal acceleration and gyroscopic pitching of the truck as it crosses a bridge. The vehicle-based wireless monitoring system is designed to interact with a static, permanent wireless monitoring system installed on the bridge. Specifically, the mobile wireless sensors time-synchronize with the bridge's wireless sensors before transferring the vehicle response data. Vertical acceleration and gyroscopic pitching measurements of the vehicle are combined with bridge accelerations to create a time-synchronized vehicle–bridge response dataset. In addition to observing the vehicle vibrations, Kalman filtering is adopted to accurately track the vehicle position using the measured horizontal acceleration of the vehicle and positioning information derived from piezoelectric strip sensors installed on the bridge deck as part of the bridge monitoring system. Using the Geumdang Bridge (Korea), extensive field testing of the proposed vehicle–bridge wireless monitoring system is conducted. Experimental results verify the reliability of the wireless system and the accuracy of the vehicle positioning algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} heavy traffic {{together}} with aggressive environmental loads {{poses a threat}} to the safety of an aging bridge stock. Often, damage is only detected via visual inspection at a point when repairing costs can be quite significant. Ideally, bridge managers would want to identify a stiffness change as soon as possible, i. e., as it is occurring, to plan for prompt measures before reaching a prohibitive cost. Recent developments in signal processing techniques such as wavelet analysis and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) have aimed to address this need by identifying a stiffness change from a localised feature in the structural response to traffic. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is limited by the roughness of the road profile, the vehicle speed and the noise level. In this paper, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is applied by the first time to the acceleration response of a bridge model to a moving load with the purpose of capturing sudden stiffness changes. EEMD is more adaptive and appears to be better suited to non-linear signals than wavelets, and it reduces the mode mixing problem present in EMD. EEMD is tested in a variety of theoretical 3 D <b>vehicle–bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> scenarios. Stiffness changes are successfully identified, even for small affected regions, relatively poor profiles, high vehicle speeds and significant noise. The latter is due to the ability of EEMD to separate high frequency components associated to sudden stiffness changes from other frequency components associated to the <b>vehicle–bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> system...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the running safety of railway vehicles on viaducts subject to strong lateral actions such as cross winds requires coupled nonlinear <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> models, capable to study extreme events. In this paper original models developed by the authors are described, based on finite elements for the structure, multibody and finite element models for the vehicle, and specially developed interaction elements for the interface between wheel and rail. The models have been implemented within ABAQUS and have full nonlinear capabilities for the structure, the vehicle and the contact interface. An application is developed for the Ulla Viaduct, a 105 m tall arch in the Spanish high-speed railway network. The dynamic analyses allow obtaining critical wind curves, which define the running safety conditions for a given train in terms of speed of circulation and wind spee...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} {{intended}} to develop an analytical approach to simulate the coupled vibration of bridges and running vehicles, and to investigate the dynamic characteristics of rationalized curved bridges. In this paper, a curved twin Igirder bridge with general cross-section is adopted for the analysis. As a preliminary step, a general large dump truck with one axis at front and two axes at rear is modeled as a sprung-mass system with 2 -degree-of-freedom for the <b>vehicle-bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> analysis. The coupled vibration of the interaction system is formulized and a computer program is developed. Eigenvalue analyses are carried out for different types of bridges to find acceptable torsional stiffness. The coupled vibration of the running vehicle and the bridge is simulated using the developed analytical approach, based on which the dynamic responses of the curved bridge are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} numerically how the natural {{frequencies}} of a bridge change during the crossing of a vehicle. An Euler-Bernoulli beam is modelled traversed {{by a single}} DOF vehicle. The use of such a simple <b>Vehicle-Bridge</b> <b>interaction</b> model is justified by the objective of providing insight into the structural dynamics of a moving load interacting with a bridge. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} variations in natural frequencies depend greatly on vehicle-to-structure frequency ratio and mass ratio. In some conditions, significant variations in modal properties are observed. Additionally, it can be analysed from the passing vehicle response. Time-frequency signal analysis of the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s vertical acceleration clearly shows how the frequencies evolve during the event. The frequency localization properties of the Wavelet transform (Modified Littlewood-Paley) are exploited in analysing the signal and highlighting the relevant results...|$|E
