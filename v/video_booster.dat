40|$|In this paper, {{exposure}} of a cameraman to the electromagnetic emissions from a standard wireless digital camera are studied. Two typical operating conditions, namely the camera {{leaned on the}} operator's shoulder or held {{up in front of}} the groin, are analyzed. The obtained results show that power absorption inside the cameraman body, in terms of specific absorption rate (SAR), is well below the limit for both occupational and general public exposure currently issued by European regulations. However, if a <b>video</b> <b>booster</b> unit is added to the camera, European SAR restrictions for general public exposure might be exceeded...|$|E
5000|$|After {{placing the}} CRS-8 cargo {{on its way}} to the International Space Station, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket {{conducted}} an experimental boostback and re-entry maneuver over the Atlantic Ocean. Nine minutes after liftoff, at 20:52:10 UTC, the booster landed vertically on the autonomous spaceport drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, 300 km from the Florida coastline, achieving a long-sought-after milestone for the SpaceX reusable launch system development program. [...] The <b>video</b> of the <b>booster</b> landing shows one of the legs outside of the bull's eye's outer circle.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{pediatric}} occupant postures {{can help}} researchers indentify injury risk factors, and provide information for prospective injury prediction. This {{study sought to}} observe lateral head positions and shoulder belt fit among older child automobile occupants during a scenario {{likely to result in}} sleeping - extended travel during the night. An observational, volunteer, in-transit study was performed with 30 pediatric rear-seat passengers, ages 7 to 14. Each was restrained by a three-point seatbelt and was driven for seventy-five minutes at night. Ten subjects used a high-back booster seat, ten used a low-back booster seat, and ten used none (based on the subject height and weight). The subjects were recorded with a low-light video camera, and one frame was analyzed per each minute of <b>video.</b> The high-back <b>booster</b> group exhibited a statistically significant (p< 0. 05) decrease in the mean frequency of poor shoulder belt fit compared to the no-booster and low-back booster groups. The high-back booster group also exhibited statistically significant decreases in the 90 th percentile of the absolute value of the relative lateral motion of the head. The low-back booster group did not result in statistically significant decreases in poor shoulder belt fit or lateral head motion compared to the no-booster group. These results are consistent with the presence of large lateral supports of the high-back booster which provided support to the head while sleeping, reducing voluntary lateral occupant motion and improving shoulder belt fit. Future work includes examining lap belt fit in-transit, and examining the effects of these observations on predicted injury risk...|$|R

Investiguei sua inserÃÃo e participaÃÃo nos grupos de produÃÃo, associaÃÃes, como elemento de construÃÃo de novos modos de organizaÃÃo, alicerÃados no trabalho coletivo, cooperado e na autogestÃo. Procurei desvelar nÃo apenas as perspectivas de trabalho e significados atribuÃdos a esse trabalho pelos jovens, mas mediante sua forma de organizaÃÃo e produÃÃo, busquei identificar elementos produzidos nessas experiÃncias que contribuÃssem para uma produÃÃo social maior â os saberes e aprendizados significativos na luta das camadas populares, numa perspectiva de contra-cultura, de EducaÃÃo Popular. O caminho percorrido para elaboraÃÃo desse estudo situa-se na unidade entre diÃlogo, reflexÃo e aprofundamento teÃrico, numa perspectiva metodolÃgica de inserÃÃo nos grupos, observaÃÃo participante, aplicaÃÃo de questionÃrios, entrevistas e grupos de discussÃo e, ainda, a utilizaÃÃo da fotografia, da mÃsica e do vÃdeo como elementos impulsionadores de expressÃo da subjetividade. Esse caminhar da pesquisa funda-se numa perspectiva teÃrico-metodolÃgica do tipo etnogrÃfico, que enfatiza a tentativa de compreensÃo dos elementos que formam o universo cultural, conceitual dos participantes. Os achados revelam que esses grupos, produtores de contra-cultura, situam-se num patamar de exploraÃÃo e reproduÃÃo capitalista pela interaÃÃo com o mercado organizado por esse sistema, mas ao mesmo tempo colaboram na produÃÃo de saberes que, aliados a uma organizaÃÃo e sistematizaÃÃo tÃcnico-cientÃfica, pela interaÃÃo teÃrico-prÃtica pode contribuir na esfera da contra-hegemonia. This {{study it}} gives to life to youth, {{understanding}} this segment as social actors and, therefore, {{able to act}} in the space to transform it. I investigated its insertion and participation in the groups of production, associations, as element of construction in new ways of organization, based in the collective work, cooperated and in the self management. I looked for to reveal not only the perspectives of work and meanings attributed to this work for the young, but by means of its form of organization and production, I searched to identify elements produced in these experiences that contributed for a bigger social production â the knowledge and significant learningâs in fight of the popular layers, in a perspective of opposed-culture, Popular Education. The way covered for elaboration of this study is placed in the unit between dialogue, reflection and theoretical deepening, in a methodological perspective of insertion in the groups, participant observation, application of questionnaires, interviews and discussion groups and, still, the use of the photograph, music and <b>video</b> as elements <b>boosters</b> of expression of the subjectivity. This research way itâs based in a perspective theoretician-methodological of ethnographic type, that emphasizes the attempt of comprehension of the elements that they form the cultural and conceptual universe of the participants. The findings reveal that these groups, producers of against-culture, are placed in a platform of exploration and capitalist reproduction for the interaction with the market organized for this system, {{but at the same time}} collaborates in the production to knowledge that, allies to an organization and technician-scientific systematization, for the interaction theoretician-practical it can contribute in the sphere of the against-hegemony...|$|R
