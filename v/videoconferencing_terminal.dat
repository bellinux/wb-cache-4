40|$|A {{configurable}} architecture for {{a low-cost}} <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>terminal</b> usable on an ATM network {{has been developed}} which provides {{a high degree of}} performance in a modular manner. Considerable research has been conducted in order to provide support for the loss of any compressed Video which is transferred between such terminals. This work enables lost video to be concealed using a simple processing algorithm operating only on the received data. Additional features, such as multiparty conferencing support, can be added if required to adapt the terminal to both the users' needs and the underlying network capabilities. An example terminal was designed and built to demonstrate the architecture. This was based on a PC with additional hardware support for video and networking functions...|$|E

The {{analysis of the}} frame-size autocorrelation function of extensive video data that were gathered during realistic experiments with two popular <b>videoconference</b> <b>terminals</b> (currently the only supporting the H. 264 encoder) suggested that H. 264 videoconference traffic is fully uncorrelated {{as a consequence of}} the constrained (in the loop) operation mode of the encoders. By using this fact and by statistically analyzing the sampled frame-size histogram, we conclude that H. 264 traffic can be reasonably represented by a D/G / ï¿½ queue with deterministic arrivals according to the video frame rate and service times that can be fitted by a histogram-based model proposed on a previous study...|$|R
40|$|In this manuscript, {{methods for}} {{modelling}} and parameter assessment of unconstrained and constrained videoconference traffic are proposed. In {{the case of}} unconstrained traffic the encoder operates in an independent of the network mode (open-loop) while in constrained traffic the encoder has knowledge of the networking constrains and operates using rate-control algorithms (in the loop). The analysis of extensive data that were gathered during experiments with popular <b>videoconference</b> <b>terminals,</b> as well as, of traffic traces available in literature, suggested that while the unconstrained traffic traces exhibited high short-term correlations, the constrained counterpart patterns appeared to be mostly uncorrelated, in a percentage not affecting queueing. On {{the basis of these}} results, this study discusses methods for accurate modelling and analytical treatment of both types of traffic. Extensive model-based queuing results, in single-source and multiplexed environments, using continuous methods, compared to trace-driven results, confirm the validity of our modelling proposals...|$|R
40|$|While Network Coding {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied from a theoretical point of view, the number of practical implementations is still very limited. We have performed an actual demonstration of this technique in a real satellite network, where Network Coding was applied on the streams of a <b>videoconference</b> between two <b>terminals.</b> The design challenges are analyzed along with the main ideas that enabled the proposed protocol to achieve more than 90...|$|R
