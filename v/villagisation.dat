In short, rewards or collective punishments such as curfews could be served much more readily after <b>villagisation,</b> and this quickly broke Mau Mau's passive wing. Though there were degrees of difference between the villages, the overall conditions engendered by <b>villagisation</b> meant that, by early 1955, districts began reporting starvation and malnutrition.

50|$|The government's public {{relations}} officer, Granville Roberts, presented <b>villagisation</b> {{as a good}} opportunity for rehabilitation, particularly of women and children, but it was, in fact, first and foremost designed to break Mau Mau and protect loyalist Kikuyu, a fact reflected in the extremely limited resources {{made available to the}} Rehabilitation and Community Development Department. Refusal to move could be punished with the destruction of property and livestock, and the roofs were usually ripped off of homes whose occupants demonstrated reluctance. <b>Villagisation</b> also solved the practical and financial problems associated with a further, massive expansion of the Pipeline programme, and the removal of people from their land hugely assisted the enaction of Swynnerton Plan.|$|E

50|$|Operation Vijiji (Operation <b>Villagisation)</b> was an {{exercise}} in social engineering carried out in post-colonial Tanzania in 1973.

The means to this terminal end was originally suggested by the man brought in by the colonial government to an ethnopsychiatric 'diagnosis' of the uprising, JC Carothers: he advocated a Kenyan version of the <b>villagisation</b> programmes that the British were already using in places like Malaya.|$|E
5000|$|Extremely {{intensive}} {{social engineering}} campaigns occurred {{in countries with}} authoritarian governments. In the 1920s {{the government of the}} Soviet Union embarked on a campaign to fundamentally alter the behavior and ideals of Soviet citizens, to replace the old social frameworks of Tsarist Russia with a new Soviet culture, to create the New Soviet man. The Soviets used newspapers, books, film, mass relocations, and even architectural-design tactics to serve as a [...] "social condenser" [...] and to change personal values and private relationships. In a less positive manner, political executions (for example the Night of the Murdered Poets in Moscow in 1952), and arguably fear of becoming a victim of mass murder with the Mass killings under Communist regimes, played an influential role in the social engineering frameworks in Soviet Russia. Similar examples include the Chinese [...] "Great Leap Forward" [...] (1958-1961) and [...] "Cultural Revolution" [...] (1966-1976) programs and the Khmer Rouge's deurbanization of Cambodia (1975-1979). In Singapore, the government's housing policies attempt to promote a mix of all races within each subsidized housing district in order to foster social cohesion and national loyalty while providing citizens with affordable housing. In Tanzania in the 1970s, the government pursued a policy of enforced <b>villagisation</b> under Operation Vijiji in order to promote collective farming.|$|E
50|$|Farming {{practices}} towards tea and cloves {{had increased}} for subsistence farmers. By 1974 ujaama {{programs and the}} IDA (International Development Association) worked hand in hand; while <b>villagisation</b> organized new villages to farm, the IDA financed projects to educate farmers to grow alternate crops and granted loans to farmers with added credit to small farmers (Whitaker 206). For example, only 3 tons of tea had been produced in 1964 yet by 1975, 2,100 tons of tea was the net output of smallholder farmers mostly by Nyerere's policies have given the communal villages the opportunity to grow tea leaves despite {{the long history of}} tea being only grown in estates (208). Although these statistics come from the late 1970s, one may understand agricultural growth through reorganising traditional farms and investing into non-staple agriculture (especially through educating farmers how to grow tea and improve farming methods. One may look upon another example of Tanzanian government's extensive services in training farmers to grow tobacco and improve farming methods, which aided significantly in tobacco yields 41.9 million pounds in 1975-1976. By 1976, Tanzania became the third-largest tobacco cultivator in Africa (207). Therefore, when the Tanzanian government used extensive services in agriculture, they achieved positive results and crop yields' growth, especially in tea and tobacco smallholder farming whose prices are cheaper for Tanzanian villages to consume than purchase products within the cities.|$|E
40|$|<b>Villagisation</b> and {{large-scale}} agricultural investments in Gambella region {{has been a}} major concern of human right groups. The Ethiopian government argues that <b>Villagisation</b> program is voluntary and part of Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) which attempts to bring development to indigenous communities and nothing to do with large-scale agricultural investment. On the contrary, human right groups and local civil society organizations claim that the Ethiopian government is forcefully relocating indigenous people from their ancestral land under the disguise of development while the true motive of the government is to expand agricultural investment in the region {{at the expense of the}} livelihood of the local communities. This research is an attempt to investigate the controversial <b>Villagisation</b> {{and large-scale}} agricultural investment in Gambella regional state by looking into the link between large scale agricultural investment and <b>Villagisation.</b> The main focus of the research is to examine the impacts of agricultural investment and <b>Villagisation</b> in Gambella region the light of the Ethiopian government policy in the region and the alleged development induced human right violations. The research is based on a qualitative method to capture data from 32 <b>Villagisation</b> sites using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. For the purpose of this study, 241 participants were selected from the study sites to participate in the research. Out of the 241 participants 75 of them were participated in in-depth interviews and the rest were included in focus group discussions and informal discussions based on the participants’ knowledge, views, experience and feelings associated with <b>Villagisation</b> and large-scale agricultural investment in the region. The findings of this study show no indication of involuntary <b>Villagisation,</b> no significant relationship between <b>Villagisation</b> and investment, or no evidence of previously occupied land being leased to investors. However, the study reveals that there has been serious lack of communication and misinformation from the government side in the process of planning and implementing the <b>Villagisation</b> program. Owing to this, suspicion and lack of trust between government officials and the local communities characterized implementation of the <b>Villagisation</b> project. GeographyM. A. (Geography...|$|E

This political intervention is â€œunlockingâ€ and making the lowland resources accessible and extractable by the state, while a concomitant <b>villagisation</b> project is guaranteeing continued accumulation by disempowering the local population by making the community legible, governable, and controllable.

30|$|Livestock {{mobility}} is {{the principal}} means by which pastoralists cope with and {{take full advantage of}} natural resource variability in drylands (Scoones 1995, Behnke et al. 1993). Over the last two decades, scholars working with pastoral groups from both the northern and southern hemisphere have reported an almost universal decline in herd mobility, caused by a variety of factors ranging from the commoditisation of the pastoral economy to <b>villagisation</b> policies (cf. Fratkin 1997). Sedentarisation has been particularly influenced by declines in unfenced land available to pastoralists and their livestock after the widespread privatisation and enclosure of pastures for ranching, mechanised agriculture or conservation. Much of this change has been a consequence of the negative policy discourse surrounding pastoralism that often manifests in severely repressive rangeland policies designed to reform practices seen as irrational or environmentally destructive, whilst simultaneously improving economic productivity.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{investigate}} whether households relocated to governmentbuilt village settlements, as part of Rwanda’s <b>Villagisation</b> programme (‘Imidugudu’), diversify into non-farm income-generating activities {{to a greater extent}} than other rural households in Rwanda, and if so, to what extent the variation can be explained by differences in micro-level asset and meso-level access factors. Despite the programme objective to stimulate non-farm activity, the results of empirical estimations drawing on household and community-level data suggest that Imidugudu households differ surprisingly little from other rural households in terms of diversification into non-farm income sources. The slightly greater participation in non-farm income-generating activities observed among the Imidugudu households can be attributed to regional variation and household characteristics mattering for selection into the programme rather than to asset endowments and improved service access.

40|$|The present article {{explores the}} origin and changes in {{partnership}} agreements established between agro-industries and oil palm smallholders in Cameroon. The different forms of partnership which have existed {{over the years in}} the oil palm sector until now are assessed, notably the FONADER-sponsored smallholder scheme (1978 to 1991) and more recently the Afriland First Bank sponsored <b>villagisation</b> project of Socapalm Eseka (2007 / 2008 to present). Special attention is given to the factors and conditions that have influenced the outcomes of these partnerships, specifically the failure of the FONADER-sponsored smallholder scheme. The authors conclude that with the current absence of steady support from the government to oil palm smallholders, especially after the implementation of the structural adjustment plans, private partnership schemes between agro-industries and oil palm smallholders could be highly profitable for both stakeholders. Such partnerships can foster social cohesion and limit further encroachment of agro-industries into the primary forest, provided such partnership agreements are carefully planned and adequately implemented...|$|E
40|$|In late 1960 s {{and early}} 1970 s, {{progressive}} Ethiopians and international agencies urged Haile-Selassie’s Imperial government to introduced land reform and rural change and in 1974 the emperor was deposed and the Derg took power. Soon, the new régime, the Derg, promulgated a revolutionary land reform program. The land reform proclamation abolished all private ownership making all land common {{property of the}} Ethiopian people. Despite the wide spread of the resistance, the law was implemented in most part of the province. In 1980 ’s the Derg regime introduced <b>villagisation</b> and collectivization program {{in most parts of}} the country and that were unpopular and hence contributed for the fall of the regime. In 1996 to 1997, the second land reform in the province was made under the current government. Like the Derg, land property rights have remained vested in the state. In November 1996, the Regional Council of the Amhara National Regional State (ANRS) issued a proclamation of new land reform programme that has been hotly debated. However, despite the politico-economic and symbolic significance of arable land in the area under study, we have no scholarly work in the agrarian reform of Gojjam.

40|$|The {{building}} of a large multipurpose dam is planned at Stiegler’s Gorge on the Rufiji River (Tanzania). Both national and local authorities have strongly emphasised the flood control aspect of the dam as they see the Rufiji floods as a major constraint to development. Though {{it is true that}} the Rufiji River has a high flow variability at various timescales, the flood perception in local communities differs from this view. The floods, essential for the sustenance of floodplain fertility, and therefore of the farming system, and vital to the productivity of most of the natural resources on which local communities depend, are perceived as a blessing, whilst droughts and the absence of regular flooding are perceived as the main threat. Historically, most of the food shortages in Rufiji District are associated with drought years and the myth of “the flood as a plague” emerged only in the late 1960 s during the Ujamaa <b>villagisation</b> policy. The persistence of this myth is favoured by the inadequate assessment of the complexity of the local economies by the District technical staff. This difference in perception of the flood has major implications for development options. Under the current dam design, the alteration of the flooding pattern would have negative consequences for the downstream wetland and forest ecosystems and the flood-associated livelihoods of some 150, 000 people. A cost-benefit analysis of flood control measures and a study of a dam design that would maintain the beneficial aspects of flooding should be accorded the highest priority...|$|E
40|$|This study applies {{a multidimensional}} {{definition}} of wellbeing, which includes material, social and subjective dimensions, to household level social research in rural Rwanda. Its {{contribution lies in}} applying the approach to three different fields: the study of cultural difference; natural resource management; and agrarian change, and in combining a wellbeing assessment with dominant theories or concepts in each. Rwanda has received acclaim for meeting development targets despite high levels of poverty and population density. However, due to centralised, target driven policy, those impacts are contested and this thesis presents rare empirical insights {{from the perspective of}} rural inhabitants themselves. The assessment of rural wellbeing forming the basis of three empirical papers reveals that many people struggle to meet basic needs for food, shelter and fuel. In contrast to development indicators, data reveal wellbeing to be falling among many rural households and inequality to be increasing, despite investment-driven health, education and security improvements. Far-reaching policies promoting rural and agricultural modernisation, alongside reconciliation between ethnic groups, appeared only to emphasize difference between groups, with outcomes of poverty reproduced for those with little relative power. The Twa, an indigenous people, suffer acute difficulties, exacerbated by reduced forest access. However application of a framework combining wellbeing and ecosystem services reveals that a landscape approach to natural resource management could realise synergies between local resource needs and conservation of biodiversity in Rwanda’s rich tropical forests. The pervasive and authoritarian nature by which development targets are pursued, for example enforcing rural <b>villagisation,</b> has resulted in a perceived loss of freedom, which inhibited local systems of knowledge, labour, trade and social interaction. While such consequences are commonly overlooked, more holistic approaches such as this enable interpretation of complex interrelated systems and promote awareness of local perspectives, with critical implications for the design and assessment of development policy...|$|E
40|$|Through a {{case study}} of two villages of the Southern Province of Rwanda, this thesis explores the effects on Rwanda National Settlement Policy on the {{livelihoods}} of the rural population. With today 344 inhabitants per km², Rwanda has the highest population densities of Sub-Saharan Africa. Subsistence agriculture is the mainstay for more than 90 percent of the population. Since 1997, Rwanda has undertaken a controversial policy of grouping people in villages whereas rural traditional habitat is that of scattered homesteads on the hills’ slopes. The rationale of the policy is dealing of high demographic pressure on little arable land. Grouping people in villages would free more land for cultivation. But the policy is also profoundly rooted {{in the history of the}} country for the last half century. Between 1952 and 1972, experiences of agricultural modernization were conducted through the so-called paysannats. A <b>villagisation</b> experiment was tried in 1970 es- 1980 es in pilot villages without much success. The new habitat policy is like a continuation of those past experiences. However, the new policy was mainly driven by the genocide of 1994 and its aftermaths. Tutsi returnees after more than three decades in exile and genocide survivors whose houses were destroyed needed a safe place to stay when the genocide ended in July 1994. Some occupied properties of Hutu who left the country in the wake of RPF victory fearing reprisals. When Hutu returnees were forced back home in 1996 - 1997, the government needed to find a way to address the property issue, to avoid further sociopolitical violence. Analyzing the cases of Ngera and Nyagahuru, two villages of the southern Province constructed by the Belgian Cooperation in 1998 - 2000, the thesis indicates the vulnerability situation of imidugudu villages’ dwellers. A high rate of women headed households, direct consequence of the genocide, scarce natural resources, weakness of social institutions and little possibility of non farm activities are important elements which need to be taken into consideration to make a decent living for all. The government of Rwanda has initiated other policies closely related to Human Settlement Policy like Agricultural Policy, Land Policy and Environmental Policy. The thesis examines important aspects of those policies which influence the livelihoods of “imidugudu” dwellers. The thesis ends suggesting some other possible ways of rural development which should be explored...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{politics}} of public policy. It provides analysis of land policy and a study of policy making and of the Tanzanian state. Rather than deducing the state's agenda from its actions and the policies it produces, this thesis seeks to examine the interactions between the significant factions and personae of the Tanzanian political and administrative elites. This approach goes beyond identifying the divisions within the state between the Party leadership, the technocrats within the Government, and the Presidency. The thesis demonstrates how the ways in which conflicts are resolved, or deferred, and compromises are reached can lead to outcomes which do not necessarily constitute the sum of identifiable interests. In particular, a 'hidden level of government' is uncovered which consists of a technocratic elite which has, to a large extent, managed to depoliticise otherwise sensitive and controversial policy decisions and thus impose their stamp on policy outcomes. This approach to the analysis of rural land policies reveals the continuities in the state's approach to land issues. Since the colonial period, the objective of Tanzania's land policies has been to transform the countryside from the presumed inefficiencies of the 'traditional' modes of land use to fit the needs of a 'modern' and monetised economy. The modernising policies have provided the rationale for an authoritarian approach to land tenure and have been implemented by a centralised land administration. This thesis' historical analysis of the policies associated with the period of ujamaa and <b>villagisation,</b> and of the case studies of the 1983 Agricultural Policy and the 1995 National Land Policy, show that a modernising discourse and centralising administrative practices have remained at the centre of the policy agenda, despite dramatic changes in economic strategies and political institutions, and controversies over the future direction of land policies. The resulting land tenure regime relies on discretionary decision making by politicians and land officials and fails to provide workable procedures of checks and controls against malpractice. This study's detailed examination of the formulation of the National Land Policy reveals how a small elite of senior civil servants were able to hijack the policy making process and side-step political pressure for reform. They ignored, or appropriated selectively, the evidence and recommendations produced by comprehensive policy reviews, including the 1992 Presidential Commission of Inquiry, to maintain their direction of land policy while failing to address the evident shortcomings of the existing land policy regime. </p...|$|E
40|$|By the mid- 1970 s, Tanzania had {{the biggest}} {{co-operative}} movement in Africa and the oldest in East Africa. Despite such achievement, for decades, the literature on Tanzania’s small-scale coffee and cotton cultivation and marketing co-operatives has suffered from a dearth of substantive historical accounts. The available literature is fragmented along various academic disciplines, mostly political science and sociology. In addition, {{there is no single}} substantive secondary historical study specifically dedicated to the co-operative movement since the inception in 1932. The neglect is more critical given the current renaissance in Africa and increasing international interest in the co-operative movement at either national or local levels. This thesis seeks to fill this gap by utilising primary sources from the Co-operative College archive in Manchester and Tanzania National Archive (TNA) to examine and evaluate the coffee and cotton marketing co-operatives during the 1932 to 1982 period. The study further explores the interlocking forces and policies that led to its growth and development. The development is also examined against the changing political and ideological influences during the interwar, and post-war to independence periods. This thesis is structured under three cases, two of which are coffee marketing co-operatives, the Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union (KNCU) and Bukoba Co-operative Union (BCU) in Kagera; and the cotton apex marketing co-operative in the WCGA, the Victoria Federation of Co-operative Unions (VFCUS) which was formed in 1955. Study findings show that the time gap {{in the formation of the}} mentioned co-operatives were due to the colonial authority neglecting its own co-operative development policy. The evidence shows that, the KNCU which was formed in 1933 and BCU in 1950 were both established at the behest of the British colonial government in a move to control the coffee industry. Importantly, the study examines the power relations involved and the government interventions in the process and the extent to which the co-operatives were promoted and controlled by the government through the co-operative and agricultural marketing policies and legislations. This was particularly provided under Section 36 of the 1932 co-operative legislation and was further reinforced by three policies, the 1934 Chagga Rule, the 1937 Native (control and marketing) Ordinance and the Defence Ordinance, Orders of 1939 and 1940; and the African Agricultural Products (Control and Marketing) Ordinance, 1949. The post-colonial authority perpetuated the colonial policies in promoting co-operatives and the control of agricultural export revenues provided under the 1962 by the National Agricultural Products Board (Control and Marketing) Act by intensifying the intervention, effectively strangling and restructuring them to provide for effective control. Again, there was an increased politisation of the movement’s function as they became an integral part of the propagation of the socialist/ujamaa ideology and the national development plan as the 1976 <b>villagisation</b> policy. This study is of the view that the colonial and post-colonial authorities intervened in the formation of co-operatives given the fact that they were economically strategically vital. During the phases covered in this thesis, the established legislations reinforced the government’s control over the co-operative movement and the producers; and granted themselves a monopoly over the handling and export of small-scale produced coffee and cotton through the control of marketing boards by appointing co-operatives as crop handling agents. Thus, the co-operative movement never attained autonomous status as it became part of the government machinery in extracting resources and exploiting small-scale growers...|$|E
