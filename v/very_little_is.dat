5|$|The table {{below is}} {{a summary of the}} key {{physical}} properties of the group 12 elements. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about copernicium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed except for its boiling point (tentative).|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} the Glover's pika's behavior, ecology, and reproduction. It is a generalist herbivore, and is known to {{construct}} haypiles.|$|E
5|$|Her {{rule was}} finally ended by the {{politician}} Aulus Postumius, after she opted against Roman suppression. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known of the}} rest of her life, but she was eventually succeeded by Gentius in 181 BC. According to the folklore of the modern inhabitants of Risan, Teuta ended her life in grief by throwing herself from Orjen Peak.|$|E
50|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> {{found to}} {{document}} the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age in the Arras area.|$|R

50|$|Lamb wrote several novels {{which were}} almost {{in the nature}} of dramatised biographies. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> invented beyond known history.|$|R
5|$|Somari was {{developed}} by the homebrew developer Hummer Team. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about the game's origins; it is theorized to have been based upon extracted source code from the original game and its sequel that was back-ported to the NES. The title has caught the attention of contemporary video game journalists, who have commented upon its accurate recreation of the original game.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} went smoothly, {{except for a}} clash with the editors of The Russian Messenger, about which <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known. Since the {{manuscript}} Dostoyevsky turned in to Katkov was lost, it is unclear to what the editors had objected in the original.|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} Israel's early life. Michael Lapidge dates his birth to around 900, while Wood places it {{slightly}} earlier, around 890. He was a disciple of Ambrose and spent time at Rome, {{but it is}} unknown who Ambrose was or whether he was Israel's tutor in Rome. In Wood's view Israel was a monk at Saint-Maximin in Trier in the 930s.|$|E
25|$|Imbrian Mysteries {{were one}} of the secret {{religious}} rites of ancient Greece (similar to the Eleusinian Mysteries). Unfortunately, <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>are</b> known about Imbrian Mysteries.|$|R
50|$|These visits {{occurred}} {{at a time when}} <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> known about Russia outside the region. The few published descriptions of Russia were in some cases wildly inaccurate.|$|R
60|$|The summer passed rapidly by, and <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> said between Miss Le Smyrger and Miss Woolsworthy about Captain Broughton. In many respects--nay, I may say, as to all {{ordinary}} matters, no {{two women}} {{could well be}} more intimate with each other than they were,--and more than that, they had the courage each {{to talk to the}} other with absolute truth as to things concerning themselves--a courage in which dear friends often fail. But nevertheless, <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> said between them about Captain John Broughton. All that was said may be here repeated.|$|R
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} the {{toxicity}} of iridium compounds because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known of}} Saint Padarn (or Paternus {{to use his}} Latin name), and almost nothing {{with any degree of}} certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097. However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life from the little that we do have.|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known of}} the ecology of eastern voalavo, but {{northern}} voalavo {{is thought to be}} largely terrestrial with some scansorial (tree-climbing) abilities. It is active during the night, bears up to three young per litter, and probably eats fruits and seeds. Various parasites have been recorded on northern voalavo, including mites and Eimeria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> officially {{developed}} for {{this part of}} Mystara. Ever since the Mystara product line was discontinued, fans have created their own material for this part of Mystara.|$|R

50|$|Although the SL sedans and the SW station wagons {{were both}} {{redesigned}} for the 1996 model {{year on the}} exterior, mechanically <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> changed from the first generation S-Series vehicles.|$|R
5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centuries}} {{following}} Rome's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was, {{at least for}} a time, part of the Pictish kingdom. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about the Pictish Orcadians, the main archaeological relics being symbol stones. One of the best examples is located on the Brough of Birsay; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols. This small tidal island {{has a long history of}} settlement that continued into the Norse period.|$|E
5|$|She {{had three}} younger brothers. The eldest, Alfred, {{was born in}} 1883, was awarded a {{doctorate}} in chemistry from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. Fritz Noether, born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments: after studying in Munich he made a reputation for himself in applied mathematics. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928. There is no record of Noether ever marrying or having children.|$|E
60|$|Henry {{was clearly}} amazed, but too kind to express all his doubts; he only said {{something}} about the difficulties of mathematics, and remarked that <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> known about the stars.|$|R

60|$|Having {{had their}} luncheon--and it amazed Chubbins {{to see how}} <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> {{required}} to satisfy their hunger--the bird-children crept out of the basket and flew down to the twig beside their nest.|$|R
5|$|Since 1996, {{the status}} of the Ethiopian hare has beendata {{deficient}} on theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is because even though it is widespread species, <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about its status and ecology. The current state of its population trend is unclear. There are no known threats to the species. It occurs in the Abijatta-Shalla National Park and the Gambela National Park. It has also been found in the Baroye Controlled Hunting Area.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{probably}} in 1213, he took Dyrrhachium from Venice, followed in 1214 by Corfu. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known about the}} details of these successes, as the generally hostile stance of the pro-Nicaean Byzantine historians towards Michael means that his achievements were often ignored. According to local Corfiot tradition, the castle of Angelokastro was built by Michael. Michael continued to push northward into Albania and Macedonia, taking Kruja and ending the independence of the principality of Arbanon and its ruler, Dimitri Progoni, but his attempt to seize Zeta was stopped by the Serbs at Skadar.|$|E
5|$|The shapeshifter was {{an enigmatic}} and mysterious {{character}} in the StarCraft Universe. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about this creature, beyond {{the fact that the}} shapeshifter was in fact a Xel'Naga, and was by its own admission several thousand years old. In each case that the shapeshifter has appeared in a meaningful role the creature has assumed the form of a Terran Male. The Shapeshifter's allegiance was to the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, and accordingly its actions were to further Amon's own goals.|$|E

50|$|In 1913, the Julien House was {{destroyed}} by a fire - <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>was</b> left standing {{by the time the}} fire was over. Construction on the present building began soon after, and was completed in 1915.|$|R
5|$|The {{weakening}} of royal authority {{may also have}} resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards, in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all, probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords. However it is far from certain that the Lombard takeover occurred during those years, as <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known of Faroald and Zotto's respective rise to power in Spoletium (Spoleto) and Beneventum (Benevento).|$|E
5|$|This serpent eagle {{feeds on}} snakes, chameleons, and toads, and hunts these species by {{dropping}} onto {{them from a}} perch in the understory. Its excellent eyesight enables it to hunt in the dark forest. <b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> known about its breeding habits, though it is suspected to breed from June to December. The Congo serpent eagle is listed as a species of Least Concern due to its large range and population. This species has been kept as a pet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>little</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} Silverthrone’s eruptive history. However, as at other calderas, eruptions at Silverthrone are {{explosive}} in nature, involving viscous magma, glowing avalanches of hot volcanic ash and pyroclastic flows. The source magma of this rock {{is classified as}} acidic, having high to intermediate levels of silica, as in rhyolite, dacite, and andesite. Andesitic and rhyolitic magma are commonly associated with the two forms of explosive eruptions called Plinian and Peléan eruptions. Silverthrone is considerably younger than its nearest prominent neighbour Franklin Glacier Volcano to the east-southeast.|$|E
