After graduating high school, Praeger went to the government vocational guidance section to inquire about how she could further study mathematics. The <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>officer</b> she spoke with tried to discourage her from studying mathematics further , suggesting she become a teacher or a nurse because two other girls who came to him wanting to study math weren't able to pass their courses. [...] He reluctantly showed her an engineering course description, but she felt it didn't have enough mathematics. So she left without getting much information that day, but did continue on to receive her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Queensland.|$|E

40|$|The {{building}} industry, {{as one of}} {{the last}} male bastions, has seen a significant degree of resistance to concepts such as `gender equity' and `affirmative action' and resentment at what is seen as the `big brother' approach of the government's `social justice' agenda. There is a widespread misinterpretation of `equal opportunity', with men either taking the stand that women are not equal physically or that if they want equal opportunity they must demonstrate that they can do everything in the very same way that a man does on the building site. Recent work suggests that organizations which are proactive on equality issues have usually extended the equal treatment model to incorporate difference initiatives such as mentoring, fast-tracking into promotion positions or going {{out of their way to}} recruit from minority groups. It is argued here that, in an area such as the building industry, it is crucial to combine both strategies if the issue of women's disadvantage is to be adequately addressed. This paper explores girls' experience of entry-level and trade training, the attitudes of male workers and contractors to female apprentices, and the issue of support from teachers, <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> and parents. Queensland has been chosen as the site for this study because, after a long period of conservative rule, it had become the most `backward' of all the Australian states in matters of gender equality. The advent of the Goss Labour Government (1989 - 96) provided opportunities both to `catch up' and to learn from the limitations of earlier equal opportunity initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1986 Perception and {{inquiries}} {{have revealed}} that not all <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers possess the necessary interviewing skills. The {{aim of the research}} was to identify generally applicable interviewing skills, as well as those specific interviewing skills which are characteristic of the <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> provided to a pupil leaving school. The aim was furthermore to determine to what extent <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers in Transvaal secondary schools are grounded in these skills. It has been indicated that <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> actually culminate in the interview. After the interview has been analysed from an educational perspective, attention has been given to the validity and reliability of the interview. Further attention has been given to the trainability in interviewing of <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers. The following most important, generally applicable interviewing skills were then identified. * Communication as interviewing skill - There is a distinction between verbal and non-verbal communication. * Listening as interviewing skill - A distinction is drawn between marginal listening, evaluative listening and projective listening. * Establishment of report as interviewing skill - A favourable emotional climate is a requirement for a successful interview. * "Silence" as interviewing skill - The following distinction applies: that between silence initiated by the interviewer, and silence initiated by the client. * Perception as interviewing skill - For the interviewer to correctly interpret that which he percepts is equally important, if not more important, than sensory perception. * Empathy as interviewing skill - It is essential for the interviewer to place himself in the position of the client without becoming emotionally involved. * Attitude as interviewing skill - Success will be determined by the interviewer's attitude towards the client. * Questioning as interviewing skill - There is a distinction between an openended and closed question. Questions should be put with utmost circumspection because it could influence the outcome of the interview. * The use of synopsis as interviewing skill - Through synopsis the client gets the opportunity to verify the information revealed to the interviewer. The specific interviewing skill characteristic to the <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> situation has been identified as: The skilful interpretation of reports. The <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teacher has a lot of information about the school leaver from the guardian's file, accumulative card and <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> file. The planning and application of an empirical research has been done. The research was mainly aimed at determining how important the <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers regard the interviewing skills and to what extent these teachers are grounded in interviewing skills. From the research it seemed that the training <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers received in interviewing, was inadequate. The most important conclusions were: * The importance of these interviewing skills to the interviewer can't be stressed enough. * The majority of <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers don't possess the basic qualifications to act as such. * Some <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers tend to underestimate the importance of the interviewing skills and they furthermore don't have the ability to handle• these interviewing skills adequately. The most important recommendations are: * That high priority be given to the training of interviewing skills to <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers. * That the Transvaal Education Department only appoint qualified <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers at secondary schools. * That attention should be given to the practical exercise of these skills. * That universities, in co-operation with the Transvaal Education Department present further courses in interviewing to acting <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> teachers.

40|$|Purpose. Youth in-care face a {{range of}} {{barriers}} that hinder their career development, not {{least of which is}} the high prevalence of mental health, emotional and behavioural problems among this population and lack of access to vocational rehabilitation services. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide an overview of the factors that impede the school-to-work transition of youth in-care from their perspective and that of the key stakeholders in their lives. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 youth in-care, 27 carers, 14 caseworkers and 21 <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> in Queensland, Australia. Results. There is {{a range of}} social, psychological and environmental factors that impact the career development of youth incare, some of which are unique to this population. Factors include the effect of placement stability, negative in-care experiences, negative perceptions about them, limited access to caseworkers, lack of resources, poor educational planning and lack of <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> and career exploration. Conclusions. These findings have a number of implications for practice, including the need for rehabilitation counsellors to understand and address the multiple barriers facing youth in-care, to provide vocational rehabilitation services throughout the school-to-work transition period and to coordinate support from carers, caseworkers and <b>guidance</b> <b>officers.</b> Griffith Health, School of Human Services and Social WorkFull Tex...|$|R

Authoratative literature on <b>Vocational</b> <b>Guidance</b> for the gifted child serves as theoretical background. The characteristics, needs and developmental possibilities of the gifted child are investigated in terms of a <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> programme. The function of the home, school and "world of work" regarding the gifted child's <b>vocational</b> education and <b>guidance</b> are considered. The emphasis, however, is placed {{on the role of the}} school, and in particular the role of the Head of Department: Educational Guidance; subject teachers and the Educational Advisor: Vocational matters. In the empirical investigation, a questionnaire was completed by Heads of Department: Educational Guidance, in a number of Afrikaans-medium and double-medium Secondary Schools. The SAS computer programme is applied to determine the average of the responses for each question. The results of the investigation indicate that certain aspects of the existing <b>Vocational</b> <b>Guidance</b> programme are effective. There are however, a number of areas what deserve more attention, and possibly need to be revised. For the <b>Vocational</b> <b>Guidance</b> programme to be really effective, the existing programme needs to be implemented maximally, while comprehensive involvement of a committed teaching staff is essential.

40|$|Although {{between the}} wars some pioneer career {{counseling}} services already existed in Italy, {{it was only}} after the second world war that specific services were started, initially only sporadically and subsequently in a more generalized way all over the country. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> took on particular importance in schools, also in consideration of the reform then underway in high school and university. After those years of intense activity, the next two decades witnessed a decreased interest in <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> issues. Since the end of the 1990 s, however, there has been a revival of <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> also thanks to two reforms that took place at that time -one involving the educational system and the other the labor market- which attempted to respond to the new challenges and competitions that globalization created -and is still creating- to economies all over the world. The biggest challenges are connected to increasing the professionalism of the sector operators but do not have the requisites required by the SIO (Italian Society of <b>Vocational</b> <b>Guidance,</b> established in 2004) and to fostering research. The career service providers that do not have specific training in the field are still the majority and they often work with individuals at great risk (persons with disability, with socio-economic difficulties, immigrants). As regards research, <b>vocational</b> <b>guidance</b> psychology is definitely weaker than other fields of psychological research and seems to suffer from an inferiority complex: it seems neither to benefit fully from contributions and stimuli that may come from experimental, social, developmental and educational psychology nor to put itself forward as a promising and autonomous new sector of investigation and intervention.

De gyoaktiviteter som anses förekomma verkar vidare vara av mer spontan karaktär. Totalt uppger 13 % av lärarna att man medvetet planerar in syomoment i undervisningen.
