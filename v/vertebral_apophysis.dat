40|$|Lumbar disc {{herniation}} {{in adolescents}} {{is a rare}} condition. It is commonly associated with fracture of the <b>vertebral</b> ring <b>apophysis.</b> The diagnosis is most clearly established by CT scan. The differential diagnosis is important and should include spine and spinal cord tumours, discitis and neuropathy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Detachment of the {{posterior}} {{part of the}} lumbar <b>vertebral</b> ring <b>apophysis</b> has been reported by many authors, associated or not with disc prolapse, and has been ascribed to various mechanisms, although {{the relationship between the}} two pathologies remains unclear. METHODS: We studied 26 patients (17 males and 9 females; mean age, 34. 3 years) suffering from a lumbar disc herniation with nontraumatic detachment of the ring apophysis. Investigations included standard X ray, computed tomography (CT), tridimensional CT, and magnetic resonance imaging. Nineteen patients were operated on by microsurgical discectomy and removal of bone fragments. RESULTS: Clinical and neuroradiologic features of herniated disc associated with detachment of the ring apophysis have been recognized and have led to the definition of posterior retroextramarginal disc herniations. A further classification is suggested, considering two morphological types that imply clinically distinctive features and a different surgical approach. In all operated cases, removal of the bone fragments was necessary and the results were good. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations led us to postulate a common mechanism in the pathogenesis of disc herniation with nontraumatic detachment of the ring apophysis. They should be distinguished from other calcifications of the disc because a proper surgical technique, including removal of apophyseal fragments, is required...|$|R
40|$|Study Design: A {{retrospective}} study. Purpose: To {{assess the}} radiological, clinical features and surgical outcomes of six patients {{of elementary school}} age with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Overview of Literature: LDH is common in people in their fourth and fifth decades. However, the condition is extremely rare in children of elementary school age. Moreover, the clinical symptoms and treatments {{are different from those}} of adults. Methods: We reviewed a series of 6 patients under the age of 12 years, who underwent surgery for LDH at our institution between 1992 - 2002. Initially, all patients were treated conservatively. The indications for surgery were failure of conservative treatment for 3 months, intractable pain and/or progressive neurological impairment. Results: The surgical findings revealed a protruding disc in five cases and a ruptured disc in one. In addition, separation of the <b>vertebral</b> ring <b>apophysis</b> was observed in 3 cases. The symptoms had disappeared completely at the last follow-up. At the last follow-up, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was 10 points in 5 cases and 9 points in 1, and the Kirkaldy-Willis criteria was excellent in all patients. No intervertebral disc space narrowing was observed in any patient at last follow up. In addition, there were no degenerative changes in the vertebral endplate and facet joint. Conclusions: Patients with symptoms that persist for more than 3 months or those with a progressive neurological deficit must be considered for surgical discectomy.
