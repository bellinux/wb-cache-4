The projection room was converted to office space which houses, Alistair Tutton Photography, Vox Theatre Event Space and Springboard Creative. Although, the balcony no longer exists, the archways that lead to the balcony are still present. The original stage floor has also been preserved. Stage curtains were purchased from a local high school and along with the refurbished stage <b>valance</b> <b>lighting</b> the theatre look was complete.|$|E
5000|$|The model lineup {{was further}} changed; {{to bring the}} Thunderbird in line with other Ford models, the Elan was dropped, {{replaced}} with LX and Sport versions. The LX was equipped with the V6 while the Sport was equipped with the V8. Turbo Coupes gained an intercooler, essentially giving the car the powertrain of the Ford Mustang SVO. Versions with the 5-speed manual were given a power increase to 190 hp, reaching {{a top speed of}} 143 mph. Versions with the 4-speed automatic transmission (new for 1987) were detuned to 150 hp in the interest of transmission durability; turbocharger boost was reduced to 9.5 psi (65 kPa or 0.65 bar) instead of 10-15 psi (70 to 100 kPa or 0.7 to 1 bar). Turbo Coupes were equipped with anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes, Automatic Ride Control, and 16-inch 225/60VR performance tires. The Turbo Coupe also featured a performance-styled front <b>valance</b> with fog <b>lights</b> and special trim with [...] "Turbo Coupe" [...] badges on the doors, as well as [...] "Snowflake" [...] 16 inch alloy wheels.|$|R
