40|$|Fresh {{air control}} in a {{mushroom}} tunnel is by adjustment of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>damper</b> {{in the air}} handling unit, and this has {{a major impact on}} the climate of the tunnel. Damper angle affects the proportion of fresh to recirculated air, i. e. the mixing ratio. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the mixing ratio as a function of the damper angle, thus facilitating predictive climate control strategies. Measurement of mixing ratio was achieved by psychrometric measurement of the fresh, recirculated and mixed airflows. A full range of damper angles, from horizontal to vertical, i. e. 0 – 908, at 98 intervals were used. Compared to mixing ratio models from the literature, results showed that the effect of damper angle on mixing ratio can be better modelled by an exponential relation, but a much better model is a sigmoid. The benefit obtained for an exponential model was a fit improvement of 37...|$|E
40|$|Ventilation is {{important}} because it affects indoor environmental conditions, including air pollutant concentrations that may modify the health of the occupants of a building, or their perceptions and comfort. This paper reports, first of all, on field studies monitoring indoor overnight CO 2 levels and outdoor ventilation rates in bedrooms employing room air conditioners (RACs), so the current situation of ventilation in actual high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong can be appreciated. This is followed by a report of the results of laboratory experiments where two typical RACs were used in an examination of outdoor air ventilation characteristics in rooms employing RACs. The results of field studies showed that the outdoor ventilation rates in the measured bedrooms equipped with RACs in high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong could not meet the ventilation requirement specified in the ASHRAE standard 62 - 2001 even if there was only one occupant in a bedroom. Although the use ofa window-type air conditioner (WRAC) may provide a higher outdoor ventilation rate than the use of a split-type air conditioner (SARC), this may be ascribed to the fact there is more natural infiltration when a WRAC is used. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>damper</b> currently available in a WRAC does not significantly affect the outdoor ventilation rate. Therefore, such a damper cannot be expected to provide the ventilation rate as required by a ventilation code and its intended function of controlling ventilation is limited. In addition, the air exhausted from indoors to outdoors through the ventilation outlet in a WRAC is air that has just been cooled by the cooling coil (evaporator). This is unreasonable, because exhausting just-cooled and dehumidified air is a waste of energy. Therefore, an improved design for a WRAC has been suggested. Finally, the outdoor ventilation requirement for bedrooms at nighttime, when occupants are asleep, is discussed. A new ventilation rate of 3. 0 l/s per person for the sleeping environment in high-rise residential buildings is proposed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
30|$|This {{study shows}} that the National Trust has instigated an {{effective}} maintenance programme that has secured stable indoor environmental conditions by conservation heating and cleaning that are vital to avoid mould growth, both airborne and on the surfaces. The previously reported mould problems concentrating especially on the vellum binders, {{back of the book}} presses, behind the picture frames and tapestries, which have quite possibly been exacerbated due to organic matter content, poor <b>ventilation</b> and rising <b>damp,</b> or external conditions leading to moisture enrichment, such as driven rain, seem to have been resolved. One critical area that emerges from this research however is around windows. Both the metal frame and stonework sills of the single glazed windows were found to have high surface mould concentrations. Because these are an intrinsic part of the architectural heritage of the Blickling Hall, and therefore cannot be replaced, it is of utmost importance that they are kept clean and free of surface water, in order to avoid conditions that do and can lead to surface mould.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Rising damp {{constitutes}} one of {{the main}} causes of monumental heritage and old buildings degradation, especially, its thick walls with heterogeneous composition. The LFC-FEUP has been developed important research in rising damp domain. In recent years, was validated and experimentally characterized the operation principle of a technique called "wall base ventilation system " for the treatment of rising damp in monumental heritage and ancient buildings consisting of circulating air {{at the base of the}} buildings walls with high thickness and heterogeneity in its constitution, with a saturation distant relative humidity. The studies previously developed allowed the interest and viability of the proposed system, taking time to develop a methodology for optimizes it. In this paper it is presented the optimization of the wall base ventilation system based on some important physical parameters. To optimize the system, it was developed a 2 D evaporation model that describes the moisture transfer between the system and the wall as well as the water vapour transport throughout the system (Evaporation and Transport Model – ETM). It was also used and adapted another 2 D model, to describe the rising damp phenomenon in buildings walls, considering the wall base <b>ventilation</b> system (Rising <b>Damp</b> and Evaporation Model – RDEM). Finally, the design model was developed, using both models (ETM and RDEM) and some experimental validation was done, which allowed the comparison between the levels archived by the wet front analytically and experimentally...|$|R
