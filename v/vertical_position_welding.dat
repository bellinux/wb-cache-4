40|$|To obtain {{satisfactory}} welds in positional {{laser beam}} welding, {{it is necessary}} to know how process parameters will influence the quality of welds in different <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> In this study, the titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V sheets were laser welded in two <b>vertical</b> <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> (<b>vertical</b> up and vertical down), and the appearance, porosity, strength, and ductility of the laser joints were evaluated. Results show that undercuts of the vertical up welds were greater than that of vertical down welds, while the porosity contents were much higher in vertical down welds than that in vertical up welds. When welding with a higher heat input, the <b>vertical</b> up <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> resulted in poor weld profiles (undercuts and burn-through holes), whereas the <b>vertical</b> down <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> led to excessive porosity contents in welds. Both severe undercut and excessive porosity were detrimental to the tensile properties of the welds. Weld appearance was improved and porosity contents were reduced by using a lower heat input, achieving better weld quality. Therefore, it is suggested that process parameter settings with relatively high laser powers and welding speeds, which can result in lower heat inputs, are used when laser welding the Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloys vertically...|$|R
50|$|Electrogas welding (EGW) is a {{continuous}} <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> arc <b>welding</b> process developed in 1961, {{in which an}} arc is struck between a consumable electrode and the workpiece. A shielding gas is sometimes used, but pressure is not applied. A major difference between EGW and its cousin electroslag welding is that the arc in EGW is not extinguished, instead remains struck throughout the welding process. It is used to make square-groove welds for butt and t-joints, especially in the shipbuilding industry and {{in the construction of}} storage tanks.|$|R
40|$|A small {{welding robot}} is described, which {{by means of}} {{magnetic}} wheels can freely move over vessel shells. The driving behaviour of suitable undercarriages has been studied in the laboratory on flat and curved surfaces in horizontal {{as well as in}} <b>vertical</b> <b>positions.</b> The <b>welding</b> torch is placed on an axis system with three degrees of freedom. Using a sensor system the welding torch is precisely guided taking account of seam geometry and <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> At the same time an adaptive fitting of welding parameters is assured. The developed device and the corresponding control system have been tested in shipyards under field conditions. From these test results additional research and development tasks for a prototyping are derived.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of shielding gases and <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> on properties of duplex and superduplex stainless steel circumferential pipe welds. Corrosion resistance, microstructural features and weld defects were assessed and related to the welding procedures. Horizontal and <b>vertical</b> upward <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> produced high quality welds. However, welding in the overhead position resulted in less good results in terms of porosity and corrosion resistance. Shielding gases containing 30 % helium showed best results, whilst using a mixture Ar+ 2 %CO 2 resulted in undercuts and porosity in all <b>welding</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} and {{the usefulness of}} applying plasma keyhole welding to structural steels with different compositions and material thicknesses, and in various <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> has been examinated. Single pass butt welding with I groove in flat, horizontal <b>vertical</b> and <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> and root <b>welding</b> with V, Y and U grooves of thick plate material in flat position have been studied and the welds with high quality has been obtained. The technological conditions for successful welding are presented. The single and interactive effects of welding parameters on weld quality, especially on surface weld defects, geometrical form errors, internal defects and mechanical properties (strength, ductility, impact toughness, hardness and bendability) of weld joint, are presented. Welding parameter combinations providing the best quality welds are also presented...|$|R
30|$|Spray arc is {{required}} for thicker section than short arc. It is very suitable when a high deposition rate is needed and when deep penetration {{is required}} for welding of massive base materials that can tolerate high heat input. The large weld pool makes <b>vertical</b> or overhead <b>position</b> <b>welding</b> difficult, {{especially in the case}} of plain carbon steel and stainless steels. For joining steels, the transition current can be varied more than when welding aluminium alloys. A spray arc can be used with almost all common alloys containing aluminium and also nickel alloys, copper alloys, stainless steels, magnesium, and carbon steels (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Robert and Messler 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). Despite the advantages of conventional spray arc, odd arc instabilities and disordered metal transfer have restricted its adoption. In spray arc mode, the current and voltage are almost steady, which leads to random droplet size and frequency (Hutt and Lucas 1982). Therefore, high fume, spatter, and heat input are generated. As a result of insufficient control, the weld quality can be adversely affected. It should also be noted that the argon-based shielding gas used to achieve spray arc is more expensive than CO 2. In view of these drawbacks, spray arc is unsuitable for aluminium, structural steel, coated steel, and high-strength steels.|$|R

40|$|Current CGSB testing {{standards}} (CAN/CGSB: 65. 17 - 1999) require that participants {{be able to}} move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> in calm water tests only. The effect that two separate wave frequencies had on the ability of people to move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> was investigated. Twenty-three participants were instructed to move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> in the following conditions: calm water, a regular wave spectrum, and an irregular wave spectrum. There {{were no significant differences in}} the length of time it took to move to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> across all three conditions. Visual observations of the participants in the water suggest that more physical effort was required on their part to stabilize themselves while in waves.

In conclusion, the two wave spectrums tested increased the amount of physical effort required by the participants to remain in a <b>vertical</b> <b>position,</b> but did not significantly affect the time it took to do so.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{evaluate}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> adopted by nulliparous women during labor in terms of pain and satisfaction with the position. METHODS: the study {{was based on a}} secondary efficacy analysis of data from 107 nulliparous women enrolled in a randomized controlled trial in which the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> adopted during the dilation phase of labor was evaluated. The analysis involved comparing the median percentages of the duration for which women remained in the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> for each of the variables studied. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to determine the difference s betwee n th e groups. Statistical significance was set at p 7 (p= 0. 02). At 4 and 6 cm of dilation, the women who reported greater satisfaction remained more than 50 % of the time in the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> (p= 0. 0 2 an d p= 0. 03, respectively).

40|$|Abstract: EAST Superconducting Tokamak is a non-circular {{advanced}} steady-state plasma experimental device, {{which will}} be build at ASIPP in next year. Tokamak plasmas with highly elongated cross sections are subject to a vertical displacement event (VDE). For long duration steady state operation of EAST, {{it would be very}} crucial to maintain the plasma radial and <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> accurately. For designing the position controller in EAST we have adopted 1. 5 D equilibrim evolve control model. While the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> instability is slowed down by a set of passive stabilizers placed closed to the plasma edge, a pair of in- vessel active feedback coils can adequately control <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> perturbations of up to 2 cm. The parameters of both <b>vertical</b> and radial <b>position</b> control coils and their power supplies are determined based on the simulations. 1...|$|R
