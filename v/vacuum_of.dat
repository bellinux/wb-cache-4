5|$|The Soviet-style {{secret police}} and the central {{security}} office Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (UB) grew to around 32,000 agents as of 1953. At its Stalinist peak, there was one UB agent for every 800 Polish citizens. The MBP was also {{in charge of the}} Internal Security Corps, the Civil Militia (MO), border guard, prison staff and paramilitary police ORMO used for special actions (with over 100,000 members). The ORMO originated from popular self-defense efforts, a spontaneous reaction to the explosion of crime in the power <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> 1944–45. In February 1946 the PPR channeled and formalized this citizen militia movement, creating its ostensibly crime control voluntary ORMO structure.|$|E
5|$|The deep <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> space {{could make}} it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, {{such as those that}} require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E

5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to test them against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending meltdown of its reactor core, the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> space pulls her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls unconscious, and Wheatley is left in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E
5|$|In 1747, Fleetwood's playhouse patent expired. The theatre and {{a patent}} renewal were {{purchased}} by actor David Garrick (who had trained under Macklin earlier) and partner James Lacy. Garrick served as manager and lead actor of the theatre until roughly 1766, {{and continued on}} in the management role for another ten years after that. He is remembered {{as one of the}} great stage actors and is especially associated with advancing the Shakespearean tradition in English theatre – during his time at Drury Lane, the company mounted at least 24 of Shakespeare's plays. Some of Shakespeare's surge in popularity during this period can be traced to the Licensing Act of 1737, which mandated governmental approval of any play before it could be performed and thereby created something of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> new material to perform. Garrick shared the stage with company including Peg Woffington, Susannah Cibber, Hannah Pritchard, Kitty Clive, Spranger Barry, Richard Yates and Ned Shuter. It was under Garrick's management that spectators were for the first time barred from the stage itself.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{metallurgy}} is {{that field}} of materials technology {{that deals with}} making, shaping, or treating metals in a controlled atmosphere, at pressures significantly less than normal atmospheric pressure.

5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>of</b> space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
