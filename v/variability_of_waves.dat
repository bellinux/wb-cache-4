40|$|In Sri Lanka, nearshore {{wave climate}} is {{influenced}} by the simultaneous occurrence of swell waves approaching from a more or less southerly direction and sea waves mainly influenced by monsoonal weather pattern. Some nearshore areas are also vulnerable for occasional impact of cyclonic wave conditions. This complexity and high degree of temporal and spatial <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> clearly emphasize the need for accurate assessment of near shore wave climate. The lack of wave recordings at nearshore location restricts the assessment of nearshore wave climate to some extent. This deficiency in wave data can be overcome by transforming waves from location at which wave data are available through wave propagation modelling. This research study is aimed to develop two dimensional mathematical model based on an irregular wave description capable of simulating wave propagation from offshore to nearshore considering wave transformations due to shoaling, refraction, wave breaking and bottom friction dissipation. The wave conservation equation and the model of Battjes and Janssen were used as the basis to develop the model. Galle (70 m depth) is considered as offshore location which represents the entire deep water wave climate off the southern offshore coast. Hambantota (17 m depth) and Kudawella(I 5 m depth) were selected as nearshore locations to establish the directional wavestatistics for swell and sea waves by applying the developed mathematical model. Finally based on obtained nearshore wave data base, predictions for extreme wave conditions were made as design wave parameters for coastal and harbour structures. Extremewave heights analysis were done for both offshore and nearshore locations in southerncoast of Sri Lanka using two statistical extreme value probability distributions, namely Gumbel (Fischer-Tippet Type 1) distribution and the Weibull distributio...|$|E

This study classifies uncertainty into 2 types: aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty.

Spectral analysis <b>of</b> inter-annual <b>variability</b> and correlation coefficient analysis between inter-annual variability and climate index such as Arctic Oscillation are conducted to quantify aleatory uncertainty.

The two bodies are modelled as a constrained multi-body system in the frequency domain. Transfer functions are calculated for the motions and forces of the system. Access is possible when no slip conditions occur at the fender, and when the relative rotations between the two bodies are within certain tolerance limits. Four response variables are defined to impose such conditions. In a short-term sea state the extreme maximum crest height of these variables is computed, assuming that response crest heights follow a Rayleigh distribution. Each of the extreme values is compared to a specific threshold, to determine whether access is possible or not. Accessibility is calculated for a sample platform located off the coast of Scotland using hindcast data for the period 1980 - 2013. Average accessibility resulted to be 23. 7 %.

Time frequency plots for zonal wavenumbers 1 and 2, at two heights representing the middle stratosphere and the stratopause, respectively, are used to analyze the temporal <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waves,</b> and its possible relationship to the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and semiannual oscillation (SAO). Kelvin wave activity reaches a maximum during the solstice seasons and almost disbars during the equinoxes, in agreement with previous tudies. Eastward propagating variance is estimated for wave periods from 4 to 20 days, at all UARS pressure surfaces currently available for MLS. The semiannual modulation of variance is observed to extend down to the lower limits of the height ranges of the temperalure and ozone retrievals. Furthermore, a superposed QBO modulation is detected up to the stratopause. Comparison between the variance in eastward propagating waves and the mean zonal wind shows a possible participation <b>of</b> kelvin <b>waves</b> in the forcing of the QBO. At the stratopause the role <b>of</b> Kelvin <b>waves</b> in forcing the SAO appears to be limited, in agreement with previous results.

First, the seasonal variations <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy flux are investigated {{in combination with}} the directional distribution. Most <b>of</b> the incoming <b>wave</b> energy is concentrated in the winter season, in which high waves from the WNW, NW, and NNW direction frequently impact the coastline. Second, the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> breaking in the near shore area, and breaker height and depth, are examined. Re­lated morphological indices such as the closure depth and the Sunamura index are also estimated. The seasonal variations of these properties indicate common patterns, in which the values are highest in winter, medium in spring and autumn, and lowest in summer. The cumulative probability of breaker depths varies significantly from season to season. The estimated closure depth also indicates distinct seasonal changes. These results indicate that the cross-shore width of significant morphological change is substantially var­iable according to the time. The estimations of the Sunamura indices suggest that the shoreline is advanced during the summer, while shoreline recessions generally occur in other seasons. The transitions from shoreline recessions to shoreline advances are deduced to occur in March. and from advances to reces­sions in September. Third, an analysis ofinfragravity waves is conducted.

This {{is useful for}} the retrieval <b>of</b> two dimensional <b>wave</b> spectra in highly variable sea states, especially in complex coastal areas or near islands. Using the three different SAR scanning modes {{it is possible to}} image the same location every 2 days. An inter-comparison between sea state parameters and spectral distributions retrieved from TSX, buoy and wind-wave models is presented for the Azores Archipelago in the area where the first wave energy power plant to be grid connected was built and continues in operation. A verification of the spectral parameters significant wave height, peak period, energy (mean) period and wave power in addition to wave spectral shape obtained from TSX SAR against buoy data and wind-wave Mar 3 G model analysis is included, which shows the good accuracy of these remote sensed data. In addition, the strong spatial <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> conditions in complex coastal areas (in the channel between São Jorge and Pico islands) is highlighted through the comparison of a series of (partially overlapping) TSX SAR Spotlight image spectra...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Increased wave {{reflection}} {{is an independent}} factor associated with cardiovascular diseases, risk, and mortality. The influence of the menstrual cycle on {{wave reflection}}s and particularly on the reproducibility of their measurement has never been examined. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the reproducibility and <b>variability</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> reflection indices in premenopausal healthy women during their menstrual cycle. Thirty-two women were examined at 3 phases of their menstrual cycle: days 1 to 2 (menstrual phase), days 6 to 14 (late follicular), and days 4 to 7 after ovulation (early luteal phase). Applanation tonometry of the radial artery and aortic pulse wave analysis were performed for the calculation of augmentation pressure, augmentation index, and timing <b>of</b> reflected <b>waves.</b> Reproducibility <b>of</b> these measures was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis, whereas ANOVA was performed to assess their variability during the menstrual cycle. The SD of augmentation index differences between repeated measurements within the menstrual cycle ranged from 7. 6 % to 9. 9 %. Bland-Altman analysis indicated no evidence of systemic bias and no trend for the reproducibility of measurements to vary with their underlying mean value. Intraclass correlation coefficient indicated a moderate reproducibility of augmentation index and augmentation pressure (0. 80) and a rather low reproducibility for timing <b>of</b> reflected <b>waves</b> (0. 43). Mean augmentation pressure, augmentation index, and timing <b>of</b> reflected <b>waves</b> did not vary significantly during the menstrual cycle (ANOVA). Measurement <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> reflections at the same phase of the menstrual cycle or statistical adjustment could be suggeste...|$|R
