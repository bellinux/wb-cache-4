In two-lung ventilation during esophagectomy, her Cdyn, P/F, and ratio of dead space to tidal volume were within normal limit (30  mL/H 2 O, 500, and 0.15, respectively). Therefore, <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{did not occur}} during artificial pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum, although her PaCO 2 was elevated transiently. However, in patients with single lung transplantation and/or poor lung graft function, <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> might occur, which promotes ventilator-induced lung injury and an inflammatory reaction, followed by pulmonary dysfunction and graft rejection. During the perioperative period of esophagectomy, the major respiratory problems of this case were a slight right lung edema and a persistent pulmonary air leak due to {{the division of the}} thoracic adhesions, which needed 13  days to recover.|$|E

40|$|Sleep predisposes to disordered {{breathing}} (SDB) {{across a}} broad continuum ranging from periodic episodes of transient hypoventilation to full-blown obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome with markedly impaired daytime functioning. A ma-jor cause of SDB is the sleep-induced reduction in tonic neural activity to muscles of the upper airway. Thus, in persons with already compromised airway structure, sleep and changing sleep states result in intermittent airway narrowing and often closure. These episodic <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiencies</b> cause in-termittent asphyxia, chemoreceptor stimulation, increased res-piratory efforts, and transient arousals. Cardiovascular responses are analogous to a defense homeostatic response. Cardiac out-put and blood pressure decline slightly and then increase tran-siently upon termination of each event, and muscle sympa-thetic nerve activity (MSNA) increases during the apneas, peaks during the early recovery period, and then shuts off abruptly. The increased MSNA is due primarily to peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation, to cortical arousal, and their inter-action. In turn, increased sympathetic nerve activity is obliga-tory to the acute pressor responses to apnea (1). What are the long-term consequences of these recurring periods of cardiovascular stimulation that prevent much of the normal lowering effect of sleep on nocturnal blood pressure? Systemic hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity have been linked statistically to obstructive sleep apnea; however, {{it is difficult to}} prove these associations in cross-sectional studies {{because of the presence of}} common risk factors such as age, gender, obesity, and alcohol consumption.

After inhalation of nTiO 2, we monitored changes in 5 -lipoxygenase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in rat lung tissue. Lung function parameters include specific airway resistance (SRaw), peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), functional residual capacity (FRC), and lung compliance (Cchord); blood white blood cell count (WBC), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH); and lung lavage leukotriene C 4, interleukin 6 (IL 6), tumor necrotic factor α (TNFα), hydroxyl radicals, and NO. Leukotriene receptor antagonist MK 571 and 5 -lipoxygenase inhibitor MK 886 were used for pharmacologic intervention. Compared to control, nTiO 2 exposure induced near 5 -fold increase in 5 -lipoxygenase mRNA expression in lung tissue. iNOS mRNA increased while eNOS mRNA decreased. Lavage leukotriene C 4; IL 6; TNFα; NO; hydroxyl radicals; and blood WBC, NO, hydrogen peroxide, and LDH levels rose. Obstructive <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> was observed.

Christie (19446) briefly recorded the lack of correlation in his experience between the radiological appearances and the clinical and post-mortem findings, and Parkinson and Hoyle (1937) found that radiology provided additional support of the diagnosis in only half of 80 cases of gross olinical emphysema; but in an extensive search of the literature we have been unable to obtain any precise information regarding the extent to which <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> can be judged by radiological appearances. The purpose of the present investigation waa therefore to ascertain the correlation between the radiological and clinical states of the victims of emphysema. Scope and Method of the Investigation Fifty-two cases of varying degrees of emphysema were assessed. The diag-nosis was made in the first instance on clinical grounds alone; all the patients complained of cough and dyspnoea either at rest or on exertion, and their diminished exercise tolerance was in no case explicable by primary cardio-vascular or blood disease, or by obesity, though three had pulmonary heart failure. The entire group presented {{some or all of the}} classical physical signs of emphysema.

40|$|The {{newborn infant}} with a {{congenital}} diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) who develops severe respiratory distress requiring operative repair within the first 24 hours of life {{represents one of the}} most challenging problems in pediatric surgery. The mortality in these infants still exceeds 50 % and has historically been attributed to <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> secondary to pulmonary hypoplasia. However, the primary abnormality in these neonates seems to be an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance with an elevation of pulmonary artery pressure, right-left ductal shunting, preductal shunting and progressive hypoxemia. Eighteen neonates with a CDH were operated upon within the first 24 hours of life with a mortality of 38 %. In no instance did <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> seem to be {{a major factor in the}} death of the patient. Seven infants with progressive hypoxemia were treated with a vasodilator, tolazoline. Six of the seven infants showed an initial response to treatment, with a rise in preductal PaO 2 and a decrease in ductal shunting. Four of these seven desperately ill neonates survived. Pathologic examination of the pulmonary vasculature in the non-survivors revealed an increase in muscle mass within the pulmonary arterioles. An exaggerated vasoconstrictive response of an abnormally hypertrophied pulmonary vascular bed leading to an elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, rather than abnormalities of ventilation, appears to be the important mechanism leading to the often fatal hypoxemia observed in the neonate with a CDH. Improved survival will depend upon the successful management of the deranged pulmonary vascular hemodynamics seen in these infants...|$|E

The literature supports that, in light of the significant incidence of cardiorespiratory complications, SCI patients should be managed in a monitored special care unit.

40|$|Exacerbations {{of chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{are associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. The effective management of COPD exacerbations awaits {{a better understanding of the}} underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that shape its clinical expression. The clinical presentation of exacerbations of COPD is highly variable and ranges from episodic symptomatic deterioration that is poorly responsive to usual treatment, to devastating life threatening events. This underscores the heterogeneous physiological mechanisms of this complex disease, as well as the variation in response to the provoking stimulus. The derangements in ventilatory mechanics, muscle function, and gas exchange that characterise severe COPD exacerbations with respiratory failure are now well understood. Critical expiratory flow limitation and the consequent dynamic lung hyperinflation appear to be the proximate deleterious events. Similar basic mechanisms probably explain the clinical manifestations of less severe exacerbations of COPD, but this needs further scientific validation. In this review we summarise what we have learned about the natural history of COPD exacerbations from clinical studies that have incorporated physiological measurements. We discuss the pathophysiology of clinically stable COPD and examine the impact of acutely increased expiratory flow limitation on the compromised respiratory system. Finally, we review the chain of physiological events that leads to acute <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in severe exacerbations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{pulmonary}} function after acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood and identify risk factors for reduced pulmonary function. We studied a population-based cohort of 94 survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood who were in first remission after treatment without spinal irradiation or bone marrow transplantation. Pulmonary function test results were compared with reference values for our laboratory, based on 348 healthy subjects who had never smoked from a local population study. A median of 8 years after cessation of therapy (range 1 - 18 years) the participants had a slight, subclinical, restrictive <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and reduced transfer factor and transfer coefficient. The changes in lung function were related to younger age at treatment and to more dose-intensive treatment protocols that specified more use of cranial irradiation and higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines, cytosine arabinoside and intravenous cyclophosphamide than previous protocols. We conclude that, 8 years after treatment without bone marrow transplantation or spinal irradiation, survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in first remission were without pulmonary symptoms but had signs of slight restrictive pulmonary disease including reduced transfer factor. The increased dose intensity of many recent protocols for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia may lead to increased late pulmonary toxicity...|$|E

Methods: The study included 34 ALS patients implanted with DPS system. All patients underwent multidisciplinary and laboratory evaluations before the surgery. The laboratory examinations included pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas analysis. Survival rates were recorded in a 2 -year follow-up after the surgery. Results: Twenty-eight of 34 patients with ALS survived after a 2 -year follow-up. These patients were younger than those who died and had the disease for a longer time; however, the differences were not significant. Both right and left hemidiaghragms were thicker in the survived patients (P < 0. 0001 for each). Pulmonary function tests revealed {{no significant differences between}} the patients who survived. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the survived patients (P = 0. 025). Conclusions: DPS implantation was more efficacious in ALS patients with mild respiratory failure and thicker diaphragm.

40|$|Abstract Objectives To {{assess the}} {{possibilities}} of reinnervation in a paralyzed hemidiaphragm via an anastomosis between phrenic nerve and inferior laryngeal nerve in rabbits. Reinnervation of a paralyzed diaphragm could be an alternative to treat patients with <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> due to upper cervical spine injuries. Material and method Rabbits were divided into five groups of seven rabbits each. Groups I and II were respectively the healthy and the denervated control groups. The 3 other groups were all reinnervated using three different surgical procedures. In groups III and IV, phrenic nerve was respectively anastomosed with the abductor branch of the inferior laryngeal nerve and with {{the trunk of the}} inferior laryngeal nerve. In group V, the fifth and fourth cervical roots were respectively anastomosed with the abductor branch of the inferior laryngeal nerve and with the nerve of the sternothyroid muscle (originating from the hypoglossal nerve). Animals were evaluated 4 months later using electromyography, transdiaphragmatic pressure measurements, sonomicrometry and histological examination. Results A poor inspiratory activity was found in quiet breathing in the reinnervated groups, with an increasing pattern of activity during effort. In the reinnervated groups, transdiaphragmatic pressure measurements and sonomicrometry were higher in group III with no significant differencewith groups IV and V. Conclusion Inspiratory contractility of an hemidiaphragm could be restored with immediate anastomosis after phrenic nerve section between phrenic nerve and inferior laryngeal nerve. </p...|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{dysfunction}} often {{occurs in}} patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and may involve both respiratory and locomotor (peripheral) muscles. The loss of strength and/or endurance in the former can lead to <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> whereas in the latter it limits exercise capacity and activities of daily life. Muscle dysfunction is the consequence of complex interactions between local and systemic factors, frequently coexisting in COPD patients. Pulmonary hyperinflation along with the increase in work of breathing that occur in COPD appear as the main contributing factors to respiratory muscle dysfunction. By contrast, deconditioning seems to {{play a key role in}} peripheral muscle dysfunction. However, additional systemic factors, including tobacco smoking, systemic inflammation, exercise, exacerbations, nutritional and gas exchange abnormalities, anabolic insufficiency, comorbidities and drugs, can also influence the function of both respiratory and peripheral muscles, by inducing modifications in their local microenvironment. Under all these circumstances, protein metabolism imbalance, oxidative stress, inflammatory events, as well as muscle injury may occur, determining the final structure and modulating the function of different muscle groups. Respiratory muscles show signs of injury as well as an increase in several elements involved in aerobic metabolism (proportion of type I fibers, capillary density, and aerobic enzyme activity) whereas limb muscles exhibit a loss of the same elements, injury, and a reduction in fiber size. In the present review we examine the current state of the art of the pathophysiology of muscle dysfunction in COPD...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory {{symptoms}} and ventilatory function changes {{in relation to}} length of exposure to cotton dust E. ZUgKIN and F. VALIC Andrija Stampar School of Public Health, Zagreb University, Zagreb, Yugoslavia The prevalence of byssinosis, respiratory symptoms, acute changes of ventilatory capacity over the shift, and chronic changes of ventilatory capacity were studied in two groups of non-smoking female workers exposed to practically identical concentrations of {{the same type of}} cotton dust but for very different periods of time (16 and 4 years respectively). The prevalence of non-specific respiratory symptoms increased with the duration of exposure to cotton dust only in the subjects with byssinosis. Exposure to cotton dust caused significant reductions over the shift of the mean FEV 1. o, FVC and PEF in all the groups of cotton workers examined. In byssinotics the reduction in ventilatory capacity was considerably greater in subjects with longer than in those with shorter exposure to cotton dust, while in non-byssinotics the response was approximately equal in the two groups. Inhalation of a bronchodilator {{at the end of the}} shift restored ventilatory function to its pre-shift values except in byssinotics with a longer duration of exposure to cotton dust. Chronic changes of ventilatory capacity developed only in subjects with a longer exposure to cotton dust and were common in the byssinotics. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to cotton dust may cause respiratory symptoms accompanied by changes of lung func-tion. The diagnosis of byssinosis is based on the characteristic history of chest tightness, cough, and wheezing, predominantly on the first working day after a break of more than one day of exposure to active dust. Later, the same symptoms occur on subsequent days of the week, and chronic cough and dyspnoea may persist even during absence from work. Evidence of irreversible <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> may then be found (Schilling et al. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis is an inflammatory disease {{which leads to}} chronic <b>ventilatory</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and is characterised by a reduction in pulmonary static and dynamic volumes. It {{has been suggested that}} lung elastance may also be abnormally increased, particularly in end stage disease, but this has not been systematically tested. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the respiratory mechanics during mechanical ventilation in patients affected by end stage disease.  METHODS—Respiratory mechanics were monitored in seven patients with idiopathic {{pulmonary fibrosis}} being ventilated for acute respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 5. 8 (0. 3); pH 7. 28 (0. 02); PaCO 2 8. 44 (0. 82) kPa; tidal volume 3. 4 (0. 2) ml/kg; respiratory rate 35. 1 (8. 8) breaths/min) using an oesophageal balloon and airway occlusion during constant flow inflation. The total respiratory system mechanics (rs) was partitioned into lung (L) and chest wall (w) mechanics to measure static intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPi), static (Est) and dynamic (Edyn) elastances, total respiratory resistance (Rrs), interrupter respiratory resistance (Rint,rs), and additional respiratory resistance (ΔRrs).  RESULTS—PEEPi was negligible in all patients. Edyn,rs and Est,rs were markedly increased (60. 9 (7. 3) and 51. 9 (8. 0) cm H 2 O/l, respectively), and this was due to abnormal lung elastance (dynamic 53. 9 (8. 0) cm H 2 O/l, static 46. 1 (8. 1) cm H 2 O/l) while chest wall elastance was only slightly increased. Rrs and Rint,rs were also increased above the normal range (16. 7 (4. 5) and 13. 7 (3. 5) cm H 2 O/l/s, respectively). RL and Rint,L contributed 88 % and 89 %, on average, to the total. Edyn,rs, Est,rs, Rrs and Rint,rs were significantly correlated with the degree of hypercapnia (r = 0. 64 (p< 0. 01), r = 0. 54 (p< 0. 05), r = 0. 84 (p< 0. 001), and r = 0. 72 (p< 0. 001), respectively).  CONCLUSIONS—The elastances and resistances of the respiratory system are significantly altered in ventilated patients with end stage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These features are almost totally due to abnormalities in lung mechanics. These profound alterations in elastic and resistive mechanical properties at this stage of the disease may be responsible for the onset of hypercapnia. ...|$|E
