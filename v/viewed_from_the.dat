5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the poles {{is greater than}} at the equator, so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator, then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator, while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E

5|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> third-person perspective. The playable {{character}} is {{visible on the}} screen and the camera can be freely rotated around him. The player controls Batman as he traverses Arkham Asylum, a secure facility for the criminally insane located off the coast of Gotham City. The opening areas of the game are linear, serving as a tutorial for the moves and approaches available to the player. Once the player emerges onto the island he can freely explore the game world, although some areas remain inaccessible until certain milestones in the main story. Batman can run, jump, climb, crouch, glide from heights using his cape, and use his grapple gun to climb low structures or escape to higher ledges.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, having cited him {{in a number of}} {{different}} texts throughout his career. The Prologue begins with a quote from Cervantes' Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (Persiles and Sigismunda), which is subsequently mentioned, with a focus on the character of Rutilio. The mention of Rutilio is noteworthy, as the episode has been of interest to critics due to its magical subject matter, concerning lycanthropy. Both works feature a distant and exotic land where the marvellous is present by means of metamorphoses, and <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> characters' perspective.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> side as in the original Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons trilogy, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The game also includes moving platforms and teleporters that Keen can respectively jump on and interact with. In between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map, the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, or by resetting the game. When a level is completed, the player is given a password that records their progress, lives, and points; this password is entered when starting the game in order to resume where the player left off. The game is divided into three worlds, connected by a central hub area where the game begins and where Keen starts whenever a password is entered.|$|E
5|$|Completed in 1980, {{the bank}} built the National Westminster Tower (now known as Tower 42) in London {{to serve as}} its {{international}} headquarters.

5|$|Some {{have argued}} that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion, {{although}} this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, when the sun, <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} first floor and {{continuing}} to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone.

The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time). The present doorknobs and hinges, locked for protection, display the state coat of arms. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.|$|E
