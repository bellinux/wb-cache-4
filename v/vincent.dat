5|$|In November 2007, <b>Vincent</b> runs a {{blood test}} on himself after {{experiencing}} {{what appears to be}} symptoms of morning sickness and discovers he is pregnant. Eve inspects <b>Vincent</b> (who is dressed as Valerie) on November 22, 2007 and discovers his pregnancy and his true gender identity as intersex. <b>Vincent</b> torments Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born and to prevent her from telling anyone that he was still alive and pregnant with Julian's child. After his psychopathic accomplice Viki Chatsworth severs Julian's penis, <b>Vincent</b> plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist <b>Vincent</b> with the birth of his son on the Russells' kitchen table after Eve explains everything about <b>Vincent</b> and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with <b>Vincent</b> (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal dinner for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, <b>Vincent</b> and Viki kill all the guests with a poison mushroom sauce, but Tabitha gives up her powers and becomes a born again Christian in order to resurrect everyone. <b>Vincent</b> is last seen being arrested by Chief of Police Sam Bennett. Since T. C. Russell, Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and <b>Vincent</b> are the only two members of the Russell family to appear in the series finale.|$|E
5|$|Players can unlock <b>Vincent</b> by {{the halfway}} point of Final Fantasy VII, when Cloud Strife and his allies find him {{sleeping}} in a coffin {{in the basement of}} Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim. Cloud mentions his quest to stop the game's antagonist, Sephiroth, who <b>Vincent</b> recognizes as the son of Lucrecia Crescent. <b>Vincent</b> joins the group when he learns that they may eventually meet up with Hojo, against whom <b>Vincent</b> has an unexplained vendetta. Later, <b>Vincent</b> finds Lucrecia inside a cave, and his backstory is partly revealed. <b>Vincent</b> {{was a member of the}} Turks, an elite group of Shinra agents. While serving as Lucrecia's guard, he fell in love with her, but she ultimately decided to remain faithful to Hojo, who persuaded her to use her unborn baby in his experiments. When protesting about the nature of these experiments, <b>Vincent</b> was shot by Hojo, who subsequently began to experiment on him as well. This resulted in him not aging and having the ability to transform in various demons. Not being able to protect Lucrecia, <b>Vincent</b> felt a strong guilt which led him to his isolation. Overcome by guilt, Lucrecia sealed herself away in Mako crystals. Upon entering the cave in the game, Lucrecia revives and asks <b>Vincent</b> if Sephiroth is still alive, but <b>Vincent</b> lies and tells her that he is dead.|$|E

5|$|The game begins {{during the}} climax of Final Fantasy VII. As <b>Vincent</b> and Yuffie Kisaragi help to {{evacuate}} Midgar, which {{is about to be}} destroyed by Sephiroth's Meteor spell, <b>Vincent</b> finds the body of Professor Hojo slumped at the controls of the Sister Ray cannon.

5|$|Unbeknownst to Whitney, Chad {{previously}} began {{a sexual}} relationship with the tabloid reporter <b>Vincent</b> Clarkson at an unspecified time around the Vendetta plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that <b>Vincent</b> is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making <b>Vincent</b> his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that <b>Vincent</b> is intersex, and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald and Noah Bennett, Chad repeatedly insists that he is not gay, and that his relationship with <b>Vincent</b> is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, <b>Vincent</b> engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees <b>Vincent</b> and Chad having sex {{in the back of a}} gay bar; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from <b>Vincent.</b> The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and Ethan Winthrop reunite, but that possibility is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.|$|E

He is surprised to find Weiss slumped in his chair, dead. However, as Omega begins to manifest itself, Weiss seems to revive, and confronts <b>Vincent.</b> It is revealed that Weiss is possessed by Hojo; before Hojo was killed in the Mako Cannon three years earlier, he uploaded his consciousness into the Worldwide Network, then took possession of Weiss's body while he was online attempting to find a cure for the virus with which the Restrictors had infected him. Hojo/Weiss and <b>Vincent</b> battle to a standstill. However Nero, who had been defeated earlier by <b>Vincent,</b> emerges from the Lifestream and destroys Hojo. Nero then merges with Weiss in order to help him fuse with Omega, just as <b>Vincent</b> is fused with Chaos.|$|E

After the group reunites, it is determined that <b>Vincent</b> will spread the nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft spread the antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. Spike and Elektra separately head to confront <b>Vincent.</b> Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them.

5|$|After the show's {{transition}} from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with <b>Vincent.</b> Believed dead, <b>Vincent</b> reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she relapses, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. <b>Vincent</b> arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. <b>Vincent</b> plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and an erection might kill him.

He returns the next day to find that Fatboy has not been discovered, and from how scared Fatboy is, realises something is wrong. Fatboy opens up about the fact his mother used to lock him up for extended periods of time, which led to him assuming the comedic persona of 'Fatboy'. <b>Vincent</b> convinces him to use his real name, Arthur, again, and gives him a job as DJ at his bar The Albert as long as he no longer puts on a false persona, starting with admitting to Donna that he will now be showing his true self to her.
