40|$|The North endcap {{calorimeter}} {{vessel was}} recieved on July 1, 1990. A cooldown {{of the pressure}} vessel with liquid nitrogen was performed on July 10 - 11 to check the vessel's integrity. With the pressure vessel cold, the insulating vacuum was monitored for leaks. Through out the testing, the insulating vacuum remained good and the vessel passed the test. The cold test was carried out per the procedures of D-Zero engineering note 3740. 220 -EN- 250. The test was {{very similar to the}} cold test performed on the Central Calorimeter in October of 1987. Reference D-Zero engineering notes 3740. 210 -EN- 122, 3740. 000 -EN 107, and 3740. 210 -EN- 110 for information about the CC cold test. The insulating vacuum space was pumped on while equipment was being connected to the pressure vessel. Two hours after starting to pump with the blower the vacuum space pressure was at about 210 microns. Pumping on the vacuum space for the next 15 hours showed no progress and a leak detector was connected to the pumping line. A leak check showed a leak in a thermocouple feedthru on the <b>vacuum</b> space <b>relief</b> plate. After fixing the leak, the pressure dropped to 16 microns in less than one hour. A rate of rise test was performed starting at a pressure of 13 microns. The pressure rose to 39 microns within 8 minutes and then only rose to 43 microns in 2. 5 hours (1. 6 microns/hour). After all connections were made to the pressure vessel, a vacuum pump with an estimated effective pumping speed of about 70 scfm was valved on. The lowest pressure achieved after 2 days of pumping was 80 microns. Valving out the pump for 30 minutes resulted in a 5 micron per minute rate of rise. The rate of rise was considered acceptable since there were known leak paths through the bolts of the signal ports. The EC North vessel was rolled outside of Lab A in preparation for a 5000 gallon liquid nitrogen trailer which arrived July, 10 at 8 : 00 am. Before filling the vessel, the vacuum space pump was valved off. The pressure in the vacuum space was 12 microns at that point. During the next 24 hours of the test, the vacuum space pressure decreased to 5 microns. A plot of the vacuum space pressure with time is included {{at the end of this}} note. The liquid nitrogen was pressure transferred from the trailer at 29 psig to the pressure vessel at 1 psig for ten hours. At that time there was sufficient (16 -inch) of liquid nitrogen in the vessel to turn the LN 2 trailer delivery pump on. Thirteen and one half hours after starting the fill, the vessel had 50 -inch of LN 2 collected. During the latter part of the filling, about twelve loud metallic bangs were heard. The noises came at random intervals with sometimes five minutes between and other times an hour between. The best way to describe the sound is to imagine the sound made if someone was trapped inside the vessel with a baseball bat and took a good swing. The trailer was disconnected and the the vessel was left overnight for ten hours. Due to the slow LN 2 fill rate, the temperature gradient in the pressure vessel shell was not very large, only about 25 kelvin difference was found from a RTD in the warm-up nozzle of the vessel and the resistors of the liquid level probe. A temperature versus time graph is included at the end of this note...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, when an {{upstream}} valve in a pipe closes, water downstream of the valve attempts to continue flowing creating a vacuum that may cause the pipe to collapse or implode. This {{problem can be}} particularly acute if the pipe is on a downhill slope. To prevent this, air and <b>vacuum</b> <b>relief</b> valves or air vents are installed just downstream of the valve to allow air to enter the line to prevent this vacuum from occurring.|$|E
50|$|Thief hatch, {{also known}} as a gauge hatch, is a term given to a close-able {{aperture}} on a tank or vessel used in the oil and gas industry. These hatches are placed in atmospheric or low pressure tanks in order to allow for level or sample measurements and to provide <b>vacuum</b> <b>relief</b> to the vessel. Thief hatches are also used in gauge tanks and in transport vehicles where they must be opened to the atmosphere to take measurements and samples. Flash gas is readily leaked whenever these hatches are opened and therefore they can pose a problem in terms of emissions. There have also been reports of fatalities caused by manual tank gauging and sampling via thief hatches.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes {{called a}} check valve or a {{backflow}} preventer, a chemigation valve is an apparatus designed to protect water supplies from agricultural chemicals used during chemigation, the application of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides through irrigation water. [...] Most chemigation valves consist of a spring-loaded check valve, a low pressure drain, an air and <b>vacuum</b> <b>relief</b> valve, and an injection port for introducing the chemicals downstream of the check valve. Many chemigation valves also have a 4-inch inspection port so that a person can reach inside and feel if the check valve is still functional. Some governments {{require the use of}} two chemigation valves installed in series if hazardous chemicals are to be injected.|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} of the fission product control systems and structures are reviewed to (a) {{provide a basis for}} developing the mathematical model for design basis loss-of-coolant accident dose computations, (b) verify that the values of certain key parameters are within pre-established limits, (c) confirm the applicability of important modeling assumptions, and (d) verify the functional capability of ventilation systems used to control fission product releases. The parameters which must be established for use in the calculation of the radio-logical consequences of accidents in Chapter 15, and the systems whose functions must be reviewed are outlined below. Many of these areas are the responsibility of other branches and are reviewed by the AEB to provide a general knowledge of the containment systems and their operation following a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). The following areas are reviewed: 1. Primary Containment Design Primary containment characteristics of (1) the containment isolation times and methods, (2) leak rates prior to and following containment isolation if venting, <b>vacuum</b> <b>relief</b> or purging of the containment is permitted (by technical specification) during operation, (3) total and mixing volumes to be assumed from the recirculation characteristics given in safety analysis reports, and (4) the efficiencies of the ESF filters used for post-accident ventilation. The dose mitigating function of the pressure suppression devices, e. g., subatmospheric operation, suppression pools, is described in Sec-tions 6. 2. 1 and 6. 2. 2 of the SAR. The existence and operation of pressure suppression devices should be determined since their existenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of the suppression-chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers is to relieve vacuum in the drywell. There are four vacuum breakers located outside the primary containment which form {{an extension of the}} primary containment boundary. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>relief</b> valves are mounted in special piping between the drywell and the suppression chamber, which allow air and steam flow from the suppression chamber to the drywell when the drywell is at a negative pressure with respect to the suppression chamber. Therefore, suppression chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers prevent an excessive negative differential pressure across the wetwell drywell boundary. Each vacuum breaker is a self actuating valve with one vacuum breaker in each line. Manual isolation valves are located on each side of each vacuum breaker. A negative differential pressure across the drywell wall is caused by rapid depressurization of the drywell. Events that cause this rapid depressurization are cooling cycles, inadvertent drywell spray actuation, and steam condensation from sprays or subcooled water reflood of a break {{in the event of a}} primary system rupture. Cooling cycles result in minor pressure transients in the drywell that occur slowly and are normally controlled by heating and ventilation equipment. Spray actuation or spill of subcooled water out of a break results in more significant pressure transients and becomes important in sizing the vacuum breakers. In the event of a primary system rupture, steam condensation within the drywell results in the most severe pressure transient. Following a primary system rupture, air in the drywell is purged into the suppression chamber free airspace, leaving the drywell full of steam. Subsequent condensation of the steam can be caused in two possible ways, namely, Emergency Core Cooling Systems flow from a recirculation line break, or drywell spray actuation following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These two cases determine the maximum depressurization rate of the drywell...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A suite of models were integrated to predict the potential of a large liquid hydrocarbon storage tank fire escalating and involving neighbouring tanks, {{as a result of}} thermal loading. A steady state pool fire radiant heat model was combined with a further model, in order to predict the distribution of thermal loading over the surface of an adjacent tank, and another model was incorporated to predict the thermal response of the contents of the adjacent tank. In order to predict if, or when, an adjacent tank will ignite, the radiant heat from the fire received by the adjacent tank must be quantified. There are a range of mathematical models available in the literature to calculate the radiant heat flux to a specified target and each of these models is based on assumptions about the fire. The performance of three of these models, which vary in complication, was analysed (the single point source model, the solid flame model and the fire dynamics simulator computational fluid dynamics model) and, {{in order to determine the}} performance of each model, the predictions made by each of the models were compared with actual experimental measurements of radiant heat flux. Experiments were undertaken involving different liquid fuels and under a range of weather conditions and, upon comparing the predictions of the models with the experimental measurements, the solid flame model was found to be the one most appropriate for safety assessment work. Thus, the solid flame model was incorporated into the thermal loading model, in order to predict the distribution of radiant heat flux falling onto an adjacent tank wall and roof. A model was developed to predict the thermal response of the contents of an adjacent tank, in order to predict variations in the liquid and vapour temperature, any increase in the vapour space pressure and the evolution of the vapours within the given time and the distribution of thermal loading over the surface of the tank as predicted by previous models; of particular importance was the identification of the possibility of forming a flammable vapour/air mixture outside the adjacent tank. To assess the performance of the response model, experiments were undertaken at both laboratory and field scale. The laboratory experiments were conducted in the Chemical Engineering Laboratory at Loughborough University and required the design and construction of an experimental facility representing a small-scale storage tank exposed to an adjacent fire. The field scale experiments were undertaken at Centro Jovellanos, Asturias, Spain. An experimental vessel was designed and fabricated specifically to conduct the laboratory tests and to measure the response of a tank containing hydrocarbon liquids to an external heat load. The vessel was instrumented with a network of thermocouples and pressure transmitter and gauge, in order to monitor the internal pressure and distribution in temperature throughout the liquid and its variation with time. The model predicting the thermal response of an adjacent tank was shown to produce predictions that correlated with the experimental results, particularly in terms of the vapour space pressure and liquid surface temperature. The vapour space pressure is important in predicting the time when the vacuum/pressure valve opens, while the liquid surface temperature is important as it governs the rate of evaporation. Combining the three models (the Pool Fire model, the Thermal Loading model and the Response model) forms the basis of the storage tanks spacing international codes and presents a number of innovative features, in terms of assessing the response to an adjacent tank fire: such features include predicting the distribution of thermal load on tanks adjacent to the tank on fire and thermal load on the ground. These models can predict the time required for the opening of the pressure <b>vacuum</b> <b>relief</b> valve on adjacent tanks and the release of the flammable vapour/air mixture into the atmosphere. A wide range of design and fire protection alternatives, such as the water cooling system and the minimum separation distance between storage tanks, can be assessed using these models. The subsequent results will help to identify any recommended improvements in the design of facilities and management systems (inspection and maintenance), in addition to the fire fighting response to such fires...|$|E
