40|$|Recent works {{show that}} {{wholesale}} exporters play {{a large role}} in international trade. Wholesalers provide intermediate services for manufacturers and account for a substantial portion of total export <b>values</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy,</b> Japan, and the United States. This study seeks to provide the first evidence on the link between firm productivity and exports by wholesalers, using Japanese firm-level data. Empirical analysis reveals that wholesale firms are heterogeneous and that exporters are more productive than non-exporters in the wholesale sector, as is seen in the manufacturing sector. In addition, the analysis provides the evidence that exporters with foreign subsidiaries tend to be more productive than those without and that they outperform the latter in terms of other measures such as average exports, export-sales ratio, and the extensive margin of exports. These results are in line with the firm heterogeneity model of exports and are similar with the previous empirical studies on manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|Aim  The aims of {{this study}} are: (1) to explore the {{relationships}} between the Ellenberg indicator values (light, temperature and moisture) recently developed for two Mediterranean regions (Italy and Greece); and (2) to evaluate the possibility of using these values in other Mediterranean areas. Location  Southern Greece and the Mediterranean part of Italy. Methods  A global matrix containing 966 items of information (161 species × 3 indicator variables × 2 values assigned in each study, one in Italy and one in Greece) was constructed. A test of the accuracy of the values in predicting actual environmental conditions was provided using a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) on published vegetation relevés from the Mediterranean region. The gamma statistic was used to express relationships of ecological indicator values between the two regions, and pairs of indicator values calculated for each species were compared using Wilcoxon matched pairs tests. Results  The results showed that indices developed for Greece and Italy were not similarly correlated to sample scores along DCA axis 1. Species’ indicator <b>values</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> and for Greece were highly significantly correlated for light and moisture and significantly correlated for temperature, but the correlations were weak (0. 20 ≤ gamma ≤ 0. 31). Pairwise testing gave significantly different indicator values for the two regions. Discrepancies below or equal to 2 units on 9 -point scales (12 points for moisture) were found for 88 %, 70 % and 54 % of the species respectively for light, temperature and moisture indices. A substantial number of species showed higher discrepancies, from 3 up to 6 units. Main conclusions  In the light of the present work, it seems clear that the indicator values developed for Italy and for Greece should not be used outside the region for which they were defined. This constitutes additional evidence that indicator values can be influenced by the identity of potential competitors. It also underlines the need to use standardized methods for calibrating indicator values against measured variables {{in such a way that}} indicator systems can serve as general reference systems.

A particular focus has been dedicated to the applications devoted to cultural heritage which have an important historic, strategic and economic <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy.</b> Two specific cases, the first related to the permanent monitoring of an historical masonry Basilica and the second regarding the dynamic testing of a modern structure, have been presented {{as a basis for}} specific discussion...|$|R
40|$|Large {{urban systems}} can be {{considered}} as the final point of convergence of resources, environmental services and human activities from rural settlements to villages to towns to small and big cities. The emergy synthesis method is applied in order to capture the complexity of urban systems {{from the point of view}} of the larger scale, the geobiosphere, where resources come from. Emergy is the total available energy of one kind (usually solar) directly or indirectly used up to drive a system or a process. It {{can be considered as}} a measure of a system's demand for environmental support. The population of Rome is 4. 43 % of total Italian population, with an emergy use of about 4 % of total emergy supporting the Italian economy. Emergy use per capita is 5. 50 E+ 16 seJ/year, compared to an average <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> of 3. 60 E+ 16 seJ/year. An empower density of 1. 09 E+ 14 seJ/m(2) /year was calculated for Rome, much higher than <b>for</b> average <b>Italy,</b> 6. 86 E+ 12 seJ/m(2) /year. Finally, the emergy/GDP, an indirect measure of economic performance of the system, is 2. 43 E+ 12 seJ/(sic) for Rome compared to 1. 64 E+ 12 seJ/(sic) <b>for</b> <b>Italy,</b> suggesting that in an urban system (generally characterized by a larger fraction of tertiary activities) the required environmental support for the generation of economic results is much higher than for the whole economic system. Finally, comparison of above performance indicators with similar studies published by other authors (Taipei, San Juan and Macao) points out that Rome has the highest annual emergy per capita (suggesting higher potential standard of living).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} statistical reconstructions of {{the industrial}} labor force in post-Unification Italy. The estimates {{are based on the}} population censuses taken in 1871, 1881, 1901, and 1911. The figures are presented <b>for</b> each of <b>Italy’s</b> 69 provinces, separately by gender. Industry, as is customary in the literature, is defined so to include four major components: mining, manufacturing, construction, and utilities. Manufacturing is in turn broken down into 12 sectors. Some of the limits of population censuses, including their questionable representation of the labor force in the textile sector, are briefly summarized. The paper focuses then on possible uses of the proposed labor force estimates. It is in particular shown that, despite their known limits, population censuses represent a useful historical source to obtain legitimate estimates of provincial <b>value</b> added <b>for</b> <b>Italy’s</b> industry. The present contribution, that aims at stimulating the quantitative debate on Italian industry and industrialization at the local level, ends by presenting tentative directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Alien species, {{particularly}} when invasive, {{are likely to}} represent a major issue when dealing with biodiversity even though their impact at the ecosystem level needs to be better understood and quantified. Anyway, their spread affects almost all the ecosystems, and the trend of this phenomenon seems to increase at global scale. Here, we present a first attempt to a quantitative description of the invasiveness of habitat and ecosystem types in Italy through the facilities of the European Research Infrastructure on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research LifeWatch. The study is adopting an ecosystem level approach {{in order to assess}} the fragility of key EUNIS ecosystem/habitat types to alien species. Ecological modelling and geospatial statistics are used to evaluate abiotic conditional factors of the fragility of the most widespread EUNIS ecosystem types along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in Europe and to map ecosystems fragility at the national and European scale. Ninety-six sites from Italy have been processed and encompassed in 41 habitats (level 2, EUNIS code). Available taxonomical data are referred to about 19, 650 records; 10, 600 taxa; 10, 050 species. The trait "alien species" is going to be harmonized among different taxonomic groups at both geographical and temporal scale. At present, however, the alien trait has been attributed to about 4 % of the species data sets, whereas the mean <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> is around 3 %. The incidence of alien species greatly varies in different environments/habitats, with highest values in terrestrial and freshwater habitats and lowest in marine habitats. Marked differences also occur among different taxonomical groups, with highest incidence of alien species among terrestrial vegetables and vertebrates, lowest for less known groups such as invertebrates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} market {{valuation}} of R&D in Denmark for 1989 - 2001, {{adding to the}} limited number of studies of countries outside of the US or the UK. In terms of financial systems or ownership structure, Denmark can be seen as an intermediate case between Anglo-Saxon models in the US and the UK and large continental European countries such as France, Germany and Italy. In order to facilitate international comparison, the analysis follows Hall and Oriani (2006), and it is found that the relative shadow <b>value</b> of R&D <b>for</b> Denmark is larger than comparable <b>values</b> <b>for</b> France, Germany, <b>Italy</b> and the US, and similar to those for the UK. Though, while relative shadow values are high overall, shadow values are substantially lower for firms with high R&D intensity. The role of ownership structure is also examined and it is found, in contrast to comparable results <b>for</b> France and <b>Italy,</b> that R&D is actually valued more highly in Danish firms with a single large shareholder. It is argued that this difference may be due to greater investor protection in Denmark. Market valuation, R&D, Knowledge capital, Intangible assets, Ownership structure,...|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Sect.  2, a basic {{element of the}} German model is a relatively long job tenure. Using OECD data mainly based on the European Labor Force Survey, I calculated {{the share of the}} labor force employed for at least 10 years for a number of countries. Figure  10 shows the results for 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2012. In a broad classification, the countries can be divided into three groups: (i) short-tenure countries like Australia, Canada and Denmark; (ii) an intermediate group including Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom; (iii) and long-tenure countries like Japan, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Note that the results for Germany in the 1990 s and early 2000 s are likely to be biased because German re-unification interrupted the careers of many East German workers. If this potential bias is taken into consideration, Germany clearly belongs to the high-tenure category of countries. In 2012, approximately 41 [*]% of German workers had held their job positions for at least 10 years. This is lower than the <b>values</b> found <b>for</b> <b>Italy</b> (46 [*]%) and Belgium (42 [*]%), but markedly higher than in Australia (24 [*]%), Canada (28 [*]%) or the United Kingdom (31 [*]%). In the German case, there was an overall upward trend in the share of the workforce with a long tenure. Hence, {{there is no indication that}} labor market reforms changed the fact that the German model relies on a significant part of the workforce experiencing a high level of job stability. If anything, employment duration and tenure have increased, not decreased. A closer look at the empirical evidence shows, however, that this is not the case for all groups of workers. Especially for young workers in general and young low-skilled workers in particular, the average length of an employment spell has declined markedly.|$|R
