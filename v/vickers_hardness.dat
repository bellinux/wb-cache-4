5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the <b>Vickers</b> <b>hardness</b> test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

The mixing ratio of Si-SiC composite nanoparticle to micron-sized SiC was optimized to 10  wt%. <b>Vicker’s</b> <b>hardness</b> and relative density was increased with increasing sintering temperature and holding time. The relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> <b>hardness</b> was further increased by reaction bonding using additional activated carbon to the mixture of micron-sized SiC and nano-sized Si-SiC.

Nano-sized Si-SiC composite powder, having 20 – 70  nm particle size, was prepared by non-transferred arc thermal plasma process. Sintered SiC pellets were prepared by SPS process using the mixture with different ratio of micron-sized SiC powder and nano-sized Si-SiC composite particle as a sintering additive. At a fixed ratio of micron-sized SiC and nano-sized Si-SiC (90 : 10), the relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> <b>hardness</b> increased with increasing sintering temperature and holding time. The maximum relative density (88.2 %) and <b>Vicker’s</b> <b>hardness</b> (21.2) were recorded at 1800  °C sintering temperature for 1  min holding time. The relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> <b>hardness</b> was further increased by addition of extra activated carbon to {{the mixture of}} micron-sized SiC and nano-sized Si-SiC. The relative density and <b>Vicker’s</b> <b>hardness</b> were increased to 97.1 % and 31.4  GPa, respectively, {{with the addition of}} 0.2  wt% of extra activated carbon to the SiC/Si-SiC mixture. It was found that the nano-size effect of Si-SiC composite particle and the exothermic nature of silicon–carbon reaction bonding were responsible for the increase in relative density and hardness. Therefore, it was suggested that the nano-sized Si-SiC composite particle could be a promising additive for sintering of SiC ceramics.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} phase stability, mechanical, electronic, optical {{properties}} and <b>Vicker's</b> <b>hardness</b> {{of the newly}} predicted layered compound V 4 SiC 3 using the first-principles method. This hypothetical compound is found to possess higher bulk modulus as well as higher hardness than those of a similar V 4 AlC 3. The Mulliken bond population analysis indicates that the substitution of Al atom with the Si atom increases the <b>Vicker's</b> <b>hardness</b> of this compound. The electronic band structure shows that the conductivity is metallic and the main contribution comes from V 3 d states. The partial density of states (PDOS) shows that the hybridization peak of V 3 d and C 2 s lies lower in energy than that of V 3 d and Si 3 p states {{which suggests that the}} V 3 d - C 2 s bond is stronger than the V 3 d - Si 3 p bond. The results are consistent with our bond analysis. Further we have discussed the origin of the features that appear in the optical properties. V 4 SiC 3 is seen as a promising dielectric material showing a much better candidate material as a coating to avoid solar heating than those of V 4 AlC 3, α-Nb 4 SiC 3 and Ti 4 AlN 3 compounds.
