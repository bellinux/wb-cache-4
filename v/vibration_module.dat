40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the possible solution for the supply of electric energy to autonomous systems in a well via <b>vibration</b> harvesting <b>modules.</b> Some autonomous systems such as pressure/temperature sensors located for example in the B-annulus, should be powered in order to function. This represents a significant challenge in in subsea wells, since penetrations in subsea wellheads are not allowed by the current standards such as API 17 D. One of the solutions to the power supply challenge is to use energy harvesting modules. Since during drilling and production phases multiple sources of vibrations are present these modules can potentially be used. The use of <b>vibration</b> harvesting <b>modules</b> for powering autonomous sensors in inaccessible locations can potentially decrease complexity of monitoring systems, significantly reduce installation time and costs. In order to identify to what extend the <b>vibration</b> harvesting <b>module</b> {{can be used for}} the power supply an experiment of using the <b>Vibration</b> Harvesting <b>Module</b> (VHM) is performed. The experiment setup which was used to estimate certain parameters of the <b>vibration</b> harvesting <b>module,</b> calculations justifying the choice of equipment and experimental procedure are provided in the thesis. The experiments consisted of three parts: two experiments with induced vibrations by using two different vibration motors and one experiment with natural oscillations. It was concluded that natural oscillations test can give such important characteristics of the system as resonance frequency and Q-factor. By using these parameters the effective range of the <b>vibration</b> harvesting <b>module</b> can be estimated. Information concerning internal resistance and power output can be obtained only by testing, as it was demonstrated. Resonance frequency and effective operation range were obtained by two different tests and results of those tests were comparatively similar. It has been demonstrated that while Thevenin’s equivalent can quite accurately describe power output characteristics this mathematical model fails to describe internal resonance due to its dependency on a current. Many other factors should be studied in order to properly describe both power output and internal resistance using the same model...|$|R

Both technologies use miniature cameras that are mounted on a pair of glasses worn by the user who is blind. The Haptic Belt provides vibrations that convey the direction and distance at which a person is {{standing in front of a}} user, while the VibroGlove uses spatio-temporal mapping of vibration patterns to convey facial expressions of the interaction partner. Alternatively, it has been shown that even very simple cues indicating the presence or absence of obstacles (through small <b>vibration</b> <b>modules</b> located at strategic places in the body) can be useful for navigation, gait stabilization and reduced anxiety when evolving in an unknown space.

40|$|The {{precision}} of feed drive systems depends strongly on the frictional behaviour of the bearing elements. Friction has two effects onto the feed drive system, {{on the one}} hand it improves the damping and reduces vibrations {{and on the other hand}} it induces nonlinear effects that affect the motion quality in terms of precision and smoothness. In this thesis, an idea is investigated that uses the good damping properties of sliding bearings and improves their frictional behaviour using high frequency oscillations. The phenomenon that friction is reduced in the presence of high-frequency oscillations was observed in various experiments since the 1950 ’s and found its way into industrial applications such as ultrasonic deep drawing, drilling, grinding and cutting. However, the idea to use this effect to come up with new bearing elements has not been investigated yet. The goal of this thesis is to develop a systematic design for sliding bearings that allow high-frequency oscillations. The theory of friction in the presence of vibrations is used to investigate the influence of vibration and motion parameters such as longitudinal, transversal, angluar and higher harmonic vibrations onto the friction force. Chapter 4 introduces the basic setup of high-frequency sliding bearings containing a <b>vibration</b> <b>module</b> with actuator resonator and sliding elements. Basic design principles for the different components are developed in Chapter 5. The design of the resonator plays a key role in transmitting the vibrations from the actuator to the sliding elements. The design is based either on a two-mass model or as an waveguide depending on the dimension of the bearing. An demonstrator is developed in Chapter 6 using FEM to optimize the stiffness an vibration characteristics of the bearing. Chapter 7 presents the results of experimental investigations of the vibrational and frictional properties of the developed bearing elements. It is shown, that the sliding and static friction can be reduced significantly and that the frictional force can be controlled using the acutator voltage and frequency. Thus, it is possible to actively design the frictional behaviour of the bearing element, giving the possibility to linearize the friction and thereby changing the damping and linearity properties of the bearing. Using this effects, experiments are made that show that the friction control allows to minimize and even eleminate the appearing of stick-slip during movement...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the seismic vibration effects on two-phase flow. Based on the seismic characteristics found in literature, the properties for designing a test facility to simulate vibration and the test conditions for adiabatic and diabatic (subcooled boiling) two-phase flows have been chosen. In order to perform this experiment, an annulus test section has been built and attached to a <b>vibration</b> <b>module.</b> For experimental investigation and visualization of two-phase flow, Pyrex-glass tubes have been utilized as a transparent test section and stainless steel instrumentation ports are designed to acquire experimental data. In the design process, calculations considering the resonance, natural frequency, structural deflection, material properties and vibration conditions for the vibration structure have been performed to choose a suitable vibration beam. The motion equations of the eccentric cam are also analyzed with respect to displacement (vibration amplitude), velocity and acceleration. Each design process is set for the goal of an economical, reliable and controllable vibration condition for the two-phase flow test section. In addition, the scaling laws for geometric similarity, hydrodynamic similarity and thermal similarity {{are taken into account}} for the annulus test section to simulate a fuel assembly sub-channel of a prototypic boiling water reactor (BWR). ^ Potential hydrodynamic and thermal effects for two-phase flow under seismic vibration are broken down and analyzed in detail. Based on the 1 -D drift-flux model, the hydrodynamics effects are discussed with respect to the possible variations of distribution parameters, C 0, and drift velocity, 3 ̆c 3 ̆cνgj 3 ̆e 3 ̆e, caused by the changes of the void distribution, bubble diameter and flow regimes. Sensitivity studies are carried out for analyzing these potential hydrodynamic effects. In addition, the void generation relations in a diabatic (subcooled boiling) two-phase flow system are taken into account for analyses of potential thermal effects, including the onset of nucleate boiling and onset of significant void (ONB-OSV) effect, wall nucleation effect and bulk phase change effect. Analyses of phenomenological changes and temperature distributions are performed for estimations of void changes due to vibration. ^ An extensive 1 -D experimental database is assembled for adiabatic and subcooled boiling two-phase flow under stationary and vibration conditions. The adiabatic test results are used to examine and verify the potential hydrodynamic effects, whereas the subcooled boiling test results are compared and explained by proposed thermal effects. Several vibration effect maps were made in terms of flow conditions (3 ̆cjg 3 ̆e- 3 ̆cj f 3 ̆e), thermal conditions (NZu-N Sub), operation conditions (3 ̆cj f 3 ̆e- 3 ̆cα 3 ̆e) and vibration conditions (E-f and f-α) for adiabatic and subcooled boiling two-phase flow tests. Among these vibration effect maps, different effective vibration conditions and dominant effects can be seen by regions. In the 3 ̆cjg 3 ̆e- 3 ̆c jf 3 ̆e plots of adiabatic two-phase flow tests, the hydrodynamic effect is found to dominate. The void fraction is found to potentially decrease due to vibration in wall-peak bubbly flow regime and increase at the region close to bubbly-to-slug transition boundary. No significant change in void fraction is found in slug flow regime under vibration. In addition, the thermal effect due to vibration is presented on the NZu- NSub plots. Three regions representing void increase, no change and void decrease which are corresponding to thick thermal boundary layer (TBL), bulk saturation and near saturation with low flow and high subcooling conditions are presented for subcooled boiling flow under seismic vibration. Finally, the E-f and f- α plots express the effective vibration conditions for adiabatic and subcooled boiling flows, and the acceleration values are compared with existing earthquake intensity records. In summary, a systematic database covering wide ranges of seismic vibration conditions along with adiabatic/diabatic flow/thermal conditions has been built in this study, and the physical understanding of seismic vibration effect on two-phase flow has been developed based on the analyses of potential hydrodynamic and thermal effects. Several vibration effect maps on different planes have been proposed as important conclusions for seismic vibration effects on two-phase flow systems. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this project has been to explore {{practical}} applications of radiation dose optimisation in the clinical setting of the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. The relevance of interventional procedures and hence fluoroscopy, to modern cardiology practice, is illustrated, and the clinical significance of radiation dose management outlined. Current radiation dose management techniques, {{as well as the}} proposals for further dose optimisation, are detailed in this thesis. The first experiment in this project aims to establish an automated method of data collection for the monitoring of radiation dose optimisation techniques. A combination of open source programming languages and database management software has been used to create software that receives information directly from the fluoroscopic systems following patient procedures in the form of Radiation Dose Structured reports. All information about radiation exposure as well as study type, length and patient demographics are collected and stored. A further application of the software is to calculate the patient skin dose to monitor the likelihood of adverse tissue reactions following any high dose procedures. This information is then analysed and disseminated to operators to drive radiation dose optimisation. The second experiment in this project assessed the accuracy of the reported radiation dose metrics for different manufacturers collected in the above experiment. Fluoroscopic units used for cardiac catheterisation procedures are tested routinely for compliance. However, under Australian regulations, it is not required to validate certain metrics that impact on patient dose management. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of standard DICOM values used in patient dose calculations through direct measurement. The results indicate that the accuracy of the table height was dependent on the age of the unit, with older units varying by up to 4 cm. The reference air kerma and DAP were all within 10 %. The FOV showed the greatest discrepancy from the directly measured value with up to 20 % inaccuracy. The results of this experiment show that table height, and FOV should be directly measured and accounted for when calculating patient skin dose. This chapter also presents recommendations regarding the frequency and tolerance of testing. The third experiment in this thesis addresses the feasibility of using a novel &lsquo;ultralow&rsquo; fluoroscopic pulse rate during routine diagnostic coronary angiograms. Fluoroscopic pulse rate, one of the factors that influence patient dose in a coronary angiogram, is also under control of the operator and can thus be adjusted accordingly. Literature relating to reduction in fluoroscopic pulse rate as a means of radiation dose optimisation shows positive results. However, the resulting loss of diagnostic clarity has been a limiting factor. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of using an ultra low fluoroscopic pulse rate of 3 pulses per second on procedure duration, diagnostic clarity and radiation dose in an analysis of 50 coronary angiograms performed at a large metropolitan centre. The results showed a statistically significant reduction in DAP (58 %) with no reduction in diagnostic clarity or increase in procedure length. The fourth experiment uses the above results in conjunction with educational talks to practically apply radiation dose optimisation techniques at a large teaching hospital. Dose optimisation is particularly pertinent in teaching hospitals, where longer procedure times may be necessary to accommodate the teaching needs of junior staff, and thus impart a greater dose. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the effects of varying optimisation protocols in conventional coronary angiograms, from the perspective of a large tertiary centre implementing a rapid dose reduction program. Routine coronary angiograms were chosen to compare baseline levels of radiation, and the dose imparted before and after dose optimisation techniques was measured. Such techniques included lowering dose per pulse, pulse rate, frame rate and encouraging larger field of views and collimation. The results showed up to 54 % dose reduction from a lowering of both frame rate and dose per pulse, without any adverse impact on clinical outcomes or teaching of junior staff. The fifth experiment focuses on the radiation exposure received by the operators in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Established research indicates potential long-term harm from low dose protracted radiation exposure to operators of cardiac angiography, with increasing exposure imparting greater risk. This experiment used a phantom model and thermoluminescent dosimeters to measure radiation dose to operators in a conventional coronary angiogram procedure, specifically looking at radiation dose to target regions of the operator to better examine clinical effects. Correspondingly, the results allow for a deduction of a comprehensive list of factors that allow the conversion from readily available patient dose metrics to operator dose. The study also found that basic monitoring using only a single under apron dosimeter underestimates the radiation dose by up to 68 %. Finally, the study provides recommendations to best mitigate the risk of radiation-induced disease through the use of radiation protection tools in high exposure regions of the body. The sixth and final experiment in this thesis outlines the production and evaluation of a real-time radiation dose detector for the purpose of educational simulation and furthering understanding of radiation safety, and eventually clinical applications. Current conventional dose measurement methods, while clinically useful, are usually limited to retrospective analysis of dose only. In the cases where a real-time dose can be measured and displayed, the onus to continually assess the radiation dose visually adds cognitive load to the operator. This project examines the creation of a real-time dose detector that can provide visual, audible and tactile feedback to the interventional cardiologist. The aim of such a device is to provide ongoing feedback to the operator which can result in dose savings to the patient in real time via procedural modifications. A prototype was created and tested, with calibration results showing that detector performance was comparable to available products and comfortable to wear for the operator. The <b>vibration</b> <b>module</b> providing tactile feedback can be programmed to either activate during increased dose rates (thus allowing procedural modifications) or following a set dose threshold, serving as a reminder that the procedure is resulting in a high patient and operator radiation exposure...|$|E

40|$|Developing an {{intelligent}} machine tool means to augment its level of automation. This augmentation, in turn, requires a machine controller {{able to perform}} actions and to implement attributes that are currently demanded to, and hold by, human operators. The present paper describes how this issue is being faced by a large Italian national research project, funded under the Industria 2015 initiative. Considering the case of milling machines, human operators are currently in charge of supervising the cutting process by acting on spindle speed and feed override controls in order to compensate for undesired process conditions (e. g. excessive vibration or power absorption) caused by a wrong choice of process parameters during {{the design of the}} part-program, by tool wear, by unexpected work material properties, or by machine tool dynamics. The first part of the paper proposes the architecture for an augmented-automation machine tool. Rather than revolutionizing the well-established architecture of a conventional machine tool, the concept is based on an additional controller that implements a supervision and optimization loop. This additional controller gets process state information from the CNC and from dedicated measurement systems, and closes a feedback action on the CNC as a human operator would do: by acting on feed and spindle speed overrides. The second part of the paper illustrates how the additional controller works: following the optimal control theory, it is based on a dynamic process model, a set of state variables (i. e. measurements), and a set of controls. Exploiting a simplified process model and efficient optimization algorithms, it performs a real-time optimization of the controls (i. e. the overrides named above) {{on the basis of a}} weighted multi-objective target function and a set of measurements taken from the cutting process (power, forces, accelerations). In particular, the target function takes into account the following objectives: cutting time, work-piece surface finish, tool wear rate and vibration mitigation in general. The third part of the paper details the strategies concerned with tool vibrations prediction, monitoring and mitigation, which are integrated into the optimization loop. A <b>vibrations</b> prediction <b>module</b> based on a simplified cutting process model allows the estimation of the vibration level and/or chatter occurrence during a pre-processing phase: thus, through the computation of the Stability Lobes Diagram along the tool path, the more stable spindle speeds can be identified.

40|$|Abstract: Development of {{light-weight}} {{and small}} diameter arrays has gained importance {{in recent years}} primarily because {{of their ability to}} operate from small and autonomous assets such as AUVs and USVs. Like conventional arrays these arrays are also subjected to platform vibrations, even though the levels could be small, which may tend to limit its acoustic performance. Similarly, knowledge of the hydrodynamic behaviour of the array, such as snaking of the array, is also important because such effects would result in undesirable performances during array beamforming and bearing estimation. Hence it is important to study these effects so that necessary compensations can be applied. For example, to suppress the vibration, suitable <b>vibration</b> isolation <b>module</b> can be built and if the array snakes, then it could be instrumented with suitable sensors for estimating the array shape.

That gives serious physical problem, so called, Reynaud phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a <b>vibration</b> transmissibility reduction <b>module</b> with flexure mechanism for personal tools. At first, we select a target personal tool, grass cutter, and measure the level of vibration transmissibility on the hand. And then, we develop the concept design of the module that has stiffness for reduction the vibration transmissibility more than 20 %, where the vibration transmissibility is measured with an accelerometer. In addition, the vibration reduction can be enhanced when the interior gap between inner and outer body is filled with silicone gel. This will be verified by the further experiment.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{vibration}} on cathode strip chamber operation are analyzed. Gas gain variation and low frequency noise tolerances {{lead to a}} specification of a maximum vibration amplitude for various frequencies. Possible resonant wire vibrations are described. 1 Introduction The cathode strip chambers (CSC's) in the CMS endcap muon system {{may be subject to}} mechanical excitation by acoustic pressure, air flow, or possible water cooling systems. Vibration of a chamber module implies motion of the internal anode wires with respect to the cathode planes, thereby affecting wire gain and generating low frequency electrical noise. In this note, the effects of vibrations on CSC operation are estimated leading to a specification of a maximum amplitude for <b>vibrations</b> of a <b>module.</b> The lowest order module vibrational modes are estimated to have frequencies low compared to the spectrum of wire vibration frequencies and do not lead to large amplitude wire vibration.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} back-analysis {{result of}} a RC building in Ica, Peru which was severely damaged during the Pisco-Chincha Earthquake on 15 Aug 2007. The building was located approximately 120 km from the epicenter. It has 12 spans in E-W direction and 3 spans in N-S direction. It consists of two stories and is separated into two modules at the center which allows independent <b>vibration</b> of each <b>module.</b> During the earthquake, many columns of the building were heavily damaged by shear-flexure-axial interaction. Masonry infill walls shortened the effective length of columns, which resulted in brittle shear failures. Part of the structure was overloaded with partition walls on second floor which might {{have led to the}} crushing of columns below. The analytical model of the building is based on the field measurements. Actual size of structural elements, non-structural elements, and exposed reinforcements were measured during field investigation. Unexposed rebars and material properties are determined considering construction practice. Ground motion recorded at a station located at 0. 5 km from the building site is used as an input to the structure. To investigate the effect of infill walls on shear force demand, two analyses are conducted; with and without infill walls. The analysis results confirmed that shear force demand on columns with infill walls is significantly higher than those without infill walls. In addition the seismic demand with infill wall is larger than the shear force capacity estimated from design equation. It is anticipated that infill walls in the first floor, overload in the second floor, and inadequate stirrups of the columns resulted in the failure of columns...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mechanization rate of dryland crop {{production}} in Korea is about 56 %, {{and especially the}} rate is very low (13. 3 %) for harvesting operation. Recently, precision agriculture technologies including real-time yield monitoring sensors are in demand by female and aged farmers for user comfort. Purpose {{of the study was}} to conduct basic tests of yield monitoring sensors for small-sized Korean potato harvesters. Methods: Candidate sensing modules were selected for mass flow (i. e., load cell) and volume flow (i. e., CCD camera) measurements on the way of potato transportation from the digging part to the collection part. Laboratory test bench was constructed using a commercial potato harvester available in Korea, and the sensing modules were instrumented at the end of the transportation part. Calibration tests were conducted with sample potatoes. Effects of speed of the transportation part, distance between the transportation part and sensing <b>module,</b> <b>vibration</b> and slope of the test body were investigated. Results and discussions: Calibration tests of the mass flow sensor provided fairly good results with R 2 of 0. 95 and RMSE of 11 g. The performance of the mass flow sensor was significantly affected by the number of load cell, and vibration and slope of the test body. The volume-based sensor also showed good results with R 2 of 0. 91 and RMSE of 12 g. The performance was significantly affected by the vibration and slope of the test body. Effects of the speed of the transportation part, and distance between the transportation part and sensing module were not statistically significant within the tested conditions. Conclusion: Both of the mass flow and volume flow approaches showed promising results. Further tests should be conducted to minimize the effects of vibration and slope of the test body, especially considering the harvesting field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Smart adaptronic Elements for Active Vibration ControlThe induced {{vibrations}} of the high-precision machine {{limit the}} achievable required accuracy, such that constrain the performance {{improvement of the}} machine specifications. The main goal {{in the design of}} high precision machines is to enhance the accuracy while increasing productivity. These two design parameters are negatively coupled, as increasing the machine dynamics leads to more induced vibrations, especially with light structure machines. The induced vibrations will limit both the productivity and the accuracy of the machine. Within the scope of this thesis the main motivated question was Could we improve the performance parameters like: precision, accuracy, productivity, and process stability; by design and produce smart adaptronic modules that will be integrated in a modular way within the high precision machines?, This main question has been split to three main tasks (motivated questions to be answered) during the different research activities: 1. When to use active <b>vibration</b> compensation adaptronic <b>modules?</b> 2. How to design the active <b>vibration</b> compensation adaptronic <b>modules?</b> And, 3. How to use the active adaptronic modules? The development of such adaptronic elements is not an easy task, as it requires an extensive knowledge for a number of different scientific fields, which will be discussed at the beginning, followed by a suggested design methodology to develop the adaptronic element. This design methodology is a series of integrated mechatronic concurrent design processes, which will be applied through the different chapters of this thesis. This design approach consists of three main concurrent design phases:· Identification of the adaptronic design problem. · Integrated design of the adaptronic elements within the mechatronic system. · Adaptronic concept validation. As a real practical applications for the different research activities in this thesis, two prototypes of developed adaptronic <b>modules</b> for active <b>vibration</b> compensation will be presented, namely the active 3 DOF stiffness element A 3 DSE (patent no. WO 2011 / 041858 A 2), and the adaptronic smart platform (European project HARCO (FP 7 - 2010 -NMP-ICT-FoF). The first prototype A 3 DSE module is ideally suited for implementing active vibration compensation in the mechanical structure of machine elements, especially struts, that are subjected to axial or/and bending disturbances. According to the used controller strategy, the A 3 DSE is an adaptronic device for active disturbance-rejection and active vibration-damping applications. The design idea of the A 3 DSE is based on the incorporation of three piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated piezoelectric force sensor, which are assembled in an axisymmetrical configuration within a mechanical holding structure, using suitable mechanical and electronic interfaces. The second module is the adaptronic platform, which has been designed as an adaptronic modular interface between the spindle housing and the machine frame of high-precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155, to compensate the vibrations of the cutting tool, to improve the workpiece final surface quality and to reduce the lead time. The working principle is similar to the A 3 DSE, and is based on the incorporation of three powerful high voltage piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated, piezoelectric force sensor in preloaded units, which are distributed in axisymmetrical configuration to connect the movable and the fixed flanges of milling machines spindle. The two developed prototypes will be experimentally tested, using suitable developed test benches, besides testing the first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform on the real high precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155. Active feedback control technique will be implemented in simple straightforward way to present it as an industrial product in the future work. For the A 3 DSE; the results proved the capability of compensating the axial and bending vibration of the active struts where the A 3 DSE module is integrated in. The dimension and maximum stroke of the used piezoelectric actuators represent the most important factors which determine the range of the compensated vibrations. The adaptronic smart platform module has been tested within developed test bench; the used control strategy depends on two different types of possible feedback measured signal. Firstly, using the collocated force feedback signals from the piezoelectric force sensors integrated in the actuating unit with the three piezoelectric actuators. Secondly, using the acceleration feedback signals from three accelerometers collocated with the three actuating units. The experimental results revealed that the two tilting modes could be successfully damped, and the stiffness at the low frequency range has been improved. The first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform has been mounted on the real FIDIA DL 155 high precision milling machine at the workshop of FIDIA s. p. a., San Mauro Torinese, Italy. The preliminary test results succeeded to compensate the tool-tip vibrations over a wide range of rotating speeds, up to 60 % tool tip vibration suppression. For future work, this research {{is considered to be a}} road map covers the full path from identification to controller synthesis and validation, where provided an integrated mechatronic design approach for adaptronic modules. This integrated approach includes: the identification of the adaptronic design problem, the integration of the adaptronic modules within the mechatronic system, and the adaptronic concept validation. It is general methodology which is suitable to apply for different adaptronic modules depend on the case study. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The design {{feasibility}} study is documented {{of a single}} cylinder, free piston Stirling engine/linear alternator (FPSE/LA) power module generating 150 kW-electric (kW sub e), and {{the determination of the}} module's maximum feasible power level. The power module configuration was specified to be a single cylinder (single piston, single displacer) FPSE/LA, with tuning capacitors if required. The design requirements were as follows: (1) Maximum electrical power output; (2) Power module thermal efficiency equal to or greater than 20 percent at a specific mass of 5 to 8 kg/kW(sub e); (3) Heater wall temperature/cooler wall temperature = 1050 K/ 525 K; (4) Sodium heat-pipe heat transport system, pumped loop NaK (sodium-potassium eutectic mixture) rejection system; (5) Maximum power <b>module</b> <b>vibration</b> amplitude = 0. 0038 cm; and (6) Design life = 7 years (60, 000 hr). The results show that a single cylinder FPSE/LA is capable of meeting program goals and has attractive scaling attributes over the power range from 25 to 150 kW(sub e). Scaling beyond the 150 kW(sub e) power level, the power module efficiency falls and the power module specific mass reaches 10 kg/kW(sub e) at a power output of 500 kW(sub e). A discussion of scaling rules for the engine, alternator, and heat transport systems is presented, along with {{a detailed description of the}} conceptual design of a 150 kW(sub e) power module that meets the requirements. Included is a discussion of the design of a dynamic balance system. A parametric study of power module performance conducted over the power output range of 25 to 150 kW(sub e) for temperature ratios of 1. 7, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 is presented and discussed. The results show that as the temperature ratio decreases, the efficiency falls and specific mass increases. At a temperature ratio of 1. 7, the 150 kW(sub e) power module cannot satisfy both efficiency and specific mass goals. As the power level increases from 25 to 150 kW(sub e) at a fixed temperature ratio, power module efficiency is seen to increase slightly, but at the expense of increased specific mass. An empirical equation relating power module thermal efficiency as a function of power module specific mass, power output, and temperature ratio is developed. Alternative configurations to the single cylinder, direct coupled linear alternator approach are also evaluated, but are shown to have technical drawbacks that lessen their attractiveness. The dynamic balance assembly mass (moving mass and structure) represents 20 to 30 percent of the total single cylinder power module mass. Joining two modules in a balanced opposed configuration eliminates the need for the balancer, and a hot end junction can be made without significant addition of structural mass. Recommendations are made for evaluation of advanced heat pipe concepts, tests of radial flow heat exchangers, and evaluation of high temperature alternator materials...|$|R
