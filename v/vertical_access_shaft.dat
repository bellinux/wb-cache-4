Barsanti, seeing that several corridors and chambers were seemingly unfinished and that all were completely devoid of artefacts, deemed that the pyramid had never been used. Shortly after, in 19101911, George Reisner and Clarence S. Fisher worked on the site, excavating {{the north and east}} exteriors of the pyramid as well as the cemeteries surrounding it. The dimensions of the pyramid as estimated by Barsanti, Reisner and Fisher differ greatly and even the numbers of subterranean galleries they report are in disagreement. Unfortunately, the pyramid lies within a restricted military area since 1970 and consequently no excavation has been undertaken there since Reisner and Fisher's superficial work, leaving the structures beneath the pyramid in doubt. Furthermore, the pyramid is now sanded up, hampering modern estimations of its dimensions.|$|E
50|$|Pit tomb- The pit tombs at San Jose de Moro are the {{simplest}} form of burial. They are long, superficial graves that typically contain one individual {{with a few}} burial offerings. Pit tombs appear during later Transitional and Lambayeque occupations of the site with some pit tombs {{dating back to the}} Moche period. Boot-shaped tomb- Boot-shaped tombs are associated with the Middle and Late Moche periods. The tombs usually have a 2m deep <b>vertical</b> <b>access</b> <b>shaft</b> that leads to a horizontal vault or chamber where the deceased individuals are placed along with offerings. After burial, the vault is sealed with an adobe wall; an indicative feature of the boot-shaped tomb.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the LCC itself is cylindrical with hemispherical ends. Walls are of steel-reinforced concrete and approximately 4.5 feet thick. A blast door permits entry into the LCC from the tunnel junction. An escape hatch 3-ft in diameter {{is located at the}} far end of the LCC. The escape hatch and associate tunnel are constructed to withstand weapon effects and allow personnel egress in the event of damage to the <b>vertical</b> <b>access</b> <b>shaft</b> (but the tunnel is sand-filled, which sand will flood the LCC if the hatch at the bottom of the tunnel is opened). Essential LCC launch equipment along with the missile combat crew are located in a shock isolated room suspended within the blast−proof outer structure. The room is steel and suspended as a pendulum by four shock isolators (see picture below).|$|E

25|$|Sub-surface mining {{consists}} of digging tunnels or shafts {{into the earth}} to reach buried ore deposits.

Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels, slope mining uses diagonally sloping <b>access</b> <b>shafts,</b> and <b>shaft</b> mining utilizes <b>vertical</b> <b>access</b> <b>shafts.</b> Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques.|$|R

50|$|The pyramid {{was built}} around a {{framework}} of limestone radial arms, similar to the framework used by Senusret I. Instead of using an infill of stones, mud and mortar, Senusret II used an infill of mud bricks before cladding the structure {{with a layer of}} limestone veneer. The outer cladding stones were locked together using dovetail inserts, some of which still remain. A trench was dug around the central core that was filled with stones to act as a French Drain. The limestone cladding stood in this drain, indicating that Senusret II was concerned with water damage. There were eight mastabas and one small pyramid to the north of Senusret's complex and all were within the enclosure wall. The wall had been encased in limestone that was decorated with niches, perhaps as a copy of Djoser's complex at Saqqara. The mastabas were solid and no chambers have found within or beneath, indicating that they were cenotaphs and possibly symbolic in nature. Flinders Petrie investigated the auxiliary pyramid and found no chambers.The entrances to the underground chambers were on the southern side of the pyramid, which confused Flinders Petrie for some months as he looked for the entrance on the traditional northern side.The builders <b>vertical</b> <b>access</b> <b>shaft</b> had been filled in after construction and the chamber made to look like a burial chamber. This was no doubt an attempt to convince tomb robbers to look no further. A secondary access shaft led to a vaulted chamber and a deep well shaft. This may have been an aspect of the cult of Osiris, although it may have been to find the water table. A passage led northwards, past another lateral chamber and turned westwards. This led to an antechamber and vaulted burial chamber, with a sidechamber to the south. The burial chamber was encircled by a unique series of passages that may have reference to the birth of Osiris. A large sarcophagus was found within the burial chamber; it is larger than the doorway and the tunnels, showing that it was put in position when the chamber was being constructed and it was open to the sky.The limestone outer cladding of the pyramid was removed by Rameses II so he could re-use the stone for his own use. He left inscriptions that he had done so.|$|E

30|$|In Afghanistan, most {{of active}} and {{abandoned}} karezes {{are located on}} the eastern, southern and western flanks of the Hindu Kush (Fig.  3 b). In a study of a local area (Fig.  3 a), an algorithm was designed to automatically locate chahs in a GIS environment. First, visual identification of kariz features (<b>vertical</b> <b>access</b> <b>shafts</b> or chahs) was made using orthophotography and the locations entered in a GIS environment. Karezes in Afghanistan exhibit a surface expression of roughly circular depressions ringed by piles of sediment, chahs, that lead to a surface canal delivering water to a village (Figs.  1, 2). Active and abandoned chahs were distinguished by considering whether the holes appeared open or collapsed.|$|R

30|$|An ancient {{water supply}} system, called kariz in Afghanistan, has supplied, until recently, {{low-cost}} and well-timed water to rural families and family groups in Afghanistan. A kariz is a sub-horizontal tunnel that is hand-dug in alluvial fans flanking the Hindu Kush. An average kariz is about 1  km long and 1  m 2 in cross-section in Afghanistan, with <b>vertical</b> <b>access</b> <b>shafts</b> visible in {{many kinds of}} remotely sensed images. The tunnels have gradients of about 1  m km− 1, allowing gravity flow of water that minimizes damage to the structure by physical erosion of the tunnel floor and walls. Recently, many of these karezes have gone dry. Preservation of the water supply, {{as well as of}} the cultural significance of these old structures, provides a justification for a deeper understanding of how they function to produce water. This study includes modeling the delivery of water to a theoretical kariz using Visual MODFLOW, with a representative kariz discharge rate as a means of calibrating the model. Our work shows that a successful model is strongly controlled by choice of hydraulic conductivity (for simulations in this study, 70  m day− 1 was optimal), the ratio of kariz hydraulic conductivity to aquifer conductivity (107 was optimal in this study), as well as the length of the kariz in contact with the water table. Further, the natural water discharge from the kariz to surface canals was successfully simulated using a pumping well at the downgradient end of the kariz. Many other factors remain in need of investigation, including (1) simulations of a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity domain more representative of alluvial fan depositional system; (2) a better realization of alluvial aquifer recharge through influent rivers carrying seasonal snowmelt from the Hindu Kush; (3) a better simulation of the water loss when the kariz tunnel lies above the water table, but is still below-ground; (4) a thorough investigation of the capture zone of a kariz; and (5) the potential influence of traditional pumped vertical water wells (tube wells) on kariz discharge rates.|$|R
