40|$|Employers {{generally}} {{spend less}} than one minute reading a CV before deciding to reject it, or to shortlist it for detailed consideration. If you fail {{to make the right}} impact, you missed your chance. • If applying for an advertised vacancy, always ensure that you comply with any application process entirely. The <b>vacancy</b> <b>notice</b> might specify: how to apply (CV, application form, online application), the length and/or format of the CV, whether a covering letter is required, etc. • Be brief: two A 4 pages are usually more than enough, irrespective of your education or experience. Do not exceed three pages. If you hold a degree, include your secondary school qualifications only if relevant to the job in question. • Is your work experience limited? Describe your education and training first; highlight volunteering activities and placements or traineeships. 2. Be clear and concise • Use short sentences. Avoid clichés. Concentrate on the relevant aspects of your training and work experience. • Give specific examples. Quantify your achievements. • Update your CV as your experience develops.

40|$|The present {{research}} aimed {{to examine the}} effects of explicit cultural values on employer attractiveness. In Exp. 1, male and female participants saw a recruitment brochure promoting either a predominantly feminine or a predominantly masculine corporate culture (Cameron & Freeman, 1991; Hofstede, 1980). Adjective ratings indicate that company image was perceived as intended. As expected, female participants showed higher general attractiveness ratings as well as application intentions for the prototypical feminine as compared to the masculine culture, male participants exhibited the opposite pattern. Participants’ career-status (student vs. employee) did not affect perceptions of employer attractiveness. In Exp. 2, participants either belonging to a minority group (physical disability, migrant family, or other than heterosexual orientation), or not, were presented a <b>vacancy</b> <b>notice</b> promoting a diversity-oriented vs. an achievement-oriented corporate culture. Again, image ratings indicate that the announcements were perceived as intended. Although general attractiveness ratings remained unaffected here, participants belonging to a minority group showed higher application intentions for the diversity-oriented than for the achievement-oriented company,and vice versa for participants not belonging to a minority group. Beyond manipulation check, image ratings show a significantly morepositive pattern for the diversity-oriented company regardless of participants’ group membership. Implications for value establishment and communication in times of organisational and societal change are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{diversification}} of translation services, tools and quality expectations {{in an increasingly}} globalized translation industry has accentuated the significance of translation quality assurance (TQA) processes and their management. This paper focuses on the profile of institutional translation service managers from a holistic TQA perspective. After a short account of their most common duties as described in sample <b>vacancy</b> <b>notices</b> from various international organizations, including senior service managers and mid-level language unit heads, {{the role of the}} latter as competence and process managers responsible for translation quality in specific languages is analyzed in more detail. The data compiled in 24 interviews with mid-level managers serve to outline an inventory of their main TQA-related functions and challenges, and lead to conclusions on their growing relevance and expected expertise in this evolving field...|$|R
40|$|Before the Career Path system, {{jobs were}} {{classified}} according to grades with general statutory definitions, {{guided by the}} "Job Catalogue" which defined 6 evaluation criteria with example illustrations {{in the form of}} "typical" job descriptions. Career Paths were given concise statutory definitions necessitating a method of description and evaluation adapted to their new wider-band salary concept. Evaluations were derived from the same 6 criteria but the typical descriptions became unusable. In 1999, a sub-group of the Standing Concertation Committee proposed a new guide for describing Career Paths, adapted to their wider career concept by expanding the 6 evaluation criteria into 9. For each criterion several levels were established tracing the expected evolution of job level profiles and personal competencies over their longer salary ranges. While providing more transparency to supervisors and staff, the Guide's official use would be by services responsible for <b>vacancy</b> <b>notices,</b> Career Path evaluations and related decisions as well as external salary and career comparisons...|$|R
50|$|In September 2012, the Government put out job {{advertisements}} in industry publications such as The Lawyer {{to hire a}} DPP at a salary of US$125,000 per year. Applicants for the position were required to be qualified to practice law in a Commonwealth country or the Republic of Ireland. The advertisement also suggested that applicants have at least fifteen years' experience, and stated that the deadline for application was 10 October 2012. Other <b>vacancy</b> <b>notices</b> called for hiring a Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions with 10 years' experience at a salary of US$85,000 per year, {{as well as a}} Secretary who was a Belonger at a salary of US$18,900 to $20,520 per year. Ten people applied for the positions, of whom six were shortlisted. In December 2012, it was announced that JoAnne Meloche, a Canadian then employed as Deputy Director of Prosecutions in the TCI Attorney-General's Chambers, had been appointed as DPP and was scheduled to be sworn in the following February. Turks and Caicos Islander Angela Brooks was named Meloche's Deputy DPP.|$|R

40|$|Reduced Activation Ferritic/Martensitic steels {{are being}} {{extensively}} studied {{because of their}} foreseen application in fusion reactors. To reproduce neutron irradiation conditions, Eurofer 97 samples were implanted at room temperature with helium ions at energies of 500 keV and 2 MeV and doses of 1 x 1015 - 1017 He /cm 2. The implantation induced defects were characterized by positron beam Doppler Broadening (DB). The samples were annealed in the range 300 – 1500 K, in 100 K steps. As the temperature increases, the annealing of vacancies and <b>vacancy</b> clusters is <b>noticed</b> and followed by the coalescence of HenVm clusters. At temperatures around 1200 K HeV pairs dissociate and bubbles are formed. Above 1300 K the helium release from bubbles is observed. The S-W graphs reveals that the samples have similar positron traps up to 1200 K. At 1200 K helium bubbles are noticed and the S,W pair shows a clearly distinct behaviour from the S,W values of vacancy type defects. As the temperature increases and helium is release, the S,W pairs shift towards the S,W’s of vacancies. RST/Radiation, Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
