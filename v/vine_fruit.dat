50|$|Dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> {{is a term}} {{given to}} all the {{varieties}} of dried grape produced. The need for this term came {{from the fact that}} the United Kingdom is the only country in the European Union which differentiates dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> into different types. On mainland Europe, they are all simply called raisins, whereas in the UK they are differentiated into raisins, sultanas and currants. In this instance the term currant refers to the Zante currant, not the fruit of the Ribes genus.|$|E

50|$|Ochratoxin is a {{mycotoxin}} {{that comes}} in three secondary metabolite forms, A, B, and C. All are produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus species. The three forms differ in that Ochratoxin B (OTB) is a nonchlorinated form of Ochratoxin A (OTA) and that Ochratoxin C (OTC) is an ethyl ester form Ochratoxin A. Aspergillus ochraceus is found as a contaminant {{of a wide range}} of commodities including beverages such as beer and wine. Aspergillus carbonarius is the main species found on <b>vine</b> <b>fruit,</b> which releases its toxin during the juice making process. OTA has been labeled as a carcinogen and a nephrotoxin, and has been linked to tumors in the human urinary tract, although research in humans is limited by confounding factors.|$|E
5000|$|American Civil War hero Thomas Law Reed settled here {{to provide}} wheat for Gold Rush miners in the mid-1800s. His {{donation}} {{of land for}} a railroad station site established the town {{as the center of}} the San Joaquin Valley's [...] booming wheat business. Railroad officials commemorated his vision by naming the fledgling City in his honor. When mining fever began to fade, wheat demand slackened. Kings River water was diverted for crop irrigation, and the region began its over 100-year tradition of bountiful field, tree, and <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> harvests. In 1913 the land was developed with cement sidewalks, sewer systems, as well as the construction of the first steel water tower. With water and railroad services in place, farming families of European immigrants were recruited, and the settlement was incorporated in 1913, with Ordinance No. 1 adopting and prescribing the style of a Common Seal on February 25, 1913. An important element in the early town was a colony of German Mennonites, whose strong traditions and values still shape Reedley's culture. The population today is diverse and multicultural and Reedley boasts a current population equal to [...] Each of the town's major ethnic groups has shown strong civic leadership, a desire to retain cultural and religious traditions, and the ability to work successfully together for Reedley's betterment. Among the community's 25 churches are Anglican, Catholic, Christian, Armenian, Baptist, Buddhist, Mennonite, and many other congregations. The area's 41 organizations and 12 civic clubs include Filipino community organizations, a Finnish organization, and American Lebanese Women's Club, several Hispanic and Latin American organizations, and a Japanese organization among the many sports, cultural, conservation, charitable, and civic associations. In 1988 Reedley celebrated the first 100 years of its multicultural heritage, and the 75th anniversary of incorporation. It is also noted for being the location of the opening and monster truck scenes in the movie Roadhouse starring Patrick Swayze in 1989.|$|E

40|$|Dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> (raisin, sultana and currant) is {{the second}} (after wine) most {{important}} product of viticulture. Concerning this, the contamination of dried grape by ochratoxigenic fungi and ochratoxin A (OTA) has attracted much attention. Favorable climatic conditions in countries with well-developed viticulture contribute to the spreading of ochratoxigenic fungi. The aim of this work was to identify the contamination sources of dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> by ochratoxigenic filamentous fungi and OTA, as well to determine the Critical Control Points (CCP) {{at different stages of}} production. Primary contamination of grapes occurred during vegetation, especially maturation period, when the risk of mechanical damages was the highest one. 48 samples of soil and 81 samples of fresh grape berries collected in 4 regions of Armenia were investigated. As a result, 22 micromycetes sp. from 7 genera were isolated. Drying process {{is one of the main}} CCP. As the most of dried products is produced by open sun drying method, secondary contamination occurs in plants.

40|$|European wine {{production}} represents about 70 % of world production {{and thus is}} an important export commodity. Ochratoxin A (OTA) was first detected as a wine contaminant in 1996 {{and the role of}} Aspergillus section Nigri and A. carbonarius in OTA production discovered in Europe in 1999. Subsequently Europe-wide surveys have shown that A. carbonarius is predominantly responsible for OTA contamination of grapes, wine and vine fruits. Analyses of wine samples throughout Europe have shown that there is a gradient in OTA concentration with a decrease from red, to rose and to white wines. The latitude of production {{is an important factor in}} determining risk from OTA contamination. Some geographic regions in Southern Europe are more prone to contamination with the toxigenic species and OTA. Ochratoxin A has also been found in much higher concentrations (max. 53 micro g/kg) in dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> than in wine suggesting that A. carbonarius can dominate the drying <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> ecosystem. There is a significant lack of knowledge in Europe on conducive climatic conditions preharvest and their relationship with levels of risk from OTA contamination in grapes and their fate in {{wine production}}.

40|$|Dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> {{farms in}} Sunraysia and Robinvale were nearly all {{established}} under closer settlement schemes, with farm size averaging about 8 hectares. The present {{study indicates that}} economics of size exist up to a harvested area of about 25 hectares. This would suggest that structural change is occurring in the industry, with farms being amalgamated {{to take advantage of}} these economies of size. However, structural change {{in recent years has been}} negligible. Some of the obstacles to adjustment are examined in the thesis. They have important implications for government policy; in particular, there is a need for a Land Authority to facilitate adjustment in dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> growing regions. The thesis also considers some methodological problems in estimating economies of size, and in deriving policy proposals from such estimates. It concludes that the results of most studies of farm size, including this one, must he regarded as provisional, pending the outcome of properly designed empirical tests. It also concludes that the Paretian concept of efficiency is inadequate as a framework for adjustment policy. I would like to thank my supervisors,Mr. G. W. Edwards, Mr. N. H. Sturgess, and Dr. A. S.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study on}} the {{ochratoxin}} producing mycoflora of grapes, several Aspergillus strains were isolated and tested for their ochratoxin A (OTA) producing abilities. Aspergillus strains of the section Nigri, which did not produce detectable amounts of OTA but which had a similar morphology to A. carbonarius, were isolated from wine grapes and/or dried <b>vine</b> <b>fruit</b> in Portugal and Spain. These strains, however, have characters that allow morphological distinction from the other species in the section, particularly the conidia size (5 – 7 µm), which allows separation of the species from the two most common biseriate species in section Nigri: A. carbonarius (7 – 9 µm) and A. niger and its aggregate species (3 – 5 µm). The strains are described here as belonging to a new species, named A. ibericus. The validation of this new taxon is supported further by analysis of the ITS- 5. 8 S rDNA and calmodulin gene sequences and by analysis of the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) patterns, which were consistent in separating these strains from other species in the section.
