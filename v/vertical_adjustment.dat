50|$|The {{horizontal}} and <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{range of a}} firearm sight is often advertised by the manufacturer using mils. For instance a rifle scope may be advertised as having a <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> range of 20 mils, which means that by turning the turret the bullet impact can be moved a total of 20 meters at 1000 meters (or 2 m at 100 m, 4 m at 200 m, 6 m at 300 m etc.). The {{horizontal and}} <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> ranges can be different for a particular sight, for instance a scope may have 20 mils vertical and 10 mils horizontal adjustment. Elevation differ between models, but about 10-11 mils are common in hunting scopes, while scopes made for long range shooting usually can have an adjustment range of 30-50 mils.|$|E

50|$|A {{milling machine}} built {{and used in}} the shop of Gay & Silver (aka Gay, Silver, & Co) in the 1830s was {{influential}} because it employed a better method of vertical positioning than earlier machines. For example, Whitney's machine (the one that Roe considered the very first) and others did not make provision for vertical travel of the knee. Evidently, the workflow assumption behind this was that the machine would be set up with shims, vise, etc. for a certain part design, and successive parts did not require <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> (or at most would need only shimming).

5000|$|Many modern reticles are {{designed}} for (stadiametric) rangefinding purposes. Perhaps {{the most popular and}} well-known ranging reticle is the [...] "Mil-dot" [...] reticle, which consists of duplex crosshairs with small dots at milliradian (Mil or 1/1000 of a radian) intervals in the field of view. This reticle has gained significant acceptance in NATO and other military and law enforcement organizations. Training and practice will enable a user to measure the range to objects of known size, the size of objects at known distances, and compensate for both bullet drop and wind drift at known ranges with reasonable accuracy. To promote methodological uniformity, (mental) calculations and communication between spotters and snipers in sniper teams, the elevation or <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> and windage controls of Mil-dot reticle equipped telescopic sights are usually adjustable in (decimal) 0.1 milliradian increments. There are, however, (military) Mil-dot equipped telescopic sights that use coarser or finer reticle adjustment increments.|$|E

In experiment 1, we investigated whether the backward inclination of the vertical horopter was manifested in the angle at which readers prefer to orient the page. All observers preferred a page inclined backwards to any other orientation. This backward inclination was less than predicted from previous psychophysical reports, however. In experiment 2, we investigated the extent of binocular correspondence, defined by minimal apparent interocular horizontal motion, in the central 24 deg of the binocular field. Our data define a planar surface inclined top-away from the observer as a locus from which psychophysical corresponding points are stimulated. In experiment 3, we measured <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments</b> required to eliminate apparent vertical motion. Together, the pattern of results from experiments 2 and 3 is most consistent with a planar surface, inclined top-away from the observer.

5000|$|Rifles {{from the}} late 19th century often {{featured}} one of two types of aperture sight called a tang sight or a ladder sight. Since the black powder used in muzzleloaders and early cartridges was not capable of propelling a bullet at high velocity, these sights had very large ranges of <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments,</b> often {{on the order of}} several degrees, allowing very long shots to be made accurately. The [...]45-70 cartridge, for example, was tested by the military for accuracy at ranges of up to 1500 yards, which required 3 degrees of elevation. Both ladder and tang sights folded down when not in use to reduce the chance of damage to the sights. Ladder sights were mounted on the barrel, and could be used as sights in both the folded and unfolded states. Tang sights were mounted behind the action of the rifle, and provided a very long sight radius, and had to be unfolded for use, though rifles with tang sights often had open sights as well for close range use. Tang sights often had vernier scales, allowing adjustment down to a single minute of arc over the full range of the sight.|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} effect of a <b>vertical</b> height <b>adjustment</b> of the chair and visual display unit (VDU) on work-related upper {{quadrant}} musculoskeletal pain (WRUQMP) and sitting comfort in office workers. The upper quadrant refers to the occiput, cervical and upper thoracic spine, including the clavicles and scapulae. Methods: A single subject (N = 1) study, in which the subject serves as her own control, was conducted using the ABC design. An ergonomic workstation adjustment of VDU and chair height was compared to the subjectâs usual workstation settings. Pain and sitting comfort was measured using visual analogue scales (VAS). The subject was assessed over three four-week phases as she performed her typical VDU work. The results were compiled and tabulated. Results: Both the mean and variance in pain intensity decreased after the workstation intervention. A deterioration in sitting comfort was noted. Conclusion: The <b>vertical</b> height <b>adjustment</b> of the chair and visual display unit may have contributed to a decrease in work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain in this subject. This safe, economical workstation intervention may be a practical management option for the computer user suffering from work-related upper quadrant musculoskeletal pain.

5000|$|Multiple purpose designs {{incorporate}} improved tripod and H-frame features {{with extra}} multiple adjustment capabilities that include finite rotational, horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{of the working}} plane. Four extendable armatures securely lock a canvas or drawing board to the easel, thus allowing any part of a painting to be instantly re-positioned at any height or angle whilst painting. This includes bringing the working area directly underneath the brush or pen hand. The front and all four sides of a canvas are untouched by the easel. The easel folds down to a compact size. While painting, it can be moved without the canvas falling off. The ergonomic design aims to remove the physical pain and discomfort experienced when using traditional A- or H-frame easels and offer improved brush control.

5000|$|As {{very few}} {{firearms}} come with built-in telescopic sights (military designs {{such as the}} Steyr AUG, SAR 21 and the H&K G36 being exceptions) mounting a scope to a firearm requires additional equipment. Equipment is available to mount scopes on most production firearms. A typical scope mounting system consists of two parts, the scope base and the scope rings. By picking the appropriate combination of scope base to fit the firearm and scope rings to fit the scope, {{a wide range of}} scopes may be mounted to most firearms. With the appropriate combination of adjustable scope bases and scope rings it is also possible to mount several telescopic sights on the same gun to make the gun more versatile. However, it is important to take into consideration whether or not a gun is particularly hard to mount. If it is or if a gun is intended for long-range shooting, {{it could be that the}} amount of <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> range is smaller than required. This can be solved with the help of a vertically canted base or canted rings. Typical cant angles offered by mounting components manufacturers are 20 and 30 MOA.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{subjective}} visual vertical (SVV, {{the visual}} estimation of gravitational direction) is commonly considered {{as an indicator}} of the sense of orientation. The present study examined the impact of two methodological factors (the angle size of the stimulus and the participant's gender) on deviations of the SVV caused by head tilt. Forty healthy participants (20 men and 20 women) were asked to make visual <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments</b> of a light bar with their head held vertically or roll-tilted by 30 Â° to the left or to the right. Line angle sizes of 0. 95 Â° and 18. 92 Â° were presented. Results The SVV tended to move in the direction of head tilt in women but away from the direction of head tilt in men. Moreover, the head-tilt effect was also modulated by the stimulus' angle size. The large angle size led to deviations in the direction of head-tilt, whereas the small angle size had the opposite effect. Conclusions Our results showed that gender and line angle size {{have an impact on the}} evaluation of the SVV. These findings must be taken into account in the growing body of research that uses the SVV paradigm in disease settings. Moreover, this methodological issue may explain (at least in part) the discrepancies found in the literature on the head-tilt effect. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The PSL rifle is {{typically}} issued with a 4Ã24 optical sight called LPS 4Ã6Â° TIP2 (LunetÄ Puá¹£cÄ SemiautomatÄ Tip 2, or [...] "Scope, Semi-Automatic Rifle, Type #2") {{which is a}} simplified version of the Russian PSO-1 telescopic weapon sight. This optical sight features 4Ã magnification, a 6Â° field of view, and the objective lens is 24 mm in diameter. It shares the basic design and stadiametric rangefinder found in the reticle of the original Russian PSO-1 scope. The LPS 4Ã6Â° TIP2 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors.

5000|$|Using extreme {{examples}} {{is useful}} {{as a means of}} demonstrating effects that occur in less extreme configurations but are much more difficult to spot and therefore to explain. The first observation is an easy one (top left in the image captioned [...] "Reversed head in variousâ¦"). If the stick head is rotated onto the reverse (lighter colour) the toe is not going to disappear into the ground to enable the reverse side of the stick to be presented to the ballâa <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustment</b> is necessary. Secondly (top right), if the handle of the stick is kept at exactly the same angle and rotated, a horizontal adjustment is necessary to bring the reversed head to a position where contact will be made with the ball. The third figure (bottom left) shows these adjustments having been made (and a change to the angle of the handle because the position of the hand holding the stick at the top would be about the same as it is when gripping the stick in the forehand position), but the area of stick head making contact with the ball is very small; so control may not be adequate. The fourth figure (bottom right) demonstrates that to get good contact with the ball on a larger area of the reversed head, it is necessary to move the handle much nearer to the vertical. This means the player must bring the ball in very close to the feet and come to a more upright dribbling positionâthis in turn impairs the ability to scan the pitch and keep the ball in peripheral vision at the same timeâa considerable disadvantage when dribbling to evade opponents.|$|E

Pressure effects {{are treated with}} a step-ladder plus steady-state model and tunneling effects are included. New features include a treatment of the C isotope effect and a proposed nonstatistical effect in the reaction. The latter was prompted by existing kinetic results and molecular-beam data of Simons and co-workers [J. Phys. Chem. A 102, 9559 (1998); J. Chem. Phys. 112, 4557 (2000); 113, 3173 (2000) ] on incomplete intramolecular energy transfer to the highest vibrational frequency mode in HOCO*. In treating the many kinetic properties two small customary <b>vertical</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the barriers of the two transition states were made.

The kinetic carbon isotopic effect is usually less than 10 per mil. A striking consequence of the nonstatistical assumption is the removal of a major discrepancy in a plot of the kOH+CO/kOD+CO ratio versus pressure.
