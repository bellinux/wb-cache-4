25|$|Brown {{notes that}} he was <b>very</b> <b>dissatisfied</b> {{with the quality of}} cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he {{enrolled}} in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997. Brown says that he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment ("unitaskers"), such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multi-purpose tools.|$|E
500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback. In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling <b>very</b> <b>dissatisfied.</b> And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E
2500|$|Dirac's {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) made {{predictions}} that were – {{more often than}} not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. [...] "I must say that I am <b>very</b> <b>dissatisfied</b> with the situation", he said in 1975, [...] "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!" [...] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.|$|E

6000|$|Mr Adolphus Longestaffe, the squire of Caversham in Suffolk, and of Pickering Park in Sussex, was closeted on {{a certain}} morning for {{the best part of}} an hour with Mr Melmotte in Abchurch Lane, had there {{discussed}} all his private affairs, and was about to leave the room with a <b>very</b> <b>dissatisfied</b> air. There are men,--and old men too, who ought to know the world,--who think that if they can only find the proper Medea to boil the cauldron for them, they can have their ruined fortunes so cooked that they shall come out of the pot fresh and new and unembarrassed. These great conjurors are generally sought for in the City; and in truth the cauldrons are kept boiling though the result of the process is seldom absolute rejuvenescence. No greater Medea than Mr Melmotte had ever been potent in money matters, and Mr Longestaffe had been taught to believe that if he could get the necromancer even to look at his affairs everything would be made right for him. But the necromancer had explained to the squire that property could not be created by the waving of any wand or the boiling of any cauldron. He, Mr Melmotte, could put Mr Longestaffe in the way of realising property without delay, of changing it from one shape into another, or could find out the real market value of the property in question; but he could create nothing. 'You have only a life interest, Mr Longestaffe.' ...|$|E

60|$|A {{pretty young}} lady, Yarinka, his {{favorite}} niece, is lounging on an ottoman between {{his end of}} the table and the door, <b>very</b> sulky and <b>dissatisfied,</b> perhaps because he is preoccupied with his papers and his brandy bottle, and she can see nothing of him but his broad back.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, after that, I fancied {{that she}} tried to speak even to me, in {{intervals}} when we were left alone. But she never uttered a word. The Doctor always had some new project for her participating in amusements away from home, with her mother; and Mrs. Markleham, who was very fond of amusements, and <b>very</b> easily <b>dissatisfied</b> with anything else, entered into them with great good-will, and was loud in her commendations.

The non-partisan Politfact watchdog organization found that his words were [...] "half-true." [...] In fact, Politifact said polls have found that often the majority of consumers have varying degrees of satisfaction, but are not strongly satisfied. For instance, an ABC News poll in June 2009 about the cost of health insurance premiums found 23 percent were very satisfied, but a combined 75 percent of consumers were somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or <b>very</b> <b>dissatisfied</b> (31 percent somewhat satisfied, 19 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 25 percent <b>very</b> <b>dissatisfied.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{constraints}} {{under which}} Akbar Khan had {{to conduct the}} battle in Kashmir made him a <b>very</b> frustrated and <b>dissatisfied</b> man.

40|$|We {{examined}} the prevalence and correlates {{of satisfaction with}} appearance and weight. Participants (N = 12, 176) completed an online survey posted on the NBCNews. com and Today. com websites. Few {{men and women were}} <b>very</b> to extremely <b>dissatisfied</b> with their physical appearances (6 %; 9 %), but feeling <b>very</b> to extremely <b>dissatisfied</b> with weight was more common (15 %; 20 %). Only about one-fourth of men and women felt very to extremely satisfied with their appearances (28 %; 26 %) and weights (24 %; 20 %). Men and women with higher body masses reported higher appearance and weight dissatisfaction. Dissatisfied people had higher Neuroticism, more preoccupied and fearful attachment styles, and spent more hours watching television. In contrast, satisfied people had higher Openness, Conscientious, Extraversion, were more secure in attachment style, and had higher self-esteem and life satisfaction. These findings highlight the high prevalence of body dissatisfaction and the factors linked to dissatisfaction among U. S. adults...|$|R

6000|$|Now Woolsey {{had been}} a little, a <b>very</b> little, <b>dissatisfied</b> {{during the course of}} the evening's entertainment, by fancying that Eglantine, a much more voluble person than himself, had {{obtained}} rather an undue share of the ladies' favour; and as he himself paid half of the expenses, he felt very much vexed to think that the perfumer should take all the credit of the business to himself. So when Miss Crump asked if he had provided the music, he foolishly made an evasive reply to her query, and rather wished her to imagine that he HAD performed that piece of gallantry.

3000|$|Few women (4 of 32) felt <b>very</b> {{isolated}} and <b>dissatisfied.</b> Here, “isolation {{refers to the}} individual’s perception and reality of being emotionally and socially alone, economically confined, and culturally disconnected. It is the ‘feeling and fact’ of not belonging or having any meaningful relationship” (Abraham [1998], p. 224).

The next morning we talked of it again, when I found he was fully satisfied, and, smiling, said he hoped I would not want money and not tell him of it, and that I had promised him otherwise. I told him I had been <b>very</b> much <b>dissatisfied</b> at my landlady's talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with; but I supposed she wanted what I owed her, which was about eight guineas, which I had resolved to give her, and had accordingly given it her the same night she talked so foolishly.|$|R

60|$|The country {{began to}} be <b>very</b> much <b>dissatisfied</b> with the {{management}} of public affairs within {{two or three years}} after the commencement of Richard's reign. Large sums of money were raised, and put into the hands of Richard's uncles, who spent it in organizing great expeditions by land and sea to fight the French; but almost all of these expeditions were unsuccessful. The people thought that they were mismanaged, and that the money was squandered. Some of the nobles expended immense sums upon themselves. In the case of one expedition that put to sea from the southern coast of England, the nobleman who commanded it had twenty-five vessels loaded with his own personal property and baggage, and that of his servants and attendants. This man had fifty-two new suits of apparel, made of cloth of gold, immensely expensive. The fleet was wrecked, and all this property was lost in the sea.|$|R
