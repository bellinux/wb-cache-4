40|$|Abstract. Since positive-displacement dry {{vacuum pumps}} were first {{launched}} into {{the semiconductor industry}} in 1984, issues concerning about characteristics evaluation on consistent bases have been continuously arisen from the mass production lines. The non-destructive, in-situ purposed characteristics evaluation system for dry vacuum pumps has been established collaborating with a semi-conductor manufacturer and branch dry pump manufacturers in Korea. The evaluation method exploits the constant <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> to measure the mass flow rate in standards level, and facilitates the evaluation of spatially averaged sound power levels using a semi-anechoic chamber.

40|$|Investigation of {{instantaneous}} {{wall pressure}} in a <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> design {{has been carried}} out. The focus {{of the study was}} to obtain spectral analysis of the differential pressure between two pressure transducers. The following Reynolds numbers, based on bulk velocity and pipe diameter, have been studied; 17 000, 46 000, 92 000 and 150 000. The following models were used; SST, SST SAS and SST DES. Several researchers have contributed to the development of these model. F. R Menter was the original formulator of SST, which the other two models are extensions of. Menter are principally behind the SST SAS model. The concept of DES originated with P. R Spalart, but have since been worked on by many researchers including Spalart. Six different grids were employed, ranging from 300 000 to 2 250 000 grid cells. Grid dependence for SST were investigated using four of the grids. Grid dependence for mean velocity was found to be within 1. 5 percent for the grids investigated. Time-averaged flow data were examined. The averaging time was found to be too short to exhibit statistical steadiness of second moment statistics for the SAS model. Instantaneous flow data were presented qualitatively for the DES model, using axial contour plots, and quantitatively for both DES and SAS models, using one-point spectra of fluctuating velocity. Distributions of mean skin-friction and mean wall pressure coefficient for the SST model were presented. It was further shown that the SST model alone is not able to produce wall pressure fluctuations, but that SAS and DES are. Spectral analysis of instantaneous differential pressure between the two pressure transducers were carried out for Re = 46 000, 92 000, 150 000. An increase in bulk velocity was found to increase the level of spectral amplitude of instantaneous wall pressure.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the ability of chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine to cause cessation of lactation in Staphylococcus aureus-infected mammary quarters, assess milk production in the treated quarter in the subsequent lactation, and evalu-ate whether microbiological cure was obtained. Four-teen mid- to late-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cat-tle from the Washington State University dairy herd with single mammary quarter S. aureus intramam-mary infections were studied. Cows were randomly as-signed to one of two treatment groups, povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine. Cows in the povidone-iodine group were infused with 120 ml of 5 % povidone-iodine solution (0. 5 % iodine) after complete milk-out. Chlorhexidine-treated cows were infused with a proprietary chlorhexi-dine suspension after two milkings 24 h apart. Treated mammary quarters were not milked for the rest of the lactation. Milk production from each mammary quarter (kg of milk/quarter) was measured using in-line <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> for 5 consecutive days before treatment and again at the start of the subsequent lactation. Povidone-iodine caused permanent cessation of lactation in the treated quarter, whereas 71 % of the chlorhexidine-treated mammary quarters returned to function in the subsequent lactation. Hence, if the primary objective is to eliminate the mammary quarter from lactation, and thereby presumably lower the risk of herdmates acquiring new S. aureus intramammary infection, then povidone-iodine appears to be the best of the two meth-ods. No difference in total milk production between lac-tation one and two in either group was found, sug-gesting that permanent loss of a quarter was not detri-mental to overall milk production...|$|R

The Integrated Drive Generator (IDG), which generates electric power for the jet plane, needs to be cooled all the time in order to have maximum efficiency. To have effective heat transfer between the IDG and Mobil jet lubricating oil, the oil should be of high quality. Due to the simultaneous operation of vacuum and high pressure pumps in the engine lube system, air is entrapped into the oil and carried through the IDG and hence, decreases the heat transfer between the parts of the IDG and the lubricating oil. In order to resolve this problem, the Deaerator is used in the IDG, to remove the entrapped air from the oil by utilizing the basic centrifugal principle. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the performance of the different deaerator designs including the basic 75 / 90 GENERIC design, by conducting experiments and CFD simulations. The deaerator testing methodology has been modified based on the overall mass balance of air inlet and outlet sections of the deaerator. The deaerator test rig is modified with number of additional temperature sensors, air <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> pressure transducers and NI Lab VIEW Data Acquisition System.

Coriolis <b>meters</b> do not have any moving parts and provide long term stability, repeatability, and reliability. Because they are direct mass flow measurement devices, Coriolis meters can handle the widest range of fluids from gases to heavy liquids and are not impacted by viscosity or density changes that often effect velocity based technologies (PD, Turbine, Ultrasonic). With the widest flow range capability of any flow technology, Coriolis can be sized for low pressure drop.

40|$|AbstractComputational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) provides well-established tools for {{the prediction of}} the velocity profiles in turbulent pipe flows. As far as industrial pipe and district heating systems are concerned, combinations of elbows {{are the most common}} pipe assemblies. Among the different pipe combinations, double elbows out-of-plane are of special interest, since they introduce strong disturbances into the flow profile and have a strong influence on many common types of <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> In front of a double elbow there is often another flow-disturbing installation. As a result the upstream conditions are unknown and an investigation of the resulting systematic bias on the measurement of the flow rate and the associated contribution to its measurement uncertainty is necessary. We demonstrate here that this can be achieved by a variation of the inlet profile in terms of swirls and asymmetry components. In particular, an ultrasonic and an electromagnetic <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> are modeled in order to quantify the systematic errors stemming from uncertain inflow conditions. For this purpose, a generalized non-intrusive polynomial chaos method has been used in conjunction with a commercial CFD code. As the most influential parameters on the measured <b>volume</b> <b>flow,</b> the distance between the double elbow and the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> as well as the orientation of the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> are considered as random variables in the polynomial chaos approach. This approach allowed us to obtain accurate prediction of the systematic error for the ultrasonic and electromagnetic meter as functions of the distance to the double elbow. The resulting bias in the flow rate {{has been found to be}} in the range of 1. 5 – 4. 5 % (0. 1 – 0. 5 %) with a systematic uncertainty contribution of 2 – 2. 4 % (0. 6 – 0. 7 %) for the ultrasonic (electromagnetic) <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> if the distance to the double elbow is smaller than 40 pipe diameters. Moreover, it is demonstrated that placing the <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> in a Venturi constriction leads to substantial decrease of the bias and the contribution to the measurement uncertainty stemming from the uncertain inflow condition...|$|R

In such a strong irradiation, high pressure, and temperature environment, the existing flow measurement techniques (such as Electromagnetic <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> Ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> Turbine <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> etc.) are not accurate and reliable. The measurement of flow rates (mass <b>flow</b> rates or <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate) plays a notable role in monitoring and controlling the experimental conditions. The bulk flow rates can be obtained through direct methods, which measure the amount of discharged fluids over a period of time. Alternatively, flow rates can also be obtained using indirect methods. For example, they can be derived through the measurement of fluid velocities. So far, the velocities have been found in strong correlation with signals of pressure, temperature, optical wave, ultrasonic wave, etc. based on diverse physical principles.

Specifically, it {{is focused on}} gas flows where density changes canbe significant, i. e. compressible flows. In such flows only the mass flow ratehas a significance and not the <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> rate since the latter depends onthe pressure. The motivation {{for the present study}} is found in the use of flowmeters for various purposes in the gas exchange system for internal combustionengines. Applications can be found for instance regarding measurements of airflow to the engine, or measurements of the amount of exhaust gas recirculation. However the scope of thesis is wider than this, since the thesis aims toinvestigate the response of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> to pulsating <b>flows.</b> The study is mainlyexperimental, but it also includes an introduction and discussion of several inindustry, common flow measuring techniques. The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> were studied using a newly developed flow rig, designedfor measurement of steady and pulsating air flow of mass flow rates and pulsefrequencies typically found in the gas exchange system of cars and smallertrucks. Flow rates are up to about 200 g/s and pulsation frequencies from 0 Hz(i. e. steady flow) up to 80 Hz. The study included the following flow meters:hot-film mass <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> venturi flowmeter, Pitot tube, vortex flowmeter andturbine flowmeter. The performance of these meters were evaluated at bothsteady and pulsating conditions. Furthermore, the flow under both steady andpulsating conditions were characterized by means of a resistance-wire basedmass <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> with the ability to perform time resolved measurements ofboth the mass flux ρu, and the stagnation temperature T 0. Experiments shows that, for certain <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> a quasi-steady assumptionis fairly well justified at pulsating flow conditions. This means that thefundamental equations describing the steady flow, for each instant of time,is applicable also in the pulsating flow. In the set-up, back-flow occurred atcertain pulse frequencies, which can result in highly inaccurate output fromcertain <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> depending on the measurement principle. For the purposeof finding means to determine when back flow prevails, LDV measurementswere also carried out. These measurements were compared with measurementsusing a vortex <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> together with a new signal processing technique basedon wavelet analysis. The comparison showed that this technique may have apotential to measure pulsating flow rates accurately.
