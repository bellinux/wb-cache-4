5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> allowed him to conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He {{used to say that}} he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Branham's followers {{to his death}} was one of shocking disbelief.

5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> {{is at least}} as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E

5|$|Ravalomanana {{solicited}} a {{loan from}} the Agence Française de Développement to further expand his business, but this request was denied, souring his view of France. His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1.5 million US dollars was approved, and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company. The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time, José Broffman, secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products {{at a lower cost}} than other small dairy producers, which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business. Broffman later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company, joined by private investors from South Africa, Germany and the United States. As Tiko continued to grow, the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa (constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products) and surplus butter from Europe, further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification. Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices, ice cream, cooking oil and carbonated beverages. The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group's products, Vita Malagasy ("Made in Madagascar"), reflected Ravalomanana's national pride and his <b>vision</b> <b>that</b> Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets.|$|E
