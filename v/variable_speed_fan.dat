The thermodynamic model of an air-cooled screw chiller was developed using the simulation program TRNSYS and validated using the field data and specifications of the chiller. The staging of condenser fans and the control of their speed in various operating conditions were described.

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and reheat coil is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> in series with a heating coil. These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the heating coil output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component – a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> and a heating coil in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through – the fan is upstream of the heating coil. ...|$|E
40|$|Upcoming {{emissions}} regulations (Tiers 3, 4 a and 4 b) are imposing {{significantly higher}} heat loads on the cooling system than lesser regulated machines. This work was {{a suite of}} tasks aimed at reducing the parasitic losses of the cooling system, or improving the design process through six distinct tasks: 1. Develop an axial fan that will provide more airflow, with less input power and less noise. The initial plan was to use Genetic Algorithms to do an automated fan design, incorporating forward sweep for low noise. First and second generation concepts could not meet either performance or sound goals. An experienced turbomachinery designer, using a specialized CFD analysis program {{has taken over the}} design and has been able to demonstrate a 5 % flow improvement (vs 10 % goal) and 10 % efficiency improvement (vs 10 % goal) using blade twist only. 2. Fan shroud developments, using an 'aeroshroud' concept developed at Michigan State University. Performance testing at Michigan State University showed the design is capable of meeting the goal of a 10 % increase in flow, but over a very narrow operating range of fan performance. The goal of 10 % increase in fan efficiency was not met. Fan noise was reduced from 0 to 2 dB, vs. a goal of 5 dB at constant airflow. The narrow range of fan operating conditions affected by the aeroshroud makes this concept unattractive for further development at this time 3. Improved axial fan system modeling is needed to accommodate the numbers of cooling systems to be redesigned to meet lower emissions requirements. A CFD fan system modeling guide has been completed and transferred to design engineers. Current, uncontrolled modeling practices produce flow estimates in some cases within 5 % of measured values, and in some cases within 25 % of measured values. The techniques in the modeling guide reduced variability to the goal of + 5 % for the case under study. 4. Demonstrate the performance and design versatility of a high performance fan. A 'swept blade mixed flow' fan was rapid prototyped from cast aluminum for a performance demonstration on a small construction machine. The fan was mounted directly in place of the conventional fan (relatively close to the engine). The goal was to provide equal airflow at constant fan speed, with 75 % of the input power and 5 dB quieter than the conventional fan. The result was a significant loss in flow with the prototype due to its sensitivity to downstream blockage. This sensitivity to downstream blockage affects flow, efficiency, and noise all negatively, and further development was terminated. 5. Develop a high efficiency <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> drive to replace existing slipping clutch style fan drives. The goal for this task was to provide a continuously <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> drive with an efficiency of 95 %+ at max speed, and losses no greater than at max speed as the fan speed would vary throughout its entire speed range. The process developed to quantify the fuel savings potential of a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> drive has produced a simple tool to predict the fuel savings of a variable speed drive, and has sparked significant interest in the use of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> drive for Tier 3 emissions compliant machines. The proposed dual ratio slipping clutch <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> drive can provide a more efficient system than a conventional single ratio slipping clutch fan drive, but could not meet the established performance goals of this task, so this task was halted in a gate review {{prior to the start of}} detailed design. 6. Develop a cooling system air filtration device to allow the use of automotive style high performance heat exchangers currently in off road machines. The goal of this task was to provide a radiator air filtration system that could allow high fin density, louvered radiators to operate in a find dust application with the same resistance to fouling as a current production off-road radiator design. Initial sensitivity testing demonstrated that fan speed has a significant impact on the fouling of radiator cores due to fine dusts, so machines equipped with continuously <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> drives would be expected to have more radiator debris fouling problems than a machine with a constant speed fan. Filtration concepts looked at a wide range of filtration technologies, but the combination of pressure drop constraints and the small size of the debris to be filtered made this a futile exercise. The most successful technologies evaluated all incorporate some way to increase the Reynolds number inside the heat exchanger air flow path. A form of an 'air knife' concept has emerged as the most promising technology to pursue...|$|E

50|$|Early pellet grills had {{fans that}} ran {{continuously}} once the power was turned on. That meant oxygen was constantly being fed to the fire, {{making it harder}} to control temperatures. Eventually, continuous fans were replaced by ones that ran {{in conjunction with the}} auger-on cycle. However, that still meant that every time pellets were being fed to the fire, so was oxygen. As a result, some manufacturers have incorporated intermittent fans into pellet grills. These fans work independent of the auger and can turn on and off to feed oxygen to the fire only when necessary. Still, intermittent fans blow at 100% strength all the time.

40|$|The adjustable-pitch {{setting on}} an axial-flow fan {{is the most}} common method of {{controlling}} airflow for primary coal mine ventilation. With this method, the fan operates at a constant speed dictated by its motor design. The angles of the blades are adjusted to change the amount of airflow and pressure to meet ventilation requirements. Typically, the fan does not operate at its optimum efficiency, which only occurs in a narrow band of air pressures and quantities. The use of variable frequency drives (VFDs), which control fan speed, provides a solution to this problem. VFDs are already used in various similar applications such as pumping and building ventilation. New technology now enables efficient VFD operation in medium voltage (2, 300 – 6, 900 V) fan applications. The primary benefit of a variable frequency drive is that it allows motors to operate at reduced speeds, and thus at a lower power, without a loss of torque.

40|$|Stall-induced {{vibration}} places fundamental {{limitations on}} industrial fan performance and remains a persistent {{problem in the}} development of industrial fans and compressors. In this paper, we present an experimental programme that utilised two strategies to study rotating stall recovery patterns in an industrial fan. The experimental facility incorporated a fan with both variable pitch in motion blades and a variable speed drive. The facility enabled us first, to study the evolution of unsteady pressure signals on the fan casing whilst varying fan blade pitch and then to examine varying fan rotational speed. Consequently, we were able to recover a fan from stall either by varying blade pitch at constant speed, or by varying speed at constant blade pitch. We also studied the physical flow phenomena associated with stall recovery by cross-correlating signals from circumferentially offset high frequency response pressure transducers and then analysed the cross-spectra. This enabled us to gain insight into the transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery in the studied industrial fan class. The transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery by varying blade pitch was indicative of both a mild and progressive transition. In contrast, stall recovery by varying fan speed occurred more suddenly. In comparison with the variable pitch transition, the variable speed transition was more indicative of recovery from mild surge. From this we may conclude that stall recovery via variable speed resulted in significantly higher unsteady mechanical stress induced in fan rotating components than recovery via variable pitch. Higher bending stresses in the fan blades are more likely to result in mechanical failure, and therefore we may conclude that the studied fan is more ‘stall tolerant’ when one operates it as a variable pitch fan rather than as a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|E
40|$|An energy {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} Texas A & M University at Qatar building in Doha, Qatar. The building and its HVAC systems were modeled using EnergyPlus. Building chilled water and electrical data were collected to validate the computer simulation. The simulated monthly electricity consumption was within plus/minus 5 percent of the metered building data. Ninety-five percent of simulated hourly electricity data in a day were within plus/minus 10 percent of metered data. Monthly chilled water demand was within plus/minus 18 percent of measurements, and simulated monthly demand was correlated to metered monthly values with an R-squared correlation coefficient of 0. 95. Once the simulation was verified with the metered data, an optimization of the building's HVAC systems was performed. Better utilizing the building's variable speed fans at part loads showed potential annual electricity savings of 16 percent over the base case, with another 22 percent savings in chilled water energy. After converting chilled water savings to equivalent chiller electricity savings, the potential utility cost savings over the base case were found to be $ 90, 000 /yr at local utility rates. Reducing outdoor air intake to ASHRAE indoor air quality minimums yielded an additional 17 percent in potential chilled water savings and brought total monetary savings over the base case to $ 110, 000 /yr. Using a dedicated outside air system to precisely control individual zone ventilation showed potential for an additional 12 percent chilled water savings and $ 14, 000 in yearly utility savings, while also eliminating cases of under-ventilation. A hypothetical retrofit of fan powered terminal units (FPTU's) resulted in energy savings only at very low minimum flow rates, below ventilation standards. Savings were never more than 20 percent over the no-fan case. Series FPTU's showed no savings at any flow setting and negligible difference was found between ECM and SCR motor control. Finally, the dependence on climate of each improvement was studied. Simulations were run in the relatively milder climates of Houston and Phoenix and compared to those found for Doha. It was found that <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> operation is a more cost effective option for milder climates, while outside air control is more cost effective in extreme hot and humid climates such as Doha. Future study is needed to make the FPTU model valid for different climates and flow ranges...|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} contribution {{of this project}} is the design and {{construction of a new}} type calorimeter, a double chamber calorimeter (DCC), to directly and accurately estimate total losses of a 7. 5 kW induction motor. The DCC is utilised to investigate the additional losses due to the presence of time harmonics in the supply of mains-connected induction motors. The main advantage of using the DCC is that it enables estimation of machine losses independent of the level of the supply distortion and motor loading conditions. The DCC is made of class VH expanded polystyrene insulation material, large enough to house the test motor and a reference heater for balance type of loss measurement. A <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>fan</b> is used to maintain the air with sufficient flow rate through the calorimeter to remove the generated heat within the calorimeter chambers. Motor losses are estimated as a function of reference heater input power and the air temperature rise across the calorimeter chambers after thermal equilibrium has been achieved. One-dimensional conducted heat leakage through the calorimeter walls is estimated by developing a simple loss model for the calorimeter and validated using experimental tests. The model utilises conduction shape factors to evaluate the heat leakage through the calorimeter walls, edges and corners. Dynamic operation of the DCC is examined by performing substantial experimental tests using two identical heaters. Accordingly, limits for the air flow rate through the calorimeter, air temperature rise inside and across each chamber and heater input power are derived. Experimental results confirmed that motor losses up to 1 kW can be estimated using the DCC with a resolution of 10 W and an accuracy of 4 %. Motor line-line voltages and line currents are measured by developing voltage and current measurement circuits. For data collection a PC-based data acquisition (DA) system in conjunction with a computer software package is employed in this project. The DA system is also used for absolute temperature measurement using RTDs and relative temperature measurement using thermopiles. A 10 kVA inverter capable of producing harmonically distorted waveforms (up to 1 kHz) is employed to conduct harmonic tests on the test induction motor. Experimental tests are performed under non-distorted (nominal) and various distorted supply conditions and with the motor operating under no load, half load and full load. Experimental results confirmed that a distorted voltage containing low order harmonic causes more losses in a motor when compared with a distorted voltage having a higher order harmonic. A weighted THD (WTHD) is defined to specify the limits for additional losses in a motor supplied by distorted voltages. In terms of loading effect, the additional losses significantly increase with load mainly due to the increased resistance with temperature. Therefore, one can conclude that the harmonic losses are load independent and are constant for a known voltage distortion level except for the temperature effect. The variation of test motor parameters with harmonic order as well as the variation of additional losses with WTHD has led to establishment of derating factor (DF) for induction motors. Depending upon the supply WTHD, a DF can be determined which suggests the fraction of machine loading under which the additional losses due to the distorted supply can be safely tolerated by the machine. This figure has been calculated using the data for several machines with various power ratings from 3. 7 kW to 1. 6 MW. The results confirmed that a higher WTHD {{can be applied to the}} larger machines as compared with smaller machines. In other words, larger machines are more capable of handling additional losses due to the supply distortion. It has also been demonstrated that most induction motors can afford a WTHD up to 8 % if a service factor of 1. 15 is applied. The 8 % figure corresponds to an average THD of about 15 % which is much larger than the commonly used 5 % limit for THD in utility power networks as specified by standards...|$|E
40|$|Air-cooled {{chillers}} {{can take}} up around one-fourth of the total electricity consumption of an air-conditioned building. This paper evaluates the potential electricity cost savings of these chillers with improved condenser features of condensing temperature control (CTC), evaporative pre-coolers (EC) and <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> condenser <b>fans</b> (VSF). A validated model for an air-cooled screw chiller was used to ascertain how the individual and mixed features influence the annual electricity consumption of chillers operating for the cooling load profile of a hotel. With regard to a chiller plant with a 15 -year lifespan, the life cycle electricity cost savings are estimated at between HK$ 2, 291, 247 and 8, 320, 732, depending on the features used. The simple payback of the features could range from 1. 07 to 3. 32 years. These findings show how chiller manufacturers and building owners can profit from implementing energy efficient technologies for air-cooled chillers. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} the energy saving that could be achieved by converting a variable air volume (VAV) system from using Inlet guide vane to <b>variable</b> <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> control, which was meant to inform the decision on whether to retrofit all the VAV systems in an office building. The study Involved retrofitting one Of the 54 VAV air-handling units (AHUs) in the building as a pilot installation. Measurement was conducted to obtain the characteristics of the system followed by a short term monitoring of the frequency of power supply to the AHU and the outdoor temperature. A simplified model was established from the measured results for predicting the fan energy use of the system. The feasible annual energy saving was estimated using the model, based on the monthly operating hours and the monthly mean outdoor temperatures determined from the records logged by the building management system. The pilot study concluded that the conversion would be viable, as the payback period would be less than four years. <b>Fan</b> <b>speed</b> control retrofit for all the VAVAHUs in the building commenced In March 1999 and was completed in June 2000. The electricity consumption Of the AHUs during the past year has been determined from metered energy use records and found to be reasonably close to the predictions of the model established in the pilot study. The procedures adopted in the pilot study may be applied in other buildings for determining whether or not to retrofit VAV systems with conventional inlet guide vane control to <b>variable</b> <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b> control.
