25|$|VA {{disability}} {{benefits for}} PTSD have evolved over time, {{in response to}} legislation, scientific advances, political pressure, revised diagnostic classification schemes, regulatory changes, case law, and administrative decisions.

For example, current efforts at change or reform include urging the VA to place more emphasis on <b>vocational</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and treatment versus cash payments; revising the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; establishing a balance between efforts to decrease claims processing time (productivity) {{with the need for}} consistency and accuracy of examination results and rating decisions (quality); and considering a veteran's quality of life as a factor in determining the disability rating.|$|E
