The heat sink is designed with corrugated fins to improve its heat dissipation capability. The experiments are performed using variable coolant <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and input heating powers. The experimental results show a high and reliable thermal performance using the heat sink with corrugated fins. The heat transfer capability is improved up to 30 W/cm 2 when the base temperature is kept at a stable and acceptable level. Besides the heat transfer capability enhancement, the capability of the system to transfer heat for a long distance is also studied and a fast thermal response time to reach steady state is observed once the input heating power or the volume <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> are varied.

25|$|Weirs allow hydrologists and {{engineers}} a simple method of measuring the <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> in small to medium-sized streams/rivers or in industrial discharge locations. Since {{the geometry of}} the top of the weir is known and all water flows over the weir, the depth of water behind the weir can be converted to a rate of flow. However, this can only be achieved in locations where all water flows {{over the top of the}} weir crest (as opposed to around the sides or through conduits/sluices) and at locations where the water that flows over the crest is carried away from the structure. If these conditions are not met, it can make flow measurement complicated, inaccurate or even impossible.|$|E

We demonstrate here that the voltage–current characteristics of a micro-reactor channel network can be accurately modelled using measurements of the full 3 -D geometry of the channel network, the liquid conductivity and the channel wall–liquid surface conductivity. It is shown that surface conductivity provides {{a significant contribution to}} the overall measured electrical currents in channel networks for which the ratio of surface area to volume is high. Following correction for surface conductivity, the electrical currents are proportional to the liquid <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> measured in the different branches of the channel network.

40|$|The Environmental Transport Group of the Environmental Technology Section was {{requested}} {{to predict the}} seven-day ten-year low flow (7 Q 10 flow) for the SRS streams based on historical stream flow records. Most of the historical flow records for the SRS streams include reactor coolant water discharged from the reactors and process water released from the process facilities. The most straight forward way to estimate the stream daily natural flow is to subtract the measured upstream reactor and/or facility daily effluents from the measured downstream daily flow. Unfortunately, this method does not always work, {{as indicated by the}} fact that sometimes the measured downstream <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> are lower than the reactor effluent <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> For those cases that cannot be analyzed with the simple subtracting method, an alternative method was used to estimate the stream natural flows by statistically separating reactor coolant and process water flow data. The correlation between the calculated 7 Q 10 flows and the watershed areas for Four Mile Branch and Pen Branch agrees with that calculated by the USGS for Upper Three Runs and Lower Three Runs Creeks. The agreement between these two independent calculations lends confidence to the 7 Q 10 flow calculations presented in this report...|$|R

2500|$|For an open-system, design {{constraints}} include washout {{characteristics of}} the animal chamber and sensitivity of the gas analyzers. [...] However, the basic principle remains the same: What goes in must come out. The primary distinction between an open and closed system is that the open system flows air through the chamber (i.e., air is pushed or pulled by pump) {{at a rate that}} constantly replenishes the O2 depleted by the animal while removing the CO2 and water vapor produced by the animal. The <b>volumetric</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> must be high enough to ensure that the animal never consumes all of the oxygen present in the chamber while at the same time, the rate must be low enough so that the animal consumes enough O2 for detection. For a 20g mouse, flow rates of about 200ml/min through 500ml containers would provide a good balance. At this flow rate, about 40ml of O2 is brought to the chamber and the entire volume of air in the chamber is exchanged within 5 minutes. For other smaller animals, chamber volumes can be much smaller and flow rates would be adjusted down as well. Note that for warm-blooded or endothermic animals (birds and mammals), chamber sizes and or flow rates would be selected to accommodate their higher metabolic rates.|$|E
