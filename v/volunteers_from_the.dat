5|$|As {{the weather}} turned colder and rations grew smaller, groups of Texians began to leave, most without permission. Morale was boosted on November 18, {{when the first}} group of <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States, the New Orleans Greys, joined the Texian army.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Royal Australian Regiment lie in the {{decision}} made by the Australian government to raise a force for occupation duties in Japan {{at the end of}} the Second World War. The 34th Australian Infantry Brigade was raised in October 1945 from Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) personnel then serving in the South West Pacific Area, with the three battalions of the brigade designated as the 65th, 66th and 67th Australian Infantry Battalions of the AIF. The 65th Battalion was formed from <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 7th Division and the 2/40th Battalion. The 66th Battalion received <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 9th Division and 1st Australian Corps troops. The 67th Battalion was formed from the 3rd, 6th, and 11th Divisions. After concentrating on the island of Morotai, the 34th Brigade moved to Japan and joined the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in February 1946.|$|E

5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} {{the region}} soon afterwards {{with most of}} his squadron, Watrin was still unable to make an impression {{on the walls of}} Porto Ferrajo, and Airey held the town against the French for the last few weeks of the war until news arrived of the ceasefire that accompanied the provisional signing of the Treaty of Amiens on 1 October. On 11 October, <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Maltese Light Infantry arrived to relieve the garrison at Porto Ferrajo. In March 1802 under Article XI of the final terms of the Treaty, the British turned over the entire island to the French and Elba remained in French hands throughout the Napoleonic Wars. The Maltese detachment returned to Malta in April 1802.|$|E
5|$|At all levels, Scouts {{are governed}} by an {{executive}} of trustees, known as executive committees – these could be <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local community who have had ties with the association, either themselves or through their children. An executive normally consists of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, {{and a number of}} other officers. In Group Executive Committees, Group Scout Leaders and Section Leaders also form part of the committee. Their role is to ensure that the best interests of the young people and the community are served by the group, district, county, or national levels of the association.|$|E

5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. <b>Volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> organization assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations {{took place on}} Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally {{held at the}} Hawthorne Bridge in the American West Coast city of Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011. The {{demonstration}} was {{in response}} to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Kheda {{was hit by}} {{floods and}} famine and the {{peasantry}} was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The first Native Americans {{to become}} Orthodox were the Aleuts living {{in contact with}} Siberian fur traders in the mid 18th century. They had been baptized mostly by their Orthodox trading {{partners}} or during occasional visits by priests serving aboard exploring vessels of the Russian navy. Russian colony in Alaska was established in 1784 by merchant Grigory Shelikhov. Shelikhov's attempt to colonize Kodiak Island was met with resistance by the native population. He returned to Russia and installed Alexandr Baranov {{as director of the}} colony. In order to convince the Russian imperial court of the seriousness of his colonial ambitions, Shelikhov recruited <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Valaam, an environment that appears strikingly similar to the Kodiak archipelago's landscape, and Konevitsa monasteries to travel to the new colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulation}} included 3,500 Canadian Army members, representing all of Winnipeg's units, {{making it}} the largest military exercise in Winnipeg to that point. The defending forces were commanded by Colonels E. A. Pridham and D. S. McKay. Troops were drawn from the 18th (Manitoba) Armoured Car Regiment, No. 10 District Engineers and Signals, the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, the Winnipeg Grenadiers, the Winnipeg Light Infantry, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, Veteran's Guard of Canada (including over 300 veterans of the First World War), {{and a number of}} reserve and civilian groups. The 'Nazi' troops were <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Young Men's Board of Trade, using uniforms rented from Hollywood and with painted sabre scars on their faces. They were commanded by Erich von Neurenberg. Approximately $3,000 was spent on the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide <b>volunteers</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and handing it up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
