5000|$|John Godson, who was {{directing}} {{the news that}} night remembered, When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface, the whole BBC control room, with the canteen ladies and security guards standing beside the vision control desk, exploded into cheering and clapping. To us {{it had been a}} similar type of relief as it must have been to Armstrong, his crew and Ground Control. Up to now, nothing had gone wrong. I vividly recall we had Armstrong's 'One small step' spiel with very little distortion, considering he was in full lunar gear. I mean, it was easily comprehensible though, shall we say, slightly garbled. It was quite difficult to make any visual sense out of the first pictures from the lunar surface, as I recollect. But under those circumstances we would have had James Burke describe, <b>voice-over,</b> <b>what</b> we were trying to assimilate with our eyes. I was there to direct the situation - to decide when voice-over explanations were required, to be ready to take actions if the picture circuits failed. In fact, it resulted in quite a calm overnight operation with, if I remember correctly, not a single major panic situation other than numerous sound comprehension problems.|$|E

The Last of Us (2014, Naughty Dog/Sony Computer Entertainment) {{is a case in}} point. I look into the game’s use of subtitles and didactic texts in order to find out to the extent speech acts shape the player’s understanding of what the video game is. As an understudied aspect of video games, HUD or menu elements, as well as characters’ exchanges and <b>voice-over</b> narration, disclose <b>what</b> {{it is like to be}} alive, dead or in-between. Essentially, they show the tensions between the avatar and the gamer: the hero makes all of the decisions by himself and the player has to abide or stop playing all together. The avatar’s identity comes alive through speech acts, while the player is left outside decision-making processes. Survival horror gaming, with a religious twist, gives insight into the in-game discussion on the representation of the zombie rather than on the zombie experience as such. On screen, the interplay between speech acts and written language amounts to a procedural language, which suggests that variability in language creates an environment conducive to learning. Particularly, language use is all about group values and communication styles that should help gamers tell apart friends from enemies, good from evil and, finally, people from zombies...|$|R

Even though repeated attempts are being made from within the spatial professions to develop a tectonically or geo-morphologically formulated immunity to these changes, the built environment appears as a subject matter in an increasing number of fields, from trend analytics and economic forecasting to environmental science and health care. One of these new and increasingly important fields of architectonical practice is film production. As a “micro-environment with global span” (Sassen 2003), this spatio-temporal domain has developed its own platforms and tools for commissioning and curating architectural environments, thus providing a new and increasingly important cartography of contemporary space (Abbas, 2003). Here, the emerging film commissions play an active role, engaging not only in promotion of the architectural environment, but furthermore also in its categorization, assessment and reproduction. What we have to ask, however, is what are the premises for this new spatial production, and how does it affect the further intermediation of architectural knowledge? Through a case study of the Oresund Film Commission and its web based “location database”, this paper aims to discuss these and related issues. A compilation of more than five hundred still images of potential locations for film production, covering anything from “fairytale scenery and medieval villages tucked in lush fields” to “contemporary European settings” (www. oresundfilm. com), the database provokingly actualizes the ambiguities of architectural typologization and archival practices – on the one hand its dependency upon an often unarticulated aesthetic narrative or naturalized voice-over {{and on the other hand}} its inclination to blend with a global branding culture. Together with a number of similar location databases, it is, however, also an example of the changing representational and reproductive conditions characterizing a mediatized architectural arena, rendering to the place-specific and local a new and extended role as enunciative entrances in a geo-political play. The paper interrogates and examines this new cinematographically driven locality production as well as the expectations, both for adaptation and change, to which it gives rise. The argument developed is that neither urban design nor architectural curatorship can consider themselves independent of processes of mediatization. Nevertheless, it is not a curatorial assignment to uncritically provide an increasingly powerful media industry with a legitimizing <b>voice-over.</b> Instead, <b>what</b> is needed is rather a new attention to the urban narrative that goes beyond passive commentary, taking into account the discursive potentials that an expanded architectural media-geography eventually holds...|$|R
