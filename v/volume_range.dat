25|$|By {{the time}} of Pet Sounds, Wilson was using up to six of the eight tracks on the {{multitrack}} master {{so that he could}} record the voice of each member separately, allowing him greater control over the vocal balance in the final mix. After mixing down the four-track to mono for overdubbing via an eight-track recorder, six of the remaining seven tracks were usually dedicated to each of the Beach Boys' vocals. The last track was usually reserved for additional elements such as extra vocals or instrumentation. Vocals were recorded using two Neumann U-47s, which Dennis, Carl and Jardine would sing on, and a Shure 545 used by Brian for his leads. Love sang most of the album's bass vocals, and necessitated an extra microphone due to his low <b>volume</b> <b>range.</b> Some of the vocals were recorded at CBS Columbia Square, {{because it was the only}} facility in Los Angeles with an eight-track recorder.|$|E
25|$|Miyazaki {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines {{and that he}} was not always able to finish his monthly instalments for serialization in Animage. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the tankōbon volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form. Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each tankōbon <b>volume,</b> <b>range</b> from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared. The story as re-printed in the tankōbon spans 7 volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.|$|E
25|$|Normal flatus <b>volume</b> <b>range</b> {{is around}} 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} flatus episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.|$|E

40|$|Background: Real-time {{three-dimensional}} echocargiography (RT- 3 D-Echo) and ultrafast {{computed tomography}} (CT) are two novel methods {{for the analysis of}} LV ejection fraction and volumes. Objective: To compare LVEF and volume measurements as obtained using RT- 3 D-Echo and ultrafast CT. Methods: Thirty nine consecutive patients (27 men, mean age of 57 ± 12 years) were studied using RT- 3 D-Echo and 64 -slice ultrafast CT. LVEF and LV volumes were analyzed. Statistical analysis: coefficient of correlation (r: Pearson), Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression analysis, 95 % CI, p< 0. 05. Results: RT- 3 D-Echo measurements: LVEF ranged from 56. 1 to 78. 6 (65. 5 ± 5. 58) %; end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>ranged</b> from 49. 6 to 178. 2 (87 ± 27. 8) ml; end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>ranged</b> from 11. 4 to 78 (33. 1 ± 13. 6) ml. CT scan measurements: LVEF ranged from 53 to 86 % (67. 8 ± 7. 78); end-diastolic <b>volume</b> <b>ranged</b> from 51 to 186 (106. 5 ± 30. 3) ml; end-systolic <b>volume</b> <b>ranged</b> from 7 to 72 (35. 5 ± 13. 4) ml. Correlations between RT- 3 D-Echo and CT were: LVEF (r: 0. 7888, p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 0. 6301 to 0. 8843); end-diastolic volume (r: 0. 7695, p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 0. 5995 to 0. 8730); end-systolic volume (r: 0. 8119, p< 0. 0001, 95 % CI 0. 6673 to 0. 8975). Conclusion: Good correlation between LVEF and ventricular volume parameters as measured by RT- 3 D-Echo and 64 -slice ultrafast CT was found in the present case series.
