25|$|EMR in {{the visible}} light region {{consists}} of quanta (called photons) {{that are at}} the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectrum,</b> EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule retinal in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.|$|E
25|$|Wavelength is {{a measure}} of the {{distance}} between repetitions of a shape feature such as peaks, valleys, or zero-crossings, not a measure of how far any given particle moves. For example, in sinusoidal waves over deep water a particle near the water's surface moves in a circle of the same diameter as the wave height, unrelated to wavelength. The range of wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a spectrum. The name originated with the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectrum</b> but now can be applied to the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as to a sound spectrum or vibration spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Jung drew {{an analogy}} between the psyche and {{light on the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum. The center of the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectrum</b> (i.e., yellow) corresponds to consciousness, which grades into unconsciousnessness at the red and blue ends. Red corresponds to basic unconscious urges, and the invisible infra-red {{end of the spectrum}} corresponds to the influence of biological instinct, which merges with its chemical and physical conditions. The blue end of the spectrum represents spiritual ideas; and the archetypes, exerting their influence from beyond the visible, correspond to the invisible realm of ultra-violet. Jung suggested that not only do the archetypal structures govern the behavior of all living organisms, but that they were contiguous with structures controlling the behavior of inorganic matter as well.|$|E

25|$|Biofluorescence is the {{absorption}} of electromagnetic wavelengths from the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectrum</b> by fluorescent proteins in a living organism, and the reemission of that light at a lower energy level. This causes the light that is re-emitted {{to be a different}} color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescent light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.|$|E
500|$|The {{surface of}} Titan has been {{described}} as [...] "complex, fluid-processed, [...] geologically young". Titan has been around since the Solar System's formation, but its surface is much younger, between 100 million and 1 billion years old. Geological processes may have reshaped Titan's surface. Titan's atmosphere is twice as thick as Earth's, making it difficult for astronomical instruments to image its surface in the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The Cassini spacecraft used infrared instruments, radar altimetry and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging to map portions of Titan during its close fly-bys. The first images revealed a diverse geology, with both rough and smooth areas. There are features that may be volcanic in origin, disgorging water mixed with ammonia onto the surface. There is also evidence that Titan's ice shell may be substantially rigid, which would suggest little geologic activity.|$|E
2500|$|Colour-producing {{molecules}} {{fall into}} two distinct classes: biochromes and structural colours or [...] "schemochromes". The biochromes include true pigments, such as carotenoids and pteridines. These pigments selectively absorb parts of the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectrum</b> that makes up white light while permitting other wavelengths to reach [...] {{the eye of the}} observer. Structural colours are produced by various combinations of diffraction, reflection or scattering of light from structures with a scale around a quarter of the wavelength of light. Many such structures interfere with some wavelengths (colours) of light and transmit others, simply because of their scale, so they often produce iridescence, creating different colours when seen from different directions.|$|E

The SOT consists of two optically separable components: the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA), consisting of a 50 -cm aperture Gregorian with a collimating lens unit and an active tip-tilt mirror, and an accompanying Focal Plane Package (FPP), housing two filtergraphs and a spectro-polarimeter. The optomechanical and optothermal performance of the OTA is cru-cial to attain unprecedented high-quality solar observations.

The philosophy included {{the idea that the}} product's user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated. Various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned [...] "S-numbers" [...] (spectral numbers) ranging from S-1 through S-40, which are still in use today. For example, S-11 uses the caesium-antimony photocathode with a lime glass window, S-13 uses the same photocathode with a fused silica window, and S-25 uses a so-called [...] "multialkali" [...] photocathode (Na-K-Sb-Cs, or sodium-potassium-antimony-caesium) that provides extended response in the red portion of the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectrum.</b> No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode.|$|E

40|$|ZnO {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} candidate for photoelectrochemical splitting of water for hydrogen production. To increase the efficiency of ZnO based photoelectrochemical cell, its band-gap and band edges should be tailored to match <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> <b>spectra</b> and water redox potential respectively. In this paper, First-principles density functional theory calculations have been performed to evaluate the effect of non-metal dopants on electronic properties of ZnO. The model structures of X-doped ZnO were constructed using 32 -atom 2 x 2 x 2 supercell of wurtzite ZnO with one O atom replaced with X (carbon C, phosphorus P). With respect to the electronic band structure, C (2 p), P (3 p) states are located above the valence band maximum of ZnO and mixing of these states is feeble to produce significant band gap narrowing. Doping of these non-metals dopants helps in the creation of isolated states which enhances <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> absorption of ZnO. Our theoretical calculations are consistent with the experimental results of C (P) doped ZnO and fully explains its <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> activity on non-metal doping...|$|R
