5|$|In the 1985 Indianapolis 500, he {{was passed}} {{for the lead}} by Danny Sullivan in Turn One on lap 139. Immediately after {{completing}} the pass, Sullivan spun in front of Andretti. A caution for the spin, minimized the time Sullivan would lose to Andretti by pitting to replace 20 laps later Sullivan took the lead for good when he passed Andretti without incident. Andretti dominated the 1987 Indianapolis 500, leading 170 of the first 177 laps of the race. His lead was so large, that he was advised to slow his pace to preserve his equipment. In a cruel twist of fate, when Andretti started running slower, his reduced engine rpm's created a harmonic imbalance in his turbocharged Ilmor/Chevrolet V8 {{that led to a}} broken <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> with 20 laps to go.|$|E

50|$|Poppet valves {{typically}} require small coil <b>springs,</b> appropriately named <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> to {{keep them}} closed when not actuated by the camshaft. They {{are attached to the}} valve stem ends, seating within spring retainers. Other mechanisms can be used in place of <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> to keep the valves closed: Formula 1 engines employ pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> in which pneumatic pressure closes the valves, while motorcycle manufacturer Ducati uses desmodromic valve drive which mechanically close the valves.|$|R
50|$|Stiffer <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> {{can help}} prevent valve float and valve bounce, but only {{at the expense of}} {{increased}} friction losses and higher stresses in the valvetrain. Various techniques have been used to offset the effect of stiffer springs, such as dual-spring and progressive-sprung valves, roller-tipped tappets, and pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
25|$|Free-flow: Either of {{the stages}} may {{get stuck in}} the open position, causing a {{continuous}} flow of gas from the regulator known as a free-flow. This can be triggered by a range of causes, some {{of which can be}} easily remedied, others not. Possible causes include incorrect interstage pressure setting, incorrect second stage <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> tension, damaged or sticking valve poppet, damaged valve seat, valve freezing, wrong sensitivity setting at the surface and in Poseidon servo-assisted second stages, low interstage pressure.|$|E
25|$|A {{weighted}} dump {{line will}} automatically start open the valve to start dumping excess air if the weight is lifted off the bottom. This {{will stop the}} lift from ascending any further if the dump valve releases air fast enough. When the weight is lowered back to the bottom by the sinking load, the valve will close again, and should hold the load steady. The stability of this system depends on the preload of the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> {{and the size of}} the valve opening.|$|E

50|$|Valve float was {{analyzed}} {{and found to}} be caused largely by resonance in <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> that generated oscillating compression waves among coils, much like a Slinky. High speed photography showed that at specific resonant speeds, <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> were no longer making contact at one or both ends, leaving the valve floatingbefore crashing into the cam on closure.|$|R
25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of <b>valve</b> <b>spring)</b> to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
25|$|Juddering, shuddering and moaning: This {{is caused}} by an {{irregular}} and unstable flow from the second stage, It {{may be caused by}} a slight positive feedback between flow rate in the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, but enough to cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are tuned for maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> pressure often stops this problem. Juddering may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts.|$|E
2500|$|When the diver {{starts to}} inhale, {{the removal of}} gas from the casing lowers the {{pressure}} inside the chamber, and the external water pressure moves the diaphragm inwards operating a lever. This lifts the valve off its seat, releasing gas into the chamber. The inter-stage gas, at about [...] over ambient pressure, expands through the valve orifice as its pressure is reduced to ambient and supplies the diver with more gas to breathe. When the diver stops inhaling the chamber fills until the external pressure is balanced, the diaphragm returns to its rest position and the lever releases the valve to be closed by the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> and gas flow stops.|$|E

2500|$|Cams {{that have}} {{excessive}} valve lift, running at high rpm, can cause {{what is called}} [...] "valve float", where the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> tension is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex. This {{could also be a}} result of a very steep rise of the lobe, where the valve is effectively shot off the end of the cam rather than following the cams’ profile. [...] This is typically what happens when a motor over revs. [...] This is where the engine rpm exceeds the maximum design rpm. [...] The valve train is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily. [...] Sometimes an over rev can cause engine failure when the valves become bent as a result of colliding with the piston crowns.|$|E

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} springs, and compression springs. The most widely used application are for engine valve springs (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|E

50|$|Nicholas Sulentic (born 24 November 1887 in Croatia) immigrated from Croatia (then part of {{the former}} Austro-Hungarian Empire) to the United States in 1906, at age 15, living in Illinois and Wyoming before coming to Waterloo in 1916 to enter the grocery store {{business}} with his brother. Their business was located {{at the intersection of}} East Fourth and Adams Streets in a two-story brick building. He became president of North Waterloo Meat Co. and operated Pinkerton's grocery and bakery, the city's first supermarket, in 1921. He established a small factory on East Fourth Street but found the design of the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> compressor he had purchased was already protected by a patent. So, he invented his own device, a <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> lifter, and combined it with a compressor. This device enabled garage mechanics to more easily gain access to parts within an engine. He founded Waterloo <b>Valve</b> <b>Spring</b> Compressor Co. in 1922. The company prospered and diversified from making tools to tool chests. The company was renamed Waterloo Industries in 1967 and became a successful tool storage manufacturer, with retail and industrial customers such as Sears (Craftsman brand), Lowe's, and Cornwell.|$|E
