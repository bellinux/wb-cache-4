5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El <b>Vigia</b> hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E

40|$|Since 2000, {{a network}} of volunteers known as <b>vigías</b> has been engaged in {{community-based}} volcano monitoring, which involves local citizens {{in the collection of}} scientific data, around volcán Tungurahua, Ecuador. This paper provides the first detailed description and analysis of this well-established initiative, drawing implications for volcanic risk reduction elsewhere. Based on 32 semi-structured interviews and other qualitative data collected in June and July 2013 with institutional actors and with <b>vigías</b> themselves, the paper documents the origins and development of the network, identifies factors that have sustained it, and analyses the ways in which it contributes to disaster risk reduction. Importantly, the case highlights how this community-based network performs multiple functions in reducing volcanic risk. The <b>vigías</b> network functions simultaneously as a source of observational data for scientists; as a communication channel for increasing community awareness, understanding of hazard processes and for enhancing preparedness; and as an early warning system for civil protection. Less tangible benefits with nonetheless material consequences include enhanced social capital – through the relationships and capabilities that are fostered – and improved trust between partners. Establishing trust-based relationships between citizens, the <b>vigías,</b> scientists and civil protection authorities is one important factor in the effectiveness and resilience of the network. Other factors discussed in the paper that have contributed to the longevity of the network include the motivations of the <b>vigías,</b> a clear and regular communication protocol, persistent volcanic activity, the efforts of key individuals, and examples of successful risk reduction attributable to the activities of the network. Lessons that can be learned about the potential of community-based monitoring for disaster risk reduction in other contexts are identified, including what the case tells us about the conditions that can affect the effectiveness of such initiatives and their resilience to changing circumstances...|$|R

25|$|When a 8m (26ft) long whale was sighted, chalupas (chaloupes in French, {{and later}} shallops in English) were sent out, each manned by a steersman, five oarsmen, and a harpooner. The whale was harpooned {{and forced to}} tow a wooden drogue or drag, which was used to tire the whale. Once exhausted, the whale was lanced and killed. If {{darkness}} fell upon the crews before they returned, those ashore would light signal fires at the <b>vigías</b> to guild {{them back to the}} station. The whales were brought alongside a wharf or cutting stage, where they were flensed. The blubber was tried out, cooled, and poured into barricas – casks of oak that held 55 gallons of oil. These casks were towed out to the ship by a boat, where they were stored in the hold. When a full cargo had been obtained, either during the right whale season, or, more often during the later bowhead season, many of the larger ships sailed to Pasaia to discharge their cargoes; they also fitted out of the same port. Pasaia was preferred by both French and Spanish Basques because of its deep-water entrance and the excellent shelter it provided from Biscay storms.|$|R

The results show that many characteristic cuticular features (form of the head, head constriction, prominence of labial disc, presence and number of longitudinal striations on basal lip annule, tail form, form of tail annules, presence of epiptygma, indentation of the bursa) are variable at specific level and cannot be used for specific characterization. Some other characters (number of lip annules, presence of areolations at phasmid level in lateral fields, ornamentation of lateral fields) show a low variability, are relatively constant in the genus, have limited use as identification criteria at the specific level, and help to separate species into groups. Study of the morphology of the epiptygma shows that this organ has a tubular structure which can be retracted and/or coiled into the vagina or protruded from the vulva to varying degrees, appearing in lateral optical section single when flattened or double when the tube is open. The synonymy of Peltamigratus and Nectopelta with Aorolaimus is confirmed.

The focus of this trip, carried out in September 2010 by a field team from the University of Canterbury and University College London, was to investigate both direct and indirect effects of ashfall on critical infrastructure, and the management of ashfall events. In particular we paid attention to less-studied areas of interest including electrical power and healthcare systems. All infrastructure topics explored aspects of resilience and adaptation, in the context of ongoing volcanic unrest at Tungurahua since 1999. Research methods were largely qualitative and included semi-structured interviews, observation, water testing and informal conversations and meetings with locals. A good overview of ashfall impacts on electricity networks, healthcare services and emergency management issues was achieved during the trip. The information gathered adds to our knowledge of the possible effects of volcanic ashfall on infrastructure and public services. Further insights into impacts of water, wastewater, transportation and agriculture were gained. Overall, infrastructure seemed to function well during the 2010 eruption, with only minor problems reported. However, the May 2010 eruption generated only minor ashfalls (a few mm) in most locations. Over the past 11 years of volcanic unrest, other events have caused more serious impacts, particularly a VEI 3 eruption on 16 - 17 August 2006. Electrical supplies suffered few problems, with no reports of electrical flashover from ashfalls. Problems arising from contamination of open water supplies have led to an initiative to cover water supplies. In the transport sector, the 2010 eruption resulted in a two-day closure of Guayaquil international airport due to risks to aircraft. Roads in the Tungurahua region have been frequently damaged by lahars over the past 11 years. The 2010 eruption caused partial damage to 3740 ha of crops. Far more severe, although localised, damage to crops, livestock and rural communities was caused by the August 2006 eruption. Healthcare centres are well-organised and are able to prioritise essential services {{in the event of an}} ashfall, and so experience few major impacts, but a variety of minor impacts on facilities and equipment. A variety of public health pathologies have increased by small amounts in the short term after ashfalls, and psychological impacts in communities affected by eruptions have increased since activity began at Volcán Tungurahua in 1999, and have required increased attention from healthcare professionals in the long term. Emergency management insights provide lessons pertaining to the benefits of local engagement and involvement in risk management, including the influential role of the <b>vigìas,</b> who act as observers of volcanic activity and coordinators of voluntary civil defence within the community. The focus on adaptations and responses to the long-term volcanic activity has provided insights into the long-term effects of volcanic activity and helped identify possible mitigation and prevention measures. It is found that in general, increased maintenance of infrastructure now occurs widely across sectors, and cleanup methods for specific sectors have been developed to cope with ashfalls. The cleanup of ash at the municipal level is well organised, and is coordinated with the National Secretariat of Risk Management such that costs are shared with the proportions adjusted according to the severity of the situation. Increased use of personal protective measures (such as masks and goggles) has achieved a reduction in 2011 GNS Science Report 2011 / 24 vi public health impacts. Healthcare centres are also well organised, forming brigades for rapid response in affected areas, and having a clear hierarchy of health centres within each region so that patients can be transferred if necessary. They have good knowledge of the volcanic alert level system and the protocols required for each alert level change. Emergency management also appears organised. Emergency drills are run in at-risk communities, and contingency plans are updated and revised following eruptions. Hazard warning and shelter signage is also widespread in the Tungurahua volcanic hazard area. Overall, we found clear evidence for increased organisation and improved management procedures in the Tungurahua volcanic hazard area, which should have strengthened societal resilience. Additionally individual adaptive behaviour has included: increased use of personal protective equipment, which has reduced public health effects; farmers growing more ash-resilient crops including onions, and using greenhouses for crop growth; farmers only rearing livestock for a shortened period of time in the area, in order to prevent tooth abrasion; and an initiative to cover water supplies to protect them from contamination by ashfalls. Other examples of adaptations to infrastructure have included: widespread hazard signage; sirens in and around Baños for early warning (with an alternate power supply in case of power cuts, and a contingency emergency services siren system); floodgate design at Agoyan dam for bypassing turbulent water; and the development of plans to relocate electrical transmission towers away from valleys that have, in the past, been affected by lahars. Further studies in the Tungurahua volcanic area would be beneficial, to gain long-term understanding of volcanic ash consequences on a variety of sectors, including those explored in less depth in this study...|$|R
