25|$|Since Japan is {{an island}} nation and gets struck by typhoons every year, {{research}} about {{the dynamics of the}} atmosphere is a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue.</b> For this reason Japan launched in 1997 the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite in cooperation with NASA, to observe the tropical rainfall seasons. For further research NASDA had launched the ADEOS and ADEOS II missions in 1996 and 2003. However, due to various reasons both satellites had a much shorter than expected life term.|$|E

Neither during the Latin Empire nor during the Palaiologan period were any repair works executed, but by that time the population of the city had shrunk to about 40,000–50,000 inhabitants, so that the water supply was no longer a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue.</b> Nevertheless, according to Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo, a Castilian diplomat who traveled to Constantinople en route to an embassy to Timur in 1403, the aqueduct was still functioning.|$|E
25|$|A <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> for all neuroscientific or neurocomputational {{approaches}} is {{to separate}} structure and knowledge. While {{the structure of}} the model (i.e. of the human neuronal network, which is needed for processing speech) is mainly determined by evolutionary processes, the knowledge is gathered mainly during speech acquisition by processes of learning. Different learning experiments were carried out with the model ACT in order to learn (i) a five-vowel system /i, e, a, o, u/ (see Kröger et al. 2009), (ii) a small consonant system (voiced plosives /b, d, g/ in combination with all five vowels acquired earlier as CV syllables (ibid.), (iii) a small model language comprising the five-vowel system, voiced and unvoiced plosives /b, d, g, p, t, k/, nasals /m, n/ and the lateral /l/ and three syllable types (V, CV, and CCV) (see Kröger et al. 2011) and (iv) the 200 most frequent syllables of Standard German for a 6 year old child (see Kröger et al. 2011). In all cases, an ordering of phonetic items with respect to different phonetic features can be observed.|$|E

500|$|Professor Maury Dean {{wrote in}} his book Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia, that the main appeal of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] lay in its teen appeal, {{although}} he understood that at its core, it was addressing a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue</b> of female liberation. Kevin Phinney from Austin American-Statesman commented that with [...] "Express Yourself", Madonna struck out her [...] "Material Girl" [...] persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of hers is concrete. Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of Philadelphia Daily News declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice from Like a Prayer. Andy Goldberg from The Jerusalem Post was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences. Rolling Stones J. D. Considine called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] an unabashed groove tune and felt that it seemed [...] "smart and sassy, right down to Madonna's soul-style testimony on the intro: 'Come on, girls, {{do you believe in}} love?" [...] Don McCleese from Chicago Sun-Times declared the song as {{one of the highlights of}} the album, feeling that it would become anthemic. Sal Cinquemani from Slant magazine, while reviewing Like a Prayer, announced [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the most soulful performance of Madonna's career. He added that the song [...] "turned Madonna's 'Material Girl' image on its head, denouncing material things for a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song consisted of [...] "deep funk" [...] music.|$|E
2500|$|Dönitz {{government}} ordered dissolved by Eisenhower: Karl Dönitz {{continued to}} act {{as if he were the}} German head of state, but his Flensburg government (so-called because it was based at Flensburg in northern Germany and controlled only a small area around the town), was not recognized by the Allies. On 12 May an Allied liaison team arrived in Flensburg and took quarters aboard the passenger ship Patria. The liaison officers and the Supreme Allied Headquarters soon realized that they had no need to act through the Flensburg government and that its members should be arrested. On 23 May, acting on SHAEF's orders and with the approval of the Soviets, American Major General Rooks summoned Dönitz aboard the Patria and communicated to him that he and all the members of his Government were under arrest, and that their government was dissolved. The Allies had a problem, because they realized that although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, SHAEF had failed to use the document created by the [...] "European Advisory Commission" [...] (EAC) and so there had been no formal surrender by the civilian German government. This was considered a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue,</b> because just as the civilian, but not military, surrender in 1918 had been used by Hitler to create the [...] "stab in the back" [...] argument, the Allies did not want to give any future hostile German regime a legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.|$|E
2500|$|Senegal {{people are}} not prosecuted for their sexual {{orientation}}. Sexual orientation in Senegal is a purely private matter. It is a private matter, nothing more. For many years now, we have seen homosexuality in our country and that has never lead to situations where homosexuals are harassed, persecuted, or prosecuted. What {{has happened is that}} there have been sutiations where shocking behavior which ran counter to our religious beliefs and morality which [...] punishes unnatural sexual relations. I would ask you to understand the social realities of our country. This is an issue which is very complex. It is a very complicated issue in Senegal. Let me say once again in Senegal homosexuals lead freely ... we even had a federal republic to authorize a homosexual to have their name changed to a woman's name in order to emphasize their feminine side. No one was shocked when the president authorized the man to adopt the woman's name. But when homosexuality becomes blatantly public, it leads to embarrassing situations. You have to understand that we are a country with a particularly tolerant form of Islam. And that is why we must avoid, we must avoid the development of fundamentalism. We must ensure social cohesion. We must also take measures to protect the lives of homosexuals. That is why I ask you to bear in mind our society, our sociological realities. This is a perfectly complicated issue for us where there are some problems but we are aware of them. ... I would like {{to go back to a}} <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>issue.</b> We are all struggling for the independence of our judges, for the independence of our justice system. If the courts hand down a decision, you cannot say the government is responsible for that court decision. The ... independent justice system which hands down a decision. And that is what the courts did in the case of the trials of these homosexuals. And I must say ... for 25 years I was a lawyer at the bar. I know the Senegalese justice system from the inside. ... Over those years there have been three cases where homosexuals were brought before the courts. The first case was an organized homosexual marriage with a lot of fuss, a lot of publicity. The police arrested them and the court case led to an acquittal. The second case of homosexuals related to a foreign national who was already rather elderly who married a young Senegalese boy. And I would like to warn you ... that if an elderly man marries a young boy, the young boy does it so that he can emigrate and go in live in France or some other country abroad, that is the interest of the young person in getting married. This led to a conviction and an appeal was made against the conviction and ... the foreigner was able to leave the country after they were acquitted on appeal. And the third case ... is the case of homosexuals who joined together again with a great deal of fuss, carried out activities which led to disturbances in the neighborhood. The neighbors complained and the police acted. This has already been tried in the first instance, and an appeal has been made against that judgment, and the justice system is now dealing with this case independently on appeal.|$|E
