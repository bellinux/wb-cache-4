During the last decade almost all companies have been certificated according to various <b>management</b> <b>systems,</b> like quality <b>management</b> <b>system,</b> environmental <b>management</b> <b>system,</b> health and safety <b>management</b> <b>system</b> and others; furthermore many companies have implemented an integrated <b>management</b> <b>system,</b> by integrating two or more <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> The problem rising today is how to integrate innovation in this integrated <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> The challenge of the problem is that the development of an innovation <b>management</b> <b>system</b> is in the early phase. In this paper we have studied the possibility of integrating some of the innovation request in an existing <b>management</b> <b>system,</b> we have identify the innovation performance request and we proposed some recommendations regarding innovation management and its implementation as a part of an integrated <b>management</b> <b>system.</b> This paper lies down the bases for developing an model of integration <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> that include innovation as a main part of it...|$|R

This thesis also constructs a theoretical framework {{from the perspective of}} decentralization, focusing upon the change of relationships between the Chinese government, market and society, to gain an in-depth insight of changes in the development of Chinese planning <b>management</b> <b>system</b> since 1978.
