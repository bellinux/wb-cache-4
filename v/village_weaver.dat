40|$|This {{research}} {{is set in}} the context of a collaborative agreement between the Industrial Design Department, University of Canberra and the Faculty of Applied Art and Design at Ubon Rajathanee University in the northeast or Isan region of Thailand. In this thesis the textile production of the region was studied with an objective of evaluating the potential for product design process to positively influence production outcomes. Traditional textile production techniques could be lost because these processes are complex and slow, and the current environment, both physical and operational, is changing rapidly. Product design and the design process are relevant to the industrial development of Thailand and village textile production could benefit from structured design and manufacturing strategies that have a consumer focus and improved production outcomes. From a critical review of the relevant literature, it was found that <b>village</b> <b>weavers</b> valued the traditions of their craft and traditional patterns and colours were important in terms of cultural identity and village social organization. Product design process or more specifically, the Generic Design Process (GDP) was reviewed and a model developed that adapted the GDP to the prevailing research environment. The findings led to a program of field research including village interviews where the major issue of the devaluation of traditional natural material dyeing techniques was identified. Field experiments tested alternative dyeing techniques which were evaluated in a survey by <b>village</b> <b>weavers.</b> During the field research care was taken to adapt to the way in which <b>village</b> <b>weavers</b> lived and worked as the two activities were closely interrelated. The degree of skill and knowledge residing in the aging women, who constitute the majority of <b>village</b> <b>weavers,</b> in extensive and profound, and is often described as an example of local wisdom. The theoretical and experimental work has been related, with appropriate results and conclusions, to the potential for maintaining traditional natural dyeing processes albeit with different preservation techniques. The findings from this research suggests that product design processes are appropriate for village production and that the tradition of natural material colour dyes will survive, new colours were created and the potential for new trade in preserved colour dye products. Substantial databases of useful relevant information have been compiled and recommendations are made for future research...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that birds build nests {{according to a}} genetic ‘template’, little influenced by learning or memory. One way to confirm the role of genetics in nest building is to assess the repeatability of nest morphology with repeated nest attempts. Solitary weaver birds, which build multiple nests in a single breeding season, are a useful group with which to do this. Here we show that repeatability of nest morphology was low, but significant, in male Southern Masked weaver birds and not significant in the <b>Village</b> <b>weavers.</b> The larger bodied <b>Village</b> <b>weavers</b> built larger nests than did Southern Masked weavers, but body size did not explain variation in Southern Masked weaver nest dimensions. Nests built by the same male in both species got shorter and lighter as more nests were constructed. While these data demonstrate {{the potential for a}} genetic component of variation in nest building in solitary weavers, {{it is also clear that}} there remains plenty of scope in both of these species for experience to shape nest construction...|$|R

25|$|Carpets woven {{in towns}} and {{regional}} centers like Tabriz, Kerman, Mashhad, Kashan, Isfahan, Nain and Qom {{are characterized by}} their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small <b>village</b> <b>weavers</b> often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, {{as opposed to the}} artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces.

40|$|Passerine {{hosts of}} brood {{parasitic}} birds usually {{vary in their}} ability to discriminate and reject alien eggs. Two main hypotheses have been suggested to explain the persistence of acceptor individuals in species that are exploited by brood parasites. The evolutionary lag hypothesis postulates that some hosts have not yet evolved the ability to discriminate against alien eggs. Once the ability to recognize the parasitic egg has appeared by mutation, it spreads because of the selective advantage of rejection. Parasites are then selected to produce more mimetic eggs, in order to escape host discrimination, which eventually ends up in an arms race between the parasite and the host. The evolutionary equilibrium hypothesis {{is based on the assumption}} that rejection behaviour is costly in the absence of parasitism, because of recognition errors. Acceptor hosts can persist when parasitism rate fluctuates or is consistently low. Indirect evidence for costs of rejection in the absence of parasitism has been provided by Cruz and Wiley, who reported low rejection rate for a population of <b>village</b> <b>weavers</b> (Ploceus cucullatus) introduced from Africa to Hispaniola (West Indies) more than a century ago. In Africa the species is parasitized by Chrysococcyx cuckoos and shows high levels of egg discrimination. Since no brood parasite was present in Hispaniola, Cruz and Wiley suggested that rejection was selected against in the absence of parasitism due to recognition costs. Introduction of <b>village</b> <b>weavers</b> in Hispaniola, therefore, provided a unique opportunity to test the decline of an adaptation. During the past century the shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) has expanded its range-invading most of the West Indies from South America. It was first observed in Hispaniola in 1972, and it started to exploit <b>village</b> <b>weavers</b> as a host. Given that shiny cowbirds substantially reduce the reproductive success of weavers, we should expect higher rejection rates nowadays compared to those reported by Cruz and Wiley 16 years ago. In agreement with this prediction, we found a high rejection rate of cowbird model eggs (89. 3 %, 95 % CI = 81. 1 to 97. 5 %), moderate levels of rejection of non-mimetic weaver model eggs (67. 5 %, 95 % CI = 52. 5 to 82. 5 %) and rather low levels of rejection of mimetic weaver model eggs (25 %, 95 % CI = 4 to 46 %). The rejection rate of artificial cowbird eggs has therefore increased from 13. 8 % (95 % CI = 5 to 22. 6 %) to 89. 3 % in 16 years. To check whether this rapid increase in host resistance is compatible with a genetic microevolutionary change, we built a population dynamics model where, as an upper bound, resistance is inherited by the progeny with a probability of one. This simple model shows that observed changes of rejection rate are compatible with a genetic microevolutionary shift only under the most favourable scenario for rejecters to spread. Relaxing one or several of these assumptions (e. g. high parasitism rate, absence of rejection costs) considerably lengthens the period needed for rejecters to spread. We suggest that both genetic and learning processes might be involved in the observed changes...|$|R
50|$|Village weavers forage and roost {{in large}} groups, often with other weaver species. In some areas, they move {{periodically}} along fixed routes.

40|$|Historical {{introductions}} of species into new habitats can create rare opportunities to test evolutionary hypotheses, {{such as the}} role of natural selection in maintaining traits. This study examines two independent {{introductions of}} the African village weaverbird (Ploceus cucullatus) to islands where selection on egg appearance traits is expected to differ markedly {{from that of the}} source populations. The color and spotting of <b>village</b> <b>weaver</b> eggs in Africa are highly consistent within clutches, but highly variable between individuals. These two features may be an evolutionary response to brood parasitism. In Africa, weavers are parasitized by each other and by the diederik cuckoo (Chrysococcyx caprius), an egg mimic. African village weavers were introduced one century ago to Mauritius, and over two centuries ago to Hispaniola. Both islands are devoid of egg-mimicking brood parasites. In these two populations, between-individual variation and within-clutch consistency in egg appearance have both decreased, as has the incidence of spotting, relative to the source populations in Africa. These reductions are more pronounced on Hispaniola, the earlier introduction. Such changes support the hypothesis that egg appearance in the African <b>village</b> <b>weaver</b> has been maintained by natural selection as a counteradaptation to cuckoo brood parasitism. These results illustrate that the removal of an agent of selection can sometimes bring about rapid evolutionary consequences...|$|E
