500|$|Author Jennifer Fleeger {{wrote in}} her book Mismatched Women: The Siren's Song Through the Machine (2014) that the studio's {{decision}} to cast Nixon, an American who had previously done similar work as the singing voices of a Puerto Rican and Englishwoman in the musical films West Side Story (1961) and My Fair Lady (1964), respectively, as an elderly Chinese woman [...] "speaks <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> desired singing voices of these supposedly diverse new characters." [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] was one of Nixon's final film performances before her death in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more positive. The New Statesmans Robert Potts found the stories [...] "entertaining and {{intriguing}} for readers familiar with their background {{and with the}} genre", {{and for the most}} part charmingly innocent, [...] "especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life". [...] The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in The Independent found the Willow Gables fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's [...] "sly Sapphic spin". In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal Daedalus, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in The Times Literary Supplement, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, [...] "the Brunette phase speaks <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation".|$|E

In 1986, he hosted “Pride of Place: Building the American Dream,” an eight-part documentary series which aired on PBS. The series featured Peter Eisenman, Leon Krier, Philip Johnson, Frank Gehry, and other notable architects. [...] "Pride of Place" [...] was well received by the public, although other architects disliked it. He has also written extensively about American architecture, especially that of New York City, having published five <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> city's architectural history, each focusing on a different decade or period.|$|E

Congratulating the Turkish Prime Minister {{on behalf of the}} people and the government of Pakistan as well as his own and on behalf of his family, Prime Minister Gilani said that AKP's impressive electoral success shows a victory for democracy. He further said that [...] "this win of his party in third consecutive elections speaks <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> trust Turkish people repose in his leadership and the government's policies." [...] The Prime Minister hoped that the relations with Turkey would further be strengthened under the stewardship of Erdoğan as both brotherly nations have mutuality of views on regional and international issues.|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Vergne was happy with his maiden victory, saying it felt [...] "extremely satisfying" [...] as he endured a difficult season and it would improve his team's confidence in the future, [...] "There were mistakes as a team but nevertheless, to get second places, double podiums and then a win today is an amazing feeling." [...] He stated the win would put Techeetah's personnel in a positive state of mind {{and that they would}} return for the following the season as a stronger force in the series. Rosenqvist revealed that Bird was his main rival over the race weekend and that his focus was to secure third place in the Drivers' Championship. Nevertheless, he was delighted to finish in the top three driver's standings in his maiden Formula E season, [...] "I think it speaks <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> kind of effort we have made as a team. Big, warm thanks to Mahindra Racing for putting their trust in me and for giving me the tools to achieve this.” Third-place finisher López spoke of his pleasure finishing in the position following his first race retirement, [...] "I could tell straightaway what a difference the team had made to the car since my last race and it was frustrating our qualifying group meant we were unable to show this. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the race and of course the whole season, as well as working with the DS Virgin Racing team.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Floodway Park, {{bounded by}} North Main Street, Station Street, the Center Township boundary, and Yellow Creek, is a multi-use {{recreational}} site maintained by Homer-Center Parks and Recreation. [...] It offers visitors two softball fields with bleachers, a pavilion with electricity, a walking trail, restroom facilities, parking for events {{and serves as}} a [...] "trailhead" [...] for the Hoodlebug Trail. [...] Its name speaks <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> history of this section of the borough and the origins of the park itself. [...] It is located on a natural flood plain adjacent to Yellow Creek Park, and it represents [...] a different approach to land use: it can be developed and used on a regular basis, but in ways that do not profoundly inhibit the flood plain nor will structures built on the plain be ruined should severe flooding occur. [...] Prior to the Flood of '77 the area was an extension of the Main Street/Downtown Business District. [...] C. S. Kunkle Lumber, Sesti's Restaurant, the Colonial Hotel, and the original location of Luther Ford Sales at one point all stood where the park is now found. [...] (A residential neighborhood was located behind the businesses, too. [...] On {{the opposite side of the}} creek the Empire - later Homer City - Theater dating to 1913 was another prominent structure.) [...] The entire area was decimated by the Flood of 1977 with clean-up and restoration of the landscape lasting into the 1980s and the dedication of the park in the early 1990s.|$|E

60|$|And the bandmaster wrote a work {{of twenty-five}} <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{artificial}} bird. It was so learned, long, and so full of the hardest Chinese words that everyone said they had read it and understood it; for once they had been very stupid about a book, and had been trampled under foot in consequence. So a whole year passed. The Emperor, the Court, and all the Chinese knew every note of the artificial bird's song by heart. But they liked it all the better for this; they could even sing with it, and they did. The street boys sang 'Tra-la-la-la-la, and the Emperor sang too sometimes. It was indeed delightful.|$|E

You could see the fire horses harnessed with logging chains to the uprights of the shed to tear the building from its place.|$|E
6000|$|I reverently {{believe that}} the Maker who made us all makes {{everything}} in New England but the weather. I don't know who makes that, but I think it must be raw apprentices in the weather-clerk's factory who experiment and learn how, in New England, for board and clothes, and then are promoted to make weather for countries that require a good article, and will take their custom elsewhere if they don't get it. There is a sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels the stranger's admiration--and regret. The weather is always doing something there; always attending strictly to business; always getting up new designs and trying them on the people {{to see how they}} will go. But it gets through more business in spring than in any other season. In the spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of weather inside of four-and-twenty hours. It was I that made the fame and fortune of that man that had that marvellous collection of weather on exhibition at the Centennial, that so astounded the foreigners. He was going to travel {{all over the world and}} get specimens from all the climes. I said, [...] "Don't you do it; you come to New England on a favorable spring day." [...] I told him what we could do in the way of style, variety, and quantity. Well, he came and he made his collection in four days. As to variety, why, he confessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather that he had never heard of before. And as to quantity well, after he had picked out and discarded all that was blemished in any way, he not only had weather enough, but weather to spare; weather to hire out; weather to sell; to deposit; weather to invest; weather to give to the poor. The people of New England are by nature patient and forbearing, but there are some things which they will not stand. Every year they kill a lot of poets for writing about [...] "Beautiful Spring." [...] These are generally casual visitors, who bring their notions of spring from somewhere else, and cannot, of course, know how the natives feel about spring. And so the first thing they know the opportunity to inquire how they feel has permanently gone by. Old Probabilities has a mighty reputation for accurate prophecy, and thoroughly well deserves it. You take up the paper and observe how crisply and confidently he checks off what to-day's weather is going to be on the Pacific, down South, in the Middle States, in the Wisconsin region. See him sail along in the joy and pride of his power till he gets to New England, and then see his tail drop. He doesn't know what the weather is going to be in New England. Well, he mulls over it, and by and-by he gets out something about like this: Probably northeast to southwest winds, varying to the southward and westward and eastward, and points between, high and low barometer swapping around from place to place; probable areas of rain, snow, hail, and drought, succeeded or preceded by earthquakes, with thunder and lightning. Then he jots down his postscript from his wandering mind, to cover accidents. [...] "But it is possible that the programme may be wholly changed in the mean time." [...] Yes, one of the brightest gems in the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it. There is only one thing certain about it: you are certain there is going to be plenty of it--a perfect grand review; but you never can tell which end of the procession is going to move first. You fix up for the drought; you leave your umbrella in the house and sally out, and two to one you get drowned. You make up your mind that the earthquake is due; you stand from under, and take hold of something to steady yourself, and the first thing you know you get struck by lightning. These are great disappointments; but they can't be helped. The lightning there is peculiar; it is so convincing, that when it strikes a thing it doesn't leave enough of that thing behind for you to tell whether--Well, you'd think it was something valuable, and a Congressman had been there. And the thunder. When the thunder begins to merely tune up and scrape and saw, and key up the instruments for the performance, strangers say, [...] "Why, what awful thunder you have here!" [...] But when the baton is raised and the real concert begins, you'll find that stranger down in the cellar with his head in the ash-barrel. Now as to the size of the weather in New England--lengthways, I mean. It is utterly disproportioned to the size of that little country. Half the time, when it is packed as full as it can stick, you will see that New England weather sticking out beyond the edges and projecting around hundreds and hundreds of miles over the neighboring States. She can't hold a tenth part of her weather. You can see cracks all about where she has strained herself trying to do it. I could speak <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inhuman perversity of the New England weather, but I will give but a single specimen. I like to hear rain on a tin roof. So I covered part of my roof with tin, with an eye to that luxury. Well, sir, do you think it ever rains on that tin? No, sir; skips it every time. Mind, in this speech I have been trying merely to do honor to the New England weather--no language could do it justice. But, after all, there is at least one or two things about that weather (or, if you please, effects produced by it) which we residents would not like to part with. If we hadn't our bewitching autumn foliage, we should still have to credit the weather with one feature which compensates for all its bullying vagaries--the ice-storm: when a leafless tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the top--ice that is as bright and clear as crystal; when every bough and twig is strung with ice-beads, frozen dew-drops, and the whole tree sparkles cold and white, like the Shah of Persia's diamond plume. Then the wind waves the branches and the sun comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored fires, which change and change again with inconceivable rapidity from blue to red, from red to green, and green to gold--the tree becomes a spraying fountain, a very explosion of dazzling jewels; and it stands there the acme, the climax, the supremest possibility in art or nature, of bewildering, intoxicating, intolerable magnificence. One cannot make the words too strong.|$|E
