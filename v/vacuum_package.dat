The uncooled IRFPA {{is designed for}} thermal imaging applications in the LWIR (8 [...] 14 µm) range with a full-frame frequency of 30 Hz and a high sensitivity with NETD < 100 mK @ f/ 1. The microbolometer with a pixel-pitch of 25 µm consists of amorphous silicon as the sensing layer. The structure of the microbolometer has been optimized for a better performance compared to the 1 st generation IRFPA 1.

40|$|Vacuum {{packaging}} utilizing {{glass frit}} is investigated {{for the use}} with a micro-fuel processor. Enhanced device performance through proper thermal management motivates {{the need for a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>package</b> on the micro scale. Constraints imposed by the design and fabrication of the micro-fuel processor deem glass frit bonding as the optimal method for packaging. The quality of the glass seal is dependent on the pre-sintering process as well as bonding parameters. Ideal pre-sintering of a lead-zinc-borosilicate glass tape, GPR- 10 from Vitta Corp., has been achieved, and a vacuum bonding technique was optimized. The seal quality is determined visually with microscopy by comparing the size and quantity of voids present in the frit layer post-bonding. A package with a vacuum of < 150 mTorr was obtained but the seal quickly degraded. A new packaging scheme utilizing a two-step bond process is developed and evaluated. Bond optimization is applied to this process resulting in a hermetically sealed package. Hermeticity was not lost after heating the package at 450 ⁰C for 30 + hours. Final seal-off in a vacuum chamber was attempted with glass powders, glass preforms, and solders to no avail but preliminary results with solder appears promising. (cont.) Despite unsuccessfully producing a <b>vacuum</b> <b>package,</b> the methodology for optimizing bonding parameters can be utilized for glass frits that possess different physical properties from GPR- 10. The two step process developed is quite versatile and permits the use of bonding technologies that was considered incompatible previously.

The IRFPA-family compromises the two different optical resolutions VGA (640 × 480 pixel) and QVGA (320 × 240 pixel) by using a pin-compatible detector board. The uncooled IRFPAs are designed for thermal imaging applications in the LWIR (8 [...] 14 µm) range with a full-frame frequency of 30 Hz and a high thermal sensitivity.

Because electron beam irradiation can possibly increase lipid oxidation in cooked breast fillets, <b>vacuum</b> <b>packaging</b> was also investigated {{as a means}} of minimizing the effects of lipid oxidation on breast fillets. Boneless, skinless chicken breast fillets were subjected to electron beam irradiation doses of 0. 8, 1. 0, and 1. 8 kGy and stored up to 42 days at 4 C. Breast fillets were also packaged and stored in <b>vacuum</b> <b>packaging</b> in an attempt to reduce effects of electron beam irradiation on lipid oxidation in breast fillets. Microbial analyses were conducted to determine population levels of coliforms, generic E. coli, total aerobic bacteria, psychrotrophs, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in the fillets. Color determination, sensory evaluation, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were used as parameters {{to determine the effects of}} electron beam irradiation on overall quality of breast fillets. Results suggested that even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy was effective in eliminating coliforms, generic E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in irradiated samples. Population levels of total aerobic bacteria and psychrotrophs were not completely eliminated, but even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy resulted in a substantial decrease in population levels. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>packaging</b> had no effect on population levels.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the development of a low-power, high-stability miniature atomic frequency standard based on 171 Yb+ ions. The ions are buffer-gas cooled and held in a linear quadrupole trap that is integrated into a sealed, getter-pumped <b>vacuum</b> <b>package,</b> and interrogated on the 12. 6 GHz hyperfine transition. We hope to achieve a long-term fractional frequency stability of 10 ^- 14 with a miniature clock that consumes only 50 mW of power and occupies a volume of 5 cm^ 3. I discuss our progress over several years of work on this project. We began by building a conventional tabletop clock to use as a test bed while developing several designs of miniature ion-trap vacuum packages, while also developing techniques for various aspects of the clock operation, including ion loading, laser and magnetic field stabilization, and a low power ion trap drive. The ion traps were modeled using boundary element software to assist with the design and parameter optimization of new trap geometries. We expect a novel trap geometry that uses a material new to ion traps to lead to an exceptionally small ion trap <b>vacuum</b> <b>package</b> in the next phase of the project. To achieve the long-term stability required, we have also considered the sensitivity of the clock frequency to magnetic fields. A study of the motion of the individual ions in a room-temperature cloud in the trap was performed with the purpose of understanding the effect of both spatially varying and constant magnetic fields on the clock resonance and therefore the operation of the clock. These effects were studied experimentally and theoretically for several traps. In summary, this dissertation is a contribution to the design, development, and testing of a 171 Yb+ ion cloud frequency standard and related techniques, including analyses of trap geometries and parameters, modeling of the ion motion, and the practical operation of the clock.
