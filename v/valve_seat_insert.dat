40|$|Valve {{seat inserts}} {{are one of}} the vital part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. Valve and valve seat embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the valve seat during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method. Eddy current inspection method permit flaw detection in a large variety of conductive materials, either ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic. Simulation to study the change in induced current density and magnetic density around the valve seat and cylinder head due to the magnetic field generated by an exciting coil was conduct using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 4. Based on the simulation result, it is observed that the change in gap width between valve seat and cylinder head will interfere the eddy current path which caused in the change of induced current density and magnetic flux density...|$|E
40|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines {{it is important}} to manage the wear in the valve and valve seat contact in order to minimise emissions and maximise economy. Traditionally wear in this contact has been controlled by the use of a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> and the careful selection of materials for both the valve and the insert. More recently, due to the increasing demands for both performance and cost, alternative methods of controlling the wear, and the resulting valve recession, have been sought. Using the heating effect of a laser to induce localised phase transformations, to increase hardness and wear resistance, in materials has been used since the 1970 s, however it is only in recent years that it has been able to compete with more established surface treatment techniques, particularly in terms of cost, as new laser hardware has been developed. In this work, a laser has been used to treat the valve seat area of a cast iron cylinder head. In order to optimise the laser parameters for use on the head, preliminary tests were carried out to investigate the fundamental wear characteristics of untreated cast iron and also cast iron with a range of laser treatments. Previous work has identified the predominant wear mechanism in the valve and valve seat contact as impact on valve closure. Two bespoke test machines, one for testing basic specimens and one for testing components, were used to identify the laser parameters most likely to yield acceptable results when applied to a cylinder head to be used in a fired dynamometer test.

40|$|The {{exhaust valve}} system of {{combustion}} engines experiences {{a very complex}} contact situation of frequent impact involving micro sliding, high and varying temperatures, complex exhaust gas chemistry and possible particulates, etc. In addition, the tribological situation in the exhaust valve system is expected to become even worse due to strict future emission regulations, which will require enhanced combustion and cleaner fuels. This will substantially reduce the formation of combustion products that might ease the contact conditions by forming tribofilms on the contacting surfaces. The lack of protective films is expected to result in increased wear of the contact surfaces. The aim of the work presented in this thesis has been to increase the tribological understanding of the valves. The wear {{that takes place in}} the valve sealing interface and how the change in operating conditions affects it have been studied. Such understanding will facilitate the development of future valve designs. A test rig has been developed. It has a unique design with the ability to insert ppm amounts of media into a hot air flow, in order to simulate different environmental changes, e. g. varying amount and composition of combustion residue particles. PVD coated valves were evaluated in a dry atmosphere. It was concluded that although some of the coatings showed potential, the substrate could not support the thin, hard coatings. Investigations with an addition of different oils have been performed. Fully formulated oils proved to build up a protective oil residue tribofilm. This tribofilm has been in-depth analysed and proved to have similar composition and appearance as tribofilms found on low wear field tested valves. With a non-additivated oil, wear particles from the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> formed a wear particle tribofilm on top of the valve sealing surface. Without any oil the surfaces showed severe wear with wear particles spread over the surfaces. The results presented give a hint about what to be expected in the future, when the engine oils are replaced with ash less oils with reduced amount of additives and the consumed amount of oil within the cylinders are reduced. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{problem with the}} CVH is the {{tendency}} to drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> which most often happens in vin number P engines, due to the steel PM <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> in the aluminum head. (the 2000-2004 Ford Focus with the 2.0L CVH/SPI SOHC engine and also seen in 1991-2002 Ford Escorts). These engines usually drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> with no warning, even if the engine has been well maintained. In most cases, a seat drops on the number 4 cylinder, with the next most common being the number 2 cylinder (this peculiarity {{may have something to}} do with the engines secondary harmonics) [...] With the factory <b>valve</b> <b>seats,</b> the typical life of the 2.0L SPI in a Focus is about 100 to 120k miles, but it can happen as early as 70k miles. When the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> drops out of the cylinder head, it falls into the cylinder and damages the piston and cylinder head. In some cases, the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> is drawn from its cylinder through the intake manifold into another cylinder until it is obliterated.

50|$|For certain {{applications}} {{the valve}} stem and disk {{are made of}} different steel alloys, or the valve stem may be hollow and filled with sodium to improve heat transport and transfer. Although a better heat conductor, an aluminium cylinder head requires steel <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>inserts,</b> where a cast iron cylinder head would often have employed integral <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> in the past. Because the valve stem extends into lubrication in the cam chamber, it must be sealed against blow-by to prevent cylinder gases from escaping into the crankcase, even though the stem to valve clearance is very small, typically 0.04-0.06 mm, so a rubber lip-type seal is used to ensure that excessive oil is not drawn in from the crankcase on the induction stroke, and that exhaust gas does not enter the crankcase on the exhaust stroke. Worn valve guides and/or defective oil seals can often be diagnosed by a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe on releasing the accelerator pedal after allowing the engine to overrun, when there is high manifold vacuum. Such a condition occurs when changing gear.|$|R
40|$|HCx powder {{metallurgy}} steel contains in its composition high contents of Cr and C, and significant quantities of alloy elements typical of tool steels (Mo, V, W), {{to provide the}} corrosion resistance of stainless steel with wear resistance of tool steels.

The powder mixes prepared were uniaxially pressed to study the compressibility.

It is therefore necessary to examine the wear-related problems of engine <b>valves</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> and to determine by comparison whether speed or mileage inflicts the greater wear. This work focuses on the various degrees of wear produced at three different singular test speeds (10 Hz, 25 Hz, and multi-Hz) and two different cycle numbers (2. 1 × 106 and 6. 0 × 106). Throughout all tests performed in this study, the temperature of the outer surface of the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> was controlled at 350 °C and the test load was 1960 N. Wear depths were measured using a confocal laser microscope, and wear mechanisms were observed using a scanning electron microscope. The extent of wear produced at higher speeds (25 Hz) was found to be greater than that produced at lower speeds (10 Hz) under identical test conditions (temperature, valve displace-ment, cycle number, and test load). Although test cycle numbers were increased by a factor of 3, for example from 2. 1 × 106 to 6. 0 × 106, the wear depths were not proportionally increased.

40|$|INTRODUCTION] Valve {{recession}} {{occurs when}} wear of the <b>valve</b> or <b>seat</b> <b>inserts</b> in an automotive engine {{has caused the}} valve to sink or recede into the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> (as shown in Figure 1). Excessive recession leads to <b>valves</b> not <b>seating</b> correctly and cylinder pressure loss. Leaking hot combustion gases can also cause valve guttering or torching, which will accelerate valve failure. Although new valve materials and production techniques are constantly being developed, these advances have been outpaced by demands for increased engine performance and wear related problems remain an issue. Dynamometer engine testing {{is often used to}} establish short-term solutions. This is time consuming and does not necessarily reveal the actual causes of wear. A long-term approach is required in order to understand fundamental wear mechanisms and the effect of varying engine operating conditions or design changes to the valve train. This information can then be used to develop tools for predicting wear and for solving problems more quickly if they do occur. In this case study, such tools were developed using a combination of component failure analysis, bench test work and wear modelling...|$|R
40|$|Valve wear {{has been}} a serious problem to engine {{designers}} and manufacturers for many years. Although new valve materials and production techniques are constantly being developed, these advances have been outpaced by demands for increased engine performance. The drive for reduced oil consumption and exhaust emissions, the phasing out of leaded petrol, reductions in the sulphur content of diesel fuel {{and the introduction of}} alternative fuels such as gas all have implications for <b>valve</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> wear. The aim of the project has been, {{through the use of a}} representative bench test and engine testing, to diagnose the predominant wear mechanisms in diesel engine inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>seats.</b> This information was then to be used with other test data to develop a model for predicting valve recession and other tools to assist in solving valve failure problems. Test apparatus has been developed that is capable of providing a simulation of the wear of both inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>seats</b> used in automotive diesel engines. Investigations carried out using the apparatus have shown that the <b>valve</b> and <b>seat</b> wear problem involves two distinct mechanisms; impact of the <b>valve</b> on the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> on <b>valve</b> closure and sliding of the <b>valve</b> on the <b>seat</b> under the action of the combustion pressure. Wear has been shown to increase with valve closing velocity, combustion load and misalignment of the valve relative to the seat. Lubrication of the valve/seat interface leads to a significant reduction in valve recession. Valve rotation ensures even wear and promotes debris removal from the valve/seat interface. During testing it was established that resistance to impact was the key seat material property determining the amount of recession that occurred. A semi-empirical wear model for predicting valve recession has been developed based on the fundamental mechanisms of wear determined during test work. Model predictions were compared with engine tests and tests run on the bench test-rig. The model can be used to give a quantitative prediction of the valve recession to be expected with a particular material pair or a qualitative assessment of how parameters need to be altered in order to reduce recession. Flow charts have also been developed, based on the review of literature, failure analysis and modelling carried out, to assist in diagnosing and rectifying valve/seat failures and to help in reducing valve recession by design. The test apparatus, valve recession model and design tools can be integrated into an industrial environment in order to help reduce costs and timescales involved in solving valve/seat wear problems using the current trial and error methods...|$|R

The model can be used to give a quantitative prediction of the valve recession to be expected with a particular material pair or a qualitative assessment of how parameters need to be altered in order to reduce recession.
