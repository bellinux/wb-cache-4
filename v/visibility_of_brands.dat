40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is brand love, which is studied in a very limited number of studies. The {{long-term}} sustainability of the emotional bond that the consumer has established with the business makes the concept <b>of</b> <b>brand</b> love very important for both consumers and manufacturers today. A brand loved by consumers can gain a great deal of strength in competition. The main goal of the study is to determine the relationship between brand love,  self-expression <b>brand</b> and social <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>brand.</b>   In line with the aim, the study has been carried out through colleting primary data from the 459 consumers in Kayseri. The data were analyzed with the SPSS 22 package program. The findings of the research reveal that the brand love is related to {{as well as to the}} expression of inner self and social self.

Although the absolute size of the tobacco market has dwindled, the industry is still immensely successful, largely due to sophisticated and manipulative marketing strategies. The UK tobacco industry identifies target groups and builds enduring relationships based on careful brand management. Potential customers are exposed to brands which are likely to appeal to them most. Tobacco companies tailor their products to target markets by altering the content of tar and nicotine, and by adding flavourings to produce a distinctive taste. Marketing strategies ensure that the products are promoted heavily {{at the point of}} sale, and directed advertising and sponsorship agreements are used to increase the <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brand</b> and strengthen its image.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} of how and why firms in the brewing industry sponsor sports events. The thesis attempts to describe, explore and starts to explain the different objectives that brewing companies have with their brands’ sports sponsorship, the selection of what sports the brands should sponsor, the evaluation methods connected to the brewing brands’ sports sponsorship involvement, as well as the perceived advantages and disadvantages of sports sponsorship. To be able to reach the {{purpose of this}} thesis, qualitative case studies on two Swedish corporate brands and two Finnish product brands have been conducted, namely, Åbro and Herrljunga Cider, as well as Lapin Kulta and KOFF. The study shows that the most common objectives for brewing brands sponsoring sports are to build and support a positive brand image, position the brand, create or increase the <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brand,</b> as well as reach a specific target market. Moreover, results show that the possible image association potential is the most significant sports selection criterion, and that the evaluation of sports sponsorship is perceived as difficult and primarily conducted through media coverage measurements.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses data from howsociable. com to portray similar luxury wine brands in multi-dimensional space. To identify the associations between the brands and the social media visibility indicators, the paper uses correspondence analysis. Findings – The findings of the paper show that some <b>of</b> the <b>brands</b> considered did not, at the time the data were gathered, have a clearly defined social media strategy. Practical implications – The indication is that there are opportunities for luxury wine brand managers to use social media as a tool in their marketing strategies; also some threats may exist to these brands should they take a laissez faire approach to social media, particularly when social media are becoming as influential, if not more so than conventional media. Originality/value – Brands can take directions in social media today that would have been unlikely if not impossible five years ago. While brand managers may not fully be able to control the destinies <b>of</b> these <b>brands,</b> this paper suggests that the approaches followed in this particular research will present brand managers with a tool that will assist them in directing conversations that occur around their brands.

Although digital regimes undermined longstanding funding models for children’s television and reduced the production of local content in the United Kingdom and Australia, the demands of new market entrant subscription video on demand services striving to establish themselves in global markets have increased {{the value of the}} intellectual property of children’s screen content. ITV Studios’ 2015 re-make of the 1960 s Supermarionation series, Thunderbirds, is used here as a case study to illustrate how convergence has contributed to a culture of re-booting in children’s television, a genre for which consumer products have long been used to underpin program production costs. Importantly, the licence fees paid by subscription video on demand services—Netflix had a $ 5 billion programming budget in 2015 —have begun to provide additional, significant sources of funding for production budgets, while also ensuring the rapid <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> program <b>brands</b> in global television markets, particularly the United States.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Mater’s Thesis was to examine how sports {{sponsorship}} {{can be used as}} a channel for brand engagement on social media. All these three concepts have been researched previously, however, up until now they have been studied separately. Therefore, the aim was also to investigate the interrelations between these three concepts, as there is a lack of academic base on the matter. The theory of the research was based on existing academic researches <b>of</b> social media, <b>brand</b> engagement and sports sponsorship. The empirical part of the research was conducted by utilizing quantitative research method. An online questionnaire was published on Facebook pages of two Liiga ice hockey teams. In the end the total sample consisted of 322 viable respondents. The collected data was analyzed by using statistical analysis software, SPSS. The findings of the empirical research reveal that information, enjoyment, personal identity, social interaction and compensation motivate consumers to engage with brands on social media. However, the behavior of consumers is more passive than active brand engagement. Personal identity and compensation serve as motivational reasons for brand engagement on both active and passive level, while the rest are only passive brand engagement. Besides motivation there are other variables that affect consumers. Support for the team reflects to brand engagement, which is passive <b>brand</b> engagement. The <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brand</b> during the event is linked to both active and passive brand engagement.

Consequently, little {{attention has been paid to}} the influence of advertising on consumer perceptions of the endorser. This is a potentially problematic omission because evidence has suggested that advertising content plays an important role in influencing consumer attitudes and behaviors toward advertisements and <b>brands.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this study was to examine the influence of advertising appeals on consumer perceptions of the advertisement, endorser, and brand. A secondary purpose was to assess the influence of emotions on consumer perceptions of the endorser and the mediating role of emotions between advertising content and attitude toward the ad. The study featured a 4 (appeal type: humorous vs. inspirational vs. warm vs rational appeal) x 2 (athlete endorser vs. non-athlete endorser) between-subjects factorial design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight experimental conditions and were asked to watch a television commercial produced by the Nike brand. The hypotheses were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), multiple regression, and multivariate multiple regression. The results revealed that athlete endorsed ads containing warm appeals are more effective in general, than all other appeals.

To add to our conceptual understanding <b>of</b> athlete <b>branding</b> {{and particularly in the}} context of female athletes, this qualitative case study investigated the brand identity creation and brand building strategies used by two female athletes, Jennie Finch and Cat Osterman, and their management teams to leverage their brand equity. Further, due to the gendered nature of sport, this case study assessed the perceived barriers female athletes face in the brand building process. Guided by brand identity theory and social role theory, interviews were conducted with Finch, Osterman, three female agents who manage female athletes? brands, and four softball players from various levels of the softball community. Findings from this case study provide empirical support for using brand identity theory to assess the creation <b>of</b> an athlete?s <b>brand</b> identity and strategies for positioning, communicating, and leveraging the athlete?s brand. Themes shaping brand identity creation included identifying core values, brand personality, and brand associations. Brand building strategies included positioning the brand, communicating the brand?s message, leveraging the brand?s equity, creating a unique selling proposition (USP), and brand longevity. Additionally, barriers identified specific to female athletes? branding included an athlete?s performance {{is only part of the}} package, ban bossy female athletes, lack <b>of</b> consistent <b>visibility,</b> lack <b>of</b> strong <b>brand</b> associations in women?s sports, lack of assistance or guidance in managing a female athlete?s brand, and breaking barriers included strategies for overcoming barriers.

Today every organization be it small or big has realized the essence of creating a space in the World Wide Web. Social Media through its multifaceted platforms has enabled the organizations to propagate their brands. There are a number of social media networks which are helpful in spreading the message to customers. Many organizations are having full time web analytics teams that are regularly trying to ensure that prospective customers are visiting their organization through various forms of social media.

Variation in where consumers {{have lived in}} the past allows us to isolate the causal effect of past experiences on current purchases, holding constant contemporaneous supply-side factors such as availability, prices, and advertising. Heterogeneity in brand preferences explains 40 percent of geographic variation in market shares. These preferences develop endogenously as a function of consumers' life histories and are highly persistent once formed, with experiences 50 years in the past still exerting a significant effect on current consumption. Counterfactuals suggest that brand preferences create large entry barriers and durable advantages for incumbent firms, and can explain persistence of early-mover advantage over long periods. Variation across product categories shows that the persistence <b>of</b> <b>brand</b> preferences is related in an intuitive way to both advertising levels and the social <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> consumption. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{brand is}} a name, a symbol, a term or a design which {{identifies}} an organizations {{goods and services}} as distinct from those <b>of</b> other organizations. <b>Brands</b> support customers in their decision making processes and add to an organization’s reputation. Branding {{is the process of}} providing goods and services with the power <b>of</b> a <b>brand.</b> It is the communication of values, attributes, and characteristics of goods and services, clarifying what a particular brand is. In this study a multidimensional brand dashboard was developed and implemented in a company operating the plastics industry in Europe, focusing on three main markets, namely packaging, automotive, and building and construction, launching one master brand and three sub brands on the different markets.

40|$|Hot-iron {{branding}} on {{the upper}} hind limb in beef feedlot calves is a usual part of the processing procedure at arrival in many feedlots in South Africa. However, cheek branding is becoming more popular in feedlots due to ease of restraint and better <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brand</b> mark. However, the welfare aspects <b>of</b> cheek <b>branding</b> compared to leg branding have not been investigated. By monitoring physiological and behavioural markers {{this study was conducted}} to determine potential stress-related differences between feedlot calves which are branded on the leg, those branded on the cheek and control (sham-branded) animals. Thirty weaned crossbred beef calves, recently arrived at a commercial feedlot, were habituated to handling in a crush for seven days and then randomly divided into three groups of ten. Group A was branded on the cheek, Group B on the hind leg and Group C was sham-branded with a room temperature iron. Group C was further divided into two groups (n = 5) that were either sham-branded on the cheek or on the leg. Blood was collected at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after branding for serum cortisol determination with a commercial radioimmunoassay kit. In addition, faeces were collected from all animals on the day after arrival, as well as at day seven, two and one prior to branding, on the day <b>of</b> <b>branding</b> and for seven consecutive days. Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels were determined using a group-specific enzyme immunoassay measuring 11, 17 -dioxoandrostanes (11, 17 -DOA). Other outcomes monitored included behavioural traits for seven days after branding, individual average daily weight gain (ADG), morbidity and mortality during the feedlot period and histopathological evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>brand</b> mark on the skin after slaughter. Faecal 11, 17 -DOA concentrations were higher the day after transport than the day after branding (P < 0. 001) indicating higher circulating levels of cortisol during transport. Compared to pre-branding levels, serum cortisol was not significantly higher at 30 minutes after branding in all three groups but hormone levels dropped significantly at 60 minutes post-branding. Concentrations at 90 and 120 minutes were not significantly different from pre-branding concentrations in all three groups. The quantifiable rise seen between 60 and 90 minutes post-branding could have been due to the extended time (up to 2. 5 hours) spent in the crush. There were no statistically significant differences in blood cortisol or faecal 11, 17 -DOA between the cheek, leg or sham branded groups at any time. Vocalization occurred more frequently at the time <b>of</b> <b>branding</b> in the cheek branded group than in either the leg branded (P = 0. 030) or the control group (P < 0. 001). There were also no significant differences in other behavioural indices between the three groups. Faint brand marks could be seen at the time of slaughter (74 days after branding) on five animals from the leg branded group. No cheek brands were visible. No scarring was seen on histopathological examination. No significant differences were seen in the ADG, and there were no morbidities or mortalities. In conclusion, using the methods described, there were no obvious differences in serum cortisol levels, faecal 11, 17 -DOA levels, behavioural indicators of pain or production outcomes between feedlot calves branded on the cheek, the leg, or sham branded.

We quantify the <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> these two artifacts when the video halftone is displayed at medium frame rates (15 to 30 frames per second). We propose new video halftoning methods to reduce <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> these artifacts. The proposed contributions are (1) an enhanced measure of perceived flicker, (2) a new measure of perceived dirty-window-effect, (3) a new video halftoning method to reduce flicker, and (4) a new video halftoning method to reduce dirty-window-effect. 1...|$|R
