25|$|The {{number of}} reports on {{neurological}} disorders is very small, other than evidence for {{an association between}} a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a transient mild form of <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis.</b> The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis,</b> and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use {{in a number of}} countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events.|$|E

25|$|Most infections with {{adenovirus}} {{result in}} infections {{of the upper}} respiratory tract. Adenovirus infections often show up as conjunctivitis, tonsilitis (which may look exactly like strep throat and cannot be distinguished from strep except by throat culture), an ear infection, or croup. Adenoviruses, types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of conjunctivitis and tonsilitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections. Some children (especially small ones) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both {{of which can be}} severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like whooping cough. Adenoviruses can also cause <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis</b> or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder—a form of urinary tract infection — with blood in the urine).|$|E

30|$|The {{diagnosis}} in {{this patient}} was first suspected as ADEM, because (1) the clinical symptoms, such as {{disturbance of consciousness}} and convulsions, developing after the infectious symptoms were suggestive of acute encephalitis, (2) there were disseminated demyelinating lesions on head MRI, and (3) {{there were no signs}} suggestive of <b>viral</b> encephalitis, bacterial <b>meningitis</b> or other immunologic diseases such as CNS lupus or vasculitis.|$|R
30|$|The {{potential}} role of biomarkers in {{the management}} of meningitis has been much less studied in adults than in children. Similarly to children, the use of a clinical decision rule to distinguish between <b>viral</b> and bacterial <b>meningitis</b> is recommended in adults [56].

500|$|Viruses can {{reproduce}} only inside cells, {{and they}} gain entry by using {{many of the}} receptors involved in immunity. Once inside the cell, viruses use the cell's biological machinery to their own advantage, forcing the cell to make hundreds of identical copies of themselves. Although phagocytes and other components of the innate immune system can, to a limited extent, control viruses, once a virus is inside a cell the adaptive immune responses, particularly the lymphocytes, are more important for defense. [...] At the sites of viral infections, lymphocytes often vastly outnumber all the other cells of the immune system; this is common in <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis.</b> Virus-infected cells that {{have been killed by}} lymphocytes are cleared from the body by phagocytes.|$|E

He has commented, [...] "My illness had a massive impact on my job. When I came back I couldn’t find my feet. New producers came in and brought in new actors and I got lost down the pecking order [...] Ever since I came back, I’ve had nothing regular. As an actor you want storylines to stretch yourself. To be fair, I didn't work as much when the Miller family arrived in 2004. When it was just Mickey, I got really good stuff.

40|$|Abstract The {{intrathecal}} {{synthesis of}} interleukin 10 (IL- 10) {{was investigated in}} 120 paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum specimens from patients with various inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). IL- 10 was not demonstrated in the sera, but detectable levels were found in the CSF from: patients with acute <b>viral</b> ("aseptic") <b>meningitis,</b> but only within 48 - 72 h of symptom onset; human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) -infected patients with HIV-related encephalitis/leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis; a patient with primary B cell lymphoma of the CNS, and a patient with encephalomeningeal sarcoidosis (in whom IL- 10 was demonstrated in all CSF collected over a period of 6 -months). In chronic meningeal infections/inflammations, IL- 10 seems to be continuously produced within the CSF. Our findings suggest that IL- 10, a cytokine which exerts many immunosuppressive actions, may play different immunomodulatory roles in CNS diseases; in particular, its intrathecal synthesis may explain why some infectious and inflammatory meningeal diseases may have slow development and chronic evolution...|$|R
50|$|Viruses are {{the most}} common cause of aseptic meningitis. Most cases of <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis</b> are caused by enteroviruses (common stomach viruses).

Based on clinical symptoms, <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis</b> cannot be reliably differentiated from bacterial meningitis, although <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis</b> typically follows a more benign clinical course. <b>Viral</b> <b>meningitis</b> has no evidence of bacteria present in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

40|$|Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is {{a member}} of Herpesviridae and a leading cause of human <b>viral</b> diseases. <b>Meningitis</b> occurs as a {{complication}} of HSV- 1 or HSV- 2 primary infection. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate HSV meningitis in children in Gorgan province, Iran. Patients and Methods: Forty-five cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken from children referred with meningitis symptoms. Samples with negative bacterial culture results were tested for viral, biochemical and cytological assays. DNA extraction and PCR were performed. Results: HSV- 1 detected in 4 (8. 8 %) samples without any HSV- 2 infections. Cases with positive results had fever and CSF pleocytosis. Vomiting, headache and higher count of WBC were observed in 3, 2 and 3 cases respectively. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose and protein levels were normal and 3 cases showed positive C-reactive protein (CRP) results. Also erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was higher than normal in all positive cases.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis</b> {{is made by}} clinical history, physical exam, and several diagnostic tests. Most importantly, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected via lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap). This fluid, which normally surrounds the brain and spinal cord, is then analyzed for signs of infection. CSF findings that suggest a viral cause of meningitis include an elevated {{white blood cell count}} (usually 10-100 cells/µL) with a lymphocytic predominance in combination with a normal glucose level. Increasingly, cerebrospinal fluid PCR tests have become especially useful for diagnosing <b>viral</b> <b>meningitis,</b> with an estimated sensitivity of 95-100%.

The objective {{of this study was to}} identify non-poliovirus EV as a cause of <b>viral</b> aseptic <b>meningitis</b> (VAM) by two methods (cell culture and Real time PCR). From October 2010 to August 2011 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from 85 patients Embaba fever hospital admitted with symptoms of aseptic meningitis of any age and both sexes. The 85 CSF samples were inoculated into RD (human rhabdomyosarcoma) cell line in three blind passages to amplify isolates producing EV-like CPE. A total of 14 (16. 5 %) out of 85 CSF samples showed EV-like CPE. By Real time PCR 11 out of the 14 culture positive samples and 5 out of the 14 source of virus isolation original CSF were non polio EV positive. The frequency of non-polio EV meningitis hospital admissions was in the summer season (50 %), spring (25 %), late autumn (16. 6 %) and least frequency in winter (8. 4 %). non-polio EV meningitis was detected in 6 out of 41 male patients (14. 5 %) and in 6 out of 44 female patients (13. 5 %). Also non-polio EV meningitis was detected in all ages with marked increase of incidence in young children (41. 6 %) and old age (50 %) and less in adult (8. 4 %)..

The array {{has been used}} for the detection of multiplex PCR-amplified viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and non-CSF specimens. A total of 41 clinical specimens were positive for echoviruses (23 samples), herpes simplex virus type 2 (4 samples), varicella-zoster virus (4 samples), human herpesvirus 7 (1 sample), human herpesvirus 6 A (1 sample) and 6 B (2 samples), Epstein-Barr virus (three samples), polyomavirus JC (1 sample), and cytomegalovirus (2 samples). Probes for herpes simplex virus type 1, polyomavirus BK, and mumps and measles viruses were also included on the array.
