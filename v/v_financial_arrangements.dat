40|$|This article scrutinizes the {{relationship}} between the CPP and the provinces under the new CPP <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements.</b> It briefly recalls the genesis of the CPP and that of its close relative, the Quebec Pension Plan. The <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements</b> in effect from 1966 through 1986 are then reviewed along with some of the options for reform that were explored by the Department of Insurance. These are contrasted with the new <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements</b> put into effect in January 1987. The conclusion drawn from comparison of these arrangements is that the CPP is {{and will continue to be}} a program intended to serve two quite distinct purposes: paying pensions and raising revenue for provincial governments. Specifically, the effective transfer from the CPP to the provinces is estimated to be about $ 1. 2 billion per year. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{financial}} contracting {{in the presence of}} asymmetric information between entrepreneur and investor. Either liquidation threat or governance control can be used to protect investor’s interests against expropriation risk. The two parties first agree to a <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> which assigns to the parties the ”governance right” to choose the level of governance control and the ”contracting right” to design the financing contract. We show the trade-off between costs of liquidation and governance control determines the equilibrium. In Pareto-efficient equilibrium <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements,</b> a highly profitable project is financed by a contract which relies on liquidation threat so that liquidation occurs with a strictly positive probability. On the other hand, a less profitable project relies on governance control, thereby avoiding liquidation altogether. We relate different equilibrium <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements</b> to the ownership and financial structure of firm. Asymmetric information; liquidation; governance control...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the financing arrangements for planned cross-border health care within the European Union. A <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> is taken to provide a financial incentive but may also involve payment risks and administrative burden. For the pathways given by the Social Security Regulations (883 / 2004 and 987 / 2009) and the EU Directive 2011 / 24 /EU, we investigate how the associated <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements</b> act on providers, patients and on publicly funded health insurance. First, the Regulations can induce cross-border health care that will increase domestic health care expenditure and may threaten national health policy by setting an incentive for patients to go abroad for health care not covered by domestic health insurance. Second, the <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the Directive may induce cross-border health care which will lower domestic health care expenditure. However, due to considerable payment risks and administrative burden on both patients and providers, these benefits will not be reaped in full. Moreover, in the presence of national cost containment policies, the Directive may provide an incentive for cross-border health care that is too strong. Finally, due to the requirement to pay upfront, the <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> also suffers from a lack of equity of access to health care provision abroad...|$|R

50|$|Current {{international}} financial relationships are faulty: <b>Financial</b> <b>arrangements</b> between {{developed and developing}} countries are often defective, insufficient, and detrimental to the recipients. This {{is largely due to}} missing or malfunctioning markets within the countries, and a lack of mechanisms to share risk between lenders and recipients. As such, financial capital flows tend to be volatile, and are underregulated by international lending institutions. Additionally, aid levels tend to be inadequate to address some financial problems in developing markets. Both unbalanced risk and shortage of aid are likely the result of lack of representation of recipient countries in decision-making processes regarding <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements.</b>|$|R

One of the more significant findings was the prevalence of arrangements in which wives managed family finances as against the small number of wives who could be said to have had overall control of finances. Another conclusion of the importance of both the income level of the husband and whether or not the wife had paid employment as factors affecting <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements</b> of couples.
