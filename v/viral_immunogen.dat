40|$|Mink {{enteritis}} virus (MEV) causes acute enteric {{disease of}} minks resulting in high mortality (Christensen et al, 1994). Previously nucleotide sequences of some mink enteritis virus strains isolated in Japan (Higashihara et al, 1981), in Europe and USA (Christensen et al, 1994; Parrish et al, 1984) have been determined. Genome structute of MEV strains isolated in Russia {{have not been}} studied earlier. The virion protein VP 2 is the MEV most abundant capsid protein and, consequently, the main <b>viral</b> <b>immunogen.</b> In baculovirus expression system VP 2 protein is shown to form virus-like particles (Christensen et al, 1994) that might be used as effective DNA delivery system into eukariotic cells. Results: Mink enteritis virus (Rodniki strain and Cherepanovo- 98 isolate) VP 2 gene 5 ' and 3 '- fragment nucleotide sequences were determined. The comparative analysis shown 100 % homology of VP 2 gene sequence between Rodniki strain with MEV antigenic type 2. In contrast, Cherepanovo- 98 isolate had nucleotides typical for MEV antigenic type 1 and 2 as well as Abashiri strain.

40|$|Enterovirus 71 (EV- 71) is {{the main}} causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) which is {{generally}} regarded as a mild childhood disease. In recent years, EV 71 {{has emerged as a}} signiﬁcant pathogen capable of causing high mortalities and severe neurological complications in large outbreaks in Asia. A formalin-inactivated EV 71 whole virus vaccine has completed phase III trial in China but is currently unavailable clinically. The high cost of manufacturing and supply problems may limit practical implementations in developing countries. Synthetic peptides representing the native primary structure of the <b>viral</b> <b>immunogen</b> which is able to elicit neutralizing antibodies can be made readily and is cost effective. However, it is necessary to conjugate short synthetic peptides to carrier proteins to enhance their immunogenicity. This review describes the production of cross-neutralizing anti-peptide antibodies in response to immunization with synthetic peptides selected from in silico analysis, generation of B-cell epitopes of EV 71 conjugated to a promiscuous T-cell epitope from Poliovirus, and evaluation of the neutralizing activities of the anti-peptide antibodies. Besides neutralizing EV 71 in vitro, the neutralizing antibodies were cross-reactive against several Enteroviruses including CVA 16, CVB 4, CVB 6, and ECHO 13...|$|E
40|$|We {{described}} a generalized suppression of CTL anamnestic responses {{that occurred in}} mice bearing large tumor nodules or immunized with powerful recombinant <b>viral</b> <b>immunogens.</b> Immune suppression entirely depended on GM-CSF-driven accumulation of CD 11 b(+) /Gr- 1 (+) myeloid suppressor cells (MSC) in secondary lymphoid organs. To further investigate the nature and properties of MSC, we immortalized CD 11 b(+) /Gr- 1 (+) cells isolated from the spleens of immunosuppressed mice, using a retrovirus encoding the v-myc and v-raf oncogenes. Immortalized cells expressed monocyte/macrophage markers (CD 11 b, F 4 / 80, CD 86, CD 11 c), but they differed from previously characterized macrophage lines in their capacities to inhibit T lymphocyte activation. Two MSC lines, MSC- 1 and MSC- 2, were selected based upon their abilities to inhibit Ag-specific proliferative and functional CTL responses. MSC- 1 line was constitutively inhibitory, while suppressive functions of MSC- 2 line were stimulated by exposure to the cytokine IL- 4. Both MSC lines triggered the apoptotic cascade in Ag-activated T lymphocytes by a mechanism requiring cell-cell contact. Some well-known membrane molecules involved in the activation of apoptotic pathways (e. g., TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, Fas ligand, TNF-alpha) were ruled out as candidate effectors for the suppression mechanism. The immortalized myeloid lines represent a novel, useful tool {{to shed light on}} the molecules involved in the differentiation of myeloid-related suppressors {{as well as in the}} inhibitory pathway they use to control T lymphocyte activation...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{epigenetic}} {{modifications in}} the regulation of gammaherpesvirus latency has been a subject of active study for more than 20 years. DNA methylation, associated with transcriptional silencing in mammalian genomes, {{has been shown to}} be an important mechanism in the transcriptional control of several key gammaherpesvirus genes. In particular, DNA methylation of the functionally conserved immediate-early replication and transcription activator (RTA) has been shown to regulate Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Rta expression. Here we demonstrate that the murine gammaherpesvirus (MHV 68) homolog, encoded by gene 50, is also subject to direct repression by DNA methylation, both in vitro and in vivo. We observed that the treatment of latently MHV 68 -infected B-cell lines with a methyltransferase inhibitor induced virus reactivation. In addition, we show that the methylation of the recently characterized distal gene 50 promoter represses activity in a murine macrophage cell line. To evaluate the role of de novo methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the establishment of these methylation marks, we infected mice in which conditional DNMT 3 a and DNMT 3 b alleles were selectively deleted in B lymphocytes. DNMT 3 a/DNMT 3 b-deficient B cells were phenotypically normal, displaying no obvious compromise in cell surface marker expression or antibody production either in naïve mice or in the context of nonviral and <b>viral</b> <b>immunogens.</b> However, mice lacking functional DNMT 3 a and DNMT 3 b in B cells exhibited hallmarks of deregulate...|$|R

40|$|Megalocytivirus is a DNA virus {{with a broad}} {{host range}} among teleost fish. Although the {{complete}} genome sequences {{of a number of}} megalocytivirus isolates have been reported, the functions of most of the genes of this virus are unknown. In this study, we selected two megalocytivirus immunogens, P 247 and P 523, which were expressed during host infection and, when in the form of DNA vaccines (pCN 247 and pCN 523 respectively), elicited strong protectivity against lethal megalocytivirus challenge in a turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) model. Compared to control fish, fish vaccinated with pCN 247 and pCN 523 exhibited drastically reduced viral loads in tissues and high levels of survival rates. Immune response analysis showed that pCN 247 and pCN 523 (i) induced production of specific serum antibodies, (ii) caused generation of cytotoxic immune cells and specific memory immune cells that responded to secondary antigen stimulation, and (iii) upregulated the expression of genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity. To examine the potential role of P 247 and P 523 in viral infection, the expression of P 247 and P 523 was knocked down by siRNA. Subsequent in vivo infection study showed that P 247 and P 523 knockdown significantly impaired viral replication. Furthermore, whole-genome transcriptome analysis revealed that P 247 and P 523 knockdown altered the expression profiles of 26 and 41 viral genes, respectively, putatively participating in diverse aspects of viral infection. Taken together, these results indicate that P 247 and P 523 induce protective immunity in teleost and play fundamental roles essential to viral replication. These observations provide the first evidence that suggests a likely link between the protectivity of <b>viral</b> <b>immunogens</b> and their biological significance in viral replication...|$|R
40|$|During the {{prolonged}} course of chronic viral infection {{there is a}} continuous reciprocal interaction between the host immune defence system and the <b>viral</b> <b>immunogens,</b> and <b>viral</b> genetic mutations capable of circumventing host immune defence could be selected for. Our observation of increasing prevalence of heterogeneity in the DNA sequence coding for the ‘a 1 determinant of HBsAg in patients with presumed increasing length of chronic HBV infection is {{in agreement with the}} assumption of accumulation of presumed escape mutants. In a large series of Chinese patients with chronic liver disease, we found ‘a 1 determinant mutations in only one of 13 patients positive for HBsAg and HBeAg, but in eight (47 %) of 17 patients positive for HBsAg and anti-HBe. However, most significant of all was the detection of ‘a 1 determinant mutations in as many as 63 % (15 / 24) of serum samples yielding serological evidence of healed HBV infection, but still with HBV DNA presence. The HBV strains found in these patients could therefore be regarded as escape mutants, an interpretation verified by cloning the entire HBV S gene from a number of the mutant strains and expressing the S protein in a mammalian cell culture system. Thus, the protein expressed by a number of mutant S genes was non-reactive in conventional HBsAg assays. cDNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that at least two independent HDV genotype IA strains had been involved in the introduction of hepatitis D virus among the drug addicts of southern Sweden in the early 1970 s. The annual HDV RNA evolution rate was determined to be 1. 2 x 10 - 3 substitutions/nucleotide, which is of the same magnitude as the rates found for other RNA viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of HDV strains from {{different parts of the world}} confirmed the usefulness of the genotype classification. Within genotype I two subgroups, A and B, have previously been described. We observed the occurrence of the HDV genotype I subgroups to manifest geographical restrictions, genotype IA being identified as a western branch found in HDV isolates from USA and West and South Europe, and genotype IB an eastern branch occurring in HDV strains from East European countries and from China, Taiwan and Oceanea. Moreover, we identified a new type I subgroup, tentatively designated IC, occurring as the sole subgroup in several patients from Ethiopia and in a single HDV isolate from Somalia. The Somalian strain and one of the Ethiopian HDV strains were fully sequenced. One HDV isolate from Jordan and one previously described from Lebanon were also found to belong to the IC subgroup...|$|R
40|$|Background: DNA {{vaccination}} with plasmid encoding bacterial, <b>viral,</b> and parasitic <b>immunogens</b> {{has been}} shown to be an attractive method to induce efficient immune responses. Bacteria of the genus Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens for which new and efficient vaccines are needed. Methods: To evaluate the use of a DNA immunization strategy for protection against brucellosis, a plasmid containing the DNA encoding the Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis) 31 kDa outer membrane protein, as a potent immunogenic target, was constructed. Results: The constructed plasmid, pcDNA 3. 1 +omp 31, was injected intramuscularly into mice and the expression of omp 31 RNA was assessed by RT-PCR. The integrity of the pcDNA 3. 1 +omp 31 construct was confirmed with restriction analysis and sequencing. Omp 31 mRNA expression was verified by RT-PCR. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the pcDNA 3. 1 +omp 31 eukaryotic expression vector expresses omp 31 mRNA and could be useful as a vaccine candidate...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{functional}} expression of antigenic poliovirus fragments carried by various hybrid hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles. Several constructions were made by using two different insertion sites in the HBsAg molecule (amino acid positions 50 and 113) and two different sequences, one derived from poliovirus type 1 (PV- 1) and the other from PV- 2. The inserted fragments each encompassed residues 93 to 103 of the capsid protein VP 1, a segment which includes the linear part of the neutralization antigenic site 1 of the poliovirus. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of the hybrid particles were evaluated and compared in terms of poliovirus neutralization. A high level of antigenic and immunogenic activity of the PV- 1 fragment was obtained by insertion at position 113 but not at position 50 of HBsAg. However, a cooperative effect was observed when two PV- 1 fragments were inserted at both positions of the same HBsAg molecule. Antibodies elicited by the PV- 2 fragment inserted at amino acid position 113 did not bind or neutralize the corresponding poliovirus strain. They did, however, bind a chimeric poliovirus in which the homologous antigenic fragment of PV- 1 {{had been replaced by}} that of PV- 2. The only virions that were neutralized by these antibodies were certain mutants carrying amino acid substitutions within the PV- 2 fragment. These results show that position, constraints from the carrier protein, and nature of the inserted sequences are critically important in favoring or limiting the expression of antigenic fragments as <b>viral</b> neutralization <b>immunogens...</b>|$|R

However, one broadly neutralizing antibody, 2 G 12, neutralizes primary viral isolates by direct recognition of Manalpha 1 [...] > 2 Man motifs {{formed by the}} host-derived oligomannose glycans of the <b>viral</b> envelope. <b>Immunogens,</b> capable of eliciting antibodies of similar specificity to 2 G 12, are therefore candidates for HIV/AIDS vaccine development. In this context, {{it is known that}} the yeast mannan polysaccharides exhibit significant antigenic mimicry with the glycans of HIV- 1.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannans are typically terminated by alpha 1 [...] > 3 -linked mannoses that cap a Manalpha 1 [...] > 2 Man motif that otherwise closely resembles the part of the oligomannose epitope recognized by 2 G 12. Immunization with S. cerevisiae deficient for the alpha 1 [...] > 3 mannosyltransferase gene (DeltaMnn 1), but not with wild-type S. cerevisiae, reproducibly elicited antibodies to the self oligomannose glycans. Carbohydrate microarray analysis of DeltaMnn 1 immune sera revealed fine carbohydrate specificity to Manalpha 1 [...] > 2 Man units, closely matching that of 2 G 12. These specificities were further corroborated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with chemically defined glycoforms of gp 120. These antibodies exhibited remarkable similarity in the carbohydrate specificity to 2 G 12 and displayed statistically significant, albeit extremely weak, neutralization of HIV- 1 compared to control immune sera. These data confirm the Manalpha 1 [...] > 2 Man motif as the primary carbohydrate neutralization determinant of HIV- 1 and show that the genetic modulation of microbial polysaccharides is a route towards immunogens capable of eliciting antibody responses to the glycans of HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|While {{recombinant}} Listeria monocytogenes strains can {{be explored}} as vaccine candidates, {{it is important}} to develop attenuated but highly immunogenic L. monocytogenes vaccine vectors. Here, prfA* mutations {{selected on the basis of}} upregulated expression of L. monocytogenes PrfA-dependent genes and proteins were assessed to determine their abilities to augment expression of foreign immunogens in recombinant L. monocytogenes vectors and therefore enhance vaccine-elicited immune responses (a prfA* mutation is a mutation that results in constitutive overexpression of PrfA and PrfA-dependent virulence genes; the asterisk distinguishes the mutation from inactivation or stop mutations). A total of 63 recombinant L. monocytogenes vaccine vectors expressing seven individual <b>viral</b> or bacterial <b>immunogens</b> each in nine different L. monocytogenes strains carrying wild-type prfA or having prfA* mutations were constructed and investigated. Mutations selected on the basis of increased PrfA activation in recombinant L. monocytogenes prfA* vaccine vectors augmented expression of seven individual protein immunogens remarkably. Consistently, prime and boost vaccination studies with mice indicated that the prfA(G 155 S) mutation in recombinant L. monocytogenes ΔactA prfA* strains enhanced vaccine-elicited cellular immune responses. Surprisingly, the prfA(G 155 S) mutation was found to enhance vaccine-elicited humoral immune responses as well. The highly immunogenic recombinant L. monocytogenes ΔactA prfA* vaccine strains were as attenuated as the recombinant parent L. monocytogenes ΔactA vaccine vector. Thus, recombinant attenuated L. monocytogenes ΔactA prfA* vaccine vectors potentially are better antimicrobial and anticancer vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Biliary atresia is {{a common}} disease in {{neonates}} which causes obstructive jaundice and progressive hepatic fibrosis. Our previous studies indicate that rotavirus infection is an initiator in the pathogenesis of experimental biliary atresia (BA) through the induction of increased nuclear factor-kappaB and abnormal activation of the osteopontin inflammation pathway. In the setting of rotavirus infection, rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP 4) serves as an important <b>immunogen,</b> <b>viral</b> protein 7 (VP 7) is necessary in rotavirus maturity and viral protein 4 (VP 4) is a virulence determiner. The {{purpose of the current}} study is to clarify the roles of NSP 4, VP 7 and VP 4 in the pathogenesis of experimental BA. Primary cultured extrahepatic biliary epithelia were infected with Rotavirus (mmu 18006). Small interfering RNA targeting NSP 4, VP 7 or VP 4 was transfected before rotavirus infection both in vitro and in vivo. We analyzed the incidence of BA, morphological change, morphogenesis of viral particles and viral mRNA and protein expression. The in vitro experiments showed NSP 4 silencing decreased the levels of VP 7 and VP 4, reduced viral particles and decreased cytopathic effect. NSP 4 -positive cells had strongly positive expression of integrin subunit a 2. Silencing of VP 7 or VP 4 partially decreased epithelial injury. Animal experiments indicated after NSP 4 silencing, mouse pups had lower incidence of BA than after VP 7 or VP 4 silencing. However, 33. 3 % of VP 4 -silenced pups (N = 6) suffered BA and 50 % of pups (N = 6) suffered biliary injury after VP 7 silencing. Hepatic injury was decreased after NSP 4 or VP 4 silencing. Neither VP 4 nor VP 7 were detected in the biliary ducts after NSP 4...|$|R
