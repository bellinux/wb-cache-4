40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{intersect}} two recent trends in urban research. First, it takes seriously {{the recognition that}} established traditions of research concerned with urban space have tended to privilege the horizontal extension of cities {{to the neglect of}} their vertical or <b>volumetric</b> <b>extension.</b> Second, the paper contributes to the resurgence of interest among social scientists in the validity of fiction – and especially speculative or science fiction – as a source of critical commentary and as a mode of knowledge that can exist in close reciprocity with non-fictional work. From these two starting points the paper develops a reading of the dialogue between the representations of vertical urban life that have featured in landmark works of 20 th-century science fiction literature and key themes in contemporary urban analysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{amount of}} image data {{generated}} {{each day in}} health care is ever increasing, especially {{in combination with the}} improved scanning resolutions and the importance of volumetric image data sets. Handling these images raises the requirement for efficient compression, archival and transmission techniques. Currently, JPEG 2000 ׳s core coding system, defined in Part 1, is the default choice for medical images as it is the DICOM-supported compression technique offering the best available performance for this type of data. Yet, JPEG 2000 provides many options that allow for further improving compression performance for which DICOM offers no guidelines. Moreover, over the last years, various studies seem to indicate that performance improvements in wavelet-based image coding are possible when employing directional transforms. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate techniques allowing for improving the performance of JPEG 2000 for volumetric medical image compression. For this purpose, we make use of a newly developed generic codec framework that supports JPEG 2000 with its <b>volumetric</b> <b>extension</b> (JP 3 D), various directional wavelet transforms as well as a generic intra-band prediction mode. A thorough objective investigation of the performance-complexity trade-offs offered by these techniques on medical data is carried out. Moreover, we provide a comparison of the presented techniques to H. 265 /MPEG-H HEVC, which is currently the most state-of-the-art video codec available. Additionally, we present results of a first time study on the subjective visual performance when using the aforementioned techniques. This enables us to provide a set of guidelines and settings on how to optimally compress medical volumetric images at an acceptable complexity level...|$|E

Method Thirty patients underwent surgical resection and were preoperatively evaluated with fine slice high definition CT scans and 3 D-MRI <b>volumetric</b> reconstructions. <b>Extension</b> of internal auditory canal (IAC) opening during surgery was measured using 3 mm right-angle calibrated hook and neuronavigation parameters. Postoperatively, the extension of IAC opening and integrity of the labyrinth were confirmed through preoperatively images procedures. Results The preoperative length of IACs varied between 7. 8 and 12. 0 mm (mean 9. 3 mm, SD 0. 98, 95 %CI 8. 9 to 9. 6, and median 9. 0 mm). Postoperative images demonstrated adequate opening of the IAC and semicircular channels integrity. Conclusion A complete drilling of the posterior wall of IAC through the RSA is feasible and allows direct visualization of the IAC-fundus without damaging the semicircular canals...|$|R

The extension of this bundle requires the continuous presence of external calcium. Furthermore, the extension rate increases with calcium concentration, but at a given concentration, {{we find that the}} <b>volumetric</b> rate of <b>extension</b> is constant.

40|$|The {{volumetric}} behaviour of unsaturated soils {{is complicated}} than saturated soils. Depending {{on the state}} paths involving loading/wetting/unloading, compacted unsaturated soils can exhibit swelling, collapse, collapse followed by swelling, swelling followed by collapse and swelling pressure development. While significant advances {{have been made in}} modelling of the hydromechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils, it is still difficult to predict these behaviours using most methods that use suction as a constitutive variable, since the required testing effort is overwhelming on one hand {{and it is difficult to}} take into account field soil variability on the other. In contrast, the Monash – Peradeniya – Kodikara (MPK) framework proposed by Kodikara (2012) uses void ratio – moisture ratio – net stress space accompanied with the Loading Wetting State Boundary Surface (LWSBS) to explain/predict these paths and is relatively simple and has the potential to be applied to practical problems with relative ease. The current research project mainly focuses on a comprehensive validation and extension of the MPK framework and demonstration of its application to practical problems. A comprehensive series of tests are performed on statically compacted soils for the validation of the MPK framework. Two soil types, namely lightly reactive kaolin and more reactive clay referred to as Merri Creek soil, are used in the testing. The soils were prepared with different moisture contents from dry state and were statically compacted at constant water contents to obtain the void ratio-moisture ratio-net stress constitutive surfaces as well as soil specimens for the state path tests. The state path test results of yielding under loading, collapse under wetting, swelling pressure development and change in yield pressure due to wetting are explained with the MPK framework. Despite the difference in the degree of reactivity, both soils followed the concepts of the MPK framework reasonably closely. In addition, some published data from the literature were also analysed within the framework, highlighting that the framework is valid, regardless of the degree of reactivity of the soil. No suction was measured in these experiments, as it is not essential to explain most volumetric behaviour as per the MPK framework. Dynamic compaction is commonly used to construct structural fills for various geo-infrastructures. The current practice is to specify a minimum dry density and moisture content criterion to be used in the field on the basis of Proctor compaction carried out in the laboratory. Nonetheless, we still do not have practical methods for predicting the behaviour of compacted clay under the expected mechanical and environmental loadings. Current theories are difficult to apply in practice due to difficulty in determining the necessary parameters. In this thesis, the MPK framework is extended to analyse the dynamically compacted soils. Similar to statically compacted soils, a significant number of experiments were performed on the dynamically compacted lightly reactive kaolin and reactive Merri Creek soils at constant moisture contents. Since the compaction stresses were unknown for the dynamic compaction, recompression of the soil specimens from compacted soil was used to establish the relevant LWSBSs. Subsequently, independent tests were undertaken highlighting that the MPK framework could predict well the behaviour of dynamically compacted soils under loading/unloading and yielding, collapse during wetting, change of loading yield stress after wetting, and swelling pressure development during constrained wetting. The value of the approach is that the testing methods are straight-forward, do not require specialised equipment and the testing times are much shorter. In addition, the uncertainty that laboratory dynamic compaction may not relate directly to the field roller compaction can be addressed with the developed framework. Soil specimens obtained from field soil pads compacted by the actual rollers can be used to establish the corresponding LWSBS. This information will allow the direct prediction of the likely behaviour of field compacted fills under the expected environmental and mechanical loadings. Another addition to the MPK framework is achieved by incorporating loading/wetting suction within the void ratio-moisture ratio-net stress space. Initially, two hypotheses are proposed to present the suction contours on and inside the LWSBS by analysing several datasets from the literature. Subsequently, a mathematical representation is provided to establish full suction profile within the void ratio-moisture ratio-net stress space for both kaolin and Merri Creek soils. Although suction is not essential for the application of the MPK framework in many practical problems as demonstrated, yet knowing the suction profile within the void ratio-moisture ratio-net stress space is essential to complete the hydro-mechanical picture in the <b>volumetric</b> space. This <b>extension</b> will allow the development of constitutive models as well as soil water characteristic curves more rationally in future. Finally, the MPK framework is applied to analyse the performance of a conceptual compacted clayey fill. The heave/settlement results from the MPK framework and the results available from literature are compared qualitatively for both laboratory behaviour and field scale behaviour of compacted soils. It is found that the complex volumetric behaviour due to major wetting events are easily explainable using the extended MPK framework. It is observed that the initial operational void ratio (or the initial operational density) and the operational stress are the two most important parameters that govern the volumetric behaviour of compacted unsaturated soils...|$|R
