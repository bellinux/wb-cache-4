50|$|Since the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, {{the use of}} <b>variable</b> <b>annuities</b> as a {{tax shelter}} has greatly diminished, because the growth of mutual funds and now most of the {{dividends}} of the fund are taxed at long term capital gains rates. This taxation, contrasted with the taxation of all the growth of <b>variable</b> <b>annuities</b> at income rates, means that in most cases, <b>variable</b> <b>annuities</b> shouldn't be used for tax shelters unless very long holding periods apply (for example, more than 20 years).|$|R

50|$|Annuity {{contracts}} in the United States {{are defined by}} the Internal Revenue Code and regulated by the individual states. <b>Variable</b> <b>annuities</b> have features of both life insurance and investment products. In the U.S., annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies, although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to non-profits to reduce taxes. Insurance companies are regulated by the states, so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others. Their federal tax treatment, however, is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. <b>Variable</b> <b>annuities</b> are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the sale of <b>variable</b> <b>annuities</b> is overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms {{doing business in the}} United States).|$|R

We focus on the embedded tax options using Monte-Carlo simulations. We conclude that although low-cost <b>variable</b> <b>annuities</b> are superior to low-cost mutual funds over long time horizons, the critical threshold is at least 10 years for typical levels of risk aversion.

40|$|This paper explores defined {{ambition}} {{pension schemes}} that provide (deferred) <b>variable</b> <b>annuities.</b> These pension schemes allocate various risks (i. e., real interest rate, expected inflation and stock market risk) to the policyholders {{on the basis}} of complete contracts. We show how these <b>variable</b> <b>annuities</b> can be valued in a market-consistent fashion and how the insurer can adopt the principle of liability-driven investment. Market-consistent valuation is important for ensuring generational fairness and avoiding conflicts between the policyholders of the insurer. We show that the costs of <b>variable</b> real <b>annuities</b> may be less sensitive to the nominal interest rate than the costs of fixed nominal annuities, thereby reducing the nominal interest rate duration of the intertemporal hedging portfolio. This is especially so if stochastic variations in risk aversion impact equity risk premia and a lack of financial assets results in an incomplete financial market...|$|R
