50|$|Finding {{materials}} that stimulate emission {{was needed for}} the development of the SASER. The generation of coherent phonons in a double-barrier semiconductor heterostructure was first proposed around 1990. The transformation of the electric potential energy in a <b>vibrational</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> the lattice is remarkably facilitated by the electronic confinement in a double-barrier structure. On this basis, physicists were searching for materials in which stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission, is the dominant decay process.

5000|$|Tachyonic fields indeed {{arise in}} many {{versions}} of string theory. In general, string theory states {{that what we}} see as [...] "particles" [...] (electrons, photons, gravitons and so forth) are actually different vibrational states of the same underlying string. The mass of the particle can be deduced from the vibrations which the string exhibits; roughly speaking, the mass depends upon the [...] "note" [...] which the string sounds. Tachyons frequently appear in the spectrum of permissible string states, {{in the sense that}} some states have negative mass-squared, and therefore, imaginary mass. If the tachyon appears as a <b>vibrational</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> an open string, this signals an instability of the underlying D-brane system to which the string is attached. The system will then decay to a state of closed strings and/or stable D-branes. If the tachyon is a closed string vibrational mode, this indicates an instability in spacetime itself. Generally, it is not known (or theorized) what this system will decay to. However, if the closed string tachyon is localized around a spacetime singularity, the endpoint of the decay process will often have the singularity resolved.|$|E
40|$|The {{diatomic}} linear {{chain of}} masses coupled by harmonic springs is a textboook model for vibrational normal modes (phonons) in crystals. In addition to propagating acoustic and optic branches, {{this model is}} known to support a ``gap mode'' localized at the surface, provided the atom at the surface has light rather than heavy mass. An elementary argument is given which explains this mode and provides values for the frequency and localization length. By reinterpreting this mode in different ways, we obtain the frequency and localization lengths for three other interesting modes: (1) the surface <b>vibrational</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> a light mass impurity at {{the surface of a}} monatomic chain; (2) the localized <b>vibrational</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> a stacking fault in a diatomic chain; and (3) the localized <b>vibrational</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> a light mass impurity in a monatomic chain.
