40|$|In {{the present}} paper are {{discussed}} the results of simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruit at industrial scale. Fruit temperature distribution in a refrigerated cargo (reefer) has been studied {{in order to reduce}} the temperature difference in the load, to increase quality and shelf life after shipment. The mean temperature difference between the probes placed in the head space was shorter than 0. 5 °C while graphic peaks showed the temperature increase due to the on/off cycle of the automatic defrosting system. The temperature was also more than 10 °C higher than the mean registered value, and leads to a partial warming of the product. This undesired effect appears less important when the distance of the probe is higher respect to the air-cooler. Data concerning the probes placed on the container floor demonstrated a good result in terms of temperature homogeneity, but temperature reached a minimum level of about - 0, 8 °C (when the cooling system started) which can be considered too low for orange fruits storage, due to the risk of cold damage rising (about - 1, 0 °C). <b>Vented</b> <b>boxes</b> allow a more rapid cooling and a more accurate temperature control, probably due to the presence of the vent openings and, consequently, the less thermal resistance. Indeed citrus fruits placed in the <b>vented</b> <b>boxes</b> show a temperature variation like the environment cold air, while the fruits in the classic boxes show a great inertia to modify their temperature. Therefore, using the <b>vented</b> <b>boxes</b> need a precise control of the container air temperature, as any air temperature fluctuation can lead to a fruit quality decrease. The container for citrus fruit transport has to be suitable for cooling; every container for food freezing is not suitable for the scope; indeed the low evaporation temperatures could lead the rising of fruit cold damages...|$|R

40|$|A direct model, {{using the}} {{explicit}} geometry of stacked products in boxes, {{was developed and}} used to study the local and average airflow through stacks of horticultural products. The discrete element method was employed to generate a random stacking of spherical products in the box. A computational fluid dynamics model was then applied to study explicitly the airflow through the air gaps in the box and in the voids between the stacks of different random fillings. The flow resistance was affected by the confinement ratio, product size, porosity, <b>box</b> <b>vent</b> hole ratio, and much less by the random filling. The predicted pressure drop over stacks agreed with experimental correlations for porous media. Air velocity profiles inside the boxes compared well to measurements.

40|$|Inefficiency in {{fungicide}} treatment {{is one of}} the reasons for postharvest decay of fruits during the storage period. Postharvest treatment of fungicides using thermonebulisation fogging systems offers a promising means to minimize such postharvest decay. Moreover, this treatment method reduces the use of fungicides in the orchards, minimizes residues on the fruits and improves ecological and environmental sustainability. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to help optimize the application of the fungicide particles inside the fruit storage room. An Eulerian-Lagrangian multiphase flow model was used. The model takes into account two-way coupling with turbulent dispersion of the particles. The particle diameter distribution at the exit of thermonebuliser was measured and used as an input to the model. The product loaded in vented bins was considered as a porous medium, where the loss coefficients to the three orthogonal directions were approximated using simulation of the flow through the <b>vented</b> <b>boxes</b> and stacks. The dynamic behaviour of the fan was also taken into account. The distribution of the fungicide particles was highly affected by the air flow distribution inside the room.

This paper reports {{the results of a}} simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruits (14600 kg of ‘Tarocco’ oranges) in a 40 ft refrigerated container.

Controlled cooling tests using a portable cooling tunnel indicated an important cooling time reduction (reaching 7 / 8 cooling time) without affecting quality when perforated liners were used instead of solid ones. The use of these <b>vented</b> <b>box</b> liners will result in direct energy savings to packinghouses proportional to the reduction in cooling times. Also, shorter cooling times will allow scheduling operations for the off-peak utility periods.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{mounting}} a loudspeaker {{on one end}} of a sound-absorbing tube has existed since at least 1936. Surprisingly, a detailed mathematical analysis of the configuration has not been performed, nor has a design method been established. This configuration, known as a transmission line loudspeaker, has received little consideration in the reviewed literature. Instead, it has become frequently featured in magazines for audio hobbyists, where it is experimentally designed with rules seemingly derived from hearsay and described with terms of high praise. In this dissertation, an electro-acoustical model of a fiberglass-filled transmission line is presented. This model represents the transmission line as two separate lines [...] a mechanical line that models the mechanical motion of the fiberglass and an acoustical line that models the motion of the air. The lines are linked by the flow resistance of the fiberglass. From the model, solutions for the acoustic pressure, acoustical volume velocity of the air, mechanical velocity of the fiberglass fibers, and mechanical force on the fiberglass in the line are obtained. The fiberglass is characterized and empirical formulas that describe its characteristics are found. It is shown that the modeled input impedance to the transmission line is a good fit to measured data. The performance of the system is assessed by comparing it with the performances of typical loudspeaker mountings, i. e., the infinite baffle, the closed <b>box,</b> and the <b>vented</b> <b>box.</b> Finally, an example is shown of how the equations derived from the model can be used to evaluate the design of a transmission line loudspeaker system.

40|$|Surface {{sediment}} {{samples taken}} with a <b>vented</b> <b>box</b> corer from the eastern Weddell Sea on four profiles perpendicular to the continental margin have been investigated for their benthic foraminiferal content. The live fauna was differentiated from empty tests comprising the foraminiferal death assemblage. Based on the dead assemblages, potential fossil assemblages were calculated to facilitate the analogy with late Neogene core material. Five distinct live assemblages inhabit the continental margin today. Six dead assemblages and five potential fossil assemblages, respectively, correspond to these biocoenoses. A predominantly calcareous live fauna dominated by Trifarina angulosa is correlated with strong bottom currents and sandy sediments at the shelf break and on the uppermost continental slope. Below this, on the upper slope down to 2000 m water depth, the predominantly calcareous Bulimina aculeata assemblage coincides with the core of warm (> 0 °C) Weddell Deep Water and with fine and more organic-rich sediments. These calcareous live assemblages completely change composition during early diagenesis because of calcite dissolution within the uppermost sediment, which depends largely on the grain size distribution of the sediment and the fluxes of organic matter. Therefore, a still calcareous T. angulosa-dominated fossil assemblage indicates the sandy substrates on the shelf break and the upper slope, whereas the deeper slope with hemipelagic calm sedimentation and with high fluxes of organic matter is indicated by Martinottiella nodulosa, the characteristic arenaceous fossil remnant of the former predominantly calcareous live B. aculeata fauna. On a continental terrace between 2500 and 3500 m water depth Cribrostomoides subglobosus dominates the live fauna, but because of rapid disintegration of the empty tests of this agglutinated species a predominantly calcareous fauna characterized by Oridorsalis umbonatus and Epistominella exigua comprises the dead assemblage and the potential fossil assemblage, respectively. On the lower continental slope, between the carbonate lysocline (3500 m) and the carbonate compensation depth (4000 m), tests of Nuttallides umbonifer are the characteristic dead and potential fossil remnants of a former predominantly arenaceous live fauna, which {{is associated with the}} lower part of the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW).

From the modeling point of view, an analytical model {{can be found in}} literature, describing heat and mass transfer across Breathing Walls in steady state conditions. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the model lacks an exhaustive experimental validation. Therefore, in this paper, the novel laboratory apparatus named Dual Air <b>Vented</b> Thermal <b>Box</b> developed at Politecnico of Milano is presented. The apparatus is used to experimentally investigate the steady state behaviour of a 1 m 2 Air Permeable Concrete sample, crossed by an airflow at different velocities up to 12 mm/s.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{aerodynamic}} stability {{of a proposed}} suspension bridge crossing the Sognefjord. Such a bridge will require a main span of approximately 3700 m, almost double the span length of the current record holder. For such a long span and slender suspension bridge its aerodynamic properties are highly important. A comparison of the aerodynamic stability limits using three different configurations of a so-called <b>vented</b> or dual <b>box</b> girder has been done. The only difference in each configuration is the center-to-center distance between the individual box girders. The design of the individual girders and the cable system is kept constant. A modal approach to solving the equation of motion has been employed where the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes have been computed using a computer program called ALVSAT. The numerical calculations of stability limits as well as dynamic response have been done using self-written MATLAB scripts based on well-established theory of bridge aerodynamics. Aerodynamic derivatives from wind tunnel tests have been obtained from {{a report on the}} similar cross section of the proposed Brusymfonien bridge. The results obtained show an increasing critical mean wind velocity with increasing the center-to-center widths between the box sections. For the widest dual box girder, no stability limits were found.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the activities required to modify a facility {{and the process}} of characterizing, repackaging, and preparing for shipment the Nevada Test Site’s (NTS) legacy transuranic (TRU) waste in 58 oversize boxes (OSB). The waste, generated at other U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites and shipped to the NTS between 1974 and 1990, requires size-reduction for off-site shipment and disposal. The waste processing approach was tailored to reduce the volume of TRU waste by employing decontamination and non-destructive assay. As a result, the low-level waste (LLW) generated by this process was packaged, with minimal size reduction, in large sea-land containers for disposal at the NTS Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC). The remaining TRU waste was repackaged and sent to the Idaho National Laboratory Consolidation Site for additional characterization in preparation for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The DOE National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office and the NTS Management and Operating (M&O) contractor, NSTec, successfully partnered to modify and upgrade an existing facility, the Visual Examination and Repackaging Building (VERB). The VERB modifications, including a new ventilation system and modified containment structure, required an approved Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis prior to project procurement and construction. Upgrade of the VERB from a radiological facility to a Hazard Category 3 Nuclear Facility required new rigor in the design and construction areas and was executed on an aggressive schedule. The facility Documented Safety Analysis required that OSBs be vented prior to introduction into the VERB. <b>Box</b> <b>venting</b> was safely completed after developing and implementing two types of custom venting systems for the heavy gauge box construction. A remotely operated punching process was used on boxes with wall thickness of up to 3. 05 mm (0. 120 in) to insert aluminum bronze filters and sample ports to prevent sparking during penetration. A remotely operated cold-drilling process with self-drilling, self-tapping titanium coated spark-resistant filters was used for boxes with wall thickness of up to 6. 35 mm (0. 25 in). The box headspace was sampled for the presence of flammable gases. To further accelerate the project schedule, an innovative treatment process was used. Several of the OSBs were re-assayed and determined to be mixed low-level waste (MLLW) which allowed treatment, followed by disposal in the Mixed Waste Disposal Unit at the NTS Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC). The MLLW boxes were certified using real-time radiography and overpacked into custom-built polyethylene-lined macroencapsulation containers. The polyethylene-lined lid was welded to the poly-lined box using automatically controlled resistance heating through embedded wiring in the lid. The work was performed under the existing Documented Safety Analysis since plastic welding is accomplished at low temperature and does not introduce the risks of other macroencapsulation processes, such as welding stainless steel containers. The macroencapsulation process for MLLW not only accelerated the schedule by reducing the number of boxes requiring size reduction, but it also resulted in significantly improved safety with as low as reasonable achievable levels of exposure to workers plus reduced cost by eliminating the need to perform repackaging in the VERB...|$|R
40|$|New Zealand is the world’s third biggest {{producer}} of kiwifruit, with 94 % of the kiwifruit produced exported (NZ $ 1. 0 bn in 2014). Forced-air cooling of the produce (from the harvest temperature of about 20 °C to near storage temperature of 0 °C) immediately after harvest improves storage potential and maintains produce quality before transportation to market. The {{design of the}} kiwifruit packaging system influences the rate of cooling and temperature achieved, mainly by affecting the airflow within and throughout the package. The typical kiwifruit package contains 10. 5 kg of fruit and consists of a cardboard box and polyliner bag to prevent the loss of moisture and fruit shrivelling. Individual boxes are assembled onto pallets (10 boxes to a pallet layer, 10 layers high) Open areas or <b>vents</b> (in the <b>box)</b> facilitate cooling by allowing cool air to enter and circulate throughout the package. In forced-air cooling pallets are assembled into double rows with an aisle between the rows. Cool air is sucked through the pallets by a fan in the aisle, cooling the fruit and warming the air. The air is then either blown or ducted to the refrigeration system to be re-cooled. The polyliner keeps the local humidity high near the fruit, preventing weight loss due to evaporative cooling, but, {{as a barrier to}} direct fruit to air contact, slows the cooling rate. This project investigated the impact of operating conditions and package design on the cooling performance in such systems. A numerical model was developed (a CFD model implemented using the Fluent CFD software) that describes and predicts the temperature profiles of palletised kiwifruit packages undergoing forced-air cooling. The capability of the model to predict the fruit temperatures in each package was quantitatively validated against experimental data. The numerical model was able to predict temperature profiles within experimental error bars over 14 h of cooling. The numerical model was used to determine the operating point (in terms of pressure drop and flowrate across the pallet) to ensure rapid cooling of the produce without incurring excessive operational costs due to the power requirements. Results from both experimental work and the numerical model informed that there was an effective limit to the volumetric flowrate of 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 : flowrates in excess of the limit had no or little effective benefit. This threshold flowrate is below the typical range recommended in industry for the forced-air cooling of non-polylined horticultural produce, which is 0. 5 – 2. 0 L kg- 1 s- 1. The numerical model demonstrated that the overall cooling performance (cooling rate, uniformity, power consumption and pallet throughput per week) can be improved by controlling the airflow distribution between the fastest and slowest cooling kiwifruit packages. An alternative design that channels cool air through the pallet towards the slowest cooling packages, located {{at the back of the}} pallet, by using two package designs in the same pallet, was presented. At 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 it was found that the pressure drop and power required to achieve equivalent cooling rates with the new design was reduced (by 24 % each) compared to the conventional design. Additionally, at the half-cooling time the cooling uniformity was improved by 19 %. The key features of the new design can be expected to be applicable for the cooling of horticultural produce involving an inner packaging liner...|$|R
