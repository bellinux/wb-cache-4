40|$|Increased {{interest}} in unconventional batch distillation column configurations offers {{new opportunities for}} increasing the flexibility and energy efficiency of batch distillation. One configuration of particular interest is multivessel batch distillation column, which {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of all previously studied batch column configuration. In this work, for the first time the optimal design and operation tasks are developed for multivessel batch distillation with strict product specifications under fixed product demand. Also, in this work, two different operation schemes defined as STN (State Task Network) in terms of the option and numbers of off-cuts were considered for binary and ternary separation. Both the <b>vapour</b> <b>load</b> and number of stages in each column section together with the production sequence are optimised to achieve maximum profit function. The performance of the multivessel batch distillation column is evaluated against the performance of conventional batch column with a simple dynamic model using binary and ternary mixtures. It has been found that profitability improves with the multivessel system in both separations. gPROMS, a user-friendly, software is used for the modeling, simulation, and optimisation...|$|E
40|$|NoOptimal design (<b>vapour</b> <b>load,</b> V {{and number}} of stages, N) and {{operation}} (reflux ratio, R and batch time, tb) of batch distillation have received significant attention in recent years. In these studies, {{it has been suggested}} that V should be set at some upper limit (thought to be optimum) and the optimisation task should be focused on finding the optimum values of N, R and tb, which would minimise the capital investment while maximising an economic objective function usually the profit (P). The major drawback of such optimisation strategy is that there is no constraint on the amount of product (on specification) being produced (NB = no. of batches in a given time) and the overall profit can only be maximised by producing unlimited amount of products. Unplanned and unlimited production of products are not sustainable and may lead to significant losses in the case of large inventory requirements of any excess products produced. In this work, for the first time, the optimal design and operation task for batch distillation is considered with due regards to the market demands (small to large number of batches) of the products being produced. An optimisation problem formulation is presented for the task which is different than those used in the past under unlimited product demand scenario. Simulated Annealing type algorithm is used for the solution of the optimisation problem. With several examples, it will be shown that fixing V a priori (say V Vopt, P will always be <Pmax for any combination of (N, R, tb). The comparisons between the results with and without fixing of V a priori show very clear improvement in the annual profit...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{developments in}} atomic <b>vapour</b> <b>loading</b> in hollow core {{photonic crystal fibre}} (HC-PCF) for fabrication of atomic <b>vapour</b> <b>loaded</b> photonic microcells (PMC). These developments have been targeted at addressing {{some of the issues}} associated with <b>loading</b> atomic <b>vapours</b> in confined waveguiding geometries such as increased dephasing and physio-chemical wall absorptions. Atomic <b>vapour</b> <b>loaded</b> HC-PCF and PMC’s have applications in laser metrology, coherent optics and magneto optical spectroscopy. State of the art HC-PCF have been fabricated for <b>loading</b> with atomic <b>vapour</b> including both photonic bandgap (PBG) guiding and inhibited coupling (IC) hypocycloidal core shape Kagome HC-PCF. Record loss of 70 dB/km has been achieved in IC hypocycloid core shape Kagome HC-PCF in the spectral region centred at 800 nm. This fibre retains excellent single mode propagation combined with large core and increased optical bandwidth in comparison with specialist PBG HC-PCF optimised for operation around 800 nm. Aluminosilicate sol-gel coatings have been developed and successfully applied to the inner core wall of HC-PCF’s to reduce the atomic vapour surface interaction. Confining atomic vapours in micron scaled HC-PCF results in increased dephasing rates because of the frequent atom wall collisions. Anti relaxation coating materials have been applied to the inner core wall and the longitudinal relaxation time has been measured in coated and uncoated fibres utilising a magneto optical technique. Additionally sub Doppler transparencies are investigated in anti relaxation coated and uncoated HC-PCF...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} and modeled {{a simple and}} efficient source of slow atoms. From a background <b>vapour</b> <b>loaded</b> magneto-optical trap, a thin laser beam extracts a continuous jet of cold rubidium atoms. In this setup, the extraction column that is typical to leaking MOT systems is created without any optical parts placed inside the vacuum chamber. For detailed analysis, we present a simple 3 D numerical simulation of the atomic motion {{in the presence of}} multiple saturating laser fields combined with an inhomogeneous magnetic field. At a pressure of P_ Rb 87 = 1 × 10 ^- 8 mbar, the moderate laser power of 10 mW per beam generates a jet of flux Φ = 1. 3 × 10 ^ 8 atoms/s with a mean velocity of 14 m/s and a divergence of < 20 mrad.

The exposure of three workers to benzene vapour has been determined by personal air sampling, and has been related to their intake (assessed by sampling exhaled breath), and to their metabolism of benzene (evaluated from the concentration of phenol in urine.)

40|$|Interactions between atmosphere, {{ice sheet}} and ocean {{play a crucial}} role in the Antarctic climate. For example, sea-air exchanges in leads and polynyas can {{strengthen}} cyclonic activities by warming and water <b>vapour</b> <b>loading</b> of air masses while associated sea heat loss and brine rejection modify water density and contribute to the dense water formation. Due to the harsh weather conditions in Antarctica, climate and ocean models appear as suitable tools to complement the scarcity of observations and to study the Antarctic climate. Nonetheless, only few models are able to represent typical processes found at high latitudes such as katabatic winds, drifting snow for the atmosphere or sea ice formation, accretion and deformation for oceans. Furthermore, due to their high non-linearity, those processes are difficult to model as they occur at different spatial and temporal scales. Current models are often forced by outputs: atmospheric conditions are provided to ocean models and ocean models outputs are used as surface conditions in atmospheric models meaning air feedbacks on ocean (or inversely) are muted. One can think models should be coupled at each time steps to take into account instantaneous interactions. Nonetheless, this method involves (too) high computational costs. The main challenge of this coupling is to take into account air-ice-ocean interactions and the temporal scale of associated processes in order to define an appropriate coupling time step. We will present both ocean and ice-atmosphere processes relative to polar climates and the specificities of the two models as well as technical coupling aspects...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{developments in}} the fabrication and applications of photonic microcells (PMCs). A PMC is a length of gas-filled hollow core-photonic crystal fibre (HC-PCF) that is hermetically sealed by splicing both ends to standard single mode fibre. A PMC enables integration of gas-filled HC-PCF into all-fibre systems with low insertion loss. PMCs have applications in coherent optics and metrology, where specific HC-PCF designs are advantageous. Two types of state-of-the-art HC-PCF, double bandgap HCPCF and large-pitch Kagome fibre, are fabricated. The double bandgap HC-PCF extends the usable bandwidth of the fibre by providing low loss guidance across two transmission bands. The large-pitch Kagome HC-PCF has a record low attenuation of 0. 3 dB/m at 800 nm, while maintaining broadband guidance, which is partially attributed to the core shape. Three distinct {{developments in the}} field of PMCs are described. Firstly, a record length 20 metre acetylene-filled PMC is fabricated which is the key component in the first demonstration of an all-fibre slow and fast light system based on electromagnetically induced transparency. Secondly, a technique based on fibre tapering is presented which enables low loss integration of large core Kagome HC-PCFs into PMC form. Thirdly, micromirrors are developed and integrated with HC-PCF to confine light in the longitudinal dimension, providing a means to fabricate multi-pass PMCs. Two uncoated micromirrors are used to form a low finesse microcavity in Kagome HC-PCF, with record high fringe visibility using reflections from a silica/air junction. In collaboration with Kansas State University, an acetylene optical reference with sub- 10 KHz accuracy and the first acetylene laser based on population inversion are demonstrated using Kagome HC-PCF. Finally, this thesis reports on rubidium <b>vapour</b> <b>loading</b> in HC-PCF with the ultimate aim being the production of a rubidium-filled PMC for applications in metrology. Preliminary results highlight the limited loading distance of the current technique and modified loading schemes are outlined accordingly.

40|$|A {{frost point}} {{hygrometer}} {{is described in}} this thesis which uses surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to detect water vapour condensation. The SAW device crystal is cooled by a thermoelectric cooler until condensation occurs, at which point, water <b>vapour</b> <b>loading</b> onto the SAW device causes changes in the SAW velocity and amplitude. Two methods of determining the frost point temperature are outlined in this thesis. The first uses a feedback loop algorithm to maintain a constant amount of water vapour on the SAW device and hence keep {{the temperature of the}} device at the frost point. The second uses heating and cooling cycles to oscillate the SAW device temperature above and below the frost paint. Changes in the SAW properties are then used to detect the condensation-evaporation equilibrium point which is equal to the frost point. The use of SAWs rather than a conventional optical detection system in this hygrometer allows a faster response time, increased sensitivity, and decreased risk of contamination. Between September 2001 and February 2004, the SAW hygrometer was flown on 28 balloon flights, in various configurations. All of these flight data sets show agreement with radiosonde relative humidity measurements to within 1 %, using given criteria for extraction of reliable SAW hygrometer measurements. Accurate lower and mid tropospheric measurements have been made on each flight and four flights show accurate upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric measurements with water vapour mixing ratio values of less than 5 ppmv. The Hibiscus campaign flights in Bauru, Brazil, show excellent agreement between the different instruments measuring water vapour on the flight train and the SAW hygrometer. These data are discussed in conjunction with auxiliary data and model backward trajectories. Two different backward trajectory models have been used to assess the possible mechanisms of transport of water vapour above Bauru, one of which is a large scale model and the other is a meso-scale model. A sharp contrast in the air parcel transport above and below the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is seen, with large scale convection or descent controlling the water vapour mixing ratios below the TTL, and a combination of large and small scale fields controlling the water vapour in and above the TTL.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} performance of a slow atom source based on a 2 D magneto-optical trap (MOT) that uses an innovative simple optical configuration. Metal-coated retro-reflecting prisms replace mirrors and quarter-wave plates so the optical power of the cooling laser beam is recycled. This source has been characterised for three different configurations: with and without transverse magnetic field gradient, and with a pusher beam to obtain a 2 D + -MOT. The longitudinal velocity is {{of the order of}} 25 m•s − 1, with a transverse velocity spread ≤ 1 m•s − 1, while the typical atomic flux density obtained is up to 1. 3 × 1014 at •s − 1 •m − 2 for a cesium vapour pressure of ~ 4 × 10 − 8 mbar in the source.

40|$|The deterpenation of cold-pressed {{lemon peel}} oil {{by means of}} {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide was carried out both in a simple batch mode and {{by means of a}} batch process with a rectification column. The simple batch process provided experimental data of <b>vapour</b> phase <b>loading</b> at temperature 315 - 323 - 333 K and pressure ranging from 8. 4 to 10. 5 MPa. This process allowed the production of folded oils with reasonable solvent to feed ratio, but led to low recovery of oxygenated compounds in the raffinate. In order to increase the recovery of these valuable compounds, a batch process with an external reflux of extract was performed in a laboratory plant, investigating the effect of temperature, pressure and reflux ratio. The operational conditions that led to lower solvent to feed ratio, for a stated oxygenated concentration in the raffinate, were found at temperature of 333 K and pressure around 10. 0 MPa. The obtained values for the recovery of oxygenated compounds ranged from 0. 82 to nearly 1, with a reflux ratio varying from 1. 4 to 9. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, a {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model is developed to predict the hydrodynamics of industrial-scale Centrifugal tray that is {{a new kind of}} tray and can be used in distillation and absorption towers. Three-dimensional two-phase flow of gas and liquid is considered in which the interaction was modeled based on the concept of phasic volume defined in the Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase model through k-epsilon Simulation. All governing equations including surface tension and wall adhesion are solved simultaneously using the FLUENT code. Gas-liquid interfaces and the existence of froth regime are clearly visualized via VOF model. Due to the importance of trays, it is vital to predict lower operating range limits for such gas-liquid contacting devices. Weeping phenomenon is observed in bubbling regime and occurs at low vapour flow rates. To approach this aim, continuity and momentum equations are solved simultaneously for the fluid on tray and the results were compared with data of sieve trays. In the Comparison of sieve type trays with centrifugal chimney type, in low <b>loading</b> <b>vapour,</b> no weeping was observed in the centrifugal tray. The simulation results show that this innovated centrifugal tray can be used for solving the weeping problem and increasing the performance of tray towers...|$|R
40|$|Commercial kitchens {{are subject}} to high heat <b>loads,</b> <b>vapour,</b> fumes, odours and various aerosols, which are {{generated}} during cooking processes. Studies have shown, that long term exposure to cooking emissions creates adverse health effects for kitchen workers. To {{be able to control}} kitchen environment, improve thermal conditions and remove harmful cooking emissions, exhaust hoods are utilised. Inside an exhaust hood, separation of grease and condensate takes place in order to reduce ventilation maintenance costs and ensure that fire safety and hygienic requirements are met. A number of grease filtering techniques exist, however, the majority of hoods utilise single stage filtering using grease separators. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine pressure drop and grease extraction efficiency characteristics of exhaust hoods produced by a Lithuanian manufacturer. In this study, pressure drop characteristics of exhaust hoods with condensing plates and two different types of grease separators are determined. Pressure drop characteristics are essential for selection process of an exhaust fan. What is more, these characteristics are also used for determining exhaust hood air flow rate, so that ventilation engineers are able to adjust it to a required air flow rate. A comparative study of 3 different types of grease separators are carried out in order to identify the most efficient type of separators by determining and comparing their fractional separation efficiencies. For this analysis, a special experimental stand is designed and utilized for testing. This study will allow to determine the most efficient type of grease extractors...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic thermohydraulic {{behaviour}} of {{a vertical}} tube reboiler is investigated by experiments and by simulation. Natural circulation reboilers {{are widely used}} in chemical industries, especially as column evaporators. Their main components are an evaporator and a separator which are connected in a loop. The subcooled product fluid coming from the separator is heated, partially evaporated and fed back into the separator. Entering the separator the two-phase flow is separated into liquid and vapour phase due to gravity. As {{a result of the}} partial evaporation the mean density of the fluid decreases. Caused by the density difference between evaporator and separator contents, a natural circulation occurs. Under certain conditions flow instabilities will occur, triggered by different causes as for example feedback between vapour generation, flow velocity and pressure loss. To investigate these instabilities, to distinguish between them as to their type and to enable a forecast for these instabilities a technical pilot plant scale test facility is used. The main components are a vertical tube evaporator, a separator and a condenser. The evaporator is heated by steam. It is designed as a straight tube heat exchanger with seven tubes in parallel of 4 m length each. By varying various operating parameters such as product <b>vapour</b> pressure, heat <b>load</b> and submergence level, stable and unstable conditions can be observed and analysed. As a working fluid deionized water is used. Based on the experimental results and criteria found in literature a stability diagram is in development.
