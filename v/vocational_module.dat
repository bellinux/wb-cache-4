40|$|This chapter {{reports on}} a {{small-scale}} case study involving 15 - 16 year old secondary school students participating in a <b>vocational</b> <b>module</b> under the General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ) scheme that operated in England during the late 1990 s. The development was a pilot study involving experience in the workplace in a small-scale light engineering context. An initial aim {{of the study was}} to explore the potential of the setting for the development of numeracy practices. The theoretical framework adopted is based on a social perspective on learning and a view of learning mathematically as social practice. Of particular interest were the differences between everyday and school mathematical practices. The analysis focuses on differences in the practices between the settings of workplace and school in particular. Finally issues to emerge from this study are discussed in relation to the wider context of policy and practice. These include issues of relevance, questions of purpose, learner confidence and approaches to assessment in mathematics...|$|E

In {{the focus group}} interviews, almost all mentees appreciated the mentors’ efforts in the program and agreed that the program was useful to them. Mentors could help them to understand basic concepts {{so that they could}} catch up with the curriculum and be more confident when facing examinations. Mentees found that both group tutoring and a collaborative learning model were effective. This finding is in agreement with the concept of the learning community, which helps to build up individual knowledge [2]. Most mentors agreed that they had helped the mentees to participate in the program. The program also provided an opportunity for mentors to apply what they had learnt in the past and consolidate their knowledge. Friendship amongst the mentors and mentees was also built in the program.|$|R

Teachers are implementer agent in curriculum transformation. Generally, the involvement of teachers in curriculum innovation process provides a variety of challenges and obstacles in implementing it effectively. This {{study was conducted to}} identify the teacher’s readiness for the implementation of Competency Based Learning (CBL) in vocational colleges. The teacher’s readiness aspects that were studied have covered the aspects of knowledge, skills and attitudes of teachers in implementing the CBL. This study has involved 234 respondents from teachers who are teaching vocational modules in 15 pilot vocational colleges as a sample. Questionnaires were used as a research instrument with a value of Cronbach Alpha is 0. 946 which shows the reliability of the questionnaires received. Data was analysed by descriptive in frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation and ANOVA using SPSS Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14. 0. As a result, it was found that teacher’s readiness in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes towards the implementation of CBL is moderately high with an average mean value of 3. 9903 which is that indicates the teachers are willing to implement CBL in <b>Vocational</b> <b>Module.</b> The study found that there are {{no significant differences between the}} teaching experiences with the knowledge, but there are significant differences between the teaching experiences with the skills and attitudes of teachers towards the implementation of CBL...|$|E

The paper starts with a review of the main concepts that underpinned the redesign of the module. E-Learning E-learning refers to a number of learning technologies that incorporate Information Communication Technologies (ICT). These can include both synchronous communication, for example webcam conferences and chatrooms, and asynchronous e-learning tools such as email and webboards. Recent advances in learning technology have also extended to the use of blogs, wikis and podcasts available through integrated learning environments. Advantages of e-learning include the direction of learning being defined by users (Fox 2007) and that it can include varying combinations of content (MacDonald and Thompson 2005). E-learning also has benefits for students with particular difficulties. For example, Hurst (2002) identified that placing materials on the web can be beneficial for students whose disabilities prevent them from taking notes. E-learning can also provide educational access to those who could not easily attend classroom based sessions because of other commitments such as full-time paid employment or being outside the geographical location of the higher education provider. E-learning enables education to be delivered at a distance (Connolly et al...|$|E

The module structure {{is based on the}} National Qualification Framework as well as political, administrative and programme dimensions. Qualitative research helped to determine the aspects and problematic points of module structure. Methodology is based on the liberalistic and pragmatic ideas which help to combine modular vocational training system. The objectives of the article are the following: • to discuss the place of <b>vocational</b> training <b>module</b> in the National Qualification Framework; • to define the criteria for composing structure of modular training programme/module composition; • {{on the basis of the}} results of the qualitative research to set out the dimensions of the modular vocational training structure. 1. <b>Vocational</b> training <b>module,</b> a learning component developed for acquiring a certain part (unit) of qualification, determines the explicit learning path for acquiring qualification or part of it, that is reflected in the National Qualification Framework. The modular training is based on the clear split of qualification into the separate units upon which modules are developed. Qualification unit is realized through the module. It allows acquiring the set of competencies that is a constituent part of qualification and that helps to integrate and remain in the labour market. Each module is a structurized learning component of qualification activity partial competency. 2. The module structure criteria presuppose the presumable description of the module structure that determines the clear learning structure and is required for the curriculum development. 3. The empirical research helps to distinguish the following dimensions of modular training learning structure: political, administrative and programme.

40|$|Cognitive {{dysfunction}} {{is one of}} {{the hallmark}} deficits of schizophrenia. A wide range of studies illustrate how it is strongly interconnected to clinical presentation and daily life functioning (see Green, 1996 and Green et al., 2000). Hence, cognition is an important treatment target in schizophrenia. To address the challenge of cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia, a large number of cognitive remediation programs have been developed and evaluated over the past several decades. First, an overview of these programs is presented highlighting their specificity to cognitive deficit in schizophrenia using an integrated method. In this case, cognitive training focuses on enhancing several elementary cognitive functions considered as a prerequisite to social skills or <b>vocational</b> training <b>modules.</b> These programs are based on the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. However, moderate improvement for patients who benefit from these therapies has been observed as described in Wykes et al review (2011). Next, neuropsychological models of schizophrenia are then presented. They highlight the critical role of the internally generated intentions in appropriate willful actions. The cognitive control mechanism deals with this ability. Interestingly, available cognitive remediation programs have not been influenced by these models. Hence, we propose another alternative to set up a specific cognitive remediation program for schizophrenia patients by targeting the cognitive control mechanism. We describe the PrACTice program which {{is in the process of}} being validated...|$|R
30|$|The {{program had}} {{positive}} effects on students’ academic performance. Nearly every PT and tutored student achieved the learning outcomes of the <b>Vocational</b> English <b>modules.</b> For the PTs, as suggested by Gaustad [2], the time spent on revising with their peer tutees and explaining the learning materials to them reinforced {{their understanding of the}} subject knowledge. As for the peer tutees, the PTs helped them to study more effectively by giving them individual instruction and support whenever they encountered problems. The students’ learning motivation was increased, which was in line with previous findings [3]. The PTs reported being eager to study the learning materials before classes and to consult their teachers frequently to be better prepared for teaching their peer tutees. Meanwhile, peer tutees were willing to revise what they had learnt and continually seek support from their PTs and teachers. They also expressed more positive attitudes towards English learning. The scheme also boosted students’ confidence in learning English as they had support from their peers. Furthermore, the program fostered students’ ownership in learning and encouraged outside classroom learning. Some PTs voluntarily studied with their peer tutees on campus after school. A bigger pleasant surprise was that a few PTs organized an online video discussion group to practice vocabulary pronunciation and oral presentation with their peer tutees. All of these additional experiences enabled PTs to feel worthwhile and valuable, while giving peer tutees more opportunities to learn from their peers outside normal lessons.|$|R
40|$|M. A. The primary aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{effectiveness}} of an integrated youth leadership development programme on the unemployed out-of-school youth. It focuses on their perceptions of the programme based on their experiences after the training. The study is based on a sample of 35 respondents out of the 411 youth who participated, over a period of seven years, in the development programme under review. The findings reveal that the participants found the programme to be generally useful in that it changed their mindsets and attitude towards life. Some were grateful that it helped them to get jobs while others indicated that it taught them and made them become generous and impart their skills in community projects/organisations. While there seems to be controversy around the introduction of the <b>vocational</b> skills <b>module,</b> some participants indicated that it enabled them to initiate their own businesses. Furthermore, the participants aknowledged the significance of their individual roles and contributions towards their own development. In conclusion, based on the findings, conclusions are drawn and recommendations made for consideration, for example, the need for IYLDP to continue and extend its programme to reach more people, the advantages of undergoing and completing a leadership development programmes and how best to deal with post-training challenges, and considerations for IYLDP to maximize the effectiveness of its programme. It is envisaged that the proposed suggestions will help to improve the service provided by addressing the identified unmet needs and concerns raised in the study. Lastly, specific areas for further research are highlighted for consideration, for example, the need for adequate differentiation of programme goals and objectives, quantifying programme objectives, and standardising training and recruitment procedures...|$|R

40|$|Background: It is {{increasingly}} acknowledged that clinical interventions for young persons with mental disorders need to optimize social, vocational and physical functioning, and {{take into account}} developmental needs, rather than focusing only on the traditional target of psychiatric symptom change. However, few interventions for youth presenting to mental health services offer a coherent rationale for multi-faceted approaches that efficiently address all these targets. This trial uses two facilitated group therapy modules (social and physical activity) {{as a vehicle for}} promoting clinical, cognitive, social and <b>vocational</b> change. The <b>modules</b> are an adjunct to usual treatments offered to youth attending mental health services in Sydney, Australia. Methods/Design: The design is a 2 -arm, parallel group cross-over, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that examines the efficacy of this adjunctive youth early intervention program (called "YES") for improving social, vocational, mental and physical health functioning in a trans-diagnostic sample of 120 young persons aged 14 - 25 years who are currently receiving a range of "usual treatments" for clinically diagnosed anxiety, affective and/or psychotic disorders. Individuals who provide written informed consent are offered 2 group therapy modules (each comprising 4 hours per week for 8 weeks) with a 3 -week "pause" between modules. Randomization determines whether individuals commence with module A or module B. The sample will be assessed pre-randomization, and at week 1 and week 8 (after completion of the first module), and at week 11 (commencement of second module) and week 19 (completion of second module). Final follow-up is 1 -year post trial entry. Discussion: If the findings of this exploratory trial demonstrate benefits in the target domains, then it will be important to extend the research by undertaking: (a) a comparison of the YES program to a control intervention in a randomized controlled trial, (b) an explanatory study of putative mediators of change, and (c) a multi-center trial with a number of trained therapists offering the group modules combined with a longer follow-up period. © 2015 Gehue et al...|$|R
