40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the late-stage results from surgical treatment of patellar tendinopathy (PT), using the Visa score (Victorian Institute of Sport Tendon Study Group) and the Verheyden method. MethodsThis was a retrospective {{study in which}} the postoperative results from 12 patients (14 knees) who were operated between July 2002 and February 2011 were evaluated. The patients {{included in the study}} presented patellar tendinopathy that was refractory to conservative treatment, without any other concomitant lesions. Patients who were not properly followed up during the postoperative period were excluded. ResultsUsing the Verheyden method, nine patients were considered to have very good results, two had good results and one had poor results. In relation to <b>Visa,</b> the <b>mean</b> was 92. 4 points and only two patients had scores less than 70 points (66 and 55 points). ConclusionWhen surgical treatment for patellar tendinopathy is correctly indicated, it has good long-term results...|$|R
50|$|Directly {{after the}} events of September 11, 2001, the Federal Government {{typically}} placed a higher priority on obvious aspects of homeland security, such as intelligence reform, as opposed to border security. However, the government {{as well as the}} American public eventually reasoned that in order for a high-magnitude attack like September 11 to occur, something had to be seriously wrong with the border security apparatuses that were in place at the time. After all, every single one of the terrorist hijackers on September 11 had been a recipient of a temporary U.S tourist <b>visa,</b> which <b>means</b> they were legally allowed to be in the United States. If nineteen men who were committed to causing harm to Americans were capable of getting past the government screening restrictions that were in place, one could only imagine how great of a threat to America was posed by the largely unchecked 3017 mi long Canada-US border, the 1933 mi long Mexico-US border, and the many unsecured ports. However, the American public also questions why cracking down on illegal entries will hinder the ability of terrorists who enter the country legally.|$|R
40|$|In the New Zealand {{hospitality}} industry, {{workplace bullying}} and its influences have been researched extensively (Bentley et al., 2012; O'Driscoll et al., 2011); the literature (Janta, 2011; Taran & Geronomi, 2002) notes that migrant workers {{are often the}} target of bullying in the hospitality industry. As a fast-growing ethnic population group in New Zealand, however, Chinese migrant workers have not previously been a research target in regards to workplace bullying. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study is to determine the prevalence of perceived workplace bullying against Chinese migrant workers in the New Zealand hospitality industry and to examine the relationship between workplace bullying and its consequences in terms of organisational citizenship behaviour-individual (OCBI), turnover intention and negative word of mouth reported by employees. Four hypotheses were suggested to achieve this objective. This study adopted a quantitative research approach and recruited 64 Chinese respondents and 59 non-Chinese respondents engaged in the hospitality industry in Auckland, New Zealand. Following the data analysis, the results of both groups were discussed and compared in terms of their consistency with the findings of the extant literature. The key points of the study are summarised as follows: Firstly, workplace bullying in New Zealand has become a severe issue, with the percentage of employees who have suffered workplace bullying reflecting a sharp increase compared to Bentley et al. ’s (2009) survey conducted five years ago. The main reason for this change may be the large number of Chinese migrant workers, who suffer high levels of workplace bullying. Secondly, and as discussed later in this dissertation, Chinese people have unique characteristics, some of which aggravate the levels of workplace bullying. Language barriers limit their ability to interact with local communities, which results in unfair treatment that includes less training and advancement opportunities, and workplace bullying. Short-term <b>visas</b> <b>mean</b> that they are dependent on their employers to obtain New Zealand permanent residency and are therefore compelled to suffer bullying and abuse when this occurs. In addition, most Chinese migrant workers are engaged in the food and beverage sector, which has higher levels of workplace bullying than other sectors. Finally, the results of this study show that employees who suffer more workplace bullying tend to withhold their OCBI, have high turnover intention and spread negative word of mouth. Due to their suffering higher levels of workplace bullying, Chinese migrant workers are more likely to think about leaving, or actually leave their current organisations, and complain about their company or supervisor. Despite this, they appear to maintain high OCBI regardless of whether or not they have been bullied...|$|R

40|$|Disintegration of the USSR {{and join}} of Baltic States East European {{countries}} to European Union made {{this one a}} border territory between Russia and EU. The paper focuses on flows of goods and persons through boundaries between Russia and Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The purpose is to analyze the role of this boundary after the enlargement of the EU. Often regarded as peripheries within their respective federations, the eastern Baltic and western Russia are, by definition, a transitional and circulation space. After the collapse of Former Soviet Union, the new boundary remained almost easy to cross. In {{the beginning of the}} 21 th century, it became no more fuzzy but rather fixed. Since 2004, and the enlargement, the crossing has become more regulated. People need <b>visas</b> that <b>mean</b> papers and cost. The evolution of cargo flows has been more contrasted. Economic policies, political stakes and traditional links, are elements to understand East Baltic area. Kaliningrad Oblast, the Russian exclave lying by the Baltic Sea, strengthens the interest of the purpose. The approach is mainly through port and railway traffics for goods, and through air networks for passenger flows. Eastern Baltics ports are mainly transit ports for goods coming from or going to post-soviet states, while some Baltic airports concentrate flows between the last ones and the UE. Moreover, the mapping of traffic of people and commodities establish a new perception {{of the impact of the}} new EU border in the region...|$|R
40|$|There's {{something}} inherently entrepreneurial {{about leaving}} your home {{to start a}} new life in another country. Perhaps that is why immigrants tend to start businesses at a disproportionately higher rate than native-born Americans. In fact, more than 40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies in 2010 were founded by an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. Yet, despite their vast economic contributions, U. S. law provides no dedicated means for immigrant entrepreneurs to launch innovative companies in the United States. Meanwhile, other countries are stepping up to attract foreign entrepreneurs. With new visas, countries like Canada and New Zealand are competitors for international entrepreneurial talent. This policy brief suggests a visa for entrepreneurial immigrants could boost U. S. economic growth and create American jobs. Commonly called a startup <b>visa,</b> this new <b>means</b> of entry would allow immigrant entrepreneurs to start businesses in the United States after satisfying certain funding, employment, or other requirements...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} ultrasound guided dry needling and autologous blood injection {{for the treatment of}} patellar tendinosis. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Hospital/clinic based. PATIENTS: 47 knees in 44 patients (40 men, 7 women, mean age 34. 5 years, age range 17 to 54 years) with refractory tendinosis underwent sonographic examination of the patellar tendon following referral with a clinical diagnosis of patellar tendinosis (mean symptom duration 12. 9 months). INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound guided dry needling and injection of autologous blood into the site of patellar tendinosis was performed on two occasions four weeks apart. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and post-procedure Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment scores (VISA) were collected to assess patient response to treatment. Follow up ultrasound examination was done in 21 patients (22 knees). RESULTS: Therapeutic intervention led to a significant improvement in <b>VISA</b> score: <b>mean</b> pre-procedure score = 39. 8 (range 8 to 72) v mean post procedure score = 74. 3 (range 29 to 100), p< 0. 001; mean follow up 14. 8 months (range 6 to 22 months). Patients were able to return to their sporting interests. Follow up sonographic assessment showed a reduction in overall tendon thickness and {{in the size of the}} area of tendinosis (hypoechoic/anechoic areas within the proximal patellar tendon). A reduction was identified in interstitial tears within the tendon substance. Neovascularity did not reduce significantly or even increased.

40|$|Background: Jumper’s knee is {{relatively}} common among rugby players, {{and treatment of}} this condition {{is known to be}} difficult. Intra-tendinous revision surgery has shown poor results. New research on innervation patterns, and a new US+DP-guided treatment method targeting the regions with vessels and nerves outside the tendon has shown promising results in patients with Jumper’s knee. Material: This study includes 12 patellar tendons from 9 professional rugby players (mean age 26 years) with a long duration (range 12 - 72 months) of pain from the proximal patellar tendon. For 3 tendons there was previously intra-tendinous revision surgery with a poor result. Method: Treatment with Ultrasound (US) and Doppler (DP) -guided arthro-scopic shaving + open scraping, followed by immediate weight bearing and gradually increased loading up to full loading after 6 - 8 weeks, was performed. Results: For 9 tendons there was a good clinical result, and all returned to full professional rugby within 4 - 6 months. The <b>mean</b> <b>VISA</b> score increased from 49 to 78 (p < 0. 05). Follow-ups (range 10 - 30 months) show remaining good results. For 3 tendons, all have had previous intra-tendinous revision surgery, the clinical results were poor and they couldn’t return to rugby.

40|$|Background: Chronic Achilles tendinosis is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} disorder often refractory to conservative man-agement. Our study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy {{of the use of}} autologous skin-derived collagen-producing cells in the treatment of refractory Achilles tendinosis. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind study on forty Achilles tendons in thirty-two patients (eight with bilateral involvement) who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of Achilles tendinosis. The patients ranged from twenty-two to sixty-seven years old and had amean age of 45. 2 years. The patients with unilateral involvement were randomized into the treatment group (twelve patients) and control group (twelve patients). The eight patients with bilateral involvement were individually randomized into treatment and control groups, with eight Achilles tendons in each group. Achilles tendons in the treatment group were injected under ultrasound guidance with laboratory-expanded, skin-derived fibroblasts suspended in autologous plasma. The control group received ultrasound-guided injection of a local anesthetic and physiotherapy. The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) questionnaire and visual analog scale (VAS) scores were used as the main outcome measures for both groups. Results: Significant differences in the <b>mean</b> <b>VISA</b> and VAS scores were detected between the treatment and the control groups for the patients with unilateral involvement at six months (p < 0. 001 for both).

40|$|The time is {{not only}} ripe but {{pressing}} for the EU and {{the states of the}} Western Balkans to recalibrate and reinforce the current pre-accession strategy. Trade policy should be moved beyond existing free trade commitments for all the Western Balkans to enter the customs union of the EU and Turkey. Eurozone doctrine should be adapted to realities. Rather than regarding the use of the euro by Montenegro and Kosovo as an unfortunate turn of events, {{the costs and benefits of}} unilateral adoption of the euro by not-yet member states of the region should be more openly appraised, and the option to ‘euroise’ recognised as a possibility. It is good that the EU has moved at the declaratory level towards <b>visa</b> ‘liberalisation’, which <b>means</b> scrapping <b>visas</b> rather than just ‘facilitation’ measures. However the Commission has not yet published guidelines or timelines for this. The region should be put on track for access to the Structural Funds on terms and scales progressively approaching those from which new member states such as Bulgaria and Romania already benefit. The ratio of these aid receipts between the new member states and the Western Balkans is currently 4 : 1; the former are receiving more than they can handle efficiently, whereas the Western Balkans have huge unsatisfied needs. Overall the case is made for significant moves towards ‘functional membership’ of the whole of the region with the EU, which would be a highly useful advance, irrespective of how or when the EU overcomes its Lisbon Treaty hiatus...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Extracorporeal {{shock wave}} therapy (SWT) is {{effective}} {{for the management}} of chronic recalcitrant tendinopathy. The objective of the current study was to assess whether a standardized, single treatment SWT is effective {{for the management of}} chronic patellar tendinopathy METHODS: Thirty-three patients with chronic patellar tendinopathy received low-energy SWT. Thirty-three patients with chronic patellar tendinopathy received other forms of non-operative therapy (control group). Evaluation was by change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Victoria Institute of Sport Assessment score for patellar tendinopathy (VISA-P) score and by Roles and Maudsley Score. RESULTS: Mean pre-treatment VAS scores for the control and SWT groups were 7. 5 and 7. 8, respectively. One month, 3 months, and 12 months after treatment, the mean VAS for the control and SWT groups were 6. 7 and 4. 3 (p < 0. 001), 5. 9 and 3. 5 (p < 0. 001), and 5. 1 and 2. 7 (p < 0. 001), respectively. One month, 3 months, and 12 months after treatment, the <b>mean</b> <b>VISA</b> for the control and SWT groups were 50. 7 and 65. 5 (p < 0. 001), 52. 1 and 71 (p < 0. 001), and 54. 9 and 74. 5 (p < 0. 001), respectively. At final follow-up, the number of excellent, good, fair, and poor results for the SWT and control groups were 8 and 3 (p < 0. 001), 17 and 10 (p < 0. 001), 5 and 16 (p < 0. 001), and 3 and 4 (p < 0. 001), respectively. The percentage of patients with excellent (" 1 ") or good (" 2 ") Roles and Maudsley Scores (i. e. successful results) 12 months after treatment was statistically greater in the SWT group compared to the control group (p < 0. 001).
