5|$|One of Ford's {{greatest}} challenges {{was dealing with}} the continued Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South <b>Vietnam,</b> <b>and</b> required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and,</b> like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.|$|E

5|$|The Cambodian–Vietnamese War was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} between the Socialist Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> Democratic Kampuchea. The war began with isolated clashes along the land and maritime boundaries of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> Kampuchea between 1975 and 1977, occasionally involving division-sized military formations. On 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country and removed the Khmer Rouge government from power.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{and other}} anti-communist {{countries}} fought against North <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> its communist allies during the Vietnam War {{in an attempt}} to prevent the communist takeover of South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and,</b> more broadly, to implement the United States' policy of containment {{to prevent the spread of}} communism.

5|$|The use of Agent Orange {{has been}} {{controversial}} in New Zealand, {{because of the}} exposure of New Zealand troops in <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> because of the production of Agent Orange for <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> other users at an Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, New Plymouth.

5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> North <b>Vietnam</b> <b>and</b> the Viet Cong. Despite a pledge of support from U.S. President Richard Nixon, military aid to South Vietnam was sharply reduced. By the end of 1972 the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of Vietnam Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid, flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance.|$|E
