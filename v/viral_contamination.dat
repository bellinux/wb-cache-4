40|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} are {{an important}} food source for living beings, humans included. They are obligated filter feeders, that feed on microalgae, bacteria and organic particles present in the aquatic environment. Accordingly, they could accumulate chemical compounds, marine biotoxins, bacteria and viruses, including human and animal pathogens (Molloy et al., 2013; Serratore et al., 2014), influencing the epidemiology of animal and human infectious diseases (Skär & Mortensen, 2007). This topic has been long investigated for human pathogens. On the other hand, poor studies were available for finfish pathogens. The Ph. D thesis, arranged in three chapters, deals with finfish and human pathogens in bivalve molluscs and focus on betanodavirus presence in these invertebrates, on their interaction with the Redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), one species of the genus Betanodavirus, {{and the development of}} a method to mitigate bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>contaminations</b> of bivalve molluscs. Betanodaviruses very closely related to those of finfish have been found widely present in bivalve molluscs. The clams were demonstrated able to take up and then shed viable RGNNV into the surrounding environment through faeces and filtered water into the surrounding environment posing a serious risk for susceptible cohabitant fish species. Finally, a novel Manila clam sea water potassium MPS-based disinfection method was set up to mitigate the impact of bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>contaminations</b> in bivalve molluscs. The obtained results point out the possible role of bivalve molluscs in the transmission of pathogens to finfish and highlight the needing of surveillance and control activities where a close inter-specific contact is present. The proposed novel disinfection method provides good experimental results and could find wide application in fisheries sector after adequate field tests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Contamination of {{vertebrate}} {{cell lines}} with animal retroviruses {{has been documented}} repeatedly before. Although such viral contaminants can be easily identified with high sensitivity by PCR, {{it is impossible to}} screen for all potential contaminants. Therefore, we explored two novel methods to identify <b>viral</b> <b>contaminations</b> in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant. Results The first hint for the presence of contaminating retroviruses in one of our cell lines was obtained by electron microscopy of exosome-like vesicles released from the supernatants of transfected 293 T cells. Random amplification of particle associated RNAs (PAN-PCR) from supernatant of contaminated 293 T cells and sequencing of the amplicons revealed several nucleotide sequences showing highest similarity to either murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis confirmed our findings, since we could identify several peptide sequences originating from monkey and murine retroviral proteins. Quantitative PCRs were established for both viruses to test currently cultured cell lines as well as liquid nitrogen frozen cell stocks. Gene fragments for both viruses could be detected in a broad range of permissive cell lines from multiple species. Furthermore, experimental infections of cells negative for these viruses showed that both viruses replicate rapidly to high loads. We decided to further analyze the genomic sequence of the MuLV-like contaminant virus. Surprisingly it was neither identical to MuLV nor to the novel xenotropic MuLV related retrovirus (XMRV) but showed 99 % identity to a synthetic retrovirus which was engineered in the 1980 s. Conclusion The high degree of nucleotide identity suggests unintended spread of a biosafety level 2 recombinant virus, which could also affect the risk assessment of gene-modified organisms released from contaminated cell cultures. The study further indicates that both mass spectrometry and PAN-PCR are powerful methods to identify <b>viral</b> <b>contaminations</b> in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant.

None of the cell lines were infected with HCV, HIV- 1, or HTLV-I/-II. However, one cell line displayed reverse transcriptase activity. Thirty-nine cell lines harbored EBV DNA sequences. Studies on the lytic phase of EBV revealed that five cell lines produce EBV particles and six further cell lines produced EBV upon stimulation. One cell line contained an integrated HBV genome fragment but showed no virus production. Six cell lines were SMRV-infected.

40|$|Abstract Two {{different}} irrigation systems, subsurface {{drip irrigation}} and furrow irrigation, are tested {{to investigate the}} level of <b>viral</b> <b>contamination</b> and survival when tertiary effluent is used in arid and semi-arid regions. The effluent was injected with bacteriophages of PRD 1 and MS 2. A greater number of PRD 1 and MS 2 were recovered from the lettuce in the subsurface drip-irrigated plots as compared {{to those in the}} furrow-irrigated plots. Shallow drip tape installation and preferential water paths through cracks on the soil surface appeared to be the main causes of high <b>viral</b> <b>contamination</b> in subsurface drip irrigation plots, which led to the direct contact of the lettuce stems with the irrigation water which penetrated the soil surface. The water use efficiency of the subsurface drip irrigation system was higher than that of the furrow irrigation system. Thus, subsurface drip irrigation is an efficient irrigation method for vegetable crops in arid and semi-arid regions if <b>viral</b> <b>contamination</b> can be reduced.

40|$|Medium is {{the most}} {{important}} item in cell culture. Each medium consists of two main parts which are a basal medium and serum. The main source of the serum is come from an animal blood. The serum from animal blood has many disadvantages such as <b>viral</b> <b>contaminations.</b> Moreover, serum is very expensive. Serum-free media is the best alternative in solving this problem. Unfortunately, serum-free medium is not sufficient for the cell growth. Thus, some supplements must be added to serum-free medium. One of the most important sources of supplements is from plants which could reduce the cost. In this study different plant protein hydrolysates from soy, sesame, Aloe vera, rice and wheat have been tested against Human Skin Fibroblast (HSF) 1184. All protein hydrolysates were prepared through enzymatic hydrolysis using commercial enzymes of non-animal origin. These hydrolysates were characterized according to their solubility and peptide size. Different growth behaviours of HSF 1184 cells were observed when these hydrolysates were added in DMEM with and without Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Hydrolysates from exopeptidase enzymes such as Flavourzyme gave negative effect on HSF 1184 cell culture, while hydrolysates from endopeptidase enzymes were supplementary for HSF 1184 cell culture. Since plant proteins do not have all the necessary amino acids for HSF 1184 cell culture growth, they cannot be solely substituted with FBS. Depending on the enzyme used, the supplementation with hydrolysates corresponding to a high degree of hydrolysis and composition of peptides with small molecular size, led to different maximal cell density. This indicates the importance of enzyme specificity and consequently the nature of the released peptides. In conclusion, the best plant protein hydrolysates for supplementation into the complete medium for HSF 1184 growth were soy and Aloe vera which were hydrolysed by Alcalase...|$|R

Initially, GTE at 0. 5 and 5 mg/ml were individually mixed with each virus at 5 log TCID 50 /ml and incubated 2 h at 37 °C at different pHs (from 5. 5 to 8. 5). GTE affected both viruses depending on pH with higher reductions observed in alkaline conditions. Secondly, different concentrations of GTE (0. 5 and 5 mg/ml) were mixed with viral suspensions and incubated for 2 or 16 h at 4, 25 and 37 °C at pH 7. 2. A concentration-, temperature- and exposure time-dependent response was showed by GTE in suspension tests, where complete inactivation was achieved after overnight exposure at 37 °C for both viruses and also at 25 °C for HAV. In addition, antiviral effect of GTE proved efficient in the surface disinfection tests since 1. 5 log reduction and complete inactivation were recorded for MNV and HAV on stainless steel and glass surfaces treated with 10 mg/ml GTE for 30 min, analyzed in accordance with ISO 13697 : 2001. GTE was also evaluated as a natural disinfectant of produce, showing 10 mg/ml GTE reduced MNV and HAV titers in lettuce and spinach by more than 1. 5 log after 30 min treatment.

The first, consisting mainly of oyster beds, was c 1 assified in category A, as determined by fecal coliform counts in shellfish (European Community Directive 91 / 492), and the second, a mussel bed, was c 1 assified in category C. Shelllish samples were collected monthly between August, 1995 and April, 1997, and RT-PCR was used to detect viruses known to be involved in {{outbreaks of}} gastroenteritis: enterovirus, human calicivirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus.

Each sample was concentrated by ultracentrifugation method. Qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR for RVA, NoV, and HAstV were performed. A wide dissemination of gastroenteric viruses was observed in the sewage samples analyzed with 80 % of positivity, being NoV (51 %) the most frequently detected followed by RVA with a frequency of 49 % and HAstV with 45 %. Genotypes of RVA were typed using multiplex semi-nested RT-PCR as follows: P[8] (n = 15), P[4] (n = 8), P[10] (n = 1), P[11] (n = 1), G 2 (n = 29), and G 3 (n = 2).

40|$|Products {{of human}} and animal origin (biologicals and pharmaceuticals) and {{drinking}} water pose unique health and safety problems, especially due to <b>viral</b> <b>contaminations,</b> and have traditionally been a key concern both for regulators and industrial operations. They have also {{proven to be a}} stumbling block for early product research and development and inexperienced small start-up firms. Membrane filtration, being non-invasive, non-destructive and a robust technique, {{is one of the most}} preferred choices for virus filtration with ultrafiltration being an efficient process for removing macromolecules, colloids, endotoxins, viruses, and bacteria. The challenge, in virus filtration, is to remove virus particles from products to close to zero levels especially in emerging water and heavily regulated multi-billion biopharmaceutical industries. In virus capture or clearance operations, the virus particles are distributed in the range of 15 nm - 300 nm depending upon their protein coat and family, hence it is critical to study impact of particle size in ultrafiltration. A number of previous studies have been concerned with particle characteristics and their relation to flux decline behavior. However the relationship between, on one hand, particle properties of the feed and operating parameters like transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate and on the other hand, the filtration efficiency (log reduction value), are still not adequately established. This thesis investigates the effect of feed particle size, transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate on the filtration efficiency for tangential flow ultrafiltration. An empirical model is developed to quantify the dependencies of the above said parameters. For this study, a cross flow ultrafiltration rig (built in-house) is used with 30 and 100 kDa polyether sulphone membranes for three different particle sizes of silica (model virus particles) at three different transmembrane pressures (20 - 60 kPa) and three cross flowrates (0. 3 - 1. 0 L/min). The investigation shows that among feed particle size, transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate, feed particle size and transmembrane pressure are significant parameters in controlling the filtration efficiency. In the studied experimental range, higher log reduction values are obtained at lower transmembrane pressure (20 kPa) and at higher cross flowrate (1 L/min). The experimental statistical analysis also gives an insight on the cross interactions of the feed particle size, transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate. It shows that the effect of transmembrane pressure and feed particle size seems to be more significant than that of the interaction of cross flowrate with feed particle size. The experimental investigations identified that feed particle size is one of the key influential factors on the filtration efficiency. Far less attention is given to this effect in the literature both experimentally and theoretically. This thesis attempts to fill this gap by developing a rigorous model formulation for tangential flow ultrafiltration to predict the evolution of particle size in the filtered stream. Population balance theory is employed to describe the population density of each particle size class in the output streams. In this formulation, the population balance equation is coupled with filtration kinetic constitutive relations and with mass balance equations and solved using discretisation method. The model predicts permeate particle size distribution and the log reduction value as primary model outputs. A novel approach in the form of optimization-based parameter estimation is employed to estimate filtration kinetic parameters. This approach which directly uses the population balance model, as well as particle size data, represents a stark deviation from previous filtration kinetic calculations that only utilize flux data and no models that describe the particle state. As such, this approach offers more comprehensive description of filtration kinetics incorporating the effects of particle size. The model is validated and is found to be in good agreement with experimental results. The model serves as a predictive tool for filtration efficiency and filtrate particle size distribution. Overall, this model-based prediction and estimation capability serves well and facilitates the design, operation and scale-up of ultrafiltration processes...|$|R

In recent times however, the mechanistic flexibility of RNA has emerged. It is now recognized as a powerful tool for rewiring biological circuits. In the present paper, combining a toehold-based design with STAR transcriptional activators resulted {{in the development of a}} flexible RNA-based sensing device. A colorimetric LacZ assay, in vivo fluorescence assay and a suite of molecular biology techniques demonstrated the sensing capability of the modified RNAs with a fold activation of 1. 5. This work provides direction for the development of high-performance flexible RNA sensors. The paper concludes with recommendations for future work in this area including RNA structural approaches and an exploration of in vitro, paper based circuitry. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|R
40|$|To {{find the}} most {{suitable}} indicator of <b>viral</b> and parasitic <b>contamination</b> of drinking water, large-volume samples were collected and analyzed {{for the presence of}} pathogens (cultivable human enteric viruses, Giardia lamblia cysts, and Cryptosporidium oocysts) and potential indicators (somatic and male-specific coliphages, Clostridium perfringens). The samples were obtained from three water treatment plants by using conventional or better treatments (ozonation, biological filtration). All samples of river water contained the microorganisms sought, and only C. perfringens counts were correlated with human enteric viruses, cysts, or oocysts. For settled and filtered water samples, all indicators were statistically correlated with human enteric viruses but not with cysts or oocysts. By using multiple regression, the somatic coliphage counts were the only explanatory variable for the human enteric virus counts in settled water, while in filtered water samples it was C. perfringens counts. Finished water samples of 1, 000 liters each were free of all microorganisms, except for a single sample that contained low levels of cysts and oocysts of undetermined viability. Three of nine finished water samples of 20, 000 liters each revealed residual levels of somatic coliphages at 0. 03, 0. 10, and 0. 26 per 100 liters. Measured virus removal was more than 4 to 5 log 10, and cyst removal was more than 4 log 10. Coliphage and C. perfringens counts suggested that the total removal and inactivation was more than 7 log 10 viable microorganisms. C. perfringens counts appear to be the most suitable indicator for the inactivation and removal of viruses in drinking water treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
