Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a <b>very</b> <b>reasonable</b> and fair man, even if I {{did not agree with}} him' and that they could talk problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|E

25|$|Taxi fares in Dallas {{compared}} to other large U.S. cities is <b>very</b> <b>reasonable.</b> The meter rate is $2.25 plus 20¢ every 1/9 mile.

Also, fares {{to and from the}} two principal airports (DFW International Airport and Dallas Love Field) to Downtown Dallas and the Dallas Market Center area are set at a flat rate. Those rates are: $41 for DFW to or from Downtown Dallas, $18 to or from Dallas Love Field to Downtown, and $32 to or from DFW International to Dallas Market Center. Be advised: a fuel surcharge may also be added to fares if gas prices reach $2.50 per gallon or more for three consecutive weeks. In an April 2011 study conducted by the Chicago Dispatcher, Dallas taxis charge an estimated $12.75 for a distance of five miles with five minutes wait time. Tipping is not required, but is a good gesture if you receive good service from the driver.|$|E

After Coke's death, however, his jurisprudence [...] "naturally suffered an eclipse", and its next appearance is in Godden v Hales, in 1686, where the doctrine was twisted {{to argue that}} the Crown had the prerogative to dismiss government laws. Plucknett notes that [...] "the Revolution of 1688 marks the abandonment of the doctrine of Bonham's Case", but in 1701, the common law judges cited Coke's decision with approval in City of London v Wood, with John Holt concluding that Coke's statement is [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>reasonable</b> and true saying". His position was to treat statutes {{in the same way as}} other documents for the purpose of judicial review and was followed for decades. Outside the judiciary, John Lilburne used Bonham's Case in his book The Legall Fundamentall Liberties of the People of England and then in his 1649 treason trial to justify his attack on the Rump Parliament.|$|E

He saw this as the game's largest {{improvement}} upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player might come up with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a problem with it due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E

Commonly observed failure of products during sintering are caused by a co-action of friction, gravity, material properties, powder properties, and construction design. As the MSU is an appliance for production of technical products only, {{it has to be}} <b>very</b> cost <b>reasonable.</b> That's why paper technique is most favored for manufacturing of multilayered MSU as described.
