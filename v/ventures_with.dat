5|$|Eidos's German {{branch and}} the KMF agency handled {{marketing}} for Lara Croft. Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant.

He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media <b>ventures</b> <b>with</b> its {{new version of the}} character.|$|E
