5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not <b>visible</b> <b>on</b> the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E

5|$|By 0900 UTC October 2, the eye {{started to}} become less defined. Based on this, {{the storm was}} {{downgraded}} into a category 3 hurricane. Although an eye was no longer <b>visible</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery, the storms had displayed very deep convection, thus the NHC initially maintained the intensity at 120mph (195km/h). Virgil's eye continued to become less defined, and was downgraded to Category 2 intensity {{at the time of}} landfall on October 4. It rapidly weakened over land, and was a dissipating tropical depression by the time it moved offshore.|$|E

Later, the town was created in film city, Mumbai. Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi, Lonavla, Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora.|$|E
