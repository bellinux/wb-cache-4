A Monte Carlo simulation is performed on de-Gennes’s effective magnetic Hamiltonian with classical spin approximation. The peaks of the specific heat as a function of temperature, which correspond to FM(AF) and canting transitions, and its {{response to}} the external magnetic field are consistent with the observation. For certain region of parameters, a more complex canting order than layer type is found at sufficiently low temperature.
