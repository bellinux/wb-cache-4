25|$|Macroscopically, the gas {{characteristics}} measured {{are either}} {{in terms of}} the gas particles themselves (<b>velocity,</b> <b>pressure,</b> or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied pneumatic chemistry for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the macroscopic properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube manometer which looks like a test tube {{in the shape of the}} letter J. Boyle trapped an inert gas in the closed end of the test tube with a column of mercury, thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an inverse relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the product was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.|$|E

2500|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of air around an object (often called a flow field) [...] enables the {{calculation}} of forces and moments acting on the object. [...] In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: lift, drag, thrust, and weight. [...] Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body. [...] Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon {{the assumption that the}} flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as flow <b>velocity,</b> <b>pressure,</b> density, and temperature, which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in air flows.

Firtstly, the plasma jet flow is supposed as steady state incompressible gas, which meets with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The model of the growth of convex diamond film considers different convex height of Mo substrate. The <b>velocity</b> and <b>pressure</b> field were simulated by CFD respectively. The simulational results show that, the distributions of <b>velocity</b> and <b>pressure</b> fields were fluctuant in reaction chamber. When convex height of Mo substrate was 9 mm, DC plasma jet was smoother than the other heights, thus, we predicts that diamond film easily grows. Meanwhile, we prepared four diamond films in different heights of substrate, by DCPJCVD. Raman spectra were used to investigate the quality of convex diamond film. It was found that, when the height of convex substrate was 9 mm, convex diamond film had only diamond characteristic peak. It is obvious that numerical analysis help us predict the distributions of <b>velocity</b> and <b>pressure</b> fields and synthesize high quality convex diamond film...|$|R
