40|$|The {{objectives}} of this advice are to analyse the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> activities in Belgium concerning animal and zoonotic diseases in animals and food, and {{to verify the}} suitability between these activities and national/international recommendations, {{in order to identify}} improvement pathways. an inventory was realized of the national and international, current and future, vertical (specific animal diseases) and horizontal (structural and organizational aspects of the surveillance activities) recommendations concerning <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> in animal health domains. This inventory was based, on a web search and on a SWOT analysis of the opinions of representatives and users of the Belgian epidemiosurveillance systems. An analysis of the differences between, in one hand, the organization of the existing systems and the typologies and, on the other hand, the recommendations concerning the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> identified in this chapter, allowed to identify gaps (needs) and to make recommendations to improve the system. The main recommendations concern: the amelioration of the communication between animal and public health authorities namely via the creation of a national <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> platform, the improvement of the coordination, the follow-up and the steering of the surveillance activities according to the objectives, the extension of the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> activities to other animal species, the responsabilisation and motivation of the stock breeders and veterinarians to stimulate their vigilance, increase their confidence in and their collaboration with the authorities, the organization of continuing education, etc...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Salmonella Typhimurium is {{the most}} {{dominant}} Salmonella serovar around the world. It is associated with foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks but has recently been associated with invasive illness and deaths. Characterization of S. Typhimurium is therefore very crucial for <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Phage typing {{has been used for}} decades for subtyping of S. Typhimurium to determine the epidemiological relation among isolates. Recent studies however have suggested that high throughput clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) typing has the potential to replace phage typing. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of highthroughput CRISPR typing over conventional phage typing in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> and outbreak investigation of S. Typhimurium. Results: In silico analysis of whole genome sequences (WGS) of well-documented phage types of S. Typhimurium reveals the presence of different CRISPR type among strains belong to the same phage type. Furthermore, different phage types of S. Typhimurium share identical CRISPR type. Interestingly, identical spacers were detected among outbreak and non-outbreak associated DT 8 strains of S. Typhimurium. Therefore, CRISPR typing is not useful for the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> and outbreak investigation of S. Typhimurium and phage typing, until it is replaced by WGS, is still the gold standard method for <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> of S. Typhimurium...|$|R

40|$|From 1994 through 1996, federal, state, {{and nongovernmental}} {{organizations}} in Mexico and in the United States of America developed and piloted a Binational Health Information System for <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>Surveillance</b> of Mexican migrant workers. The system allowed data exchange for <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> between the state of Guanajuato in Mexico and the Commonwealth (state) of Pennsylvania in the United States, for case detection, prevention, and treatment, through shared contact investigation and case management of communicable diseases. The target population consisted of migrant workers traveling between Guanajuato and Pennsylvania to work mainly in the mushroom industry, and their sexual partners in their Mexican communities of origin. Computerized migrant health information modules were set up in Guanajuato and in Pennsylvania. Patient information and <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> data were encrypted and communicated electronically between the modules, using the WONDER communications system of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Evaluation of the Guanajuato-Pennsylvania Binational Health Information System showed that major barriers to binational <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> and control are: a) lack of communication binationally; b) interrupted medical care due to migration; c) inconsistent diagnosis and treatment criteria between the two countries; d) lack of referral clinical records {{from one country to}} the other; and e) deficient legal regulations concerning binational clinical data transfer. To our knowledge, this is the first project that has successfully demonstrated the technological feasibility of a binational disease control system linking a state in the interior of one country with a state in the interior of another country, rather than just states in the border region. The project also advanced the understanding of health service organizational issues that facilitate or hinder communication, outreach, disease prevention, and organization of health care services for migrant workers in both Mexico and the United States. Despite the unprecedented success and potential bilateral benefits demonstrated by this project, serious structural and organizational deficits in the public health systems of both countries must be addressed before <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> can be achieved binationally...|$|R

40|$|Preventing {{transmission}} of virus {{is still the}} single intervention known as effective in limiting the spread of HIV infection. So, the <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> of HIV/AIDS is an important tool used by public health specialists in controlling epidemics. <b>Epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> is a continuous process of collecting, analysing, interpreting and disseminating data in order to plan, implement and assess public health interventions. The objectives of HIV/AIDS surveillance should be specific, measurable, transformed into actions, realistic, planned {{to be done in}} due time. The main methods used by HIV/AIDS surveillance in collecting the data are biological surveillance, behavioural surveillance, other sources of information. The main indicators recommended for any HIV/AIDS programme components include the fields of politics, condoms availability and quality, social stigmatus & discrimination, knowledge, vertical transmission, sex negotiation and attitude, sexual behaviour, especially in youngsters, injection with drugs, safe blood and derivatives, STI treatment and prevention, care and social support, social & health impact. Data collected by public health surveillance systems guide the responses to the events, measure and monitor the burden of the disease, assess public health politics, etc [...] Integrated approach in <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> takes into account, generally, the integration of all activities {{that have to do with}} <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> into a single service with multiple functions using the same structures, procedures and personnel.

40|$|Background: Typhoid fever {{continues}} to be a worldwide health problem, especially in developing countries. Effective <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> is needed to monitor the presence and spread of disease. Materials and Methods: Variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) was performed for Salmonella enterica serovar typhi by multiplex-PCR in 28 Nepalese isolates of sporadic typhoid fever. Results: From all 28 total isolates, we could identify 12 VNTR profiles among the isolates, signifying multiple variants in circulation within the region. Conclusion: The VNTR-based typing assay for serovar typhi isolates can be used during an outbreak of enteric fever. The typing could eventually form the basis of an effective <b>epidemiological</b> <b>surveillance</b> system for developing rational strategies to control typhoid fever.
