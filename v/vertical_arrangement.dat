5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia {{in his classic}} 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subgenus Banksia, and was divided into three sections. George placed Banksia coccinea in its own series—Banksia series Coccineae—within the section B.section Banksia on account of a unique combination of characters, namely the <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangement</b> of flowers on the spike, combined with the branched open habit, broad leaves and very small follicles. Members of the series Quercinae and five species within the series Spicigerae share the vertically aligned flowers, but do not wholly exhibit the other characters.|$|E

The updated concept had a greater emphasis on take-out/ready meals, some featuring food courts with Price Chopper's own in-house branded concepts, including Roasters (rotisserie; no relation to Kenny Rogers Roasters), Bella Roma (pizza), Coyote Joe's (tacos), and the Bagel Factory. Under the newer prototype, the aisles were also placed back in the traditional <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangement</b> at the request of many customers finding the former layout confusing.|$|E
25|$|Price Chopper was {{an early}} {{innovator}} in the conversion of conventional stores to superstores and combination (food and drug) units, as well as operating stores that are open 24 hours a day. The first Price Chopper opened in the late 1970s in Oneonta, NY followed by another in the early 1980s in Latham, New York, and then an even larger unit constructed in Queensbury, in 1986. The Super Centers, which were {{state of the art}} by 1980s standards, often featured full-service meat, seafood, and bakery departments, as well as pharmacies and banks (features new to supermarkets at the time). These units were also known for their unconventional layouts with aisles facing horizontally, or away from the cash registers, rather than the traditional <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the aisles facing the cash register area. Very few Price Chopper stores still retain this layout today. In the late 1980s Price Chopper changed its corporate logo. The aforementioned logo featured a morgan silver dollar like coin with an axe chopping into the coin. Women's advocates complained the logo promoted violence against women. Price chopper now features an axe cutting into a generic looking coin with no obverse image.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{in electricity}} markets. Vertically integrated wholesalers, {{or those with}} long-term contracts, have less incentive to raise wholesale prices when retail prices are determined beforehand. For three restructured markets, we simulate prices that define bounds on static oligopoly equilibria. Our findings suggest that <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> dramatically affect estimated market outcomes. Had regulators impeded <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> (as in California), our simulations imply vastly higher prices than observed and production inefficiencies costing over 45 percent of those production costs with <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements.</b> We conclude that horizontal market structure accurately predicts market performance only when accounting for vertical structure. (JEL L 11, L 13, and L 94) While rules concerning horizontal market structure {{form the basis of}} antitrust policies in most countries, it is widely recognized that horizontal structure comprises only one piece 1 2 of the competition puzzle.

Some believe these arrangements are the beef industry’s answer to a long-term decline in beef demand, unclear price signals, and lack of adequate profitability. Some industry participants are looking at alliances as the quick solution for increased returns and higher prices. Others believe alliances contribute further to industry problems, especially captive supplies. This fact sheet discusses some of the motivations and characteristics for these arrangements, and presents {{what is known about}} their growth and development. Strategic Alliances and Vertical Coordination Vertical coordination encompasses many broad and varied methods of harmonizing or synchronizing farm-level supplies with retail-level demand. Vertical coordination via market prices with no attribute information is at one extreme of a continuum of vertical coordination methods, while vertical integration is at the other extreme. Between the two extremes are numerous <b>vertical</b> cooperation <b>arrangements,</b> including various types of contracts, joint ventures, cooperatives, partnerships, and alliances. Vertical cooperation is defined as the relationship between individual firms or organizations in two or more adjacent stages of the production-marketing channel without full ownership or control by individual firms (den Ouden et al.). This broad but useful definition seems applicable to <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the beef industry. In essence, vertical cooperation participants or partners fundamentally maintain their independence but share information to more effectively price products and improve the flow of products and information among the vertical production-marketing stages. This definition generally describes many of the alliances and <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the beef industry even though some organizations do not classify themselves as a strategic alliance. They might use cooperative, partnership, program, or another term to describe their organizational structure and operation. The term “strategic alliance ” is used here in a broad sense to encompass many types of <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the importance of}} market characteristics in restructured electricity markets. We measure market performance relative to benchmarks that abstract away from market design characteristics but capture important structural elements. Specifically, we estimate market outcomes under an assumption of perfect competition and under an assumption of Cournot competition in three U. S. markets: California, New England, and PJM. These two counter-factual assumptions bound the space of possible static, non-cooperative outcomes. By establishing where actual market outcomes fall within these bounds, we can compare how markets perform relative to the extremes determined by structural factors alone. Our findings suggest that <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> between suppliers and retailers dramatically affect estimated market outcomes. When we include <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> in firms' objective functions, Cournot equilibrium prices in both PJM and New England fall dramatically. California did not have such arrangements. After accounting for vertical arranegments, performance in each market relative to Cournot is similar, particularly during hours of peak demand...|$|R

The previous problems of tube expansion were still a theoretical concern and so the tubes were either curved, or even convoluted into hairpins and S shapes, so as to increase heating area. In practice these shapes gave rise to two more practical problems: difficulty in cleaning the tubes and also difficulty in forming a reliable joint into the water drums, particularly where tubes entered the drum {{at a variety of}} angles.|$|E

40|$|While rules {{concerning}} horizontal {{market structure}} {{form the basis}} of antitrust policies in most countries, it is widely recognized that horizontal structure comprises only one piece of the competition puzzle. Vertical integration and other <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> between wholesal-ers and retailers will also {{have an impact on the}} incentives of firms. In addition, regulators and many economists have focused on the effects that market rules, such as auction design, may have on equilibrium prices. This paper empirically examines the relative importance of horizontal market structure and <b>vertical</b> <b>arrangements</b> in determining prices in imperfectly competitive markets. We study three US electricity markets: California, New England, and the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (PJM) market. These were the first three US markets to undergo regulatory restructuring. There is substantial evidence that the California market was the least competitive. Previous studies do not, however, address why there were apparent differences in the competi-tiveness of these markets. Events like the California electricity crisis have contributed to a perception that electricity markets are fundamentally different from other commodity markets. The complexity of market rules, as well as processes for the production and delivery of electricity, have added weight to this argument. Our results demonstrate that, in fact, fundamental concepts of oligopoly competi-tion do apply to, and are significantly informative about, the restructured electricity industry. I...|$|R
