40|$|ABSTRACT: Survivability {{assessments}} and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reductions</b> are required in warship design. A warship’s survivability is assessed by its susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability. In this paper, an integrated survivability assessment for a warship subjected to multiple hits is introduced. The methodology aims at integrating a survivability assessment into {{an early stage}} of warship design. The hull surface is idealized using typical geometries for RCS (Radar Cross Section) detection probability and susceptibility. The Vulnerability is evaluated by using the shot-line. The recoverability is estimated using a survival time analysis. This enables the variation of survivability to be assessed. Several parameters may be varied to determine their effects on the survivability. The susceptibility is assessed by the probability of detecting the radar cross section of the subject and the probability of being hit based on a probability density function. The vulnerability is assessed by the kill probability based on the vulnerable area of critical components, according to the component’s layout and redundancy. Recoverability is assessed by the recovery time fo...|$|R

Viable disaster risk reduction measures should resolve the root causes of predisaster vulnerabilities. Accordingly, we investigated the recovery from the impact of Cyclone Aila in Koyra Upazila, Bangladesh, which was severely damaged by this 2009 cyclone. Our research focused on understanding pre-Aila vulnerabilities to cyclone impact and examined the degree of inclusion of <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction</b> measures within the recovery process. A composite methodology that included an institutional survey, key informant interviews, collection of the judgment of experts, focus group discussions, and a score-based quantification technique was adopted. Through a process of understanding pre-Aila vulnerabilities, recognition of the root causes of these inherent weaknesses, and identification of appropriate measures for pre-Aila <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction,</b> a set of 23 indicators were selected to represent the most desirable <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction</b> measures to implement during recovery. A score-based technique was applied to measure the degree of inclusion of <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction</b> within the recovery with respect to the indicators. The scoring result shows that the degree of inclusion of <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction</b> within the recovery was poor. The result specifies that among the 23 indicators of potential <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction</b> measures, 10 are completely missing and the rest are only partially included. The overall findings imply that the Koyra community continues to live with a vulnerability {{similar to that of the}} pre-Aila period.|$|E

Therefore, in this PhD research, a social epidemiological approach was opted to study the influence of contextual and mediating factors on HIV-related risk behaviors of wives of Nepalese labor migrants.

(b) Should HIV prevention interventions only target labor migrant couples? (c) How and under what circumstances do HIV stigma reduction interventions influence HIV test uptake? (d) How does the local context have an impact on HIV disclosure?

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of poverty in}} Indonesia are becoming more complex, resulting in such conditions that the old approaches to poverty reduction through targeted programs run by individual institutions are no longer adequate. This is because the poor population has decreased and is now more difficult to identify. To make things worse, there has a growing population of both economically and socially vulnerable people. To overcome poverty and vulnerability with the new characteristics, the strengthening of the old approach, is required, i. e., mainstreaming poverty and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction</b> into government and nongovernment (NGOs, the corporate world, donors, etc.) policies and programs. Mainstreaming poverty and <b>vulnerability</b> <b>reduction</b> (MPVR) involves {{taking into account the}} implications for poverty and vulnerability of any of the government 2 ̆ 7 s policies and programs.

However in several developing countries asset distribution tends to be highly skewed. Taking into account these elements, this paper proposes a model considering an economy polarized into two classes (the rich and the poor) and characterized by the following stylized facts: income and productivity of the rural poor is highly dependent on natural resources; labour remuneration in rural sector represents the opportunity cost for wage labour; the rich can partially substitute natural capital with physical capital accumulation and wage labour employment. In this context, agents differ for feed back mechanisms and interactions between their choices of production and environmental dynamics. Moreover environmental depletion may trigger economic transition, but the structural change is likely to result regressive. structural change, environmental externalities, economic development, poverty alleviation. ...|$|R

These may be either time-related capture zones or catchments related to the activity of a pumping well or spring. The establishment of such zones is an indispensable measure for the proper assessment of groundwater resource <b>vulnerability</b> and <b>reduction</b> of risk, which may be induced by human activities. The delineation of these protection zones is usually performed {{with the aid of}} models, which are in turn based on site-specific information of the aquifer’s geometry, hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions. Owing to the imperfect knowledge of such information, predicting the location of these zones is inherently uncertain. It is possible to quantify this uncertainty in a statistical manner through the development of probability maps, which shows the probability that a particular surface location belongs to the aquifer’s capture zone (or catchment area). This publication aims at the investigation of the requirements for the establishment of probabilistic source protection zones, the practical use of stochastic methods in their delineation, and the use of data-assimilation for uncertainty reduction. It also provides a methodology for the implementation of these methods by modelling practitioners...|$|R
