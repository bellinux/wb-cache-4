2500|$|Lateralus emerged after a {{four-year}} legal dispute with Tool's label, Volcano Entertainment. In January 2001, the band announced that their new album's title would be Systema Encéphale {{and provided a}} 12-song track list with titles such as [...] "Riverchrist", [...] "Numbereft", [...] "Encephatalis", [...] "Musick", and [...] "Coeliacus". File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to the negative impact on artists that are dependent on success in record sales to continue their career. Keenan {{had this to say}} during an interview with NY Rock in 2000: [...] "I {{think there are a lot}} of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs." [...] A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus (supposedly a portmanteau of the leg muscle <b>Vastus</b> <b>lateralis</b> and the term lateral thinking) and that the name Systema Encéphale and the track list had been a ruse.|$|E

40|$|Background: The hip abductors (HAB), {{quadriceps}} (Q) and hamstrings (H) reciprocal strength ratios are {{predictors of}} electromyography (EMG) amplitude during load carrying walking at moderate intensity. Therefore, these strength ratios might predict also the EMG during the exercises as walking lunge (WL) or split squat (SSq) at submaximal intensity. Objective: To {{determine whether the}} EMG amplitude of vastus mediali (VM), <b>vastus</b> <b>laterali</b> (VL), biceps femoris (BF) and gluteus medius (Gmed) is associated with muscle strength ratio during SSqs and WLs. To determine whether the EMG amplitude differs between individuals with HAB/H ratio above and below one and between individuals with H/Q or HAB/Q ratio above and below 0. 5 during SSqs and WLs. Methods: 17 resistance-trained men (age 29. 6 &# 8239;&# 177;&# 8239; 4. 6 &# 8239;years) with at least 3 &# 8239;years of strength training performed in cross-sectional design 5 &# 8239;s maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) on an isokinetic dynamometer for knee extension, knee flexion, and hip abduction. The MVIC was used to normalize the EMG signal and estimate the individual strength ratios. Than participants performed WL and SSq for a 5 repetition maximum, to find out muscle activity at submaximal intensity of exercise. Results: The H/Q ratio was associated by Kendall's tau (&# 964;) with VM (&# 964;&# 8239;=&# 8239;. 33) and BF (&# 964;&# 8239;=&# 8239;-. 71) amplitude, HAB/Q ratio was associated with BF (&# 964;&# 8239;=&# 8239;-. 43) and Gmed (&# 964; =&# 8239;. 38) amplitude, as well as HAB/H was associated with VM (&# 964;&# 8239;=&# 8239;-. 41) and Gmed (&# 964;&# 8239;=&# 8239;. 74) amplitude. ANOVA results showed significant differences between SSq and WL (F(4, 79) &# 8239;=&# 8239; 10, p&# 8239;&# 8239; 0. 5 showed higher VMO amplitude and lower Gmed amplitude. Furthermore, {{significant difference was found}} for HAB/H groups (F(4, 29) &# 8239;=&# 8239; 4, p&# 8239;=&# 8239;. 02, &# 951; p 2 &# 8239;=&# 8239;. 34) in VM amplitude, where group with HAB/H&# 8239;<&# 8239; 1 showed higher VM amplitude. Conclusions: The ratios of HAB, H and Q are able to predict Gmed, VM and BF activity during WL and SSq. WL resulted in higher activity level of Gmed than SSq, because WL includes the impact forces as part of lunge movement. WL should be used in resistance-training programme, if the strengthening of Gmed or VM is the aim...|$|R

Fourteen severely obese patients (body mass index, BMI, mean±SD: 44. 9 ± 6. 3 kg/m(2)) and fourteen healthy controls (BMI: 23. 7 ± 2. 5 kg/m(2)) were studied. The <b>vastus</b> medialis and <b>lateralis</b> of the dominant thigh were concurrently investigated during voluntary isometric contractions (10 -s long at submaximal and maximal intensities and intermittent submaximal contractions until exhaustion) and sustained (120 -s long) electrically elicited contractions. We found that the detection of surface EMG signals from the quadriceps is feasible also in severely obese subjects presenting increased thickness of the subcutaneous fat tissue. In addition, we confirmed and extended previous findings showing that the volume conductor properties determine the amplitude and spectral features of the detected surface EMG signals: the lower the subcutaneous tissue thickness, the higher the amplitude and mean frequency estimates.

Methods Forty subjects with clinically diagnosed PFPS and forty healthy males matching in age, weight, height and level of sport activity were enrolled in the study. Subjects were asked to walk on an instrumented walking path at their selfselected speed. Force platform and motion tracking system were used for the analysis of the gait. Wireless surface EMG probes were used to evaluate quadriceps muscles activity. Rectus femoris, <b>vastus</b> medialis and <b>lateralis</b> activity percentage, onset and offset time, walking speed, cadence, step length, stride length, knee ROM during gait were measured and reported. Tegner activity questionnaire was reported. Results Patient group showed a significant increasing in all quadriceps muscles activity when compared to the control (p < 0. 05). In particular, for VM and VL muscle onset time was anticipated and offset time was postponed in PFPS group when compared with healthy group (p < 0. 05). Knee range of motion during walking was significantly decreased in the patient group.

40|$|Increased intraarticular {{hydrostatic}} pressure (Pia) may inhibit juxtaarticular muscle function, obstruct blood supply to joint structures and promote anoxic joint destruction in chronic arthritis. Joint capsular stiffness together with synovial fluid volume determines Pia at rest. Seventeen knee joints with effusive arthritis and {{different degrees of}} radiological cartilage involvement in 13 patients with chronic arthritis were examined. Since capsular elastance was difficult to standardize, we introduce a measure of joint capsular stiffness where the intraarticular volume yielding a pressure of 50 mm Hg (V 50) is used. After normalization of injected volumes according to the V 50, pressure volume curves became similar. Intraarticular {{hydrostatic pressure}} and maximal voluntary isometric extensor torque were measured simultaneously, while altering the intraarticular fluid volume in 9 knee joints. In 5 of these, quantified electromyography (EMG) of the <b>vastus</b> medialis and <b>lateralis</b> portion of the quadriceps muscle was also monitored. Progressive inhibition of extensor torque and EMG was found as the intraarticular pressure volume was increased in both intact and destroyed joints. No difference in inhibition was found for the 2 portions of quadriceps muscle tested. Increased intraarticular hydrostatic pressure Pia levels between 200 and 1150 mm Hg were observed during maximal voluntary activation of extensor muscles. The reproducibility was good for all variables studied. In a few instances evidence of intraarticular compartmentalization was found at low volumes. We conclude that the V 50 is a convenient expression of capsular stiffness. Furthermore, increasing Pia caused by joint effusion inhibits knee extensor muscle function and impairs synovial blood flow.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate surface lectromyography (sEMG) activity patterns during robot-assisted gait training (with and without motivating instructions from a therapist) and unassisted treadmill walking and to compare these with physiological sEMG patterns. METHODS: Nine children with motor impairments and eight healthy children walked in various conditions: (a) on a treadmill in the driven gait orthosis Lokomat®, (b) same condition, with additional motivational instructions from a therapist, and (c) on the treadmill without assistance. sEMG recordings were made of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius <b>lateralis,</b> <b>vastus</b> medialis, and biceps femoris muscles. Differences in sEMG amplitudes between the three conditions were analyzed for the duration of stance and swing phase (for each group and muscle separately) using non-parametric tests. Spearman's correlation coefficients illustrated similarity of muscle activation patterns between conditions, between groups, and with published reference trajectories. RESULTS: The relative duration of stance and swing phase differed between patients and controls, and between driven gait orthosis conditions and treadmill walking. While sEMG amplitudes were higher when being encouraged by a therapist compared to robot-assisted gait training without instructions (0. 008 [*]≤[*]p-value[*]≤[*] 0. 015), muscle activation patterns were highly comparable (0. 648 [*]≤[*]Spearman correlation coefficients[*]≤[*] 0. 969). In general, comparisons of the sEMG patterns with published reference data of over-ground walking revealed that walking in the driven gait orthosis could induce more physiological muscle activation patterns compared to unsupported treadmill walking. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that robotic-assisted gait training with therapeutic encouragement could appropriately increase muscle activity. Robotic-assisted gait training in general could induce physiological muscle activation patterns, which might indicate that this training exploits restorative rather than compensatory mechanisms...|$|R

Surface Electromyography (SEMG) is an approach {{for evaluation of}} muscle activities and onset time during different functions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to use SEMG for detection of central motor control in different functions of knee extensor muscles. Materials and Methods: Ten healthy subjects contributed in this study. They were done five repetitions of knee flexion/extension in open and close chain separately during recording of SEMG simultaneously. Integrated EMG (iEMG) of three middle repeated cycles were detected according to chain (open- close) and kind of contraction (concentric- eccentric). then the Average of three slope of iEMG compared to each other. Results: There were not significant differences in MUR of three extensor muscles for concentric and eccentric contractions in open chain but <b>vastus</b> medialis and <b>lateralis</b> muscles showed significant changes in close chain (P< 0. 05). Result showed that there were significant differences of MUR for two kind of muscle contractions between open and close chains (P< 0. 05. Conclusion: Recruitment of motor units has not shown difference in open chain between concentric and eccentric contractions. This process indicates representative similarity of control pattern in two kind of contraction in open chain. Concentric contraction at close chain cycle has more MUR in comparison with eccentric contraction. It is equal to more interference of contractible compartment in concentric to eccentric contraction. This happens due to the nature of two kind of contraction particularly in close chain cycle. Comparison between two chains indicated that more motor units contribute in close chain (concentric and eccentric).

We determined whether muscle recruitment timing could {{be inferred from}} MRI-measured transverse relaxation time constant (T 2) changes and a cycle ergometer modified to vary power {{as a function of}} pedal angle. Six subjects performed 6 min of single-leg cycling under two conditions (E 0 °- 230 ° and E 90 °- 230 °), which increased the power from 0 °- 230 ° and 90 – 230 ° of the pedal cycle, respectively. The difference condition produced a virtual power output from 0 – 180 ° (V 0 °- 180 °). Recruitment was assessed by integrating EMG over the pedal cycle (IEMG) and as the (post-pre) exercise T 2 change (ΔT 2). For E 0 °- 230 °, the mean IEMG for <b>vastus</b> medialis and <b>lateralis</b> (VM/VL; 49. 3 ± 3. 9 mV·s; mean ± SE) was greater (P 0. 05); the corresponding ΔT 2 values were 0. 9 ± 0. 9 and 1. 5 ± 0. 9 ms (P > 0. 05).

40|$|The neural command from motor neurons to muscles — {{sometimes}} referred to as the neural drive to muscle — can be identified by decomposition of electromyographic (EMG) signals. This approach can be used for inferring the voluntary commands in neural interfaces in patients with limb amputations. This paper proposes for the first time an innovative method for fully automatic and real-time intramuscular EMG (iEMG) decomposition. The method is based on online single-pass density-based clustering and adaptive classification of bivariate features, using the concept of potential measure. No attempt was made to resolve superimposed motor unit action potentials. The proposed algorithm was validated on sets of simulated and experimental iEMG signals. Signals were recorded from the biceps femoris long-head, <b>vastus</b> medialis and <b>lateralis</b> and tibialis anterior muscles during low-to-moderate isometric constant-force and linearly-varying force contractions. The average number of missed, duplicated and erroneous clusters for the examined signals was 0. 5 ± 0. 8, 1. 2 ± 1. 0, and 1. 0 ± 0. 8, respectively. The average decomposition accuracy (defined similar to signal detection theory but without using True Negatives in the denominator) and coefficient of determination (variance accounted for) for the cumulative discharge rate estimation were 70 ± 9 %, and 94 ± 5 %, respectively. The time cost for processing each 200 ms iEMG interval was 43 ± 16 (21 – 97) ms. However, computational time generally increases over time as a function of frames/signal epochs. Meanwhile, the incremental accuracy defined as the accuracy of real-time analysis of each signal epoch, was 74 ± 18 % for epochs recorded after initial one second. The proposed algorithm is thus a promising new tool for neural decoding in the next-generation of prosthetic control...|$|R

Ten male subjects performed a 6 -min cycling test at 50 % {{of the difference between}} the gas exchange threshold and [Formula: see text]O(2 peak) (Δ 50). Then, the subjects performed two MSEs of 6 × 6 s separated by two intersprint recoveries of 30 s (MSE(30)) and 180 s (MSE(180)), followed 10 min later by the Δ 50 (Δ 50 (30) and Δ 50 (180), respectively). Electromyography (EMG) activities of the <b>vastus</b> medialis and <b>lateralis</b> were measured throughout each exercise bout. During MSE(30), muscle activity (root mean square) increased significantly (p ≤ 0. 04), with a significant leftward-shifted median frequency of the power density spectrum (MDF; p ≤ 0. 01), whereas MDF was significantly rightward-shifted during MSE(180) (p = 0. 02). The mean [Formula: see text]O(2) value was significantly higher in MSE(30) than in MSE(180) (p < 0. 001). During Δ 50 (30), [Formula: see text]O(2) and the deoxygenated hemoglobin ([HHb]) slow components were significantly reduced (- 27 %, p = 0. 02, and - 34 %, p = 0. 003, respectively) compared with Δ 50.
