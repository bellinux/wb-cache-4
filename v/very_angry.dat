5|$|A mutant who is {{friends with}} Bobby and Rogue, Pyro has anti-social tendencies {{because he is}} <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> at the general public for how they treat the mutant community. He {{has the ability to}} control (although not create) fire. He later joins Magneto and Mystique. The filmmakers cast Stanford in the role after they were {{impressed}} with his performance in Tadpole.|$|E
5|$|I {{am afraid}} my {{men will be}} <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> when they see it. I cannot {{understand}} why the old man cannot do justice to those to whom he owed so much {{and the whole thing}} is so absolutely inconsistent with what he had already cabled.|$|E
5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack and feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, <b>very,</b> <b>angry.</b> Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E
60|$|Louis {{interrupted}} me; it {{was unlike}} him. His little gesture {{showed that he}} was <b>very</b> nearly <b>angry.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "He wasn't so <b>very</b> angry,--only <b>angry.</b> I {{was obliged}} to tell him; but I said as little to him as {{possible}} because he is ill. Somebody else made herself disagreeable." ...|$|R
60|$|Madame Staubach was <b>very</b> nearly <b>angry,</b> but she {{reminded}} herself that people cannot be crushed by rose-leaves. Peter Steinmarc was to be taken, because he was Peter Steinmarc, {{not because he was}} somebody very different, better mannered, and more agreeable.|$|R
5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E
25|$|The Opposition were <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> with Sir I.Coffin, who, {{with the}} candour of a novice, had made himself {{informed}} of {{the facts of the}} petition, and finding they were against his friends, said so in the House.|$|E
25|$|Herkja, one of Atli's former concubines, {{was serving}} as a maid at his court. She {{reported}} to Atli {{that she had seen}} Guðrún together with King Þjóðrekr, which made Atli <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> He approached Guðrún and she asked him what was the matter.|$|E
60|$|Philip's face, as {{he stood}} looking after her, was not {{pleasant}} to see; it was <b>very</b> hard and <b>angry.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{wondered}} how the colonel would take it, when {{he went up to}} say who he was. He did not think he would be <b>very</b> seriously <b>angry,</b> though probably he would wig him sharply. At any rate he had not done badly, and had brought no discredit to the regiment.|$|R
50|$|Nadia (Mariam Ansari): The {{older sister}} of Sadia and Hareem. She used to dislike Hareem. She becomes <b>angry</b> <b>very</b> quickly {{and has a}} sharp tongue.|$|R
25|$|Armand Călinescu {{allowed the}} Polish Government and civilians to {{take refuge in}} Romania and also ordered Romanian trains {{to be sent to}} Poland to {{evacuate}} Polish national treasures, which were sent to England from the Romanian port of Constanţa, an action which made the Nazis <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> with the Romanian Government.|$|E
25|$|The murder {{appears to}} have been {{motivated}} by Phillips's fear of his abusive and alcoholic father, who would have been <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> had he found Maddie inside their house. Phillips stated on the TV program Too Young to Kill: 15 Shocking Crimes that if he could take it back, he would, subsequently breaking down into tears.|$|E
25|$|When King Harald Fairhair {{arrived at}} Tønsberg (in Viken, {{and at the}} time a trading town) from Trondheim, he learnt of this and became <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> He {{assembled}} the ting at Fold and accused the people of treason, after which some had to accept his rule, while others were punished. He then spent the summer forcing Viken and Raumarike to accept his rule.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} spoke to his companions. Louise saw at once that they were protesting vigorously. She saw, too, that Von Behrling only became more obstinate {{and that he was}} <b>very</b> nearly <b>angry.</b> She moved a few steps on down the corridor, and stood looking out of the window. He joined her almost immediately.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{tell him}} exactly what I saw,--and Ada. I saw,--we saw,--that {{when the news}} came about the flood, you were {{conscious}} of it all. If you will go to father and tell him the truth he will be but <b>very</b> little <b>angry</b> with you. I don't suppose you {{had a hand in}} it yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Little Ron (Mike Edmonds): a very <b>very</b> short, insanely <b>angry</b> {{and violent}} Merry Man. Known {{to face the}} wrong way in ambushes. A parody of Little John.|$|R
25|$|The gods were <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> {{over the}} {{destruction}} of their temples and other sacrilegious acts by the Achaeans, and decided that most would not return home. A storm fell on the returning fleet off Tenos island. Additionally, Nauplius, in revenge {{for the murder of}} his son Palamedes, set up false lights in Cape Caphereus (also known today as Cavo D'Oro, in Euboea) and many were shipwrecked.|$|E
25|$|Patience: A {{measure of}} one's {{response}} to anger and aggravation. Individuals who score high on this facet {{tend to be}} able to tolerate very high levels of anger and maintain their composure while expressing anger. Those who score low on Patience have difficulties remaining calm while expressing their anger and tend to have quick tempers, becoming <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> in response to comparatively little provocation.|$|E
25|$|But {{though the}} message was brought fast and with ease, the heroes were not to return this way. The Gods were <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> over the {{destruction}} of their temples and other sacrilegious acts by the Achaeans and decided that most would not return. A storm fell on the returning fleet off Tenos island. Also Nauplius, in revenge {{for the murder of}} his son Palamedes by Odysseus, set up false lights in Cape Caphereus (also known today as Cavo D'Oro, on Euboea) and many were shipwrecked.|$|E
6000|$|But Drexley was silent. He was {{thinking}} then of her proteges. Had they, after all, been such brilliant successes? One or two were doing fairly well, from a pecuniary point of view--but there were others! She read his thought, and a faint spot of colour burned {{for a moment}} on her cheek. She was <b>very</b> nearly <b>angry.</b> What a bear, a brute! ...|$|R
50|$|With {{everything}} going on, Isabel gets <b>very</b> upset and <b>Angry.</b> She uses her powers {{in her room}} and unknown to her that there is actually a secret camera, hidden by her parents.|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{great deal}} in this that made the Doctor <b>very</b> angry,--so <b>angry</b> {{that he did not know}} how to {{restrain}} himself. The matter had been argued as though he had employed the clergyman in his church after he had known the history. [...] "For aught I know," [...] he said to Mrs. Wortle, [...] "any curate coming to me might have three wives, all alive." ...|$|R
25|$|However, {{his success}} was short-lived. On 1 September 1421 John {{concluded}} a treaty with Ocko tom Brok {{and the city}} of Groningen, in which they divided the Frisian territories among themselves: John of Bavaria got Oostergo and Westergo, while Ocko tom Brok and Groningen got all the territories east of the Lauwers river. When this came out, it made a lot of people <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> The Schieringers felt betrayed, especially those exiles who hoped to return to lands John had now, in effect, given away.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the port}} of Monterey, her captain was {{supplied}} with wood and water. When ready to sail he asked permission of Governor Borica to land eleven English sailors who had secretly boarded his vessel at Botany Bay, Australia. The Governor refused his consent. It {{was a violation of}} Spanish law to land any foreigners. The shrewd Yankee captain, however, that night forced the sailors at the point of a pistol to go ashore. He then speedily put to sea. Borica was <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> Making the best of the situation, however, he put the men to work as carpenters and blacksmiths.|$|E
25|$|And the captain-general {{wished to}} {{approach}} the largest of these three islands to replenish his provisions. But it was not possible, {{for the people of}} those islands entered the ships and robbed us so that we could not protect ourselves from them. And when we wished to strike and take in the sails so as to land, they stole very quickly the small boat called a skiff which was fastened to the poop of the captain's ship. At which he, being <b>very</b> <b>angry,</b> went ashore with forty armed men. And burning some forty or fifty houses with several boats and killing seven men of the said island, they recovered their skiff.|$|E
5000|$|Things go {{completely}} out of control one night soon after as a small-time thief, accused of stealing a small radio, is brought into custody. Anant is <b>very</b> drunk, <b>angry</b> and frustrated. He delivers a shocking and brutal beating to the thief - while continuing to drink - accusing him of [...] "stealing the legitimate Rights of Others" [...] {trans.: [...] "Doosron ka haq churata hai, sala!"}.|$|R
50|$|Maurice: The {{husband of}} Tess' aunt. Maurice {{is a former}} Switcher, {{although}} this fact is only revealed {{toward the end of}} the book. He owns a farm in Clare, and becomes <b>angry</b> <b>very</b> easily.|$|R
60|$|But {{what kind}} of person must he be, thought they, who sent the flood? Surely a <b>very</b> dark, terrible, <b>angry</b> God, who was easily and {{suddenly}} provoked to drown their cattle and flood their lands.|$|R
25|$|The Devi Mahatmyam {{describes}} a storied battle {{between good and}} evil, where the Devi manifesting as goddess Durga leads the forces of good against the demon Mahishasura—the goddess is <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> and ruthless, and the forces of good win. In peaceful prosperous times, states the text, the Devi manifests as Lakshmi, empowering wealth creation and happiness. The verses of this story also outline a philosophical foundation wherein the ultimate reality (Brahman in Hinduism) is female. The text {{is one of the}} earliest extant complete manuscripts from the Hindu traditions which describes reverence and worship of the feminine aspect of God. The Devi Mahatmya is often ranked in some Hindu traditions to be as important as the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
25|$|Once, while Parvati {{wanted to}} take a bath, there were no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally {{entering}} the house. Hence she created an image of a boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body, and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper and severed the boy's head with his trident. When Parvati came out and saw her son's lifeless body, she was <b>very</b> <b>angry.</b> She demanded that Shiva restore Ganesha's life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant's head to Ganesha's body, thus giving rise to the elephant headed deity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of only the second day, a {{rebellion}} broke out among the volunteer prisoners. They ripped off their uniforms and locked themselves in their cells by pushing their beds up against the door. In response to this, the guards became <b>very</b> <b>angry</b> and called for backup. This surprised Zimbardo {{as well as the}} rest of the psychologists because they had not thought it would be taken this far. Guards who were not on duty were called in and the guards who were assigned to only the night shift stayed with the guards who came in all the way through their shift the next morning. The tactic the guards came up with was to fight back in order to discipline the unruly prisoners and make them obey. In response to the prisoners barricading themselves in their cells, the guards used fire extinguishers on them to get them away from the entrances.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in {{my house}} of a Sunday," [...] said Mrs. R., looking <b>very</b> fierce and <b>angry.</b> [...] "Not a card shall be touched here. Are we in a Protestant land, sir? in a Christian country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{that subject}} I will not listen. I have felt <b>very</b> sore and <b>angry</b> ever since {{you told me}} last night {{to leave the room}} when Sholto insulted me, as if I were the aggressor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was angry," [...] he said deliberately. [...] "I {{am still}} <b>angry,</b> <b>very</b> angry--" [...] {{he noted the}} glint of {{defiance}} {{in her eyes and}} thrilled--"but I forgave, and I now forgive all over again. Though I still insist--" ...|$|R
