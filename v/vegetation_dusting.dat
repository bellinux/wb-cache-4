40|$|During the "Green Sahara" period (11, 000 to 5000 {{years before}} the present), the Sahara desert {{received}} high amounts of rainfall, supporting diverse vegetation, permanent lakes, and human populations.

30|$|In the East Asia region, {{vegetation}} green-up occurs {{within the}} dust storm prevailing season (March–May) (Cong et al. 2012). The earlier vegetation green-up date {{may be another}} cause of the reduced dust storm frequency under warmer temperatures. Although the restraining effect of <b>vegetation</b> on <b>dust</b> storm outbreaks has been recognized in some studies (Sun et al. 2001; Engelstädter et al. 2003), only the spatial aspects of <b>vegetation</b> impacts on <b>dust</b> storm frequency (such as vegetation coverage and biomass) were considered, drawing the general conclusion that the more extensive the vegetation coverage and/or the better the vegetation growth, the fewer the dust storms (Kimura 2012; Lee and Kim 2012). However, the potential effects of a shift in vegetation phenology—that is, {{the timing of the}} onset of plant regeneration in the spring season and its relation to changes in the seasonal cycles of the climate—on dust storms were ignored (Fan et al. 2014). It is possible that in addition to vegetation coverage (a spatial index), vegetation green-up onset (a temporal index) also affects dust storm outbreaks.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe West African Monsoon (WAM) {{is crucial}} for the {{socio-economic}} stability {{of millions of people}} living in the Sahel. Severe droughts have ravaged the region in the last three decades of the 20 th century, highlighting the need for {{a better understanding of the}} WAM dynamics. One of the most dramatic changes in the West African Monsoon (WAM) occurred between 15000 – 5000 yr BP, when increased summer rainfall led to the so-called “Green Sahara” and to a reduction in dust emissions from the region. However, model experiments are unable to fully reproduce the intensification and geographical expansion of the WAM during this period, even when vegetation over the Sahara is considered. Here, we use a fully coupled simulation for 6000 yr BP (Mid-Holocene) in which prescribed Saharan <b>vegetation</b> and <b>dust</b> concentrations are changed in turn. A closer agreement with proxy records is obtained only when both the Saharan <b>vegetation</b> changes and <b>dust</b> decrease are taken into account. The dust reduction strengthens the vegetation–albedo feedback, extending the monsoon's northern limit approximately 500 km further than the vegetation-change case only. We therefore conclude that accounting for changes in Saharan dust loadings is essential for improving model simulations of the WAM during the Mid-Holocene...|$|R

The experimental protocols for simulations of the mid-Holocene (midHolocene, 6000  years before present) and the Last Interglacial (lig 127 k, 127   000  years before present) are described here. These equilibrium simulations are designed to examine the impact of changes in orbital forcing at times when atmospheric greenhouse gas levels were {{similar to those of the}} preindustrial period and the continental configurations were almost identical to modern ones. These simulations test our understanding of the interplay between radiative forcing and atmospheric circulation, and the connections among large-scale and regional climate changes giving rise to phenomena such as land–sea contrast and high-latitude amplification in temperature changes, and responses of the monsoons, as compared to today. They also provide an opportunity, through carefully designed additional sensitivity experiments, to quantify the strength of atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land-surface feedbacks. Sensitivity experiments are proposed to investigate the role of freshwater forcing in triggering abrupt climate changes within interglacial epochs. These feedback experiments naturally lead to a focus on climate evolution during interglacial periods, which will be examined through transient experiments. Analyses of the sensitivity simulations will also focus on interactions between extratropical and tropical circulation, and the relationship between changes in mean climate state and climate variability on annual to multi-decadal timescales. The comparative abundance of paleoenvironmental data and of quantitative climate reconstructions for the Holocene and Last Interglacial make these two epochs ideal candidates for systematic evaluation of model performance, and such comparisons will shed new light on the importance of external feedbacks (e. g., <b>vegetation,</b> <b>dust)</b> and the ability of state-of-the-art models to simulate climate changes realistically...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of variations of greenhouse gas concentrations, orbital parameters, sea-surface conditions, <b>vegetation</b> and <b>dust</b> deposition {{on the extent of}} East Siberian mountain glaciations during the late Quaternary. An atmosphere-only general circulation model is used in a series of 16 sensitivity tests at high spatial resolution over the region of interest to systematically evaluate the relative importance of these different forcing parameters. No attempt was made to reproduce in detail the history of late Quaternary mountain glaciations in East Siberia, because, given (a) the temporal and spatial scarcity of available evidence of mountain glaciations in this region and (b) the large uncertainties concerning the boundary conditions to be prescribed in this model, such an exercise must necessarily remain incomplete and partially inconclusive. The {{results of this study suggest}} that moisture delivery from the Atlantic is an important factor determining mountain glacier mass balance in Eastern Siberia and is very sensitive to the geometry of the West Eurasian ice sheet. This means that variable moisture blocking by the West Eurasian ice sheet during the Weichselian is the most important single factor explaining the opposite history of glacier and ice sheet extent in West and East Eurasia during the Weichselian. This work confirms earlier results showing that the large 140 kyr BP West Eurasian ice sheet caused regional-scale cooling extending towards Eastern Eurasia. Nevertheless, the simulated response of the regional summer temperature (and thus glacier extent because of the strong dependency of glacier mass balance of summer melt rates) is to a very large extent directly determined by insolation. For the Early Weichselian, this leads to a clear maximum of local glacier extent at 70 kyr BP, which is in line with the variations of top-of-the-atmosphere insolation on orbital time scales, but to some degree at odds with geological evidence which suggests larger glacier extent at 115 and 90 kyr BP than at 70 kyr BP. Through snow feedbacks, the effects of changes in the prescribed <b>vegetation</b> distribution and <b>dust</b> deposition rate are also substantial. In summary, it appears that the broad features of late Quaternary glaciation history in Eastern Eurasia can be understood in terms of known forcings...|$|R

This correlation should be high (low) where the variance of land surface environment is low (large). In addition to this idea, referring to the parameterizations of threshold wind speed by NDVI and snow cover fraction, we built four hypotheses as shown in section 3. 1. However, our obtained results disagreed with these in many points, and this indicates problems in the current parameterizations. We will discuss the reasons of these disagreements and some methods will be proposed to clarify these problems...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of the dust cycle that {{successfully}} predicts dust emissions as determined by land surface properties, monthly vegetation and snow cover, and 6 -hourly surface wind speeds for the years 1982 – 1993. The model takes account of the role of dry lake beds as preferential source areas for dust emission. The occurrence of these preferential sources is determined by a water routing and storage model. The dust source scheme also explicitly takes into account the role of vegetation type as well as monthly <b>vegetation</b> cover. <b>Dust</b> transport is computed using assimilated winds for the years 1987 – 1990. Deposition of dust occurs through dry and wet deposition, where subcloud scavenging is calculated using assimilated precipitation fields.

The magnitude of dust deposition agrees well with sediment flux data from marine sites. Emission of submicron dust from preferential source areas are required for the computation of a realistic dust optical thickness.

Aeolian processes affect the biosphere {{in a wide}} variety of contexts, including landform evolution, biogeochemical cycles, regional climate, human health, and desertification. Collectively, research on aeolian {{processes and}} the biosphere is developing rapidly in many diverse and specialized areas, but integration of these recent advances is needed to better address management issues and to set future research priorities. Here we review recent literature on aeolian processes and their interactions with the biosphere, focusing on (1) geography of dust emissions, (2) impacts, interactions, and feedbacks, (3) drivers of dust emissions, and (4) methodological approaches. Geographically, dust emissions are highly spatially variable but also provide connectivity at global scales between sources and effects, with ?hot spots? being of particular concern. Recent research reveals that aeolian processes have impacts, interactions, and feedbacks at a variety of scales, including large?scale dust transport and global biogeochemical cycles, climate mediated interactions between atmospheric dust and ecosystems, impacts on human health, impacts on agriculture, and interactions between aeolian processes and dryland <b>vegetation.</b> Aeolian <b>dust</b> emissions are driven largely by, in addition to climate, a combination of soil properties, soil moisture, vegetation and roughness, biological and physical crusts, and disturbances. Aeolian research methods span laboratory and field techniques, modeling, and remote sensing. Together these integrated perspectives on aeolian processes and the biosphere provide insights into management options and aid in identifying research priorities, both of which are increasingly important given that global climate models predict an increase in aridity in many dryland systems of the world. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

Soil properties, mainly texture and nutrient concentration differed distinctly between forest and fynbos.

The measured platinum levels of up to 194 ng g- 1 agree with published literature from other European countries and represent a useful contribution to the knowledge concerning roadside platinum in the UK...|$|R
30|$|Among the {{different}} influencing factors of dust storm emergence, such as gust, sediment supply, and ground roughness, {{the condition of}} the vegetation is just one factor determining the frequency of dust storms (Fan et al. 2014). Hydrothermal conditions are the ultimate factor influencing dust storm outbreaks. However, the relationship between hydrothermal conditions and dust storms is not simply linear (Fan et al. 2014). No significant correlation was found between spring temperature/precipitation and spring dust storm occurrence in previous studies (Qian et al. 2002; Zou and Zhai 2004). Vegetation green-up is an integrated indicator of the hydrothermal conditions of the plant growth environment. Suitable conditions for vegetation green-up—a warm spring with enough precipitation—are adverse conditions for dust storm outbreaks. Unlike the nonlinear relationship between dust storms and hydrothermal conditions, a linear correlation can be established between vegetation green-up date and dust storms (Fan et al. 2014). Because vegetation green-up is a synthetical expression of hydrothermal conditions, there is a significant impact from the shift in <b>vegetation</b> green-up on <b>dust</b> storm outbreaks. Therefore, variations in vegetation spring phenology (indicating a balance between overall local hydrothermal conditions) supplement the understanding of the dynamics of spring dust storms in East Asia in the changing climate.|$|R

It is first shown that this period was not highly polluted compared to previous summers in this region, with a moderate ozone production, no significant vegetation fire events and several precipitation periods scavenging the aerosol. The period is modeled with the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) and CHIMERE models, {{and their ability to}} quantify the observed pollution transport events is presented. The CHIMERE model simulating all kinds of sources (anthropogenic, biogenic, mineral <b>dust,</b> <b>vegetation</b> fires); the aerosol speciation, not available with the measurements, is presented: during the whole period, the aerosol was mainly constituted by mineral dust, sea salt and sulfates close to the surface and mainly by mineral dust in the troposphere. Compared to the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) size distribution, it is shown that the model underestimates the coarse mode near mineral dust sources and overestimates the fine mode in the Mediterranean area, highlighting the need to improve the model representation of the aerosol size distribution both during emissions, long-range transport and deposition...|$|R
40|$|The {{major element}} {{composition}} of the insoluble, windborne long-range dust archived in the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica Dome C ice core has been determined by Particle Induced X-ray Emission analyses. The geochemistry of dust from the last glacial maximum (LGM) and from the Holocene is {{discussed in terms of}} past environmental changes, throughout the last climatic cycle. Antarctic dust from glacial and interglacial climate clearly reveals different geochemical compositions. The weathered crustal-like signature of LGM dust is characterized by a low compositional variability, suggesting a dominant source under the glacial regime. The close correspondence between the major element composition of Antarctic glacial dust and the composition of southern South American sediments supports the hypothesis of a dominant role of this area as major dust supplier during cold conditions. Conversely, the major element composition of Holocene dust displays high variability and high Al content on average. This implies that an additional source could also play some role. Comparison with size-selected sediments suggests that a contribution from Australia is likely during warm times, when a reduced glacial erosion decreases the primary dust production and a more intense hydrological cycle and larger <b>vegetation</b> cover inactivates <b>dust</b> mobility in a large part of southern South America, weakening its contribution as a massive dust supplier to Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Natural mineral aerosol (dust) is {{an active}} {{component}} of the climate system and plays multiple roles in mediating physical and biogeochemical exchanges between the atmosphere, land surface and ocean. Changes {{in the amount of}} dust in the atmosphere are caused both by changes in climate (precipitation, wind strength, regional moisture balance) and changes in the extent of dust sources caused by either anthropogenic or climatically induced changes in vegetation cover. Models of the global dust cycle take into account the physical controls on dust deflation from prescribed source areas (based largely on soil wetness and <b>vegetation</b> cover thresholds), <b>dust</b> transport within the atmospheric column, and dust deposition through sedimentation and scavenging by precipitation. These models successfully reproduce the first-order spatial and temporal patterns in atmospheric dust loading under modem conditions. Atmospheric dust loading was as much as an order-of-magnitude larger than today during the last glacial maximum (LGM). While the observed increase in emissions from northern Africa can be explained solely in terms of climate changes (colder, drier and windier glacial climates), increased emissions from other regions appear to have been largely a response to climatically induced changes in vegetation cover and hence in the extent of dust source areas. Model experiments suggest that the increased dust loading in tropical regions had an effect on radiative forcing comparable to that of low glacial CO 2 levels. Changes in land-use are already increasing the dust loading of the atmosphere. However, simulations show that anthropogenically forced climate changes substantially reduce the extent and productivity of natural dust sources. Positive feedbacks initiated by a reduction of dust emissions from natural source areas on both radiative forcing and atmospheric CO 2 could substantially mitigate the impacts of land-use changes, and need to be considered in climate change assessments.

40|$|An onboard {{processing}} mission concept is under development {{for a possible}} Direct Broadcast capability for the HyspIRI mission, a Hyperspectral remote sensing mission under consideration for launch in the next decade. The concept would intelligently spectrally and spatially subsample the data as well as generate science products onboard to enable return of key rapid response science and applications information despite limited downlink bandwidth. This rapid data delivery concept focuses on wildfires and volcanoes as primary applications, but also has applications to <b>vegetation,</b> coastal flooding, <b>dust,</b> and snow/ice applications. Operationally, the HyspIRI team would define a set of spatial regions of interest where specific algorithms would be executed. For example, known coastal areas would have certain products or bands downlinked, ocean areas might have other bands downlinked, and during fire seasons other areas would be processed for active fire detections. Ground operations would automatically generate the mission plans specifying the highest priority tasks executable within onboard computation, setup, and data downlink constraints. The spectral bands of the TIR (thermal infrared) instrument can accurately detect the thermal signature of fires and send down alerts, {{as well as the}} thermal and VSWIR (visible to short-wave infrared) data corresponding to the active fires. Active volcanism also produces a distinctive thermal signature that can be detected onboard to enable spatial subsampling. Onboard algorithms and ground-based algorithms suitable for onboard deployment are mature. On HyspIRI, the algorithm would perform a table-driven temperature inversion from several spectral TIR bands, and then trigger downlink of the entire spectrum for each of the hot pixels identified. Ocean and coastal applications include sea surface temperature (using a small spectral subset of TIR data, but requiring considerable ancillary data), and ocean color applications to track biological activity such as harmful algal blooms. Measuring surface water extent to track flooding is another rapid response product leveraging VSWIR spectral information...|$|R
40|$|Dust aerosol is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to aerosol mass concentrations in the troposphere and has considerable effects on the air quality of spatial and temporal scales. Arid and semi-arid areas of the West Asia {{are one of the}} most important regional dust sources in the world. These phenomena directly or indirectly affecting almost all aspects life in almost 15 countries in the region. So an accurate estimate of dust emissions is very crucial for making a common understanding and knowledge of the problem. Because of the spatial and temporal limits of the ground-based observations, remote sensing methods have been found to be more efficient and useful for studying the West Asia <b>dust</b> source. The <b>vegetation</b> cover limits <b>dust</b> emission by decelerating the surface wind velocities and therefore reducing the momentum transport. While all models explicitly take into account the change of wind speed and soil moisture in calculating dust emissions, they commonly employ a "climatological" land cover data for identifying dust source locations and neglect the time variation of surface bareness. In order to compile the aforementioned model, land surface features such as soil moisture, texture, type, and vegetation and also wind speed as atmospheric parameter are used. Having used NDVI data show significant change in dust emission, The modeled dust emission with static source function in June 2008 is 17. 02 % higher than static source function and similar result for Mach 2007 show the static source function is 8. 91 % higher than static source function. we witness a significant improvement in accuracy of dust forecasts during the months of most soil vegetation changes (spring and winter) compared to outputs resulted from static model, in which NDVI data are neglected...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Environmental Science) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 On a {{per capita}} basis, cement {{is the second most}} widely {{consumed}} product in the world and its demand is increasing globally due to population growth and urbanisation. Manufacturing plants produce cement kiln dust (CKD) as one of the by-products while coal provides the dominant energy source in the manufacturing process. Various meta ls are found in CKD and some of these are micro nutrients with potentially toxic effects. If these are present in large quantities, they pose a direct threat to vegetation, animals and humans. The aim o f this study was to quantify a selected number of trace metal concentrations in <b>vegetation,</b> soil, <b>dust</b> and water samples near a cement manufacturing pl ant in the North West Province. Thirty-one samples at various distances from approximately 500 m to 2700 m from where the cement factory is situated, were collected. In addition, similar samples (except for water) were taken from a control site situated 72 kilometres in a north-western direction from the factory. The water control sample was collected from the Ditsobotla municipal water supply. Soil. plant and dust samples as well as the sediment from the water sample were acid digested to obtain total metal concentrations. The acid digested samples were analyzed for selected metal concentrations using the ICP-MS. The relationship between soil metal concentrations and particle size distribution as well as the relationship between dust concentrations and Ca concentrations was established to determine the link with the presence on a CMP in the area. The control samples, reference standards and results from similar research performed were used to compare with metal concentrations found in this study. The study revealed that Ni and Cu concentrations are higher in the silt fraction of the soil whilst V, Co, Zn and Pb in the silt fraction are only marginally higher than the complete soil sample. Only Cr and Mn concentrations were higher in soil samples than the control and reference values, while metal concentrations for Cr, Cu, Pb and Mn were higher in the dust samples than the control and the Emission Limit Value (EL V). Moreover, metal concentrations in the vegetation samples are not a concern as the concentrations a re lower than reference values. Cadmium and As levels are of no concern in this study area especially since dust samples had undetectably low levels. The condition of the environment m relation to pollution from the cement factory was established. Although some metals revealed lower concentrations, the study demonstrated the potential of metal contamination particularly Ni, Mn and Cr to the environment vis-a vis on the surrounding vegetation, animals and possibly on humans. It was therefore recommended that ELV limits for South Africa should be established and monitored for cement factories in South Africa coupled with sustainable land management policies. Master...|$|R

These particulates were initially dispersed by prevailing winds. Quadrupole {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), laser ablation multicollector (LA-MC-) ICP-MS, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microfocus extended X-ray absorption fine structure (µEXAFS) spectroscopy {{have been used to}} characterise soils, <b>dusts,</b> <b>vegetation,</b> and individual particles. The concentration range of natural uranium in Colonie soils is 0. 7 — 2. 1 µg g- 1; with total uranium up to 500 ± 40 µg g- 1 in DU contaminated soils. Bioturbation can account for dispersal of contaminant from the soil surface. Primary morphologies are described for uraniferous particles from soils and dusts. Polycrystalline, often hollow microscopic uranium oxide spheres are similar to particles produced by DU munitions impacting armoured targets. These survive as UO 2 +x and U 3 O 8, the least bioaccessible oxides of uranium. Fruit and wood samples were contaminated by DU, demonstrating limited bioavailability. Deviation of 235 U/ 238 U from the natural isotope ratio allows detection of DU in soils to at least 5. 6 km from site. The average DU ‘end-member’ composition aggregated in soil samples comprises (2. 05 ± 0. 06) x 10 - 3 235 U/ 238 U, (3. 2 ± 0. 1) x 10 - 5 236 U/ 238 U, and (7. 1 ± 0. 3) x 10 6 234 U/ 238 U. Individual uranium oxide grains were analysed by LA-MC-ICP-MS, all of which were from DU, with variable isotopic compositions (236 U/ 238 U, 235 U/ 238 U & 234 U/ 238 U). There is no evidence of enriched uranium in Colonie soils and dusts. The isotopic compositions of the Colonie particles {{can be explained by the}} inhomogeneous mixing of at least seven batches of tails from the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant, which are identified as the origins of the DU feedstocks used by National Lead Industries at Colonie.

40|$|Loess grain-size {{distributions}} of four loess-paleosol sequences, {{located on a}} west to east transect from the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) to the north-western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), are unmixed with the end-member modelling algorithm EMMA. The unmixing {{results indicate that the}} loess is a mixture of three components representing very fine sandy, coarse silty and medium silty loess. The proportional contributions of these loess components in conjunction with loess mass accumulation rate estimates reveal that during the last glacial-interglacial cycle two contrasting dust supply patterns were active over the north-eastern TP and the north-western CLP: a constant supply of medium silty loess and an episodic supply of coarse silty loess and fine sandy loess. The variable input of the two coarse dust components is the main cause for the variation in grain-size patterns and mass accumulation rates between the studied sites. Alluvial fans and river floodplains in the intra-mountainous basins of the Tibetan Plateau and the deserts of northern China and Inner Mongolia are the main dust source areas for loess deposits of the north-eastern TP and the CLP, respectively. The sensitivity of these dust source areas to climate variations determines the timing of dust transport and deposition. In general, high dust fluxes are recorded during the last glacial period (Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 2 - 4) and low dust fluxes during the last interglacial (MIS- 5). The loess sections in the two regions (TP, CLP) show contrasting dust flux patterns during MIS- 3. The records from the CLP show a relatively low dust input in this period, most likely related to increased humidity in the northern dust sources (deserts) where an increased <b>vegetation</b> cover minimized <b>dust</b> deflation. In contrast to this, the Tibetan Plateau records appear to show increased and highly variable dust fluxes for MIS- 3. Alternating periods of increased humidity and aridity on the Tibetan Plateau (during MIS- 3) have resulted in an overall increase in fluvial/alluvial activity. Hence, the enhanced availability of exposed fine-grained fluvial/alluvial sediments on the Tibetan Plateau facilitated dust entrainment which resulted in an increased dust supply towards the Tibetan Plateau sites during this period. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA...|$|R
40|$|The Last Interglacial (LIG, ∼ 129 - 116 {{thousand}} years ago, ka) represents an excellent case study {{to investigate the}} response of sensitive components of the Earth System and mechanisms of high-lati tude amplification to a climate warmer than present-day. The Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 4, hereafter referred as PMIP 4) and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6, hereafter referred as CMIP 6) are coordinating the design of (1) a LIG Tier 1 equilibrium simulation to simulate the climate response at 127 ka, a time interval associated with a strong orbital forcing and greenhouse gas concentrations close to preindustrial levels and (2) associated Tier 2 sensitivity experiments to examine {{the role of the}} ocean, <b>vegetation</b> and <b>dust</b> feedbacks in modulating the response to this orbital forcing. Evaluating the capability of the CMIP 6 /PMIP 4 models to reproduce the 127 ka polar and sub-polar climate will require appropriate data-based benchmarks which are currently missing. Based on a recent data synthesis that offers the first spatio-temporal representation of high-latitude (i. e. poleward of 40 °N and 40 °S) surface temperature evolution during the LIG, we produce a new 126 – 128 ka time slab, hereafter named 127 ka time slice. This 127 ka time slice represents surface temperature anomalies relative to preindustrial and is associated with quantitative estimates of the uncertainties related to relative dating and surface temperature reconstruction methods. It illustrates warmer-than-preindustrial conditions in the high-latitude regions of both hemispheres. In particular, summer sea surface temperatures (SST) in the North Atlantic region were on average 1. 1 °C (with a standard error of the mean of 0. 7 °C) warmer relative to preindustrial and 1. 8 °C (with a standard error of the mean of 0. 8 °C) in the Southern Ocean. In Antarctica, average 127 ka annual surface air temperature was 2. 2 °C (with a standard error of the mean of 1. 4 °C) warmer compared to preindustrial. We provide a critical evaluation of the latest LIG surface climate compilations that are available for evaluating LIG climate model experiments. We discuss in particular our new 127 ka time-slice in the context of existing LIG surface temperature time-slices. We also compare the 127 ka time slice with the ones published for the 125 and 130 ka time intervals and we discuss the potential and limits of a data-based time slice at 127 ka {{in the context of the}} upcoming coordinated modeling exercise. Finally we provide guidance on the use of the available LIG climate compilations for future model-data comparison exercises in the framework of the upcoming CMIP 6 /PMIP 4 127 ka experiments. We do not recommend the use of LIG peak warmth-centered syntheses. Instead we promote the use of the most recent syntheses that are based on coherent chronologies between paleoclimatic records and provide spatio-temporal reconstruction of the LIG climate. In particular, we recommend using our new 127 ka data-based time slice in model-data comparison studies with a focus on the high-latitude climate. E.
