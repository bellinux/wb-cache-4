'There is a vulgar view of {{politics}} which sinks {{them into a}} mere struggle of interests and parties, {{and there is a}} foppish kind of history which aims only at literary display, which produces delightful books hovering between poetry and prose. These perversions, according to me, come from an unnatural divorce between two subjects which belong to one another. Politics are vulgar when they are not liberalised by history, and history fades into mere literature when it loses sight of its relation to practical politics.' These very just remarks are made by Mr. Seeley in a new book which everybody has been reading, and which is an extremely interesting example of that union {{of politics}} with history which its author regards as so useful or even indispensable for the successful prosecution of either history or politics. His lectures on the expansion of England contain a suggestive and valuable study of two great movements in our history, one of them the expansion of the English nation and state together by means of colonies; the other, the stranger expansion by which the vast population of India has passed under the rule of Englishmen. Mr. Seeley has in his new <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> his singularly attractive style and power of literary form. It underwent some obscuration in the three volumes in which the great transformation of Germany and Prussia during the Napoleonic age was not very happily grouped round a biography of Stein. But here the reader once more finds that ease, lucidity, persuasiveness, and mild gravity that were first shown, as they were probably first acquired, in the serious consideration of religious and ethical subjects. Mr. Seeley's aversion for the florid, rhetorical, and over-decorated fashion of writing history has not carried him to the opposite extreme, but it has made him seek sources of interest, where alone the serious student of human affairs would care to find them, in the magnitude of events, the changes of the fortunes of states, and the derivation of momentous consequences from long chains of antecedent causes.|$|E

Aluminium sulphate (alum) that coagulated with solids particles forming alum sludge. Alum sludge settles in the bottom of water treatment plant together with the solid particles. The significant {{of this study is to}} recover aluminium sulphate (alum) from alum sludge. Acidification process applied to alum sludge to recover aluminium sulphate (alum). Acidification using sulphuric acid will separate particulate solids and aluminium sulphate(alum). Aluminium sulphate (alum) will be recovered in aqueous solution, while particulate solids will remain in solid form.

40|$|The grid {{orientation}} {{effect is}} a long-standing problem plaguing reservoir simulators that employ finite difference schemes. A rotation of the computational grids yields a substantially different solution under certain circumstances. For example, in a five-spot pattern, the predicted recovery, water cut performance and {{the locations of the}} fronts depend on the type of grid system used. A Cartesian grid with one axis parallel to the line joining an injector and producer gives a solution significantly different from a grid that has the axes oriented at 45 ?? to this line. This study develops a unique grid-block assignment where rectangular grid blocks are interspersed with octagonal grid blocks. This grid block system is called the Hybrid Grid Block (HGB) system. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the grid orientation effect of the HGB grid to see whether it is an improvement over the conventional Cartesian grid system. In HGB, flow can progress in four directions in the octagonal grid blocks and two in the square grid blocks. The increase in the number of flow directions in the octagonal grid blocks is expected to reduce the grid orientation effect in the model. Hence, this study also evaluates the grid orientation effect of the HGB and compares it with the Cartesian grid system. To test the viability of HGB, a general purpose finite difference IMPES-formulated two-dimensional black oil simulator was developed in this study, while retaining the familiar finite-difference discretization of the flow equations. Several simulation cases were conducted to compare HGB and conventional grid block systems. Comparisons with commercial simulator are also made. Despite the fact that the reservoir is isotropic and homogeneous, grid orientation effect was still observed when rectangular Cartesian grid models are run at mobility ratio, M = 1. 0. Grid refinement can help to reduce the grid orientation effect in rectangular Cartesian grid models when there are favorable mobility ratios, i. e. M = 1. 0 or less. However, at an unfavorable mobility ratio of M = 10. 0, it is found that neither parallel nor diagonal orientation can be used reliably for the displacement problems run in this study. This is because as the number of grid blocks is increased, the performance of diagonal and parallel models actually diverges for the grid spacings investigated here. On the other hand, HGB grid is able to reduce the grid orientation effect even for unfavorable mobility ratio displacement problems (up to M = 50. 0), with maximum relative difference in pore <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> of 6 % between parallel and diagonal HGB grid models for all the cases run in this study. Comparisons between the conventional Cartesian and HGB grid show that the HGB grid is more effective in reducing the grid orientation effect than the Cartesian grid. The HGB grid performs better by consistently giving a smaller relative difference between HGB parallel grid and HGB diagonal grid in pore <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> (6. 0, 4. 5, 3. 3, and 2. 2 %) compared to the relative difference between Cartesian parallel grid and Cartesian diagonal grid in pore <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> (17. 0, 13. 0, 9. 3, 7. 9 %) at similar averaged area per grid block for all the four comparison cases studied...|$|E

30|$|Fractured {{reservoirs}} {{contain a}} large {{fraction of the}} world supply of oil and imbibition {{is one of the}} dominant recovery mechanisms. For fractured reservoirs containing heavy oils or tars, oil viscosity is high and it is hard to get a good development effect at reservoir temperature. However, if thermal methods are adopted, the oil viscosity will decrease sharply as temperature goes on and the oil recovery will increase on the contrary due to capillary imbibition. In this paper, fracture is created by wrapping the core with a steel wire mesh. Before flooding, cores are let to stand at the experimental temperature to eliminate the effect of thermal expansion on oil recovery. Considering that oil <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> is very small, a high precision electronic balance is used to weigh the oil and then calculate the oil volume. Different factors including contact area, matrix permeability, oil viscosity, water injection rate, temperature of the injected fluid and wettability of the core are all investigated. Results of this work should be helpful for the better understanding of the capillary imbibition in the development of fractured heavy oil reservoir.|$|E

METHODS: Twenty-five healthy male subjects underwent 90 dayshead-down tilt bed-rest. Volume of individual lower-limb muscles was measured via MRI before, twice during and four times up to 1 year after bed-rest. Subjects were either inactive (n= 16) or performed flywheel exercise every third day of bed-rest (n= 9). Functional performance was assessed via countermovement jump. RESULTS: On 'intent-to-treat' analysis, flywheel prevented atrophy in the vasti (p< 0. 001) and reduced atrophy in the hip adductor/extensor adductor magnus (p= 0. 001) and ankle dorsiflexors/toe flexors (soleus (p< 0. 001), gastrocnemius medialis (p< 0. 001), gastrocnemius lateralis (p= 0. 02), and tibialis posterior with flexor digitorum longus (p= 0. 04)). Flywheel exercise was not effective for the hamstrings, gracilis, sartorius, peroneals and anterior tibial muscles.

40|$|The {{properties}} of ghosts prepared by hypotonic hemolysis at various ratios of cells (C) to hemolyzing solution (H) have been studied. At all ratios, hemoglobin (Hb) {{was found to}} be distributed equally between the ghost and supernatant compartments. Techniques employing Fe 59 —labelled Hb showed that during hemolysis all of the Hb is exchangeable and that following hemolysis the ghost is impermeable to Hb. Ghosts containing defined fractions of their original Hb were prepared by appropriately altering the ratio C/H. When washed and suspended in 0. 17 M NaCl—PO 4 —buffered media, the ghosts returned to their initial <b>volume,</b> <b>recovered</b> normal shape, and behaved as osmometers. The rate of rehemolysis of these reconstituted ghosts was observed to be proportional to the concentration of Hb in the ghosts. The rate of rehemolysis was accelerated by the addition of n-butyl alcohol (BA). For a given concentration of BA, temperature, and Hb content the rate of rehemolysis was minimal around the isoelectric point of Hb. Rehemolysis by BA was inhibited by the addition of sucrose to the medium. K influx and outflux were measured and found to be increased by the addition of BA and not influenced by the presence of sucrose. These results on the rehemolytic characteristics of ghosts are consistent with and support the colloid-osmotic theory of hemolysis...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{reductions}} in the water volume of shallow lakes impose a restriction on species segregation promoting more interactions in the trophic relationships. The diets of three closely related zooplanktivorous silversides belonging to the Atherinopsidae species flock of lake Chapala, Mexico, were analyzed at two sites (Chirostoma jordani, C. labarcae, and C. consocium). Diets were described in critical shallow (August 2000) and volume recovery conditions (August 2005). Diets included mainly cladocerans (Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, and Daphnia) and copepods (Cyclops). A significant difference in diets was detected when comparing years (MRPP analysis, A = 0. 22, p < 0. 0001) and sites at different years (MRPP analysis, A = 0. 17, p = 0. 004). According to niche breadth mean values, species were classified as specialized and intermediate feeders. In shallow conditions, the small range of niche breadth (1. 72 to 3. 64) and high diet overlap values (D = 0. 64, L = 8. 62) indicated a high potential for interspecific exploitative interaction. When the lake <b>volume</b> <b>recovered,</b> {{an increase in the}} niche breadth range (1. 04 to 4. 96) and low niche overlap values (D = 0. 53, L = 2. 32) indicated a reduction of the species interaction.

The bottom of Nakadake crater was filled with the crater lake water until 2009 (Shinohara et al. 2015), and the water volume decreased to almost zero in late 2011, when a few small phreatic eruptions occurred. The water <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> in 2012 and then decreased again to almost zero in late 2013 following several small phreatic eruptions.

Xylitol was detected for 8 hours in the ASL after application in airway epithelium in vitro. We tested the airway retention time of aerosolized iso-osmotic xylitol in healthy volunteers. Methods After a screening spirometry, volunteers received 10 ml of nebulized 5 % xylitol. Bronchoscopy was done at 20 minutes (n = 6), 90 minutes (n = 6), and 3 hours (n = 5) after nebulization and ASL was collected using microsampling probes, followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Xylitol concentration was measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and corrected for dilution using urea concentration. Results All subjects tolerated nebulization and bronchoscopy well. Mean ASL <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> from the probes was 49 ± 23 μl.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} various waterflooding strategies to recover pooled dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) from the subsurface at an industrial facility. The relative influence of horizontal injection/recovery well configuration, established hydraulic gradient, and fluid properties is investigated for a site characterized by a homogeneous silty sand underlain by an impermeable clay layer. The top of the clay layer is located 5 m below the water table and supports a laterally extensive 2 m deep DNAPL pool. The sensitivity study employs a two-phase flow numerical model that simulates both DNAPL infiltration and redistribution, including the formation of immobilized DNAPL residual. This is accomplished with constitutive relations featuring hysteretic capillary pressure-saturation pathways in which the local amount of residual formed {{is a function of}} the maximum non-wetting saturation attained during infiltration. Sixteen simulations, performed in two-dimensional vertical cross-section, demonstrate that strategies effecting increased wetting phase gradients, namely increasing drawdown at the recovery drain, adding injection wells, and reducing their distance to the recovery drain, result in an increased DNAPL <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> with time at the expense of increased volumes of ground water removed per unit volume of DNAPL recovered. Strategies which do not increase wetting phase gradients result in DNAPL recovery with a minimum volume of produced contaminated ground water. Three pulsed pumping simulations indicate that increasing the length of pump shut-down time decreases the recovery of DNAPL with time but increases efficiency with respect to ground water pumped. Decreased nonwetting density and increased interfacial tension result in poorer DNAPL recovery with respect to both time and volume of ground water removed, while reduced nonwetting viscosity corresponds to dramatically increased efficiency in both respects...|$|E
40|$|Objective - To {{compare the}} use of two {{ophthalmic}} sponges for tear collection in dogs and cats. Animals studied - Ten healthy dogs and 10 healthy cats. Procedures - A strip (4 x 10 mm) of either cellulose or polyvinyl acetal (PVA) sponge was inserted into the ventral fornix of each eye for either 15, 30 or 60 seconds. The wetted strip was placed into a 0. 2 -mL tube that was first punctured at its bottom. Tears were eluted through the drainage hole into a 1. 5 -mL tube via centrifugation. Tear volume absorbed (VA) and tear <b>volume</b> <b>recovered</b> (VR) were calculated as the difference of the post- and pre- collection weight of the 0. 2 -mL tube and 1. 5 -mL tube, respectively. Recovery ratio (RR) was determined as the ratio between VR and VA. Results - Ophthalmic sponges were well tolerated by all subjects. In dogs and cats, median (95 % range) VA, VR and RR were: 44 μL (11 - 106 μL) and 16 μL (2 - 43 μL); 27 μL (1 - 84 μL) and 6 μL (0 - 29 μL); 64 % (7 - 91 %) and 35 % (0 - 86 %), respectively. PVA sponges achieved significantly greater VR in cats and RR in both species. All parameters were significantly greater with a collection time of 60 vs. 30 and 15 seconds. Body weight was associated with VA and VR in dogs but not cats. Conclusions – PVA is better than cellulose for tear collection given its superior recovery. Ophthalmic sponges could facilitate routine analysis of tear fluid in dogs and cats, although further {{studies are needed to}} evaluate the quality of tears obtained with this method...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{method has}} been {{developed}} to determine experimental equilibrium distillation curves using a modified ASTM D 86 distillation apparatus. The method determines accurate equilibrium initial boiling points and accounts for the dynamic holdup inherent in distillation curves measured {{in accordance with the}} ASTM D 86 standard. In this work, the ASTM D 86 distillation setup has been modified to simultaneously measure liquid and vapor temperature using two resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and a data acquisition system has been employed to record temperature data at one-second time intervals for the duration of each distillation. Additionally, the time for each volume recovery point is recorded. The method presented here uses the time-resolved liquid temperature data to identify the true initial boiling point (IBP) of four fuel mixtures of known composition; the IBPs are within 2 °C of the calculated equilibrium values. The time-resolved volume recovery information and the identified initial boiling point time are used to construct a volume evaporated versus time curve. The measured temperatures determined at the corresponding volume evaporated increments provide an experimental equilibrium distillation curve (EEDC). The EEDCs for the four fuel mixtures of known composition match the calculated equilibrium curves within a few degrees Celsius; a maximum mean absolute error of 2. 2 ± 1. 4 °C was observed. The dynamic holdup (volume difference between volume evaporated and <b>volume</b> <b>recovered)</b> associated with a distillation is found to correlate with the initial boiling point of the fuel being distilled and the temperature of the condenser bath used in the experiment. The method was also applied to measure EEDCs for a gasoline fuel and a diesel fuel, where the compositions were unknown, to investigate the differences between the EEDCs and the ASTM D 86 distillation curves. The results highlight the large errors incurred when using ASTM D 86 results to approximate equilibrium distillation curves...|$|E

5000|$|One study {{reviewed}} the relative diagnostic value of enzyme and bicarbonate concentrations compared with enzyme output in 363 secretin-CCK tests [...] The investigators also evaluated {{the requirement for}} perfusion markers to accurately quantify volume, and the validity of a shortened sampling time (first 20 minutes). Only 60 percent of <b>volume</b> was <b>recovered</b> with the duodenal aspiration tube, suggesting that marker perfusion to correct for distal loss of secretion is important to accurately quantify volume.|$|R
