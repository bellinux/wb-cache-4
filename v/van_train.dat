50|$|Although {{they were}} tried out on other duties around the system, {{most of their}} life was spent {{allocated}} to the new shed at Feltham. The lack of maintenance for most locomotives during World War II meant that such massive and reliable machines as the G16s continued their hard work even in very run-down condition. Inevitably, {{the introduction of the}} ubiquitous 0-6-0 diesel electric shunters at Feltham in the 1950s made the G16s redundant. They were used occasionally on empty stock and <b>van</b> <b>trains,</b> from various depots such as Guildford, but these duties were limited in numbers and further electrification in the Southern Region meant that there was a surplus of locomotives in the late 1950s. One G16 was withdrawn in 1959, another in 1960 and the final two in December 1962. None have been preserved.|$|R
