25|$|The Yongle Emperor {{may have}} {{suffered}} from undisclosed impotence in his later life. He is remembered <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> his cruelty, just like his father. He killed most of the Jianwen Emperor's palace servants, tortured many of his nephew's loyalists to death, killed or by other means badly treated their relatives. His successor freed most of the survivors.|$|E
25|$|The Persian Shah is {{the ruler}} of Persia (by the book's {{chronology}} probably Naser al-Din Shah Qajar). He is depicted as being rather self-centered and helpless. He is largely a puppet of his mother, the khanum. He is a dangerous and powerful man, nonetheless, and Nadir worries <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> his and Erik's safety under the unstable favour of the shah.|$|E

25|$|After {{recruiting}} Bellew, {{the band}} started {{to write and}} record for their second studio album, The Pillars of Humanity. When the album was released 1991 on Narrowpath Records the band did not tour <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the album. In 1992 the band was broken up, but 1993 is when the band announced their breakup. In 1995 the band reunited and played their final show at Cornerstone Festival. The members all went on to join new projects including, Stavesacre, Neon Horse, The Blamed, CHATTERbOX, and Applehead.|$|E
25|$|A year {{afterwards}} his situation, {{which had}} {{for some time}} been decidedly flourishing, showed signs of changing <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the worse. The duchess of Orléans died, and he apparently {{had to give up}} his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. But there was always a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sablière, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have had no trouble whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to that of theatrical composition.|$|E
500|$|The band {{received}} {{permission from}} the electronic music German band Kraftwerk to use the main riff from its song [...] "Computer Love", from its 1981 studio album Computer World, for [...] "Talk", replacing Kraftwerk's synthesizers with guitars. In a track-by-track interview given by the band on X, bassist Guy Berryman reported that {{in response to the}} band's request, Kraftwerk founding member Ralf Hütter [...] "said something like, 'Yes, you can use it, and thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> asking my permission, unlike that bastard Jay-Z'." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, which were {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Nico Rosberg expressed delight about his victory, but also remembered the events of Paris which, as he put it, rendered [...] "everything relative". Replying to Brundle's notion that driving {{the way he did}} earlier in the season would have given him a chance for the championship, Rosberg replied: [...] "Thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> that piece of advice, I could figure that out for myself!" [...] Lewis Hamilton on the other hand lamented {{the fact that he was}} unable to follow Rosberg closely on track without damaging his tyres too much, saying that he would have otherwise had the pace to pass him. Third placed Sebastian Vettel called it [...] "a good race", but also [...] "not very exciting", since the Ferrari drivers had been [...] "in no-mans land" [...] behind the Mercedes.|$|E

With his selection, Australian chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said, [...] "Jason Krejza had a good season for Tasmania last year but is a selection <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Indian conditions.

2500|$|A 1953 lien by the Internal Revenue Service, {{with whom}} he had been having tax problems, cost Sturges the Players and other assets. Sturges put a brave public face on the situation, writing, [...] "I had so <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> so very long, it is quite natural for the {{pendulum}} to swing the other way for a while, and I really cannot and will not complain." [...] However, his drinking became heavy, and his marriage and many of his relationships continued to deteriorate.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1880s Burne-Jones {{had begun}} hyphenating his name, merely - {{as he wrote}} later - to avoid [...] "annihilation" [...] in the mass of Joneses, and thus Georgiana became Lady Burne-Jones when her husband reluctantly {{accepted}} a baronetcy in 1894, partially at least as the title would descend to his son Philip, who ran with the smart set around the Prince of Wales and cared <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the honour. Jane Morris wrote {{that her husband had}} commented [...] "Well, a man can be an ass {{for the sake of his}} children", but in general the Socialists of their circle and Georgiana herself were appalled.|$|E

In a {{departure}} from the arranged marriages, they have chosen each other independently. They invite their parents to a joint dinner and inform them of their choice. The parents are cheerful to oblige, and they gladly arrange the wedding ceremony. Once married, however, Saby and Kashmira discover their varying interests and aspirations. The main conflict is around cricket: Saby is a great fan of cricket, and Kashmira does not care <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the sport. Saby watches every India match with unfailing zeal. Kashmira however is left alone and unattended, and she gradually feels abandoned and unloved.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have pointed out}} that the 1953 English translation of The Second Sex by H. M. Parshley, frequently reissued, is poor. The reviewer from The New York Times described the zoologist hired to do the translation as having [...] "a college undergraduate’s knowledge of French." [...] The delicate vocabulary of philosophical concepts is frequently mistranslated, and great swaths of the text have been excised. [...] The English publication rights to the book are owned by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc and although the publishers had been made aware of the problems with the English text, they long stated that there was really no need for a new translation, even though Beauvoir herself explicitly requested one in a 1985 interview: [...] "I would like <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> another translation of The Second Sex to be done, one that is much more faithful; more complete and more faithful." ...|$|E

The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd. The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: [...] "I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> maligning my wife and maligning my father.'" [...] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.|$|E
2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical models may {{calculate}} the constants (coefficients) {{corresponding to the}} higher powers of T, but since {{it is impossible for}} a (finite) polynomial to match a periodic function over all numbers, the difference in all such approximations will grow without bound as T increases. However, greater accuracy can be obtained over a limited time span by fitting a high enough order polynomial to observation data, rather than a necessarily imperfect dynamic numerical model. So for present flight trajectory calculations of artificial satellites and spacecraft, the polynomial method gives better accuracy. [...] In that respect, the International Astronomical Union chose the best-developed available theory. For up to a few centuries in the past and the future, all formulas do not diverge <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> <b>For</b> up to a few thousand years in the past and the future, most agree to some accuracy. For eras farther out, discrepancies become too large – the exact rate and period of precession may not be computed using these polynomials even for a single whole precession period.|$|E
