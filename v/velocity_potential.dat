25|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, it {{was shown}} that for finite-amplitude waves the {{convergence}} of the Stokes expansion depends strongly on the formulation of the periodic wave problem. For instance, an inverse formulation of the periodic wave problem as used by Stokes – with the spatial coordinates as a function of <b>velocity</b> <b>potential</b> and stream function – does not converge for high-amplitude waves. While other formulations converge much more rapidly, e.g. in the Eulerian frame of reference (with the <b>velocity</b> <b>potential</b> or stream function {{as a function of the}} spatial coordinates).|$|E
25|$|Thus every {{analytic}} function {{corresponds to a}} steady incompressible, irrotational fluid flow in the plane. The real part is the <b>velocity</b> <b>potential,</b> and the imaginary part is the stream function.|$|E
40|$|The {{equations}} of hydrodynamics for {{a perfect}} fluid in general relativity are cast in Eulerian form, with the four-velocity being {{expressed in terms of}} six velocity potentials: U nu =µ- 1 (phi, nu + alpha beta, nu + theta S, nu). Each of the <b>velocity</b> <b>potentials</b> has its own "equation of motion. " These equations furnish a description of hydrodynamics that is equivalent to the usual equations based on the divergence of the stress-energy tensor. The velocity-potential description leads to a variational principle whose Lagrangian density is especially simple: L=(-g) 1 / 2 (R+ 16 pi p), where R is the scalar curvature of spacetime and p is the pressure of the fluid. Variation of the action with respect to the metric tensor yields Einstein's field equations {{for a perfect}} fluid. Variation with respect to the <b>velocity</b> <b>potentials</b> reproduces the Eulerian equations of motio...|$|R

25|$|Observe {{that for}} finite depth the <b>velocity</b> <b>potential</b> Φ {{contains}} a linear drift in time, independent of position (x and z). Both this temporal drift and the double-frequency term (containing sin2θ) in Φ vanish for deep-water waves.|$|E
25|$|Luke's Lagrangian {{formulation}} {{can also}} be recast into a Hamiltonian formulation {{in terms of the}} surface elevation and <b>velocity</b> <b>potential</b> at the free surface. This is often used when modelling the spectral density evolution of the free-surface in a sea state, sometimes called wave turbulence.|$|E
25|$|Variation {{with respect}} to the <b>velocity</b> <b>potential</b> Φ(x,z,t) and free-moving {{surfaces}} like z=η(x,t) results in the Laplace equation for the potential in the fluid interior and all required boundary conditions: kinematic boundary conditions on all fluid boundaries and dynamic boundary conditions on free surfaces. This may also include moving wavemaker walls and ship motion.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrodynamic}} {{response of}} a porous flexible circular-cylinder in regular waves was analytically studied. To simplify the problem, {{the bottom of}} the cylinder was considered as rigid porous plates. Small amplitude water wave theory and structural responses were assumed.

40|$|We {{compute the}} irrotational motion of two fluids with a {{horizontal}} plane surface of separation, under gravity. The fluids are nonviscous and incompressible, the upper one of finite depth {{with a free}} surface; they contain a line singularity or a point singularity. We obtain the <b>velocity</b> <b>potentials</b> for each singularity located in the upper or the lower fluid; if the upper depth tends to infinity, known results are recovered...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the scattering of an incoming water wave over a single step below the upper surface where the height of the step may be finite or very large(infinite) in presence of a surface discontinuity. Using linear theory, the problem is formulated mathematically as a boundary value problem in two separate regions of the ocean corresponding to two different depths. By utilising the eigenfunction expansion of the <b>velocity</b> <b>potentials</b> in conjunction with the impendence conditions along the common vertical boundary of the two regions, the mathematical problem is reduced to a system of linear equations which are solved numerically to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients. If the surface discontinuity is due to a semi-infinite floating dock over an infinite step at the bottom, use of Havelock expansion of the <b>velocity</b> <b>potentials</b> and impendence conditions, the boundary value problem leads to another system of linear equation involving integral equations. The explicit form of the reflection coefficient is computed numerically in terms of wave number of the incoming wave and a number of graphical representations is given...|$|R
25|$|Airy wave theory uses a {{potential}} flow (or <b>velocity</b> <b>potential)</b> approach {{to describe the}} motion of gravity waves on a fluid surface. The use of – inviscid and irrotational – potential flow in water waves is remarkably successful, given its failure to describe many other fluid flows where it is often essential to take viscosity, vorticity, turbulence and/or flow separation into account. This {{is due to the}} fact that for the oscillatory part of the fluid motion, wave-induced vorticity is restricted to some thin oscillatory Stokes boundary layers at the boundaries of the fluid domain.|$|E
25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the <b>velocity</b> <b>potential</b> and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates (x,z) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces.|$|E

40|$|THE {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the two-dimensional isotropic parabolic potential barrier as a solvable model of a two-dimensional unstable system in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The time-independent Schrodinger equation for this model is set up as the eigenvalue problem in Gel 2 ̆ 7 fand triplet and its exact solutions are expressed by generalized eigen-functions belonging to complex energy eigenvalues. There are stationary states with a real energy eigenvalues. There are statinary states with a real energy eigenvalue involved in those solutions, and they are infinitely degenerate. A physical picture of the generalized eigenstates of the unstable system is obtained from the hydrodynamical point of view. For the first few stationary states of the two-dimensional parabolic potential barrier, the complex <b>velocity</b> <b>potentials</b> in the hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics express the two-dimensional irrotational flows round a right angle.

40|$|Horizontal {{wavenumber}} power {{spectra of}} {{vertical and horizontal}} wind <b>velocities,</b> <b>potential</b> temperatures, and ozone and N(2) O mixing ratios, as measured in the mid-stratosphere during 73 ER- 2 flights (altitude approx. 20 km) are presented. The <b>velocity</b> and <b>potential</b> temperature spectra in the 100 to 1 -km wavelength range deviate significantly from the uniform - 5 / 3 power law expected for the inverse energy-cascade regime of two-dimensional turbulence and also for inertial-range, three-dimensional turbulence. Instead, steeper spectra approximately consistent with a - 3 power law are observed at horizontal scales smaller than 3 km for all velocity components as well as potential temperature. Shallower spectra are observed at scales longer than 6 km. For horizontal <b>velocity</b> and <b>potential</b> temperature the spectral indices at longer scales are between - 1. 5 and - 2. 0. For vertical velocity the spectrum at longer scales become flat. It is argued that the observed <b>velocity</b> and <b>potential</b> temperature spectra are consistent with gravity waves. At smaller scales, the shapes are also superficially consistent with a Lumley-Shur-Weinstock buoyant subrange of turbulence and/or nonlinear gravity waves. Contemporaneous spectra of ozone and N(sub 2) O mixing ratio in the 100 to 1 -km wavelength range do conform to an approximately uniform - 5 / 3 power law. It is argued that this may reflect interactions between gravity wave air-parcel displacements and laminar or filamentary structures in the trace gas mixing ratio field produced by enstropy-cascading two-dimensional turbulence...|$|R
