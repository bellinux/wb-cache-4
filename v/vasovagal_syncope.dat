The risk of falling, in turn, is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause (e.g. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Collapse (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness) leads to a significant risk of falls; causes of syncope are manifold, but may include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), <b>vasovagal</b> <b>syncope,</b> orthostatic hypotension (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and seizures.

Rabbits with marked vagal pauses following injection of phenylephrine were selected and crossed to obtain a vagal hyperreactive strain. The density of cardiac muscarinic receptors and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) gene expression were assessed. Blood markers of the observed cardiac abnormalities were also sought. Methodology/Principal Findings: Cardiac muscarinic M 2 and M 3 receptors were overexpressed in hyperreactive rabbits compared to control animals (2. 3 -fold and 2. 5 -fold, respectively) and the severity of the phenylephrine-induced bradycardia was correlated with their densities. A similar overexpression of M 2 receptors was observed in peripheral mononuclear white blood cells, suggesting that cardiac M 2 receptor expression can be inferred with high confidence from measurements in blood cells. Sequencing of the coding fragment of the M 2 receptor gene revealed a single nucleotide mutation in 83 % of hyperreactive animals, possibly contributing for the transcript overexpression.

40|$|Sinusoidal {{galvanic}} vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces oscillations {{in blood}} pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) i. e., vasovagal oscillations, and decreases in BP and HR i. e., vasovagal responses, in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. We determined {{the characteristics of the}} vasovagal oscillations, assessed their role in the generation of vasovagal responses and determined whether they could be induced by monaural as well as by binaural sGVS and by oscillation in pitch. Wavelet analyses were used to determine the power distributions of the waveforms. Monaural and binaural sGVS and pitch generated vasovagal oscillations at the frequency and at twice the frequency of stimulation. Vasovagal oscillations and vasovagal responses were maximally induced at low stimulus frequencies (0. 025 - 0. 05 Hz). The oscillations were attenuated and the responses were rarely induced at higher stimulus frequencies. Vasovagal oscillations could occur without induction of vasovagal responses, but vasovagal responses were always associated with a vasovagal oscillation. We posit that the vasovagal oscillations originate in a low frequency band that, when appropriately activated by strong sympathetic stimulation, can generate vasovagal oscillations as a precursor for <b>vasovagal</b> responses and <b>syncope.</b> We further suggest that the activity responsible for the vasovagal oscillations arises in low frequency, otolith neurons with orientation vectors close to the vertical axis of the head. These neurons are likely to provide critical input to the Vestibulo-Sympathetic Reflex to increase BP and HR upon changes in head position relative to gravity, and to contribute to the production of vasovagal oscillations and <b>vasovagal</b> responses and <b>syncope</b> when the baroreflex is inactivated...|$|R

40|$|Reflex syncope is {{a common}} medical problem. <b>Vasovagal</b> reflex <b>syncope</b> is the most {{frequent}} form. Although the prognosis of the disorder is excellent, it may impose substantial changes in life style and cause profound psychological distress. Thus, management of this disorder is an important issue. This chapter, based on {{a review of the}} literature and the authors' clinical experience, encompasses the non-pharmacological measures used in the management of reflex syncope. The cornerstone of the nonpharmacological management of patients with reflex syncope is education and reassurance regarding the benign nature of the condition. Patients should be instructed to avoid potential triggers. A tilt table test can be employed to teach the patient to recognize early premonitory symptoms. There are several physical maneuvers (e. g., leg crossing, muscle tensing and squatting) that are effective in combating orthostatic intolerance. For the majority of patients this approach is adequate. Patients with frequent attacks of reflex syncope are advised to increase their dietary salt intake. Exercise training also increases orthostatic tolerance. In highly motivated patients with recurrent syncope, raising the head of the bed to permit gravitational exposure during sleep and prolonged periods of enforced maintenance of the upright posture (tilt-training) can be considered. Preliminary data suggest that water drinking may improve orthostatic tolerance. Abdominal belts may also be effective in highly symptomatic subjects with reflex syncop...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{specificity}} and total positive rate of head-up tilt testing (HUTT) potentiated with sublingual nitroglycerin in detecting the vasovagal origin of unexplained syncope in the elderly, since the diagnostic value of this non-invasive test has not yet been proven in this age group. In a period of 3 years, 128 elderly patients (mean age 71. 6 +/- 5. 1 years, 50 % males) with syncope of unknown origin, and 101 control subjects matched for age and gender were tilted upright to 60 degrees for 45 minutes. If syncope did not occur, sublingual nitroglycerin (0. 4 mg) was administered, and observation Was continued for 20 minutes. The positive response was defined as the reproduction of syncope or pre-syncope according to VASIS definition. During the unmedicated phase, syncope occurred in 26 patients (20. 3 %) and in no members of the control group. After nitroglycerin, 53 patients (41. 4 %) and 2 control subjects (2 %) displayed syncope. The total positive rate of the test Was 61. 8 % With a specificity of 98. 0 %. In conclusion, HUTT potentiated with sublingual nitroglycerin provides an adequate specificity and total positive rate in old patients with unexplained syncope; therefore it can be proposed as a useful diagnostic tool to detect the <b>vasovagal</b> origin of <b>syncope</b> not only in middle but also in advanced age...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Up to 60 % of syncopal episodes remain unexplained. We {{report the}} results of a standardized, {{stepwise}} evaluation of patients referred to an ambulatory clinic for unexplained syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 939 consecutive patients referred for unexplained syncope, who underwent a standardized evaluation, including history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, head-up tilt testing (HUTT), carotid sinus massage (CSM) and hyperventilation testing (HYV). Echocardiogram and stress test were performed when underlying heart disease was initially suspected. Electrophysiological study (EPS) and implantable loop recorder (ILR) were used only in patients with underlying structural heart disease or major unexplained syncope. We identified a cause of syncope in 66 % of patients, including 27 % vasovagal, 14 % psychogenic, 6 % arrhythmias, and 6 % hypotension. Noninvasive testing identified 92 % and invasive testing an additional 8 % of the causes. HUTT yielded 38 %, CSM 28 %, HYV 49 %, EPS 22 %, and ILR 56 % of diagnoses. On average, patients with arrhythmic causes were older, had a lower functional capacity, longer P-wave duration, and presented with fewer prodromes than patients with <b>vasovagal</b> or psychogenic <b>syncope.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A standardized stepwise evaluation emphasizing noninvasive tests yielded 2 / 3 of causes in patients referred to an ambulatory clinic for unexplained syncope.

Pippa, et al, ???Improving classification of epileptic and non-epileptic EEG events by feature selection???, Neurocomputing, Vol. 171 : 576 - 585, July 2015. The final published version is available at: [URL] Copyright ?? 2015 Elsevier B. V. Correctly diagnosing generalized epileptic from non-epileptic episodes, such as psychogenic non epileptic seizures (PNES) and <b>vasovagal</b> or vasodepressor <b>syncope</b> (VVS), despite its importance for the administration of appropriate treatment, life improvement of the patient, and cost reduction for patient and healthcare system, is rarely tackled in the literature. Usually clinicians differentiate between generalized epileptic seizures and PNES based on clinical features and video-EEG. In this work, we investigate the use of machine learning techniques for automatic classification of generalized epileptic and non-epileptic events based only on multi-channel EEG data. For this purpose, we extract the signal patterns in the time domain and in the frequency domain and then combine all features across channels to characterize the spatio-temporal manifestation of seizures. Several classification algorithms are explored and evaluated on EEG epochs from 11 subjects in an inter-subject cross-validation setting. Due to large number of features feature ranking and selection is performed prior to classification using the ReliefF ranking algorithm within two different voting strategies. The classification models using feature subsets, achieved higher accuracy compared to the models using all features reaching 95 % (Bayesian Network), 89 % (Random Committee) and 87 % (Random Forest) for binary classification (epileptic versus non-epileptic). The results demonstrate the competitiveness of this approach as opposed to previous methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of unexplained syncope remains a challenging clinical problem. In {{the present study}} we sought to evaluate the diagnostic value of a standardized work-up focusing on non invasive tests in patients with unexplained syncope referred to a syncope clinic, and whether certain combinations of clinical parameters are characteristic of rhythmic and reflex causes of syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS: 317 consecutive patients underwent a standardized work-up including a 12 -lead ECG, physical examination, detailed history with screening for syncope-related symptoms using a structured questionnaire followed by carotid sinus massage (CSM), and head-up tilt test. Invasive testings including an electrophysiological study and implantation of a loop recorder were only performed in those with structural heart disease or traumatic syncope. Our work-up identified an etiology in 81 % of the patients. Importantly, {{three quarters of the}} causes were established non invasively combining head-up tilt test, CSM and hyperventilation testing. Invasive tests yielded an additional 7 % of diagnoses. Logistic analysis identified age and number of significant prodromes as the only predictive factors of rhythmic syncope.

40|$|Syncope {{is defined}} as a {{transient}} loss of consciousness and absence of postural tone followed by spontaneous recovery. Neurally mediated <b>syncope</b> (<b>vasovagal)</b> and idiopathic unexplained syncope (US) are the most common causes of syncope. Syncope is a very limiting disease that, if recurrent, affects the patients’ physical and psychological health. Our objective from this study is to measure the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms among patients with US. All patients (> 12 years) with vasovagal or US who were evaluated in King Khalid University Hospital were identified. Echocardiography and table tilt test reports were reviewed and patients who had cardiac syncope (due to arrhythmia or structural heart disease) were excluded (N =  18). Ninety-four patients were included for further psychiatric assessment. The patients were contacted to fill the Symptoms Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R), which is a self-reporting questionnaire used to evaluate traits of depression, anxiety, somatization disorder and phobia. SCL- 90 -R scale has been translated to Arabic and validated in previous studies. Of the included cohort, 43 responded to fill the assessment scale, and 51 were excluded due to failure of communication (N =  41) or refusal to participate (N =  10). A control group was recruited with a case: control ratio of 1 : 3 matching for age, gender, and chronic illnesses. There were 43 patients and 129 control subjects, with predominance of females (67. 4 %) and an average age of 33. 8 (SD =  16). There was no difference in average scores of depression (13 vs. 14. 53, P =  0. 31), anxiety (11. 3 vs. 10. 4, P =  0. 51), or phobia (5. 4 vs. 5. 2, P =  0. 88). However, the syncope group had a higher average score for somatization disorder (18. 53 vs. 13. 66, P =  0. 002). Binary logistic regression model was measured after grouping the cohort into above and below median scores. After adjusting for age, gender, and chronic illnesses, the association between syncope and somatization disorder remained significant (OR =  3. 75, CI; 1. 72, 8. 15, P =  0. 001). Despite no statistical significance, when looking at the effect size, having an anxiety score above the median was 52 % higher in cases compared to controls (OR =  1. 52, CI; 0. 74, 3. 14, P =  0. 255). A sub-analysis of the case group was applied and showed that patients who had multiple syncopal attacks (6 or more) had higher average scores of depression, anxiety, phobia and somatization disorder compared to those who had less than 6 attacks (Table). Patients with vasovagal or US have similar incidence of depression, anxiety or phobia symptoms and higher incidence of somatization symptoms compared to control subjects. However, recurrent and more frequent attacks of syncope was predictive of more deteriorative psychological profile for all four domains.
