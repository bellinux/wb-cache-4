They {{do not need to}} deliver significant electric current, which further limits the electrical hazard to the wearer in case of fault.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{noise is}} {{distinct}} from shot noise, which consists of additional current fluctuations that occur when a voltage is applied and a macroscopic current starts to flow. For the general case, the above definition applies to charge carriers in any type of conducting medium (e.g. ions in an electrolyte), not just resistors. It can be modeled by a <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> representing {{the noise of the}} non-ideal resistor in series with an ideal noise free resistor.|$|E
30|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{system of}} equations are obtained applying the modified nodal analysis (MNA) (Ho et al. 1975), which is a method that allows the systematic study of circuits containing devices incompatible with the classic nodal analysis like <b>voltage</b> <b>sources,</b> voltage-dependent <b>voltage</b> <b>sources,</b> among others.|$|R
50|$|Line commutated {{converters}} require voltage {{from the}} AC network for commutation, {{but since the}} late 1990s, <b>voltage</b> <b>sourced</b> converters have started {{to be used for}} HVDC. <b>Voltage</b> <b>sourced</b> converters use insulated-gate bipolar transistors instead of thyristors and can provide power to a deenergized AC system.|$|R

25|$|By {{use of a}} {{permanent}} magnet in the magnetic circuit, a relay {{can be made to}} respond to current in one direction differently from in another. Such polarized relays are used on direct-current circuits to detect, for example, reverse current into a generator. These relays can be made bistable, maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset. For AC circuits, the principle is extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference <b>voltage</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
25|$|Feedback is used {{to better}} match signal sources to their loads. For example, a direct {{connection}} of a <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> to a resistive load may result in signal loss due to voltage division, but interjecting a negative feedback amplifier can increase the apparent load seen by the source, and reduce the apparent driver impedance seen by the load, avoiding signal attenuation by voltage division. This advantage is not restricted to voltage amplifiers, but analogous improvements in matching can be arranged for current amplifiers, transconductance amplifiers and transresistance amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|From the top down, the TEM {{consists}} of an emission source, which may be a tungsten filament or needle, or a lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) single crystal source. The gun is connected to a high <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> (typically ~100–300 kV) and, given sufficient current, the gun will begin to emit electrons either by thermionic or field electron emission into the vacuum. The electron source is typically mounted in a Wehnelt cylinder to provide preliminary focus of the emitted electrons into a beam. The upper lenses of the TEM then further focus the electron beam to the desired size and location.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of PTC thermistors being powered also is extremely useful. When first {{connected to a}} <b>voltage</b> <b>source,</b> a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. They are also used in the degaussing circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions where the degaussing coil only has to be connected in series with an appropriately chosen thermistor; a particular advantage is that the current decrease is smooth, producing optimum degausing effect. Improved degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the thermistor further (and reduce the final current) or timed relays to disconnect the degaussing circuit entirely after it has operated.|$|E
25|$|Most {{multimeters}} {{include a}} fuse, or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent {{damage to the}} multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance <b>voltage</b> <b>source.</b> Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation {{has led to the}} creation of the IEC61010 categories to rate the safety and robustness of meters.|$|E
25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Multilevel {{inverters}} {{produce a}} staircase output voltage from DC <b>voltage</b> <b>sources.</b> Requiring {{great number of}} semiconductor switches is main disadvantage of multilevel inverters. The multilevel inverters can be divided in two groups: symmetric and asymmetric converters. The asymmetric multilevel inverters provide {{a large number of}} output steps without increasing the number of DC <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> and components. In this paper, a novel topology for multilevel converters is proposed using cascaded sub-multilevel Cells. This sub-multilevel converters can produce five levels of voltage. Four algorithms for determining the DC <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> magnitudes have been presented. Finally, in order to verify the theoretical issues, simulation is presented...|$|R

500|$|Analogues {{exist for}} the active {{electrical}} elements of the <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> and the current source (generators). [...] The mechanical analogue in the impedance analogy of the constant voltage generator is the constant force generator. [...] The mechanical analogue of the constant current generator is the constant velocity generator.|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} a {{constant}} force generator is the constant-force spring. [...] An {{example of a}} practical constant velocity generator is a lightly loaded powerful machine, such as a motor, driving a belt. [...] This is analogous to a real <b>voltage</b> <b>source,</b> such as a battery, which remains near constant-voltage with load provided that the load resistance {{is much higher than}} the battery internal resistance.|$|E
500|$|Harrison used Campbell's {{image filter}} theory, {{which was the}} most {{advanced}} filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem. More advanced filter theory was {{brought to bear on}} this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being [...] "maximally flat". Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter. The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter, that is, one driven by an ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, making it hard to recognise the design for what it is. Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the series capacitor, which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm. This is the only series capacitor in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a low-pass prototype. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the [...] "turning round the L" [...] impedance transform to achieve this.|$|E

Because the method can {{take into account the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>sources,</b> the external impedances, and the nonlinearity of the core it becomes possible to analyze flux and current distributions under actual operating conditions and to design windings which produce the minimum power loss.

The controller design comprises to steps: the design of the phase compensation network and the calculation of the controller gain. The design of damping controllers of static series <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> has required the development of eigenvalue sensitivities with respect to the modulation of both the ratio and the phase of static series <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> using several input signals to select the most adequate one.

2500|$|The {{voltage rating}} of the fuse must be equal to or, greater than, {{what would become the}} {{open-circuit}} voltage.

[...] Plasma inside the glass tube may continue to conduct current until the current diminishes {{to the point where the}} plasma becomes a non-conducting gas.

A similar circuit modified {{to act as a}} current-to-voltage converter enables the instrument to measure currents as small as a few femtoamperes. [...] Combined with an internal <b>voltage</b> <b>source,</b> the current measuring mode can be adapted to measure very high resistances, of the order of 1017 ohms. Finally, by calculation from the known capacitance of the electrometer's input terminal, the instrument can measure very small electric charges, down to a small fraction of a picocoulomb.|$|E
2500|$|Analog meters {{can measure}} {{voltage and current}} by using power from the test circuit, but require a {{supplementary}} internal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> for resistance testing, while electronic meters always require an internal power supply to run their internal circuitry.

Testing often requires that the component under test be isolated from the circuit {{in which they are}} mounted, as otherwise stray or leakage current paths may distort measurements.

40|$|Abstract – Cascaded H-bridge {{multilevel}} inverters shows {{a useful}} circuit configuration {{to increase the}} number of output voltage levels to obtain high quality output voltage. By applying the concept of the power of three to dc <b>voltage</b> <b>sources,</b> it can increase the number of output voltage levels effectively. To realize this concept, two approaches may be considered. One is to use independent dc <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> pre-scaled in the power of three, and the other is to use instantaneous dc <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> generated from a cascaded transformer, which has the secondary turn-ratios scaled in the power of three in sequence. A common feature in both approaches is to use the concept of the power of three for dc <b>voltage</b> <b>sources,</b> and a point of difference is whether it adopts a low frequency transformer or not, and where the transformer is located. According to the difference, application areas are limited and show different characteristics on THD of output voltages.
