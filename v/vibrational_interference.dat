40|$|The {{evolution}} of the vibrational intensity distribution of the singly ionized A (2) Pi state in CO is experimentally examined for photon energy detunings below the adiabatic 0 - 0 transition of the O 1 s -> 2 pi resonance. We have found a strong suppression of the entire vibrational fine structure of this state, leading to its almost complete quenching for certain excitation energies, followed by a partial restoring for larger values of negative photon energy detuning. Our observation, that cannot be rationalized by the known model of a vibrational collapse for energy detuning, may be {{explained in terms of}} a Fano interference between the direct and resonant photoionization channels in the presence of strong lifetime <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{electronic}} excitation of a molecule by {{a sequence of}} two femtosecond phase-locked laser pulses is considered. In this case the <b>interference</b> between the <b>vibrational</b> wave packets induced by each of the subpulses within a single molecule takes place. It is shown that due to the dynamical squeezing effect of a molecular <b>vibrational</b> state the <b>interference</b> of the <b>vibrational</b> wave packets allows one to measure the duration of a femtosecond laser pulse. This can be achieved experimentally by measuring the dependence of the integral fluorescence of the excited molecule on the delay time between the subpulses.

40|$|Angular {{distributions}} of the N 2 O+(X) and N 2 O+(A) photoelectrons were measured as {{functions of the}} exciting-photon energy with small bandwidth {{in the vicinity of}} the resonant Nt(1 s→π∗), Nt(1 s→σ∗), and Nc(1 s→π∗) core excitations of N 2 O. For selected exciting-photon energies in this range, angular distribution parameters of the N 2 O+(A→X) fluorescence were also determined. These data are interpreted by ab initio calculations. Long-range exciting-photon energy dependencies of the photoelectron angular distribution parameters βeX(ω) and βeA(ω), recorded vibrationally unresolved, are attributed to an electronic state interference between the direct and the different resonant amplitudes for the population of the final ionic states.

40|$|International audienceAngular {{distributions}} of the Auger electrons and subsequent fluorescence photons are studied theoretically and experimentally {{in the vicinity}} of the core excitations of NO. In the calculations, lifetime <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> and electronic states interference were taken into account ab initio. The interference between excitation-deexcitation amplitudes for transitions via symmetry different intermediate resonances 1 s − 1 2 π 2 (2 ∆, 2 Σ ±), which is forbidden in the solid-angle-averaged or magic-angle-recorded decay spectra, plays a crucial role in the formation of the angularly resolved decay spectra. Experimentally, angular distribution parameters for the NO + A 1 Π → X 1 Σ + fluorescence induced by linearly polarized synchrotron radiation are determined {{in the vicinity of}} the N * O resonance in the Raman regime for core excitation.

40|$|International audienceHigh-resolution {{electron}} spectroscopy {{studies of}} the NO molecule in the regions of the N 1 s→ 2 π core excitations have been performed. By selecting electrons within certain binding energy ranges, either the Auger electron yield - a good approximation for the x-ray absorption spectrum - or the electrons emitted after decay to a particular ionic final state (constant ionic state (CIS)) were detected. By selecting the X 1 Σ+ (2 π 0) final state, the superposition of several intermediate states can be disentangled by exploiting a selection rule which permits {{only two of the}} three dipole-allowed intermediate states to decay to this specific final state. This makes it possible to obtain more detailed information on the potential energy curves of the intermediate states than is available from regular absorption measurements. We have also obtained CIS spectra for individual vibrational sublevels within this state. The role of lifetime <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> on the appearance of these spectra is discussed...|$|E
30|$|The {{size of the}} PMD {{is related}} to the density of SOAEs in an ear (Figure[*] 4). For high-multiple SOAEs it amounts to ca 100 Cent, and for low- and medium-multiple SOAEs it amounts to ca 90 Cent, a {{difference}} that is statistically significant (Results, part 2). The physical basis of this difference may lie in the fact that in an ear with high emitter density there is a relevant probability that an emitter has close-range neighbors on both sides, as shown in Figure[*] 2. The summation of destructive <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> from two sides is likely to extend the range of effective suppression. In an ear with many emitters, a single emitter would, on average, need more space to survive suppression from neighbors. This variation of the PMD is therefore consistent with the general indication, derived from the group simulations (Figure[*] 3), that the PMD phenomenon is an effect of graded probability of close-range suppression.|$|E

Interference between {{the direct and}} resonant amplitudes for {{the population of the}} CO + (A 2 Π) state {{in the vicinity of the}} O 1 s → 2 π excitation of CO * is studied by an ab initio theoretical approach. The weak direct photoionization induces Fano-Shore type profiles resulting in long-range exciting-photon energy dependencies of the computed angular distribution parameters for the CO + (A 2 Π) photoelectrons, β e A (ω), and for the subsequent CO + A 2 Π → X 2 Σ + fluorescence, β 2 X A (ω). In the presence of the direct photoionization, the lifetime <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> causes substantial variations of the computed parameter β e A (ω) across the positions of the CO * (v r) vibronic states.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} role of nuclear degrees of freedom in the x-ray absorption, x-ray resonant scattering  and some aspects of the interaction of matter with strong laser fields. Most numerical simulations are performed with a time-dependent wave-packet program that have proved its robustness  in previous investigations. The relevant experimental results are also presented for comparison when available. The first problem considered in the thesis is the possibility of obtaining x-ray absorption spectra with resolution beyond the natural lifetime broadening of the core-excited electronic states. It is shown that the method of measuring x-ray absorptionin the resonant scattering mode suggested earlier for that purpose exhibits severe limitations originating from the lifetime <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> between the intermediate core-excited vibrational levels. However, a broad class of molecules is found for which spectra with super-high resolution can indeed be obtained. These molecules have parallel potential energy surfaces of the core-excited and final states for the x-ray scattering process. The interpretations of two interesting cases of x-ray absorption and Auger scattering follow. The first one is related to scattering through a doubly excited Π state in the CO molecule. A Doppler split feature near 299. 4 eV and strong scattering anisotropy are  observed. Both features are well explained and reproduced by the theory. Next, theelectron-vibrational fine structure of the excitation for O 2 is investigated by means of different models. We are able to single out the electronic states and interpotential crossing points responsible for the peculiar absorption profile. Based on these findings we explain and reproduce the x-ray Auger scattering spectra through the same excitation. Here we encounter a rather unusual situation in which the Auger spectra are affected by three types of the interference: Apart from the lifetime <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference,</b> a strong interference between two intermediate electronic states and an interference with the direct-scattering amplitude is also present. The process of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) is investigated in the context of formation of amplified spontaneous emissions (ASE) inside laser-pumped gain media. IVR raises to a higher energy region the threshold pump intensity after which blue-shifted ASE is observed. Finally, we suggest a new scheme of x-ray pump-probe spectroscopy based on the core-hole hopping in N 2 induced by an infrared laser field. We investigate the result from the core-hole hoping on the vibrational structure of the x-ray absorption profile. Furthermore, by populating core-excited states with opposite parities, the laser field opens up symmetry forbidden resonant inelastic scattering channels, which can give new insights about the electronic structure of matter.

40|$|The {{structure}} of bulk liquid water was recently probed by x ray scattering below the temperature limit of homogeneous nucleation TH of amp; 8764; 232 K [J. A. Sellberg et al., Nature 510, 381 384 2014]. Here, we utilize {{a similar approach}} to study the {{structure of}} bulk liquid water below TH using oxygen K edge x ray emission spectroscopy XES. Based on previous XES experiments [T. Tokushima et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 460, 387 400 2008] at higher temperatures, we expected {{the ratio of the}} 1 b 1 amp; 8242; and 1 b 1 amp; 8242; amp; 8242; peaks associated with the lone pair orbital in water to change strongly upon deep supercooling as the coordination of the hydrogen H bonds becomes tetrahedral. In contrast, we observed only minor changes in the lone pair spectral region, challenging an interpretation in terms of two interconverting species. A number of alternative hypotheses to explain the results are put forward and discussed. Although the spectra can be explained by various contributions from these hypotheses, we here emphasize the interpretation that the line shape of each component changes dramatically when approaching lower temperatures, where, in particular, the peak assigned to the proposed disordered component would become more symmetrical as <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> becomes more importan...|$|E
40|$|The normal Auger {{electron}} {{spectrum of}} the O- 2 molecule is assigned in detail {{on the basis of}} ab initio valence configuration interaction (CI) wavefunctions. Potential energy curves of the ground state, the core-ionized states and the doubly charged final states are calculated and Auger decay rates are obtained with the one-centre approximation. Using the lifetime <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> method, band shapes are obtained for all contributions to the Auger spectrum. The calculated Auger electron spectrum allows us to identify all features observed experimentally. Significant differences to previous assignments are reported. A quantitative simulation of the spectrum is given {{on the basis of a}} curve-fitting procedure, in which the energetic positions and intensities of the theoretical bands were optimized. Besides providing a basis for a refined analysis of the spectrum, the fit allows us to assess the accuracy of the calculation. As expected for this level of theory, the absolute accuracy of the valence CI energies is found to be about 0. 3 eV. The inherent error of the one-centre transition rates is less than 5 % of the most intense transition in the spectrum. The frequently questioned one-centre Auger transition rates are shown to be rather appropriate if applied with reasonable wavefunctions and if the vibrational band structure of the molecular spectrum is properly taken into account...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{studies which}} focus on addressing, using both theoretical and experimental methods, fundamental questions about surface phenomena, such as chemical reactions and bonding, related to processes in heterogeneous catalysis. The main {{focus is on}} the theoretical approach and this aspect of the results. The included articles are collected into three categories of which the first contains detailed studies of model systems in heterogeneous catalysis. For example, the trimerization of acetylene adsorbed on Cu(110) is measured using vibrational spectroscopy and modeled within the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and quantitative agreement of the reaction barriers is obtained. In the second category, aspects of fuel cell catalysis are discussed. O 2 dissociation is rate-limiting for the reduction of oxygen (ORR) under certain conditions and we find that adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are decisive when modeling this reaction step. Oxidation of Pt(111) (Pt is the electrocatalyst), which may alter the overall activity of the catalyst, is found to start via a PtO-like surface oxide while formation of α-PtO 2 trilayers precedes bulk oxidation. When considering alternative catalyst materials for the ORR, their stability needs to be investigated in detail under realistic conditions. The Pt/Cu(111) skin alloy offers a promising candidate but segregation of Cu atoms to the surface is induced by O adsorption. This is confirmed by modeling oxygen x-ray emission (XES) and absorption spectra of the segregated system and near-perfect agreement with experiment is obtained when <b>vibrational</b> <b>interference</b> effects are included in the computed XES. The last category shows results from femtosecond laser measurements of processes involving CO on Ru(0001). Using free-electron x-ray laser experiments a precursor state to desorption is detected and also found in simulations if van der Waals effects are included. Resonant XES can be used to distinguish two different species of CO on the surface; vibrationally hot, chemisorbed CO and CO in the precursor state. Laser-induced CO oxidation on Ru(0001) is modeled and three competing mechanisms are found. Kinetic modeling reproduces the experiment qualitatively.
