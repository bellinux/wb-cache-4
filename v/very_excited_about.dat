The idea for the range originated with the firm's marketing director, Dilys Day, who explained: [...] "I was brought up on hotpot and Coronation Street.

500|$|Drowning Girl {{depicted}} {{the advancement of}} Lichtenstein's cartoon work, which represented his 1961 departure from his abstract expressionism period, from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and wartime armed forces. Lichtenstein said that, at the time, [...] "I was <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about,</b> and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images." [...] Lichtenstein parodied four Picassos between 1962 and 1963. Picasso's depictions of weeping women may have influenced Lichtenstein to produce portrayals of vulnerable teary-eyed women, such as the subjects of Hopeless and Drowning Girl. Another possible influence on his emphasis on depicting distressed women in the early- to mid-1960s was that his first marriage was dissolving at the time. Lichtenstein's first marriage to Isabel Wilson, which resulted in two sons, lasted from 1949 to 1965; the couple separated in 1963.|$|E
500|$|No Stairway {{was first}} self-released on Bandcamp and Glassine's {{official}} SoundCloud page on April 17, 2015. In the same year, on August 6, record label Patient Sounds distributed the album on cassette.

Live at Guitar Center, an album by Brookyln musician Noah Wall that also used Guitar Center recordings, was released slightly before the Glassine album on April 6. When Greenwald and Patient Sounds accidentally found out about Wall's record, he almost didn't want to release No Stairway, feeling [...] "gutted" [...] someone had already made an album with an identical concept to his project. However, when the label made Wall aware of Greenwald's release, he was <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> the album and his support got Greenwald motivated again to distribute his record. Greenwald has not sent No Stairway to the company despite suggestion to do so from his relatives.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} three semesters, I {{have been working on}} {{refining}} my Honors Thesis to meet exactly what I wanted to study. This is why when looking at what I wanted to focus on it, it was obvious that I wanted to integrate musical performance with a visual performance—similar to what a Video Disc Jockey (VDJ) might incorporate into a live set. Currently, there are a quite a few percussion pieces that use Max patches that process the sounds, or use pre-made visuals that play along with the music. My goal with this Thesis was {{to find a way to}} use a patch with the music that reacts to the visuals in real time. What makes this different from other performances is that each performance will be slightly different than the one before it or after it. To me, this is something that I find <b>very</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>about</b> music and technology. Throughout this essay, I will explain how I approach composing a piece specifically for this as well as my learning process to integrate a Max patch with the Music...|$|R

500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> that. We all did. We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E
500|$|Planet of the Titans was {{expected}} to be filmed in the United Kingdom in order to keep production costs low. In July 1976, Jerry Isenberg was assigned to be executive producer of the new film and British writers Bryant and Scott were hired in September. The duo had no science fiction writing experience, but had written the films Don't Look Now (1973) and Joseph Andrews (1977). Roddenberry defended the hiring of the pair, saying [...] "I'm <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> some of the ideas they've come up with. The concept that only a science fiction writer can write science fiction motion pictures is ridiculous. Look at me. I came up with Star Trek, and I was a dramatic writer. I wrote for TV." [...] Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Their 20-page treatment was submitted the following month. It was entitled Planet of the Titans and was received favourably by Diller and fellow executive Michael Eisner. The writers were told by Paramount to proceed to script on October 6.|$|E

It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to say that she was <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to listen to what they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and she {{thought it would be a}} great opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E

Carter noted that, [...] "we had talked about possibly revisiting some old monster this season, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity." [...] The writers and producers decided to take [...] "Orison" [...] in a [...] "substantial new direction". Although Donnie Pfaster was originally portrayed as a [...] "death fetishist", his nature was non-supernatural. In [...] "Orison", however, {{it was decided to}} make Pfaster into a true demon. Shiban explained [...] "we decided late in the process to turn him into this totally demonic character, essentially evil as an entity." [...] Spotnitz was <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> bringing closure to the Pfaster-Scully story. He explained, [...] "For me, what really justified bringing Donnie back was the final act of the script when Donnie comes for Scully and she ends up shooting him full of holes." [...] The final scene, however, proved difficult to script. Director Rob Bowman noted, that the act [...] "was a tough scene. Frank and I had spoken on the phone about the dialogue in the wrap-up scene with Mulder and Scully.

Sega boss Mike Hayes {{also said that the}} game was going to be [...] "very much a triple-A project. We want this to be a peer to the likes of Dead Space 2." [...] Although the game's name was anticipated following a trademark registration in October 2013 and some screenshots of the game were leaked in December 2013, Alien: Isolation was formally announced and confirmed for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One platforms with the release of a teaser trailer on 7 January 2014. The developers also stated that they were not worried about the fact that Sega's previous Alien game, , received a negative public reaction. According to Napper, [...] "It did completely reaffirm to us that there was a massive Alien fanbase out there [...] just to see such a vocal reaction to the game, everything that they've said they want is something that we're building and we're <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|E

Lead singer Bono said of the new relationship, [...] "I'm <b>very</b> <b>excited</b> <b>about</b> this. Research in Motion is going to give us what Apple wouldn't: access to their labs and their people so we can do something really spectacular." [...] The explicit corporate sponsorship of a tour was a first for the group, and was due to the anticipated production costs being higher than for any previous U2 tour. The first commercials for a new Blackberry application, called the [...] "U2 Mobile App", began airing in early July 2009 against the song [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight"; the application allows the user to listen to the album No Line on the Horizon, contains a news section which features updates about the tour, and an interactive section that allows the sharing of images and enables the user to see their position during a concert relative to the band and other application users.
