5|$|Wolf Cub leaders briefly {{followed}} a separate training system beginning in 1922, {{in which they}} were awarded the Akela Badge on completion. The badge was a single fang on a leather thong. Wolf Cub Leader Trainers wore two fangs. The Akela Badge was discontinued in 1925, and all leaders were awarded the Wood Badge on completion of their training. <b>Very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fangs issued as Akela Badges can now be found.|$|E
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E

5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of travel in the late 18th century, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected delegates were present on the designated day of May 14, 1787, and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was secured. (New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until more than halfway through the proceedings, on July 23.) James Madison arrived first, and soon most of the Virginia delegation arrived. While waiting for the other delegates, the Virginia delegation produced the Virginia Plan, which was designed and written by James Madison. On May 25, the delegations convened in the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E
5|$|The IJN {{continued}} to suffer losses and damage to its ships {{in attempting to}} keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American PT boat and CAF air attacks during subsequent resupply missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supplies carried on these missions actually reached Japanese army forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began telling their army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the resupply effort threatened future strategic plans for protecting the Japanese Empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and {{the general population of}} the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen.

5|$|Æthelberht (Old English: Æðelbrihte), {{also called}} Saint Ethelbert the King, (died 20 May 794 at Sutton Walls, Herefordshire) was an eighth-century saint and a king of East Anglia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom which today {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Little {{is known of}} his reign, which may have begun in 779, according to later sources, and <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins issued during his reign have been discovered.

5|$|De la Colonie {{was one of}} the few to escape, but the Elector of Bavaria {{had lost}} many of his best troops which was to have a {{profound}} effect on the ability of the Franco-Bavarian forces to face the Allies in the rest of the campaign. <b>Very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men who had defended the Schellenberg rejoined the Elector's and Marsin's army. Included amongst this number, however, were the Comte d'Arco and his second-in-command, the Marquis de Maffei, both of whom later defended Lutzingen at the Battle of Blenheim. Of the 22,000 Allied troops engaged, over 5,000 had become casualties, overwhelming the hospitals that Marlborough had set up in Nördlingen. Amongst the Allied fatalities were six lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, and 28 brigadiers, colonels and lieutenant-colonels, reflecting the exposed positions of senior officers as they led their men forward in the assaults. No other action in the War of the Spanish Succession claimed so many lives of senior officers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|Permission for Blyth A Power Station {{to be built}} {{was granted}} in February 1955, and its {{construction}} took place between 1955 and 1960. The station's first unit went into operation in December 1958, and the A Station was fully operational by June 1960. Its four 120MW sets were the first commissioned in Britain of what became for a time that standardised size. The construction of the B Station began on 4December 1961. Its first unit was commissioned in December 1962, {{and the rest of}} the station was fully operational by September 1966. The station had a total generating capacity of 1,730MW, the highest of any site in the UK until later in the same year, when Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation. Blyth B was the first power station in Britain to have 275MW sets installed. Its two 350MW sets were an intermediate stage toward the 500MW standard, so <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 350MW sets were ever commissioned in the UK. Both of the stations were designed by L J Couves & Partners. They were engineered by Merz & McLellan and built by the Cleveland Bridge Company.|$|E
5|$|The AN {{comprised}} one {{battalion of}} infantry of 1,000men hurriedly enlisted in Sydney, plus 500naval reservists and ex-sailors who {{would serve as}} infantry. The 1st Battalion, AN was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Russell Watson, while the naval reservists were formed into six companies under Commander Joseph Beresford. Also included were two machine gun sections, a signals section and a medical detachment. Another battalion of militia from the Queensland-based Kennedy Regiment—which had been dispatched to garrison Thursday Island—also contributed 500volunteers. Recruitment began on 11 August, with the <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infantry having had previous military experience. Under the overall command of Colonel William Holmes, the force departed Sydney on 19 August aboard HMAS Berrima and halted at Palm Island off Townsville until a New Zealand force, escorted by the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, cruiser HMAS Melbourne and the French cruiser Montcalm, occupied Samoa on 30 August. The AN then moved to Port Moresby, where it met the Queensland contingent already aboard the transport Kanowna. The force sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, although Kanowna was left behind when her stokers refused to work. The militia were also left in Port Moresby after Holmes decided they were not sufficiently trained or equipped {{to be committed to}} the anticipated fighting.|$|E

5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of}} the dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E
5|$|The predilection {{of insects}} for this {{mushroom}} was noted by 19th-century British mycologist Anna Maria Hussey, {{who wrote in}} 1847: there are <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soft-fleshed tribes, {{all of which are}} the nurseries of innumerable insects, so much in favour as the poisonous Boletus luridus, on breaking an old one it is a living mass of larvae. Our present subject is so soon attacked by insects that it is very rare to find specimens devoid of wriggling life, and being a very common and abundant kind, it must be of great service in the economy of insect existence. Several fly species have been recorded feeding on the fruit bodies, including Phaonia boleticola, P.rufipalpis, Thricops diaphanus, and, in North America, Drosophila falleni, Pegomya mallochi, P.winthemi, Megaselia pygmaeoides, and Muscina assimilis. In contrast, slugs tend to avoid consuming this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained {{there was always a}} mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

5|$|<b>Very</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animators at the Disney studio had had artistic {{training}} (most {{had been}} newspaper cartoonists); among these few was Grim Natwick, who had trained in Europe. The animator's success in designing and animating Betty Boop for Fleischer Studios showed {{an understanding of}} human female anatomy, and when Walt Disney hired Natwick he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of The Goddess of Spring, had proved largely unsuccessful; Natwick's animation of the heroine in Cookie Carnival showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists' animators disapproved of rotoscoping, considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. None of Babbit's animation of the Queen was rotoscoped; despite Graham and Natwick's objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live-action footage.|$|E
