50|$|A {{tourbillon}} has {{no effect}} on the change in rate that accompanies a change in attitude from dial horizontal (dial up or down) to dial vertical (pendant up, down, left or right). This change in rate between horizontal and vertical is much greater than rate changes between different vertical positions. Breguet designed the tourbillon for pocket watches that are kept in a vertical position in the waistcoat pocket, and can be maintained in this vertical position overnight by hanging on a suitable stand, and in this <b>vertical</b> <b>attitude</b> a tourbillon is effective. However, the attitude of a wrist watch changes frequently from vertical to horizontal depending on what its wearer is doing. The effect of a tourbillon is small compared to the change in rate resulting from changes from vertical to horizontal, and vice versa. Inclined tourbillons such as those made by Greubel Forsey are an improvement in this regard.|$|E
40|$|Seepage forces {{result from}} fluid flow through a porous medium, in {{response}} to an overpressure gradient, according to Darcy's Law. As the fluid flows past each grain or element of the solid framework, frictional drag and a local difference in pore pressure impart a seepage force to the grain. This contributes to the local balance of forces and modifies the effective stress in the solid framework. The critical factor is neither the rate of Darcy flow, nor the permeability, but the magnitude of the overpressure gradient. Over the past few years, experiments on fluid flow through porous granular materials have demonstrated the importance of seepage forces, especially at high values of overpressure, close to the overburden stress. By modifying the effective stresses, seepage forces may cause shear faults and tensile fractures to nucleate in various orientations. 1. In a thrust belt or a large gravity slide, where overpressure ramps up across a sealing layer of low permeability, incipient shear faults have listric shapes and curve into a layer-parallel detachment. This has major consequences for the structural development of deltas. 2. In strike-slip zones, where overpressure comes from a deep source, seepage forces have significant horizontal components, as well as vertical ones. The horizontal components reduce the frictional resistance on the main strike-slip zone and produce through-going faults, instead of oblique Riedel shears. 3. In cohesive materials, fluid overpressure may result in internal hydraulic fracturing. The vertical gradient of overpressure may attain or exceed the overburden stress. In basins, which are subject to no horizontal tectonic stress, hydraulic fractures may initiate in horizontal attitudes, rather than the more conventional <b>vertical</b> <b>attitudes.</b> 4. Non-cohesive layers may fluidize and the resulting material may intrude more cohesive layers, forming sand injectites, or may extrude at the free surface, forming gravity flows. 5. In composite materials, which consist in part of grains that can melt or transform to a liquid phase, heating from below may result in loss of support within the solid framework. The settling of grains through the pore fluid then results in seepage forces, which set up an overpressure gradient in the pore fluid. This in turn may lead to horizontal hydraulic fracturing, migration of the liquid fraction, and extrusion at the surface...|$|R

40|$|The Barberton greenstone belt in South Africa is an Early- to Mid-Archaean, very low-grade {{metamorphic}} supracrustal {{belt that}} is bordered {{in the south}} by a mid- to lower crustal gneiss terrain. Detailed mapping of the contacts between the supracrustal and gneiss domains along the southern margin of the greenstone belt shows that the supracrustal rocks are separated from the high-grade metamorphic gneiss terrain by an extensional detachment that is situated at {{and close to the}} base of the belt. The extensional detachment is approximately 1 -km wide and its location corresponds with the heterogeneous, mélange-like rocks of the Theespruit Formation. Within the detachment zone, two main strain regimes can be distinguished. Amphibolite-facies rocks at and below the granite-greenstone contacts are characterized by rodded gneisses and strongly lineated amphibolite-facies mylonites. The bulk constrictional deformation at these lower structural levels records, in a subhorizontal orientation, the vertical shortening and horizontal, NE-SW directed stretching of the mid-crustal rocks. The prolate, coaxial fabrics are overprinted by greenschist-facies mylonites at higher structural levels that cut progressively deeper into the underlying high-grade basement rocks. These mylonites have developed during non-coaxial strain and kinematic indicators consistently point to a top-to-the-NE sense of movement of the greenstone sequence with respect to the lower structural levels. This relationship between bulk coaxial NE-SW stretching of mid-crustal basement rocks and non-coaxial, top-to-the-NE shearing along retrograde mylonites at upper crustal levels is consistent with an extensional orogenic collapse of the belt and the concomittant exhumation of deeper crustal levels. The exhumation was initiated under amphibolite-facies conditions at depths of approximately 18 km. The extensional collapse is coeval with or shortly follows the main D 2 collisional event in the Barberton greenstone belt at ca. 3230 - 3220 Ma. Voluminous plutonism at ca. 3225 Ma along the northern margin of the belt is possibly related to the orogenic collapse and associated decompression melting of lower crustal rocks. The extensional collapse coincides with the onset of the coarse-clastic Moodies Group sedimentation which suggests that the small, isolated Moodies basins formed as supradetachment basins in the collapsing hanging wall of the detachment. The steepening of lithologies and fabrics to their present-day <b>vertical</b> <b>attitudes</b> is ascribed to a late-stage solid-state diapiric component of the exhumed hot and buoyant basement gneisses that underlie the relatively cool and dense mafic and ultramafic supracrustal succession. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reactivation}} of faults with near-optimal orientations {{is commonly}} considered {{to control the}} state of stress in the crust. Near the surface, where a principal stress direction is <b>vertical,</b> the <b>attitude</b> of such faults is explained by Anderson's theory. This raises the questions of how prevalent this type of faulting actually is in current seismicity, down to what depth it frequently occurs, and what range of friction angles explains it best. The Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog is analyzed to address these questions. Dip-slip and strike-slip mechanisms are dominant, and oblique slips are relatively rare for well-constrained events with depths shallower than 30 km. Preferred Andersonian faulting is the simplest, but not the unique, explanation for this dominance. Isolating reverse, strike- slip, and normal events reveals an asymmetry {{in the distribution of}} nodal plane dips and plunges of the P, B, and T axes between reverse and normal faulting. Assuming that the most frequent events correspond to reactivation near optimal orientations yields 40 - 60 degrees and 0 - 20 degrees friction angles for reverse and normal faults, respectively. This indicates that reverse and normal faulting mechanics are not symmetrical with respect to stress configuration as predicted by Anderson's theory...|$|R
