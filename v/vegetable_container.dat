These included seven different textile weaves, which {{appeared to have been}} used for clothing, bags, matting, and possibly blankets and ponchos. Numerous other artifacts, such as atlatls and projectile points, were also found at Windover. The occupants of Windover hunted animals, fished, and gathered plants. They used bottle gourds for storage, which comprise the earliest evidence for <b>vegetable</b> <b>container</b> storage discovered in North America. Animal bones and shells found in the graves indicated that the people ate white-tailed deer, raccoon, opossum, birds, fish and shellfish.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{potential health}} {{risks associated with}} the consumption of commonly consumed leafy vegetables, Amaranthus hybridus (tepe), Brassica oleracea (cabbage) and Spinacia oleracea (spinach) in the gold mining town of Kanana in North West Province, where these three plants were the most commonly consumed. Structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 40 households to determine their socioeconomic status and the consumption patterns of vegetables (cultivated and wild plants). Along with interviews, plant samples were sampled in home gardens and at various harvesting locations in the wild for chemical analysis. Finally, analysis of mercury content in the sampled three leafy vegetable species was performed to ascertain the contributions of the vegetables to the dietary mercury intake among a predominantly young and poor subpopulation of Kanana, which was found to be largely dependent on state welfare grants and on the cultivation and gathering of wild plants for survival. The study found that all three leafy vegetable species under analysis had mercury concentrations that exceeded the maximum permitted by the World Health Organisation. The highest mean mercury concentrations were found in A. hybridus 0. 287 μg/g dry mass and the lowest in S. oleracea 0. 128 μg/g dry mass. Equally, mercury ingestion through the three leafy vegetables by adults in the surveyed subgroups of Kanana exceeded thresholds prescribed by the (2007). Based on consumption patterns, dietary mercury intake by adults exceeded the recommended limits by one order of magnitude, with yearly dose exceeding by as much as four and three orders of magnitude. Long term mercury exposure can cause damage to the central nervous system and chronic intoxication. The surveyed subpopulation is therefore exposed to health risks from mercury toxicity. To ensure food safety and to protect the residents from metal toxicity, awareness programmes are recommended to educate communities living in the vicinity of mines to avoid the areas of highest contamination, such as the artisanal mine dumps and (in this case) the Schoonspruit stream, and to control the artisanal use of mercury. Alternative vegetable gardening methods such as <b>vegetable</b> <b>container</b> gardening using unpolluted soil can also be implemented for the community. In addition, remediation of all the sites where local people cultivate vegetables and gather edible wild plants should be considered where feasible. The insights gained through the study should be used to inform local land use planning and create awareness among personnel from local regulators and development agencies. The insights {{can also be used to}} inform environmental management planning processes, risk mitigation and social impact assessment for industries in the region, in particular those involved in mining.

5000|$|False-positive {{reactions}} due to menstrual contamination may be seen. They {{also occur}} if strong oxidizing detergents {{are present in}} the specimen <b>container.</b> <b>Vegetable</b> peroxidase and bacterial enzymes, including an Escherichia coli peroxidase, may also cause false-positive reactions. Therefore, sediments containing bacteria should be checked closely for the presence of red blood cells. Traditionally, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been associated with false-negative reagent strip reactions for blood. Both Multitistix and Chemstrip have modified their reagent strips to reduce this interference to very high levels of ascorbic acid, and Chemstip overlays the reagent pad with an iodate-impregnated mesh that oxidizes the ascorbic acid prior to its reaching the reaction pad. False-negative reactions can result when urine with a high specific gravity contains crenated red blood cells that do not lyse when they come in contact with the reagent pad. Decreased reactivity may also be seen when formalin is used as a preservative or when the hypertension medication captopril or high concentration of nitrite are present. Red blood cells settle {{to the bottom of the}} specimen container, and failure to mix the specimen prior to testing causes a falsely decreased reading.|$|R
40|$|Current day {{perishable}} supply chains require intermediate {{points for}} manual produce quality inspection. Over {{the last decade}} international seatransport of fruit and <b>vegetables</b> in reefer <b>containers</b> has grown tremendously. Reefer containers may completely close the cold chain only if produce quality inspection is automated. The observation of this growing need for automatic produce quality monitoring has triggered this research. The aim is twofold: to reveal a correlation between fruit gas exchange rates and actual produce quality aspects (1) and to automatically monitor fruit's gas exchange rates in containers from one-point gas concentration measurements only (2). Large experimental datasets have been collected to assess the correlation between respiration, ethylene production and ripeness-related firmness for Elstar apples. Both simulations and experiments have been done to test the feasibility of monitoring (variations in) respiratory activity over time. On the one hand the results prove that both objectives are feasible, at least for Elstar apples. On the other hand some uncertainties remain: 1. Uncertainty in the observed correlation between gas exchange rates and apple firmness, 2. On-line monitoring of gas exchange rates in reefer containers may be hampered by e. g. unknown leak rates, 3. To what extend may the observed correlation between quality aspects and gas exchange rates be generalised to other perishable commodities...|$|R
