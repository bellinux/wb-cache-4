This scheme was designed to protect against a 1000lb warhead, and had been tested and found effective in full-scale trials. The SPS was also a key component of the ship's damage control system, as lists resulting from flooding could be corrected by counterflooding empty <b>void</b> <b>spaces,</b> and/or draining normally liquid filled compartments. In the case of the loss of the Prince of Wales these spaces were used for counterflooding to reduce list.|$|E

Homogeneous tin films with significant <b>void</b> <b>space</b> accommodate the volume change during tin lithiation/delithiation. Through adjusting the electrodeposition currents and time, the morphologies and <b>void</b> <b>space</b> of tin films on graphite paper are controllable. At fixed electrodeposition current densities, the prolonged electrodeposition time {{plays the role}} in growing big tin particles and resulting the disappearance of <b>void</b> <b>space</b> among tin particles.

25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the <b>void</b> <b>spaces</b> are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
500|$|The mines caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated [...] off the port bow. A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed {{in the bottom of}} the ship, and bulkheads in the double bottom buckled. Some [...] of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and <b>void</b> <b>spaces</b> in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a list of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No. 1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings. The ship's two Arado Ar 196 floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin remarked that the successful repair effort was [...] "one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War." [...] Repairs lasted until 2 April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.|$|E

In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high {{overhead}} {{to begin their}} runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed {{by the number of}} targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. Yamatos main guns were loaded with Beehive shells fused to explode one second after firing—a mere [...] from the ship—but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fireroom that had already been hit, one impacted a different fireroom, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth, unconfirmed, hit may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location. This attack left Yamato in a perilous position, listing ° to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard <b>void</b> <b>spaces</b> lessened this to °, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms.

Automation helps in enhancing the quality of processed food products. The Indian food: “KHAMAN”, a fermented snack, {{is made up of}} pulses powder, oil, curd as starter and water. Thoroughly mixed batter is steamed to produce desired quality spongy “KHAMAN”. The microstructure of this food product is directly related with the textural properties of the food. This paper describes the image processing techniques for the calculation of the <b>void</b> <b>space</b> of the Indian fermented food known as “KHAMAN ” using X-ray Microtomograpny (µCT). The X-ray Microtomogrphic images were used for the analysis of percentage <b>void</b> <b>space</b> in the cooked food. The analysis of <b>void</b> <b>space</b> (air measurement) was done using the volume analysis on the set of cross sectional images of the cooked food samples.

Experimental determination f the <b>void</b> <b>space</b> in several samples of an endellite specimen by means of density measurements made on water-saturated samples indicates that the mas-sive mineral contains 10 percent or less <b>void</b> <b>space.</b> It is concluded that endellite does not exist in a tubular form.

500|$|The Iowas torpedo {{defense was}} {{virtually}} {{the same as the}} South Dakotas, consisting of four longitudinal torpedo bulkheads behind the outer hull plating with a system depth of [...] to absorb the energy of a torpedo warhead. The extension of the armor belt to the triple bottom, where it tapers to a thickness of , serves as one of the torpedo bulkheads and was hoped to add to protection. Additionally, several compartments were liquid loaded in order for the torpedo bulkheads to elastically deform and absorb energy. The outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo, with the outer two compartments absorbing the shock and with any splinters or debris being stopped by the armored belt and the empty compartment behind it. However, the Navy discovered in caisson tests in 1938 and 1939 that this torpedo defense system was actually less effective than the previous design used on the North Carolina-class due to the rigidity of the lower armor belt causing leakage into adjacent compartments. To mitigate the effects, the liquid loading system was altered so that the two outermost compartments were filled, while the two inboard compartments were <b>void</b> <b>spaces.</b> Based on costly lessons in the Pacific theater, concerns were raised about the ability of the armor on these battleships to withstand aerial bombing, particularly high altitude bombing using armor piercing bombs. Developments such as the Norden bombsight further fueled these concerns. When these concerns surfaced nothing could be done to adequately address the problem. Furthermore, experience in the Pacific theater demonstrated that high altitude bombing was not particularly effective against maneuvering warships.|$|E

I wrote some part of these rambling remarks on a high ridge of rock and turf overlooking a stretch of the central counties; the rise was slight enough in reality, but the immediate ascent had been so steep and sudden that one could not avoid the fancy that on reaching the summit one would look down at the stars.

It is dedicated to the celebration of water and fire the two prime elements of all human ceremonial. Lastly, a station resembles the old religions rather than the new religions in this point, that people go there. In connection with this it should also be remembered that all popular places, all sites, actually used by the people, tend to retain the best routine of antiquity very much more than any localities or machines used by any privileged class. Things are not altered so quickly or completely by common people as they are by fashionable people. Ruskin could have found more memories of the Middle Ages in the Underground Railway than in the grand hotels outside the stations.

60|$|Now if {{this could}} be done consistently, and all the notes of nature given in this way an octave or two down, it would be right and {{necessary}} so to do: but be it observed, not only does nature surpass us in power of obtaining light {{as much as the}} sun surpasses white paper, but she also infinitely surpasses us in her power of shade. Her deepest shades are <b>void</b> <b>spaces</b> from which no light whatever is reflected to the eye; ours are black surfaces from which, paint as black as we may, a great deal of light is still reflected, and which, placed against one of nature's deep bits of gloom, would tell as distinct light. Here we are then, with white paper for our highest light, and visible illumined surface for our deepest shadow, set to run the gauntlet against nature, with the sun for her light, and vacuity for her gloom. It is evident that she can well afford to throw her material objects dark against the brilliant aerial tone of her sky, and yet give in those objects themselves a thousand intermediate distances and tones before she comes to black, or to anything like it--all the illumined surfaces of her objects being as distinctly and vividly brighter than her nearest and darkest shadows, as the sky is brighter than those illumined surfaces. But if we, against our poor, dull obscurity of yellow paint, instead of sky, insist on having the same relation of shade in material objects, we go {{down to the bottom of}} our scale at once; and what in the world are we to do then? Where are all our intermediate distances to come from?--how are we to express the aerial relations among the parts themselves, for instance, of foliage, whose most distant boughs are already almost black?--how are we to come up from this to the foreground, and when we have done so, how are we to express the distinction between its solid parts, already as dark as we can make them, and its vacant hollows, which nature has marked sharp and clear and black, among its lighted surfaces? It cannot but be evident at a glance, that if to any one of the steps from one distance to another, we give the same quantity of difference in pitch of shade which nature does, we must pay for this expenditure of our means by totally missing half a dozen distances, not a whit less important or marked, and so sacrifice a multitude of truths, to obtain one. And this, accordingly was the means by which the old masters obtained their (truth?) of tone. They chose those steps of distance which are the most conspicuous and noticeable--that for instance from sky to foliage, or from clouds to hills--and they gave these their precise pitch of difference in shade with exquisite accuracy of imitation. Their means were then exhausted, and they were obliged to leave their trees flat masses of mere filled-up outline, and to omit the truths of space in every individual part of their picture by the thousand. But this they did not care for; it saved them trouble; they reached their grand end, imitative effect; they thrust home just at the places where the common and careless eye looks for imitation, and they attained the broadest and most faithful appearance of truth of tone which art can exhibit.|$|E

40|$|As Charles Darwin first {{noted in}} 1881, {{earthworms}} through their burrowing and casting activities, {{play an important}} role in the creation and maintenance of soil structure. Burrowing activity leads to the reorganisation of voids and creation of macropores within the soil. This has implications for aeration and the flow properties of water through soils. Casting activity affects the structural stability of soil through the stabilisation of aggregates. The overall aim of this research project has been to investigate the effects of earthworm activity and diversity on <b>void</b> <b>space</b> and aggregation in an upland soil. This research has been carried out as part of NERC's Thematic Programme on Soil Biodiversity. The field site was located on the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute's experimental farm at Sourhope in the Scottish Borders. Three experiments were designed to investigate the impact of earthworms on soil fabric, with each experiment representing an increased level of system complexity. The simplest experiment took place in a controlled environment and used an artificial soil and different earthworm treatments. The second level of system complexity used soil from Sourhope which had its structure removed, and then earthworm and liming treatments applied. The most complex experiment also used Sourhope soil and liming and earthworm treatments, except in this case the soil was undisturbed. The effects of earthworms and liming on <b>void</b> <b>space</b> were characterised using saturated hydraulic conductivity to measure macroporosity, and image analysis to quantify total porosity and void size distribution. Aggregation was assessed through aggregate stability and point counts of earthworm excremental features. The effect of earthworm inoculation in the simplest experiment led to the reorganisation of voids through increased abundance of voids > 2 mm 2 in area, and decreases in the proportion of voids with an area 2 mm 2. No significant effects were observed on aggregation due to either liming or earthworm inoculation. In the most complex experiment, neither liming nor earthworm inoculation led to changes in <b>void</b> <b>space</b> or aggregation, except for an increase in saturated hydraulic conductivity and therefore macroporosity due to earthworm inoculation. The overall conclusions from this research were that as system complexity increased, then the effects of the treatments on <b>void</b> <b>space</b> and aggregation became more difficult to isolate.
