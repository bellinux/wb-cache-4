40|$|Asymmetric {{hydrogenation}} {{has emerged}} as a versatile methodology to obtain a wide range of chiral precursors. This thesis focused on the synthesis of new chiral ligands and the expansion of the substrate scope of asymmetric hydrogenations. Paper I described the synthesis and evaluation of N,P-ligands for the Ir-catalyzed hydrogenations of unfunctionalized olefins. The substrate scope of Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations is limited to a narrow range of “test” olefins. The foremost focus of this thesis was to expand the substrate scope of Ir-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations. Papers II and III disclosed the potential of the N,P-ligated Ir complexes in hydrogenation of the enol phosphinates. This substrate class is attractive because the hydrogenated products are chiral alkylphosphinates that can be transformed into chiral alcohols and chiral phosphines without sacrificing enantiopurity. A wide range of enol phosphinates were hydrogenated to excellent conversions and enatioselectivities. The hydrogenation of purely alkyl-substituted enol phosphinates in very high conversions and ee values was emphasized in these studies. Paper IV described the investigation of unfunctionalized enamines as substrates in Ir-catalyzed hydrogenation studies. The hydrogenation results and structural limitations of the substrates are presented. Paper V described the asymmetric hydrogenation of diphenylvinylphosphine oxides, di- and trisubstituted vinyl phosphonates. The hydrogenation of diphenylvinylphosphine oxides gives direct access to protected chiral phosphines. The hydrogenated products of <b>vinylphosphonates</b> are highly synthetically useful in pharmaceutical and material chemistry. Hydrogenation of E/Z mixtures of carboxyethyl <b>vinylphosphonates</b> with perfect enantioselectivities was striking in these studies.

Examples of existing chemical modifications of the sugar and backbone regions of nucleic acids are given, followed by the introduction of the <b>vinylphosphonate</b> modification. The <b>vinylphosphonate</b> has previously been examined in DNA and has been synthesised by either Pd(0) catalysed cross-coupling of an H-phosphonate with a vinyl bromide, or by the cross-metathesis of a <b>vinylphosphonate</b> with a terminal olefin. This thesis details the first examples of the <b>vinylphosphonate</b> modification in RNA. The initial aim of this project was the synthesis of a range of nucleosides where the 5 '-C-O was replaced by a vinyl bromide carbon-carbon double bond. Starting from alpha-D-glucose, acid catalysed formation of the 1, 2 : 5, 6 -diisopropylidene alpha-D-glucofuranose was carried out followed by protection of the 3 -OH as an acetate. The 5, 6 -isopropylidene was then subjected to H 5 IO 6 mediated one-pot hydrolysis-oxidative cleavage to obtain the 5 -aldehyde. Wittig olefination using CBr 4 and Ph 3 P led to the dibromo olefin which was then stereoselectively reduced using dimethyl phosphite and diisopropylamine to obtain the pure trans-vinyl bromide. Following hydrolysis of the acetate, the stereochemistry of the 3 -OH was then inverted by sequential oxidation and reduction. With the correct stereochemistry, the 3 -OH was protected as the 2 -methylnaphthyl ether. The 1, 2 -isopropylidene moiety was then hydrolysed and acetylated to the bis-acetate which was subjected to Vorbruggen conditions obtaining the uridine (93 %), adenosine (77 %), cytidine (30) and guanosine (63 %) vinyl bromide nucleosides. The 2 '-OAc of the nucleosides were hydrolysed to the 2 '-OH in yields of 74 - 92 %. The uridine 2 '-OH was protected as the 2 '-OTBS ether (98 %), analogous to the commercially available phosphoramidites used in automated oligonucleotide synthesis. Similarly, the adenosine and uridine nucleosides could also be blocked as the 2 '-OMe (59 % and 73 % respectively). In the case of the uridine vinyl bromide, the 3 '-O-(2 -methylnaphthyl) protecting group was cleaved using DDQ, this then enabled the vinylphosphonate-linked uridine dinucleotides to be functionalised at the 3 '-OH as the cyanoethyl phosphoramidite using N,N-diisopropyl- 2 -cyanoethyl-chlorophosphoramidite, DIPEA and DMAP in dichloromethane (2 '-OTBS 74 %, 2 '-OMe 41 %). These could then be used in automated solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. The H-phosphonates were prepared in a single step form the commercially available phosphoramidites using a tetrazole. These were then coupled to the vinyl bromide nucleosides using standard conditions of Pd(OAc) 2 (0. 2 eq.), dppf (0. 4 eq.) and propylene oxide (20 eq.) in THF at 70 oC in a sealed vial for 6 hours. A range of vinylphosphonate-linked dinucleotides were accessed in yields of 61 - 99 %.

A novel 'see-saw' model is proposed for the binding of inhibitor to catalytic and allosteric sites, the latter dependent on substrate binding, that provides an explanation for the different inhibitor kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that the expression level and properties unique to an N-terminal 86 amino-acid isoform variant of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK 1 b) in prostate cancer cells reduce its sensitivity to SKi-induced proteasomal degradation in comparison to SK 1 a, i. e. these two N-terminal variants of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK 1 a and SK 1 b) have different properties.

Calorimetry showed separate glass transition temperatures from the PFE and PVPA phases, with the latter increasing with increasing annealing temperatures as a result of anhydride formation. Fully hydrated multiblock copolymer membranes reached proton conductivities above 80 mS cm- 1 at 120 oC.

Like all NMP kinases, UMP-CMP kinase binds the phosphodonor, usually ATP, and the NMP at different binding sites. The reaction results from an in-line phosphotransfer from the donor to the acceptor. The probe for the donor site was displaced by the bisubstrate analogs of the Ap 5 X series (where X = U, dT, A, G), indicating the broad specificity of the acceptor site. Both CMP and dCMP were competitors for the acceptor site probe. To find antimetabolites for antivirus and anticancer therapies, we have developed a method of screening acyclic phosphonate analogs {{that is based on}} the affinity of the acceptor-binding site of the human UMP-CMP kinase. Several uracil <b>vinylphosphonate</b> derivatives had affinities for human UMP-CMP kinase similar to those of dUMP and dCMP and better than that of cidofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities. The uracil derivatives were inhibitors rather than substrates of human UMP-CMP kinase. Also, the 5 -halogen-substituted analogs inhibited the human TMP kinase less efficiently. The broad specificity of the enzyme acceptor-binding site is in agreement with a large substrate-binding pocket, as shown by the 2. 1 A crystal structure. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Manganese (Mn) is a metal {{required}} by biological systems. However, environmental or occupational exposure {{to high levels}} of Mn can produce a neurological disorder called manganism, which has similarities to Parkinson's disease. Diethyl- 2 -phenyl- 2 -tellurophenyl <b>vinylphosphonate</b> (DPTVP) is an organotellurium compound with a high antioxidant activity, especially in the brain. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term low-dose exposure to Mn in drinking water on behavioral and biochemical parameters in rats and to determine the effectiveness of vinylic telluride in attenuating the effects of Mn. After 4 months of treatment with MnCl 2 (13. 7 mg/kg), rats exhibited clear signs of neurobehavioral toxicity, including a {{decrease in the number of}} rearings in the open field and altered motor performance in rotarod. The administration of DPTVP (0. 150 μmol/kg, ip, 2 weeks) improved the motor performance of Mn-treated rats, indicating that the compound could be reverting Mn neurotoxicity. Ex vivo, we observed that Mn concentrations in the Mn-treated group were highest in the striatum, consistent with a statistically significant decrease in mitochondrial viability and [3 H]glutamate uptake, and increased lipid peroxidation. Mn levels in the hippocampus and cortex were indistinguishable from controls, and no significant differences were noted in the ex vivo assays in these areas. Treatment with DPTVP fully reversed the biochemical parameters altered by Mn. Furthermore, DPTVP treatment was also associated with a reduction in striatal Mn levels.

We also assessed the effect of compound 5 and ROMe in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Experimental Approach: We measured IL- 1 beta formation by macrophages, sphingosine 1 -phosphate levels and S 1 P 1 expression levels in vitro and clinical score and inflammatory cell infiltration into the spinal cord in vivo. Key Results: Treatment of differentiated U 937 macrophages with compound 5, RB- 020 or sphingosine (but not ROMe) enhanced IL- 1 beta release. This data suggests these compounds might be pro-inflammatory in vitro. However, compound 5 or ROMe reduced disease progression and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the spinal cord in EAE and ROMe induced a reduction in CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell levels in the blood (lymphopenia). Indeed, ROMe induced a marked decrease in cell surface S 1 P 1 expression in vitro.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{is made of}} ethyl (diethoxyphosphino) -acetate as a common intermediate for the synthesis of various phosphinoline and isophosphinoline systems. Two syntheses of 2 -hydroxy-l, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisophosphinoline 2, 4 -dioxide from [special character omitted]-bromotoluene and 2 -(bromomethyl) benzoic acid are described. Attempts to induce cyclisation of 3 -(hydroxyphenyl-phosphinyl) propanoic acid with polyphosphoric acid, and the corresponding bis-acid chloride with aluminium chloride, prove unsuccessful, due to deactivation of the ring towards electrophilic attack. Three 1 -substituted- 1, 2 -dihydrophosphinoline 1 -oxides are synthesised, which when photolysed in a nucleophilic solvent give the three double-bond isomers of l-(2 - phosphorylphenyl) propene derivatives. This is rationalised in terms of solvent trapping of a phospha-quinoidal intermediate, obtained by electrocyclic ring-opening of the phosphinoline. The Lewis acid catalysed cyclisation of 2 - biphenylylphosphorodichloridothioate to 6 -chloro- 6 H-dibenz (c,e) (1, 2) oxaphosphorin 6 -sulphide is investigated {{under a variety of}} conditions, leading to the identification of the optimum procedure as a neat reaction at 200 C for Ih, in the presence of 0. 1 equivalent of aluminium chloride. Esterification of the resultant heterocycle, followed by photolysis of a methanolic solution gives three unidentified products. The complete absence of any photolytic reaction of the analogous 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -methoxyphosphaphen anthrene leads to the conclusion that reaction is not by a concerted, electrocyclic pathway. t-Butylamine is found to selectively monodemethylate phosphorus esters in the presence of carboxylate esters in a side-chain.

40|$|Introduction of a {{small amount}} of ionic groups into {{hydrocarbon}} polymer chain can dramatically modify the physical and rheological properties of the parent polymer, due to the microphase separated ion-rich domains which act as physical crosslinks. The ion containing polymer is termed ionomer. Ionomers based on an atactic polystyrene have been popular as model systems. The majority of the researches focused on ionomers functioned with sulfonic acid (RSO 3 H) or carboxylic acid (RCO 2 H) groups. The acidity of the pendent group has been demonstrated to have great influence on the strength of ionic interactions and hence the physical properties of ionomers. In this study, the styrene based ionomer is modified with organo-phosphonic acid group (RPO 3 H 2), which possesses two ionizable acid groups. One −POOH has an ionization potential intermediate between sulfonic and carboxylic acids. ^ Poly(styrene-co-diethyl <b>vinylphosphonate)</b> copolymers were synthesized by free radical copolymerization. The ester groups of the copolymers were hydrolyzed to phosphonic acid groups, and the alkali metals and zinc salts ionomers were obtained by neutralization. The structure, thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of the copolymers and ionomers were characterized with NMR, FT-IR, GPC, TGA, DSC, TMA and DMA. ^ Glass transition temperatures of the ionomers increased with increasing ion concentration. The free acid derivatives exhibited a short rubbery plateau. An extended rubbery plateau and an “ionic peak” in the small-angle X-ray scattering were observed for the metal phosphonated polystyrene ionomers. Time-temperature superposition was not applicable to the poly(styrene-co-vinylphosphonate) ionomers even at the lowest ion content of 2. 4 mol%, indicating that these materials were thermorheologically complex. Polar plasticizer-glycerol-preferentially solvated the ionic aggregates and weakened the ionic interactions, but the ion-rich phase was not completely destroyed. The “ionic peak” in SAXS pattern shifted to lower angle, accompanied by an increase in intensity. ^ Typical ionomer solution behavior was present in the poly(styrene-co-vinylphosphonate) ionomer: the aggregation of ion-pair in low polar mixture solvents and the polyelectrolyte behavior in polar solvent. The phosphonic acid derivatives absorbed relatively little water, even for materials with ion-exchange capacities greater than 1. 0 meq/g, and were not conductive, which made them unsuitable for application as proton exchange membranes. ...|$|E
40|$|Styrene (ST) and methyl {{methacrylate}} (MMA) have been copolymerized {{with a variety}} of comonomers containing covalently-bound phosphorus-containing groups, including vinyl phosphonic acid, several dialkyl vinyl phosphonates, and various vinyl and allyl phosphine oxides. The flame retardance of these polymers has been preliminarily assessed through thermogravimetric analysis and measurements of limiting oxygen index (LOI) and char yields. All the phosphorus-containing polymers produce char on burning (and also on heating in air or nitrogen) and have LOIs higher than those of the parent homopolymers, indicating significant flame retardance involving condensed-phase mechanisms. However, despite there being general correlations between LOI, char yield and phosphorus-content, some copolymers have higher than expected LOI and/or char yield, whilst others have lower, indicating that phosphorus environment is important. In order to explore mechanisms of flame retardance in more detail, laser pyrolysis/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and mass spectrometric thermal analysis have been applied to study the decomposition behaviour of three of the MMA copolymers: those containing pyrocatecholvinylphosphonate (MMA-PCVP), diethyl-p-vinylbenzylphosphonate (MMA-DEpVBP) and di(2 -phenylethyl) <b>vinylphosphonate</b> (MMA-PEVP) as comonomers. The laser pyrolysis experiments provide an insight into probable polymer behaviour behind the flame front in a polymer fire and show that copolymerization of MMA with the comonomers does not greatly change the pyrolysis mechanism compared with that of poly({{methyl methacrylate}}) (PMMA). However, the amounts of MMA monomer evolved during pyrolysis are much reduced for the copolymerized samples. Since MMA is the major fuel evolved during the combustion of PMMA and its copolymers, this effect must be a major contributing factor to the reduced flammability shown by the copolymers. MMA-DEpVBP underwent the most extensive decomposition following laser pyrolysis. In particular, significant amounts of highly flammable methane and ethene were detected. Such increased amounts would occur also if the copolymer were to be exposed to high temperature conditions when burnt. Hence, its seems reasonable that the MMA-DEpVBP has a lower LOI value than expected, despite it giving a relatively high yield of char. Mass spectrometric thermal analysis studies of the MMA-PEVP provide evidence that the PEVP unit decomposes around 200 °C, eliminating styrene, with evolution of MMA reaching a maximum some 50 °C higher. Possible mechanisms for these processes are suggeste...|$|E
