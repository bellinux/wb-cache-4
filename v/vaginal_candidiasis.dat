Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis).

40|$|Vulvovaginal and {{invasive}} candidiasis {{are frequent}} conditions in immunosuppressed individuals caused by Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida spp. Fluconazole and Amphotericin B {{are the main}} drugs used to fight the infection. However, resistance to fluconazole and other azole antifungal drugs is an important clinical problem that encourages the search for new therapeutic alternatives. In this work, we evaluate the antifungal activity of the biphosphinic cyclopalladate C 7 a in the in vitro and in vivo model. Our results showed fungicidal activity, with low values of minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimum fungicidal concentrations, even for fluconazole and/or miconazole resistant Candida isolates. Fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the compound was able to inhibit the formation of hyphae/pseudohyphae and, moreover, promoted morphological alterations in cellular organelles and structures, such as disruption of cell wall, apparent mitochondrial swelling, chromatin marginalization into the nuclei and increased numbers of electron-lucent vacuoles. C 7 a significantly decreased the biofilm formation and reduced the viability of yeast cells in mature biofilms when tested against a virulent C. albicans strain. In vivo assays demonstrated a significant decrease of fungal burden in local (vaginal canal) and disseminated (kidneys) infection.

40|$|The {{commensal}} fungus Candida albicans causes oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC; thrush) {{in settings}} of immunodeficiency.

T helper 1 (Th 1) cells {{have long been}} implicated in defense against candidiasis, whereas the role of Th 17 cells remains controversial. IL- 17 mediates inflammatory pathology in a gastric model of mucosal candidiasis, but is host protective in disseminated disease. Here, we directly compared Th 1 and Th 17 function in a model of OPC. Th 17 -deficient (IL- 23 p 19 −/−) and IL- 17 R–deficient (IL- 17 RA−/−) mice experienced severe OPC, whereas Th 1 -deficient (IL- 12 p 35 −/−) mice showed low fungal burdens and no overt disease. Neutrophil recruitment was impaired in IL- 23 p 19 −/− and IL- 17 RA−/−, but not IL- 12 −/−, mice, and TCR-αβ cells were more important than TCR-γδ cells. Surprisingly, mice deficient in the Th 17 cytokine IL- 22 were only mildly susceptible to OPC, indicating that IL- 17 rather than IL- 22 is vital in defense against oral candidiasis. Gene profiling of oral mucosal tissue showed strong induction of Th 17 signature genes, including CXC chemokines and β defensin- 3.

40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} is a prevalent opportunistic mucosal infection, caused predominantly by Candida albicans. Candida species vary {{in their}} susceptibility to the antifungal agents, thus, the susceptibility tests have clinical significance in determining the appropriate therapeutic choice. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of vulvovaginal yeasts and the susceptibility pattern to azoles antifungal isolated in southern Mato Grosso State, Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical samples from 166 patients were obtained regardless {{signs and symptoms of}} vulvovaginal <b>candidiasis.</b> <b>Vaginal</b> swabs were collected, seeded onto plates containing Sabouraud Dextrose agar and incubated at 35 ºC, for five days. A pool of colonies that grown on each plate was subcultured in CHROMagar Candida medium. On the basis of a pure culture, the yeasts were identified using traditional phenotypic identification methods. Susceptibility tests for antifungal fluconazole and ketoconazole were performed using the broth microdilution method according to the reference protocol M 27 A 3 of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). RESULTS: The frequency of Candida spp. in the study population was 30 %, of which 28 % were in the group of asymptomatic women and 35 % among symptomatic. Among the isolated strains were C. albicans (50 %), C. glabrata (33 %) and C. tropicalis (17 %). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fluconazole ranged from 0. 5 &# 956;g/ml to 16 &# 956;g/ml and for ketoconazole from 0. 03 &# 956;g/ml to 4 &# 956;g/ml. The resistance rates were 1. 7 % for fluconazole and 3. 4 % for ketoconazole. CONCLUSION: C. albicans was the predominant species. We observed a high susceptibility of Candida spp. to fluconazole and ketoconazole antifungal...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Squamous {{papillae}} in {{the vestibule}} are common. They were once considered to be nor-mal variants of female anatomy, but reports of the viral aetiology of such lesions are emerging. When they are symptomatic, squamous papillae can lead to problems in sexual relationships between healthy partners. Here we report a case that responded well to treatment. Benign lesions in the lower genital tract, which were once considered as normal, are now known {{to relate to the}} wide range of disease caused by human papil-loma virus (HPV). Despite strong circumstantial evidence suggesting an association between HPV and lower genital tract neoplasia, final proof that HPV is the causative agent of cervical cancer still remains to be established. It is important {{to be aware of the}} various clinical manifestations and take adequate steps to screen the patients. Case report A nulliparous woman aged 29 presented with a two year history of roughness around the vulval skin. She had noticed occasional itching in the vulva and superficial dyspareunia, and an occasional non-offensive brownish discharge mainly after menstru-ation. She had regular sexual intercourse with her fiance, who was her only sexual contact during the previous five years. She was in good health until this episode, which caused her great anxiety as she was due to be married four weeks later. Examination showed a pearly white papillomatous area in the introitus, on the inside of labia minora (fig 1). The extent of the lesions was well defined on hand lens examination. There was minimal clear mucoid discharge. The rest of the external genitalia, vagina, and cervix showed no abnormality. A wet film, Gram stained smears, culture, and serology gave negative results for gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, anaero-bic <b>vaginal</b> infections, trichomoniasis, <b>candidiasis,</b> and syphilis.

The state of vaginal microbiota was studied using PCR and culture. It were carried out a species identification of the fungi of the genus Candida and their susceptibility to antimycotics. It has been established that among women with a recurrent miscarriage after cycles of ART that repeatedly receive antibacterial therapy in preparation in the ART cycles and after abortion, in the vaginal microbiota Vaginal dysbiosis was observed in 54. 58 % of the cases, in which increased colonization by bacterial-fungal associates was noted in 67. 18 % of individuals.

40|$|Introduction: Vaginits is {{probably}} the most common infection in women during their reproductive years, resulting in 5 - 10 million health-care visits a year, worldwide. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) is the second-most common form of vaginitis in the United States, which is associated with use of oral contraceptives containing high levels of estrogen and hormonal therapies. Midwives play an important role not only in the assessment and management of vaginal infections, but also in educating women about vaginal health. Recognizing risk factors associated with infections are the key to vaginal health. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and risk factors of Candidal vaginitis in women referring to Tabriz health centers. Methods: This was a cross sectional study carried out on 1000 women aged 15 - 49 years who were selected by multiple random method. A sample of vaginal discharge was taken from the posterior fornix of the cervix and from the vaginal wall using sterile cotton swabs. The mycelium was observed by microscopic examination of a wet mount of the secretions. Another sample was taken for culturing in Agar sabura and transported to the laboratory. In addition, questionnaires with personal and reproductive information were completed. Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 15 and chi-square and, t student statistical tests were used for analysis. Results : This investigation indicated that prevalence of candidiasis was 25. 2 %. There was no meaningful statistical relationship between age, marriage age, occupation, education status, body mass index, day of menstruation cycle and abortion history with candidal vaginitis (p>. 05),but a statistically significant relationship was observed between number of deliveries, <b>vaginal</b> Ph with <b>candidiasis.</b> Also, there was a reverse statistical relationship between OCP, DMPA methods and candidiasis.

40|$|The {{presentation}} and course of Sexually transmitted diseases(STI) may be altered by presence of coexisting HIV status. Aim {{of the study}} was to study the prevalence of STI in 50 females with HIV infection and 50 females without HIV infection and to study the pap smear of patients to look for any cellular changes (dysplasia) due to sexually transmitted infections. Material and methods: The present study was an observational study, which was undertaken on 100 females with STIs (50 females with coexistent HIV infection and 50 females without HIV infection), in the age group 15 - 49 years attending Skin and VD OPD of Rajindra hospital, Patiala. Results: In our study, the commonest presenting complaint in case of both HIV positive (66 %) and HIV negative (80 %) women was vaginal discharge. PAP smear abnormalities were present in 28 (56 %) HIV positive women and 11 (22 %) HIV negative women. In case of HIV positive women, the inflammation was trichomonal in 4 (8 %), bacterial in 2 (4 %), fungal in 2 (4 %) and non-specific in 20 (40 %) patients. In HIV negative women, the inflammation was trichomonal in 2 (4 %) patients, bacterial in 2 (4 %) patients and non-specific in 7 (14 %) patients. The difference in abnormality seen in PAP smear between HIV positive and HIV negative women is statistically significant only in case of non-specific inflammation which is more common in case of HIV positive women. Conclusion: From the present study, it was concluded vaginal discharge was the commonest presenting complaint in both HIV positive and HIV negative women, though the commonest cause of <b>vaginal</b> discharge was <b>candidiasis</b> in HIV positive females and bacterial vaginosis in HIV negative females. Also, PAP smear abnormalities were significantly higher in HIV positive women than HIV negative women.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of two clinical protocols {{for the management of}} vaginal discharge in the situations where no laboratory facilities are available but speculum examination is possible and where basic laboratory facilities are available. (2) To determine clinical and simple laboratory indicators for diagnosis of patients with vaginal discharge in the local setting. DESIGN: Alternate allocation of subjects to one of two management protocols. SUBJECTS: Women presenting to university gynaecology outpatients department with a complaint of vaginal discharge. METHODS: Subjects were alternately allocated management according to one of two protocols: one without (group A) and one with (group B) immediate access to results of basic laboratory tests. Full clinical assessment including speculum examination and microbiological assessment for infection with gonorrhoea, chlamydia, candida, trichomonas, and bacterial vaginosis was performed on all women. Follow up assessment of clinical and microbiological response was performed 1 - 2 weeks later. RESULTS: At initial assessment, both groups were similar in all respects except that more group B women had inflammation of the vulva. The prevalences of various conditions were: candidiasis 22 %, bacterial vaginosis 38 %, trichomoniasis 4 %, chlamydia 4 %, gonorrhoea 0. 4 %. There was no association between any demographic characteristic and diagnosis of cause of the discharge. Both protocols resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements for women with candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis. There were no clinically important differences in outcomes between the two protocols. The sensitivities and specificities of various indicators were: curd-like <b>vaginal</b> discharge for <b>candidiasis,</b> 72 % and 100 %; homogeneous vaginal discharge for bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, 94 % and 88 %; absent or scanty lactobacilli for bacterial vaginosis, 99 % and 68 %; > 20 % clue cells for bacterial vaginosis, 81 % and 99 %; visible endocervical mucopus for chlamydia or gonorrhoea, 36 % and 86 %; microscopic endocervical mucopus for chlamydia or gonorrhoea, 64 % and 69 %. CONCLUSIONS: Both protocols were equally effective in managing women with abnormal vaginal discharge. Simple clinical indicators for candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomonas as in protocol A are sufficiently sensitive and specific for use in situations with no laboratory support. A modification to protocol A could increase detection of bacterial vaginosis at basic health service level. Further work is needed to identify appropriate indicators for infection with chlamydia or gonorrhoea. ...|$|R

40|$|A candidíase vaginal é uma doença causada por fungos do grupo das leveduras e do gênero Candida. É um problema que aflige milhões de mulheres anualmente em todo o mundo. A maior parte dos casos é resolvida com o uso de antifúngicos, mas estima-se que 5 a 10 % das pacientes apresentem infecções recorrentes. Por esta razão, terapias alternativas têm sido propostas, como o uso de lactobacilos. Nestetrabalho, foi avaliado o potencial probiótico de 15 amostras de Lactobacillus crispatus e seis amostras de Lactobacillus johnsonii, obtidas do fluido vaginal de mulheres saudáveis, contra espécies de Candida. As duas espécies utilizadas foram as mais freqüentemente isoladas em estudo prévio da {{microbiota}} vaginal de 16 mulheres ginecologicamente saudáveis. Para os estudos in vitro, foram feitos testes de antagonismo pela técnica de difusão em ágar contra as seguintes linhagens de leveduras: C. albicans ATCC 18804, C. tropicalis ATCC 750 e C. krusei ATCC 20298. Todos os testes foram feitos em duplicata. Três amostras de L. crispatus revelaram atividade antagonista contra maior número de linhagens de Candida spp. e foram selecionadas para testes in vivo subseqüentes, que foram realizados com fêmeas de camundongos BALB-c da linhagem NIH, isentos de germes. Os testes in vivo foram realizados em três etapas, variando-se a cada vez a amostra de Candida utilizada. Os animais dos grupos teste (n= 7, 6 e 6) e controle (n= 7, 6 e 6) foram respectivamente inoculados intravaginalmente com um coquetel contendo as três amostras de L. crispatus e com caldo MRS estéril. Quatro dias após, os camundongos dos dois grupos receberam inóculos subcutâneos com estrogênio,para garantir a viabilidade das infecções experimentais por Candida spp. Sete dias após o inóculo com lactobacilos, ambos os grupos foram inoculados com uma das seguintes linhagens de leveduras: C. albicans ATCC 18804, C. tropicalis ATCC 750 e, ainda, uma amostra de C. albicans isolada de uma paciente com candidíase vaginal. Para a análise estatística dos testes in vivo, foi utilizado o teste T de Student. Não foi observada diferença significativa entre os grupos controle e testequando utilizadas C. albicans ATCC 18804 e C. albicans de origem clínica (p< 0, 05). Por outro lado, houve diferença estatística quando utilizada C. tropicalis ATCC 750. Neste caso, os lactobacilos não apresentaram eficácia na redução das infecções experimentais por Candida tropicalis, mas dificultaram o aumento dos níveis populacionais de leveduras. Os dados obtidos indicam possível atividade probióticados lactobacilos testados, embora mais testes sejam necessários para melhor avaliação de suas propriedades antagônicas e aplicabilidade no tratamento da candidíase <b>vaginal.</b> Vulvovaginal <b>candidiasis</b> is {{a disease}} caused by a fungus from the group of yeasts and the genus Candida that affects millions of women every year worldwide. Most cases can be solved by antifungals, but {{it is estimated that}} 5 to 10 % of women present recurrence. For this reason, alternative therapies have been proposed, {{such as the use of}} probiotic lactobacilli. In this study, the probiotic properties of 15 samples of Lactobacillus crispatus and six samples of Lactobacillus johnsonii, obtained from the vaginal fluid of healthy women, have been tested against Candida species. Both species were the most commonly found in a previous study with 16 healthy patients. The double-layer technique was used to evaluate in vitro antagonism against Candida albicans ATCC 18804, C. tropicalis ATCC 750 and C. krusei ATCC 20298. All tests were performed in duplicate. Three samples of L. crispatus showed antagonistic activity against a greater number of Candida strains and were selected for subsequent in vivo studies with NIH germ-free female BALB-c mice. The in vivo studies were divided into three phases, which differed by the Candida strain used. The animals of the test (n= 7, n= 6 and n= 6) and control groups (n= 7, n= 6 and n= 6) were respectively intravaginally inoculated with a pool containing the three samplesof L. crispatus and sterilized MRS broth. Four days after, the mice from both groups were inoculated subcutaneously with estrogen to ensure the viability of Candida infections. Seven days after the first inoculums, the animals from both groups were inoculated by one of the following yeasts strains: C. albicans ATCC 18804, C. tropicalis ATCC 750 and a strain of Candida albicans isolated from a patient with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Student T test was used for statistical analysis of in vivo studies. No difference was observed between control and test groups when C. albicans ATCC 18804 and C. albicans from the patient with vulvovaginal candidiasis were used (p < 0, 05). On the other hand, a significant difference was found when C. tropicalis ATCC 750 was used. In this case, the lactobacilli did not show efficacy in preventing or reducing the Candida infection, but it seemed not to allow the increase of the yeast population. Obtained data indicate a possible probiotic activity of thetested lactobacilli, although more tests are needed to better evaluate theirantagonistic properties and applicability in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{antibody}} titers to Candida albicans {{were estimated}} in 37 women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> and in 148 normal American and Finnish subjects, using the passive-hemagglutination technique. The antibody titers ranged from 0 to 16 in normal individuals and 4 to 256 in <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> patients. Antibodies to C. albicans in the sera of <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> patients {{were found to}} be the secretory immunoglobulin A type, as determined by gel filtration and double-diffusion tests. The results were confirmed by the indir-ct fluorescent-antibody technique. Our findings suggest that, in <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> the antibody response is mainly local, consisting of secretory immunoglobulin A, some of which finds its way into systemic circulation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{psychological factors}} associated with chronic recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> DESIGN: A cross sectional exploratory study of women with chronic, recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> PATIENTS: 28 women found culture positive and treated for <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> by a clinic physician at least twice within the past 6 months. All women {{reported that they had}} experienced vaginal thrush six or more times within 1 year. A comparison group comprised 16 women with no history of recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> of similar age range, and recruited from a women's family planning service. METHODS: Both groups were compared on demographic criteria, sexual health histories, mental health, and psychological health characteristics. A purpose designed structured interview was administered alongside a battery of standardised psychometric instruments measuring mood, satisfaction with life, self esteem, and perceived stress. RESULTS: The two groups showed considerable similarities, with no significant differences in demographic characteristics and most sexual health issues. However, women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} suffer clinical depression, to be less satisfied with life, to have poorer self esteem, and to perceive their lives as more stressful. Additionally, women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> reported that their candidiasis seriously interfered with their sexual and emotional relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study identified many areas of psychological morbidity associated with chronic <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> and indicates that development of appropriate psychological treatment initiatives in this area is long overdue. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The microbiological, {{pathological}} {{and clinical}} factors determining <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> and recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> {{have long been}} studied, particularly using rodent models. The validity of which for understanding the pathogenesis of disease in women has been questioned. The most prevalent agent is critically determined by activation of microbial and host factors leading to persistent vaginal inflammation coupled to {{the inability of the}} inflammatory cells to resolve the fungal infection. Here we studied the activation of inflammasome complex neutrophil-recruiting and activating cytokines in the vaginal secretion of women with clinically established <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> Materials and methods. In human vaginal samples positive for C. albicans with <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (n= 20) and carriage (n= 15), infiltration of neutrophils, inflammatory mediators such as IL- 8 and IL- 1 β, activation of inflammasome complex and expression of aspartyl proteases (SAPs) were examined. Results. In vaginal swabs of patients with <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> we found: i) consistent recruitment of neutrophils; ii) appreciable level of IL- 8 and IL- 1 β; iii) activation of inflammasome complex; iv) consistent expression of SAP 2, SAP 5 and SAP 6. Conclusions. These results show that immunopathogenesis of <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> is mediated by local recruitment of neutrophils, inflammatory cytokines secretion and inflammasome activation that mirror the upregulation of SAP 2, SAP 5 and SAP 6 gene expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to design and {{evaluate}} a novel vaginal delivery system for the local treatment of <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> Bioadhesive vaginal films of metronidazole that could be retained in the vagina for prolonged period for more effective treatment against <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> were formulated by solvent casting technique using bioadhesive polymers such as chitosan, HPC and sodium CMC. Glycerine and propylene glycol were used as plasticizer. The films were characterized for various physical, mechanical, and aesthetic properties. Bioadhesive strength and in vitro release studies suggested that the prolonged release bioadhesive vaginal film formulation of metronidazole is useful and effective dosage form for treating <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> It may be concluded from present study that MTZ bioadhesive vaginal film {{can be used as}} a novel delivery system for local therapy of <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether nondiabetic women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> have an impaired glucose metabolism. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study of 62 otherwise healthy women who were attending a vaginitis clinic > or = 3 times a year for symptoms of Candida vaginitis, positive microscopy, and at least one positive Candida culture and of 32 Candida-negative control subjects, all of whom were undergoing standardized oral glucose tolerance testing. RESULTS: Women with recurrent bacterial vaginal infections did not differ from women without infections, so both groups comprised the control group. Women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> had a greater mean body mass index than the control subjects (23. 5 vs 21. 4, P =. 001). They had no more incidences of overt or preclinical diabetes mellitus than the control subjects (6 / 62 vs 0 / 32 incidents), but a greater proportion of them had at least one glucose concentration above the 95 th percentile (36 % vs 12 %, P =. 016). Glucose concentrations were higher in recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> cases than in control subjects at 0 (89 vs 85 mg/dL,P =. 049), 30 (139 vs 126 mg/dL, P =. 05), and 60 minutes (123 vs 102 mg/dL, P =. 009) after the intake of 75 g of glucose. Fasting concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin was 25 % higher in women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (5 vs 4 g/dL, P =. 0006), even after correction for body mass index. Compared with control subjects, ingestion of 75 g of glucose led to a 15 % increase of serum glucose levels in women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (P =. 01). As expected, most of these differences were largely mediated by an increased body mass index. CONCLUSION: The tolerance to glucose in nondiabetic women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis</b> is discretely impaired. Glucose tolerance testing is of value in women with recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> but the interpretation of the obtained values should not be limited to the diagnosis of preclinical diabetes mellitus. status: publishe...|$|E

Of the 47 patients who reacted with Candida albicans mannan or cytoplasmic antigens, 98 % reacted with mannan antigen but only 13 % with cytoplasmic antigen. The inclusion of mannan and cytoplasmic antigens of C. guilliermondii and C. parapsilosis did not increase the specificity or sensitivity of the test in the diagnosis of <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> It is suggested that the double diffusion test is of doubtful value {{as an adjunct to}} the diagnosis of <b>vaginal</b> <b>candidiasis...</b>|$|E
