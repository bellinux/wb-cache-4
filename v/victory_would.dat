5|$|Davidson {{played a}} large role in the Fourth Test Old Trafford. <b>Victory</b> <b>would</b> give Australia an {{unassailable}} 2–1 series lead and retention of the Ashes. A loss would mean that Australia would need to win the Fifth and final Test to prevent England from reclaiming them.|$|E
5|$|During the {{presentation}} of the teams, the riders were asked to choose their top picks for the overall victory. Roberto Visentini garnered the most votes from his fellow riders, but Delgado, Hampsten and LeMond also received many votes. Many media outlets felt that the overall <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> likely go to a non-Italian rider {{due to the lack of}} Italian general classification competitors, but that Visentini had the best chance of winning out of competing Italians.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a rematch {{of an early}} regular-season contest, but even though Georgia Tech won that game, there were {{questions}} about whether the <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> be repeated. Twice before, the two teams matched in the ACC Championship Game had played earlier that season. Both times, the loser of the first matchup won the second. There also were questions about each team's quality because of their losses in rivalry games against Southeastern Conference foes.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of his <b>victories,</b> Scaroni <b>would</b> fly a Hanriot HD.1. His 25 <b>victories</b> <b>would</b> make him second only to Belgium's Willy Coppens for success with this type of airplane.|$|R
25|$|Probable <b>victories</b> <b>would</b> {{not count}} on a pilot's score, {{although}} they would be noted. Examples of probable victories could be enemy aircraft falling out of control but not seen to impact, or a claim lacking independent confirmation.|$|R

5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no opposition party in Poland since all political groupings had to support the program of the PZPR. As a result, no real opposition candidates were permitted to run in the elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have stripped the communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Chilean Navy date back to 1817, when General Bernardo O'Higgins prophetically {{declared}} after the Chilean victory at the Battle of Chacabuco that a hundred such <b>victories</b> <b>would</b> count for nothing if Chile did not {{gain control of the}} sea.|$|R

5|$|Liverpool had {{finished}} fifth during the 1980–81 Football League, thus {{they needed to}} win the final {{to ensure that they}} would compete in the European Cup the following season. Despite this, Liverpool had won the Football League Cup for the first time earlier in the season, defeating West Ham United 2–1 in a replay after the final finished 1–1. Real Madrid {{had finished}} second in the 1980–81 La Liga, they had qualified for the UEFA Cup as a result, but <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> enable them to compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{finished}} the 1983–84 Football League as champions. They had also won the 1983–84 Football League Cup beating Everton 1–0 in a replay after the final finished 0–0.

Roma {{had finished}} second during the 1983–84 Serie A and won the 1983–84 Coppa Italia, they had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result, but <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> enable them {{to compete in the}} European Cup the following season.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's manager Kenny Dalglish {{stated in}} the aftermath, that the <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> lead to more trophies. The club reached the 2012 FA Cup Final, but were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea.

Cardiff manager Malky Mackay {{was proud of his}} team despite their defeat. They finished the season in 6th place in the 2011–12 Football League Championship, reaching the playoffs where they were beaten by West Ham United over two-legs.|$|E

50|$|Charles I {{hoped that}} quick <b>victories</b> <b>would</b> negate Parliament's {{advantage}} in materiel {{and as the}} armouries in London were beyond his reach he hoped to take the large arsenal at Hull to supplement the armouries he did have access to, {{such as those of}} the Derbyshire and Staffordshire trained bands.|$|R
5|$|The club {{also has}} a {{traditional}} rivalry with Sheffield United. In 1984, Sheffield United won promotion at Hull City's expense with the teams level on points and goal difference and separated only by goals scored, with 33 of United's goals scored by former Hull City striker Keith Edwards. City's {{final game of the}} season against Burnley had been rescheduled due to bad weather and took place after their promotion rivals had finished their campaign; Hull went into the game knowing that a three-goal <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> mean promotion, but in front of a crowd which included a number of United fans could manage only a 2–0 win, ensuring that United went up instead.|$|E
5|$|After being {{stripped}} of the victory in previous year's race {{because of an}} underweight car, Audi Sport ABT team principal Hans-Jurgen Abt said his team's objective was to get onto the podium. He acknowledged that getting the <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> not be easy because of the competitiveness of the field. After retiring from the preceding Buenos Aires ePrix, Bird stated that he would enter the Mexico City race with a positive attitude and affirmed his belief in his team and he felt {{there was a possibility}} of getting onto the podium in the event they perform well in qualifying. Mitch Evans reiterated that despite his team Jaguar not scoring points in the season's opening three races, the Buenos Aires race showed that he was becoming more confident and wanted to carry over his momentum from the four-month break. He also said he was excited to compete in the Mexico City event.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, the Pacific War {{between the}} Empire of Japan and the Allies entered its fourth year. The Japanese fought fiercely, {{ensuring}} that the Allied <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> come at an enormous cost. The 1.25million battle casualties that were incurred by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred {{during the last year}} of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 {{as a result of the}} German Ardennes Offensive. In the Pacific, the Allies returned to the Philippines, recaptured Burma, and invaded Borneo. Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in Bougainville, New Guinea and the Philippines. In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from 5:1 in the Philippines to 2:1 on Okinawa.|$|E

5|$|The chase {{continued}} through a second night, the French frigate making significant gains over her pursuers but {{still unable to}} escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set on a course that would cut {{in front of the}} French frigate. These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver. With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond. Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable {{to keep up with the}} French frigate, whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.|$|E
5|$|U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps {{set a new}} Olympic {{record of}} 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one {{hundredth}} of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by the slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had remarked {{that it would be}} better for the sport if Phelps was defeated. Phelps' margin of triumph was so close that the Serbian team filed a protest, but after officials reviewed the video, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced that Phelps did touch the wall first and his <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> be upheld.|$|E
5|$|Xerxes {{retreated to}} Asia {{with much of}} his army, leaving Mardonius to {{complete}} the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, {{the remainder of the}} Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. The Persians made no further attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea thus mark {{a turning point in the}} course of the Greco-Persian wars as a whole; from then onward, the Greek poleis would take the offensive. A number of historians believe that a Persian <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> have hamstrung the development of Ancient Greece, and by extension western civilization, and this has led them to argue that Salamis is one of the most significant battles in human history.|$|E
50|$|This was Shoghi Effendi's {{first round}} of appointees as having {{achieved}} a distinguished rank in service to the religion named Hands of the Cause. Memorial observances of his death {{were among the first}} events of the newly arrived Bahá'ís and first converts in Uganda from which Enoch Olinga, the father of <b>victories,</b> <b>would</b> appear in just two years. Bahá'í radio station WLGI is named after Gregory: the Louis Gregory Institute.|$|R
50|$|For these reasons, Prussian and German {{military}} <b>victories</b> <b>would</b> {{often be}} credited professionally to the Chief of Staff, {{rather than to}} the nominal commander of an army. Often the commander of an army was himself a member of the General Staff, but it was now institutionally recognized that not only was command leadership important, but effective staff work was a significant key to success in both pre-war planning and in wartime operations.|$|R
50|$|Even {{with the}} {{addition}} of the twin-turbocharged C-spec NPT-91 to the line-up midway through the season, the NPTI team would continue to struggle. The team would find also themselves struggling with funding as well, leaving only a lone NPT-91 to compete. No more <b>victories</b> <b>would</b> be scored that season, leaving Nissan to settle for a distant second in the constructors championship behind Toyota. Geoff Brabham would manage a mere third in the drivers championship.|$|R
5|$|His goals helped Symes land December's League Two Player of the Month and {{an offer}} of a {{contract}} extension by Accrington to fend off reported interest from other clubs during the January 2010 transfer window. However, Symes announced he would not sign a new contract during the transfer window increasing the chance he could leave on a free transfer during the summer on a Bosman ruling transfer. Two weeks later, Accrington announced they had rejected two bids from fellow League Two side Grimsby Town for their striker. One bid included striker Barry Conlon moving in the opposite direction. The second bid {{was reported to be}} a six-figure sum. Symes continued his rich vein of form as his 14thgoal of the season—making it his most productive season to date—levelled the scoring against Premier League Fulham in the FA Cup fourth round. A <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> have given Stanley a fifth round place {{for the first time in}} their history, but they eventually lost 3–1. In the crowd at the club's following game was Preston North End's new manager Darren Ferguson to become Symes' latest suitor. Despite the interest in Symes, no further bids were reported by Accrington for him or for midfielder Bobby Grant as the January transfer window closed. Symes finished the season with 19goals—his best return of his career to that point—with 13 of those coming in the league.|$|E
5|$|The 1993–94 UEFA Champions League saw Linfield {{drawn with}} Dynamo Tbilisi of Georgia. After losing 3–2 on aggregate, they were {{reinstated}} when their opponents were {{expelled from the}} competition for alleged match fixing and paying the officials. Linfield faced Copenhagen {{in the first round}} proper. They won the first leg 3–0, but lost the second leg 4–0 after extra time. This proved costly, as <b>victory</b> <b>would</b> have meant a financially lucrative tie against eventual champions A.C. Milan in the next round. The club then had to wait seven years to participate in the competition again, due to the format of the two European competitions being altered. The league's relatively low ranking in the UEFA coefficient system has meant that the club has entered in the early qualifying rounds of either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with the second qualifying round being the furthest the club has progressed in either competition. In the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the Blues entered the competition in the first qualifying round, and defeated B36 Tórshavn 4–3 on penalties to progress to the second qualifying round, after both legs ended as 0–0 draws. This was {{the first time since the}} 1984–85 season (excluding their opponent's expulsion in 1993–94) that the club had won a tie in the competition. However, they were defeated 3–0 on aggregate in the next round by AEL Limassol.|$|E

50|$|Trintignant's win put to {{the sword}} the belief that rear-engined Cooper victory {{achieved}} by Stirling Moss in Argentina was a one-off freak circumstance win and the smaller British cars would be treated more seriously, although ultimately a Cooper would not win again until 1959. The Rob Walker Racing Teams pair of early 1958 <b>victories</b> <b>would</b> remain the best ever performance by a privateer team until the rise of Tyrrell Racing in the late 1960s.|$|R
