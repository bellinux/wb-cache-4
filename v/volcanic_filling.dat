40|$|The crustal {{evolution}} of the terrestrial planets increase in complexity and duration with increasing size and mass of the planet. The lunar and mercurian surfaces are largely the result of intense, post-differentiation impact bombardment and subsequent <b>volcanic</b> <b>filling</b> of major impact basins. Mars, being larger, has evolved further: crustal uplifts, rifting, and shield volcanoes have begun to modify its largely Moon-like surface. The Earth is the large end-number of this sequence, where modern plate tectonic processes have erased the earlier lunar and martian type of surfaces.

40|$|Measurements of Mercurian {{topography}} {{based on}} Arecibo radar observations are presented. The data, which {{were obtained from}} 1978 to 1984, cover much of the equatorial zone of Mercury between 12 øN and 5 øS latitude. Over thirty continuous altitude profiles were obtained, each spanning from 20 to 90 degrees of longitude at a resolution of 0. 15 ø (longitude) by 2. 5 ø (latitude). Radar depths for large craters support previous indications from imagery that Mercurian craters are shallower than lunar craters of the same size. One very large (800 km) impact basin shows some distinct topographic structure, although its relative shallowness uggests postimpact modification by isostatic relaxation or <b>volcanic</b> <b>filling.</b> The plains of Tir Planitia appear topographically smooth to the radar. These plains extend well into the hemisphere not imaged by Mariner 10, possibly forming {{part of a large}} annulus of smooth plains around Caloris Basin. The circum-Caloris smooth plains are strongly down-bowed, indicating subsidence under a load. This and other similarities to lunar maria suggest a volcanic origin for these plains. Additional areas of topographically smooth terrain have been found in both the imaged and unimaged hemispheres. Several ridges, scarps, and fault zones have been identified in the altimetry. Three mapped arcuate scarps show heights of about 700 m and cross-sectional widths of about 70 km. One of these features is clearly a ridge, while the other two scarps have a more ridge-like appearance than is suggested by images. On...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{geologic}} history, topographic expression, and gravity signature of 29 large Venusian shield volcanoes with similar morphologies in Magellan {{synthetic aperture radar}} imagery. While they appear similar in imagery, 16 have a domical topographic expression and 13 have a central depression. Typical dimensions for the central depression are 150 km wide and 500 m deep. The central depressions are probably not calderas resulting from collapse of a shallow magma chamber but instead {{are the result of}} a corona-like sagging of a previously domical volcano. The depressions all have some later <b>volcanic</b> <b>filling.</b> All but one of the central depression volcanoes have been post-dated by geologic features unrelated to the volcano, while most of the domical volcanoes are {{at the top of the}} stratigraphic column. Analysis of the gravity signatures in the spatial and spectral domains shows a strong correlation between the absence of post-dating features and the presence of dynamic support by an underlying plume. We infer that the formation of the central depressions occurred as a result of cessation of dynamic support. However, there are some domical volcanoes whose geologic histories and gravity signatures also indicate that they are extinct, so sagging of the central region apparently does not always occur when dynamic support is removed. We suggest that the thickness of the elastic lithosphere may be a factor in determining whether a central depression forms when dynamic support is removed, but the gravity data are of insufficient resolution to test this hypothesis with admittance methods...|$|E

40|$|Four major {{planation}} surfaces (PS) {{characterize the}} Ethiopian geology and landscape. They were modelled near or {{at sea level}} before the Ordovician (PS 1), before the Late Triassic (PS 2), before the Cenomanian (PS 3), and before the Oligocene (PS 4). These are unconformities in the sedimentary sequence recognizable across the entire country and the surrounding regions that due to uplift can be locally exhumed to generate wide steps in the landscape. At {{the top of the}} sequence, that also corresponds to the higher parts of the highlands, the flat depositional surface of the continental flood basalts (CFB) is preserved over large areas. However, a series of deep large palaeovalleys dissecting the CFB have been recognized on the water divides of the Afar, the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), the Southern Ethiopian Rift (SER), and the Somalian and Sudan lowlands that are the main geomorphological features of the country. The palaeovalleys testify to a radial pattern that originated from the dome created by the emplacement of the CFB. They are easily recognizable to the south of Dire Dawa and {{in the northern part of}} the country. They were modelled over the pre-volcanic bedrock but in most of the highlands were buried under later volcanic products. The deep erosion of the dome and the later <b>volcanic</b> <b>filling</b> can explain the results of the previous thermochronological investigation. Unfortunately, the thickness of the CFB could have led to the reset of the apatite fission tracks (AFT) during the Oligocene and it is difficult to separate the effects of deep erosion from that of uplift, also considering that they can be closely related. In any case, a progressive incision of the thicker part of the dome is documented soon after the CFB deposition in the Blue Nile Gorge and during the Miocene and the Plio-Pleistocene in many other parts of the country...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} new {{quantitative}} determination of shear wave velocities for distinct geological {{units in the}} Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic (Central Europe). The phase velocities of fundamental Love wave modes are measured along two long profiles (~ 200  km) crossing three major geological units and one rift-like structure of the studied region. We have developed {{a modified version of}} the classical multiple filtering technique for the frequency-time analysis and we apply it to two-station phase velocity estimation. Tests of both the analysis and inversion are provided. Seismograms of three Aegean Sea earthquakes are analyzed. One of the two profiles is further divided into four shorter sub-profiles. The long profiles yield smooth dispersion curves; while the curves of the sub-profiles have complicated shapes. Dispersion curve undulations are interpreted as period-dependent apparent velocity anomalies caused both by different backazimuths of surface wave propagation and by surface wave mode coupling. An appropriate backazimuth of propagation is found for each period, and the dispersion curves are corrected for this true propagation direction. Both the curves for the long and short profiles are inverted for a 1 D shear wave velocity model of the crust. Subsurface shear wave velocities are found to be around 2. 9  km/s for all four studied sub-profiles. Two of the profiles crossing the older Moldanubian and Teplá-Barrandian units are characterized by higher velocities of 3. 8  km/s in the upper crust while for the Saxothuringian unit we find the velocity slightly lower, around 3. 6  km/s at the same depths. We obtain an indication of a shear wave low velocity zone above Moho in the Moldanubian and Teplá-Barrandian units. The area of the Eger Rift (Teplá-Barrandian-Saxothuringian unit contact) is significantly different from all other three units. Low upper crust velocities suggest sedimentary and <b>volcanic</b> <b>filling</b> of the rift as well as fluid activity causing the earthquake swarms. Higher velocities in the lower crust together with weak or even missing Moho implies the upper mantle updoming...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Chachil depocentre {{is one of}} {{a number}} of early Mesozoic extensional basins that form the early depocentres of the {{southern}} Neuquén Basin in Argentina. The synrift <b>volcanic</b> <b>fill</b> is composed of andesites, rhyolites and volcaniclastic deposits. Coarse-grained, non-marine facies dominate the sedimentary fill, mainly in the form of sediment gravity flow deposits. Stream flow deposits and minor non-marine carbonates are also locally present. The evolution of the graben border system was mainly controlled by subsidence along the main boundary fault (the Chihuido Bayo fault system) and recurrent volcanic activity. Marked changes in the thickness of the synrift megasequence indicate that episodic normal faulting in the hanging wall was also important. The integration of structural, magmatic and sedimentary data from the study area has led to the definition of three stages in the evolution of the synrift succession. The early rift stage is defined by the interplay between bimodal volcanism and gravity-driven sedimentation. The mid-rift stage is marked by the transition to acidic magmatism (rhyolitic and pyroclastic flows), also associated with coarse-grained non-marine deposition. The late-rift stage is dominated by fine-grained turbidites and pyroclastic falls related to the first marine sedimentation in the Neuquén Basin. From Late Triassic to Early Jurassic time, part of the proto-Pacific margin of Gondwana was affected by continental ex...|$|R

Sedimentary facies include proximal submarine fans, shelf settings, and deltaic environments. Sea-floor anomaly data from the Pacific Ocean suggest that development of Upper Mesozoic to Cenozoic fore-arc, magmatic arc, and back-arc terrains of the Peninsula resulted from the subduction of the Phoenix Plate until the early Tertiary, and, after reorganization of spreading centers in Late Cretaceous time, subduction of the Aluk Plate.

These canyons are Late Miocene landforms based on a new ignimbrite stratigraphy supported by 42 new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age determinations obtained on plateau-forming and valley-filling ignimbrites. Between 19 and 13 Ma, a gently sloping surface bevelling the clastic wedge southeast of the developing mountain front was mantled by widespread ignimbrites. After 13 Ma, this paleosurface was tilted up from 2. 2 km a. s. l. at the mountain front to 4. 3 km a. s. l. {{at the base of}} the Pliocene and Pleistocene volcanoes that crown the southwestern edge of the Altiplano. The canyons incised this topography after 9 Ma, while the dated base of younger ignimbrite valley fills suggests that these canyons had been cut down to near their present depths as early as 3. 8 Ma. By 1. 4 Ma, however, the canyons had been almost completely refilled by 1. 3 km-thick unwelded pyroclastic deposits, which were subsequently eroded. Valley incision since 9 Ma at an average rate of 0. 2 mm yr− 1 is the response to topographic uplift after 13 Ma combined with increasing runoff due to a wetter climate recorded after 7 Ma.
