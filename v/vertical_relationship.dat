This paper adds a resource-based dimension by determining <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> between bidder and target using a method proposed by Fan and Lang (2000) based on flows of goods and production. For the sake of simplicity, we have not differentiated between forward and backward vertical integration or pure and mixed <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> (Fan and Goyal 2006).

Implementing network neutrality rules would be akin to using a per se antitrust rule regarding <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> instead of the rule of reason analysis typically applied to <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> in antitrust. Per se rules are used to prevent actions that rarely, if ever, have any procompetitive benefits, such as price-fixing agreements. Rule of reason analysis is used when there are potential efficiency gains from the actions under investigation. Some vertical practices of the wireless carriers, such as bandwidth restrictions, may appear to be anticompetitive, but may also have plausible efficiency justifications so should be judged under rule of reason analysis. Economic examination of the wireless industry shows significant competition between networks, which reduces the concern about <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships,</b> but also shows some areas that should be monitored by antitrust and regulatory authorities. We propose several regulatory changes that would likely increase wireless competition and lessen the perceived need for prophylactic network neutrality rules {{while at the same time}} allowing efficiency-enhancing <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships.</b> Mobile wireless competition Network neutrality Vertical restraints Federal Communications Commission Antitrust policy...|$|R

We build an analytical model to study the impact of value chain climbing on value distribution in <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships.</b> The analysis identifies a set of dominant relation-ships, characterizes how the buyer’s optimal choice among these relationships depends on firms’ relative competitiveness in the product market and the supplier’s speed of capability development, and shows how the optimal choice evolves with the dynamics of the supplier’s capability devel-opment. The results provide new insights into our understanding of value distribution in <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> across different contexts and over time. By endogenizing the supplier’s entry into the product market, our study enriches the literatures on <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships,</b> market entry, and the management of global value chains. ...|$|R

40|$|Managing <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> within diversified {{organizations}} {{is crucial to}} the attainment of overall organizational goals, yet it can also present a significant challenge. <b>Vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> can be characterised by intensified political games and incompatible interests. It is thus a contested relationship of conflicting interests; yet both parties to the relationship are motivated to maintain the relationship because they assume that its long–term benefits outweigh the costs. Whilst most of the literature focuses on managerial issues that are likely to emerge in <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships,</b> it does not appear to focus on the needs of vertically–related units and the development of such needs, particularly as the lower level unit develops. Therefore, the consequences that are likely to occur if these needs are not met have not been explored. One way to address this gap is by focusing on <b>vertical</b> inter–unit <b>relationship</b> quality; positioning relationship quality as a social resource in a power–dependence <b>relationship</b> (the <b>vertical</b> dyad). This thesis therefore aims to explore the meaning and the concomitants of relationship quality between vertically–related units in the context of diversified organisations. This is expected to contribute to the understanding of <b>vertical</b> inter–unit <b>relationships</b> by shedding light on the underlying meaning of relationship quality and the attributes that are likely to be attached to it from the perspectives of the parties to the relationship. In turn, this enables an exploration of the factors impacting on that quality as well as its consequences. ...|$|R

Most literature has focused on either the structure of conglomerates (Keiretsu/Chaebol) in East Asia in explaining the fast economic growth or the banking structure for the recent crisis in the region. Traditionally, the <b>vertical</b> <b>relationship</b> between core companies and their subsidiaries in the real sector was believed to be a driving force for the economic success in the region. However, the degree of <b>vertical</b> <b>relationship,</b> often measured in cross-ownership among group companies, varies according to the firms ’ performance and subsequently affects banking relationships. I argue the information sharing mechanism via cross-ownership provides an important lending criterion for the banking relationship. Empirical evidence from the panel data constructed for the top 10 largest Korean holding companies (chaebols) and their subsidiaries between 1994 - 2002 suggests that firms with a weak <b>vertical</b> <b>relationship</b> in the real sector are more likely to choose collective relationship banking (CRB) to reinforce the information gap.

The findings of this paper suggest that there are both demand- and supply-side factors that contribute to the emergence of modern retailing. The evolution of <b>vertical</b> <b>relationships</b> between farmers and modern retailers observed in Indonesia is a direct response to risks and quality uncertainty. In the vertical relation, large-scale retailers may earn a monopsonistic rent, and there are risks of exclusion of small-scale farmers from the emerging food value chain. However, there are alternative channels through which farmers may sell their products, albeit at a lower price compared to the modern channels, and measures can be instituted to protect them against monopsonistic rents.

This paper examines the interaction between a man-ufacturer’s optimal information acquisition and sharing strategies in a <b>vertical</b> <b>relationship,</b> capturing the impacts of both the flexibility to sequentially control information collection and the flexibility in ex post voluntary sharing. We show that, when information acquisition is sequential, the manufacturer may not acquire perfect information {{even if it is}} costless to do so. This self-restriction in information acquisition follows from the manufacturer’s motivation to strategically influence retail behavior. When information acquisition is inflexible and constrained to be either zero or perfect information, the manufacturer acquires less (more) information under mandatory (voluntary) sharing. Moreover, voluntary sharing unambigu-ously leads to more information being generated, because the manufacturer has the option to strategically withhold the acquired information {{that turns out to be}} unfavorable.
