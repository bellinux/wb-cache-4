Although <b>vertical</b> <b>distortions</b> exist in the rendered images, they can be alleviated by depth correction. Like panoramas, concentric mosaics do not require recovering geometric and photometric scene models.

40|$|This report aims {{to compare}} {{the state of the}} art Omni‐directional image unwrapping methods/algorithms in order to develop a fast and {{correctly}} transformed panoramic image. Omni‐directional vision systems consist of a perspective camera adapted to a hyperbolic mirror. It is known that the distribution of resolution from hyperbolic mirrors is better than the one obtained with systems that use spherical mirror or parabolic mirrors without the orthographic lens. There are several methods to unwrapping Omni‐directional image. The most common method used, to obtain panoramic images, is by directly transforming the polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates. The panoramic image is created by doing an inverse mapping of the pixels, for each pixel in the panoramic image a correspondence pixel must exist in the Omni‐directional camera image. An improved version of this method can be done by including the mirror equation in the unwrapping process, so the <b>vertical</b> <b>distortion</b> is null. The circular features from an Omni‐directional image after unwrapping become linear and image tracking/detection algorithms are simplified. Nevertheless, the image must be correctly transformed. Thus, to speed up the process of unwrapping the image in real time, instead of calculating the coordinates at all‐time, lookup tables are used to know which pixel from the Omni‐directional image have a direct correspondence to the panoramic image...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In modern construction, it is {{not unusual}} to require a short span member to carry a very large load such as with a {{transfer}} girder. These members generally have high shear strengths with strut-and-tie models being able to predict these strengths generally in a conservative manner. For serviceability checks, cracked stiffness estimates, and seismic design, however, {{it is also important to}} be able to predict the deformations of the member accurately. In this paper a set of eight large and heavily instrumented reinforced concrete deep beams subjected to monotonic or cyclic loading are summarized. The displacements of these tests are explained in detail with particular attention paid to the development of deformations over the full load history. From these deformations, the paper notes that a simple 2 degree of freedom (DOF) kinematic model can be developed to predict the entire displacement field for a beam after diagonal cracking has occurred. These two degrees of freedom are the average longitudinal strain in the flexural reinforcement, and the <b>vertical</b> <b>distortion</b> of the critical loading zone near the applied load. When the results of the measured displacements of the beam tests are compared to the pattern of deformations from the 2 DOF model, excellent agreement is obtained. In addition, it is shown that the width of the main diagonal crack can also be explained well using the same 2 DOF model once these parameters are known. A forthcoming paper will explain how these parameters themselves can be predicted. 1...|$|E
