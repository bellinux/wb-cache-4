25|$|The {{powers of}} the Supreme Court are defined in Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution. These {{functions}} may be generally divided into two – judicial functions and administrative functions. The administrative functions of the Court pertain to the supervision and control over the Philippine judiciary and its employees, as well as over members of the Philippine bar. Pursuant to these functions, the Court is empowered to order a change of <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> {{in order to avoid}} a miscarriage of justice and to appoint all officials and employees of the judiciary. The Court is further authorized to promulgate the rules for admission to the practice of law, for legal assistance to the underprivileged, and the procedural rules to be observed in all courts.|$|E

50|$|Chief Deputy Public Defender Kent Faulkner {{was also}} {{assigned}} to the case. Peterson later indicated that he could afford a private attorney, namely Mark Geragos, who had done other high-profile criminal defense work. A judge changed the <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial</b> from Modesto to Redwood City, California on January 20, 2004, due to increasing hostility toward Peterson in the Modesto area.|$|R
2500|$|In July 1985, the <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> a civil <b>trial</b> {{was moved}} because studies {{offered by the}} Foundation showed bias. [...] The judge stated that [...] "community attitudes would not permit a fair and {{impartial}} trial".|$|R
25|$|On June 19, 2009, Mehserle {{pleaded not}} guilty. The jury trial was {{scheduled}} to begin in October. Mehserle's attorney Michael Rains sought a change <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial,</b> {{on the grounds that}} there would not be an impartial jury in Alameda County. Citing extensive media coverage and the social upheaval of protests and riots, the judge agreed. Rains's request was honored on October 16, and downtown Los Angeles was chosen as the venue on November 19.|$|R
50|$|New York City Mayor John F. Hylan and his {{administration}} placed blame on the BRT, bringing both Luciano and company officials to trial for manslaughter. With a change <b>of</b> <b>venue</b> the <b>trial</b> was held in Nassau County.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was built}} in 1797 {{on the site of}} the old Newgate Gaol. [...] The {{architect}} is believed to have been Whitmore Davis. [...] The building was remodelled between 1837 and 1842 by Michael Semple. There was a royal visit in 1849, and the court was the <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> several noted <b>trials</b> such as those of Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet in 1803, John Mitchel in 1848 and other Fenian leaders.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, the California Attorney General filed {{charges against}} Allen and prosecuted {{the trial in}} Glenn County, California, due to a change <b>of</b> <b>venue.</b> The <b>trial</b> lasted 23 days, and 58 {{witnesses}} were called to testify. Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple murder and conspiracy to murder eight witnesses.|$|R
50|$|All three Bixbys were {{initially}} {{held in the}} Abbeville County jail, awaiting trial. For a brief period in 2005, Steven Bixby {{was moved to the}} Anderson County jail; in early 2006, he was moved again to the Lexington County jail, where he remained as of late August 2006, due to a breach of confidentiality regarding his meetings with expert witnesses in the case. Trial dates in the case were pushed back several times from their originally scheduled starts in mid-2004. One reason for the delays was the sudden death of Circuit Judge Marc Westbrook in a September 2005 traffic accident; another reason was the contest between the defense and prosecution over both the <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial</b> and the county from which a jury pool would be selected. In early 2006, Macaulay agreed with Steven Bixby's defense that it would be nearly impossible to seat a truly impartial jury of Abbeville County citizens; in July 2006, Macaulay ruled that potential jurors would come from Chesterfield County.|$|R
50|$|Under {{a change}} <b>of</b> <b>venue,</b> the <b>trial</b> was moved over 150 miles {{away to the}} city of Chesapeake, Virginia. He pleaded {{not guilty by reason of}} {{insanity}} to all charges on the grounds that he was under Muhammad's complete control. One of Malvo's psychiatric witnesses testified that Muhammad, a member of Nation of Islam, had indoctrinated him into believing that the proceeds of the extortion attempt would be used to begin a new nation of only pure black young persons somewhere in Canada.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the <b>venue</b> <b>of</b> Mohammad’s <b>trial</b> and is broken into three sections. The first section reviews the {{historical}} use of military tribunals. This section begins {{by looking at the}} basis for Presidential authority to authorize the use of military commissions. This section then outlines the first use of military commissions since World War II. President George W. Bush’s authorization parallels the provisions in President Franklin Roosevelt’s authorization of the use of commissions in the 1940 s. However, following authorization, the military commissions were subject to judicial challenges and significant revision by Congress. Finally, this section tracks recent developments since President Barack Obama took office. The second section addresses the location <b>of</b> Mohammad’s <b>trial.</b> This section begins by discussing Attorney General Eric Holder’s announcement on November 13, 2009 to move the <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> Mohammad to the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York. This section addresses public opposition to the decision and concludes with a discussion of Holder’s January 30, 2010 decision to reconsider the location <b>of</b> the <b>trial.</b> Because the Obama Administration has yet to decide which venue to pursue, the third section considers the strengths and weakness of both options. In addition to the civilian or military trials, this section explores a third “hybrid” option: a national security court with jurisdiction over international terrorism issues...|$|R
50|$|Virginia Beach made {{national}} {{headlines in}} 2003 when it hosted the first <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> convicted Beltway sniper murderer John Allen Muhammad. The area was selected {{due to a}} court order for a change <b>of</b> <b>venue.</b> His <b>trial</b> began in October 2003, and the following month, he {{was found guilty of}} capital murder in one of the series of shootings and extortion attempts. Four months later, the judge agreed with the jury's recommendation, and he was sentenced to death. In April 2005, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the local court's verdict and the death sentence. Muhammed was executed on November 10, 2009.|$|R
500|$|The <b>venue</b> {{provision}} <b>of</b> Article III (regulating {{the location}} <b>of</b> the <b>trial)</b> {{is distinct from}} the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment (regulating the geography from which the jury pool is selected).

Unlike judicial districts under the Vicinage Clause, consistent with Article III, Congress may [...] "provide a place <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> where none was provided when the offense was committed, or change the place <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> after the commission of the offense." ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Oklahoma City bombing, processes of reconstruction - remembering victims, caring for family members and survivors, and punishing the perpetrators - began even as debris from the Murrah Federal Building was being cleared. Based on conclusions obtained from intensive interviews with 27 victims 2 ̆ 7 family members and survivors, this article explores how memory of the bombing as a culturally traumatic event was constructed through participation in groups formed after the bombing and participation in the legal proceedings against perpetrators Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. These acts cultivated the formation of various relationships - between family members and survivors as well as between these victimized populations and the perpetrators - that both helped and hindered individual and communal reconstructions of meaning. This article will first address the efficacy of a collective memory and cultural trauma perspective for analyzing two collective processes of sense-making - group membership and legal proceedings - in {{the aftermath}} of the Oklahoma City bombing. It will then briefly describe the mental context in which family members and survivors joined groups in the wake of the bombing, and the functions those groups played in trauma recovery, after which it will summarize the impact of group membership on punishment expectations. Next, it will discuss the involuntary relationship that formed between McVeigh and family members and survivors predicated on the social and media representations of McVeigh; due to this relationship, McVeigh was felt to be a constant presence in victims 2 ̆ 7 lives until his 2001 execution. Finally, this article will examine family members 2 ̆ 7 and survivors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of communicative interchange with McVeigh in the <b>venues</b> <b>of</b> the <b>trial</b> and execution. The implications of this case study illustrate in what ways concepts such as victimhood and justice are continually being expanded, with the implication that law is not only a social institution that mediates cultural trauma and cultivates collective memory, but also is manifestly conscious of these roles...|$|R

50|$|In 1719 two Briefs of Pope Clement XI were {{in favour}} of the claims of Armagh. In practice, however, the primatial right has fallen into desuetude in Ireland as in every {{other part of the}} Church. In 1679, Oliver Plunkett was arrested on a charge of conspiring to bring 20,000 Frenchmen into the country and of having levied moneys on his clergy for the purpose of {{maintaining}} 70,000 men for an armed rebellion against the Crown. After being confined in Dublin Castle for many months, he was presented for trial on these and other charges in Dundalk; but the jury, though all Protestants, refused to find a true bill against him. The <b>venue,</b> however, <b>of</b> his <b>trial</b> was changed to London, where he was tried by a jury before he was able to gather his witnesses and bring them across, though he made the request to the judge. The principal witnesses against him were some priests and friars of Armagh whom he had censured and suspended for their alleged conduct. He was dragged on a sledge to Tyburn on 1 July 1681, where he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in presence of an immense multitude. His head, still in a good state of preservation, can be viewed to this day in St. Peter's church, West St., Drogheda.|$|R
