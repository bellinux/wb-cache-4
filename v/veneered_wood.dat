50|$|The {{conservation}} and restoration of wooden furniture is an activity {{dedicated to the}} preservation and protection of wooden furniture objects of historical and personal value. When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer. Furniture {{conservation and}} restoration {{can be divided into}} two general areas: structure and finish. Structure generally relates to wood and can be divided into solid, joined, and <b>veneered</b> <b>wood.</b> The finish of furniture can be painted or transparent.|$|E

This generation of sculptors were known for conveying content from [...] "gentle craft substances: fiberglass, beeswax, <b>veneered</b> <b>wood,</b> string, paper, pigment and fabric." [...] That era's critics recognized Hill's life-size, weighty, abstract sculptures for signaling a revived interest in body art, {{as well as the}} figure, which remains the hallmark of 90s sculpture. In Michael Brenson's 1986 New York Times art review, he describes her work At Arm's Length as suggesting [...] "hills, bones, and cliffs, but it can also bring to mind the characteristic body shift of Greek and Renaissance standing figures." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the optimisation {{studies of}} a pre-stressed embedment-type timber joint system, the Kusabi–Nageshi (K–N) timber joint system, {{designed to be}} used for structures in seismic-prone countries. The K–N joint is composed of a triangular-sectioned beam and wedges in combination with bolts. Its resistive mechanism utilises the embedment strength of timber and the pre-stress in association with friction. In addition, elastic energy deposited in the bolt as storage fills the gap as it is deformed during the embedment. With the aim of optimising both mechanically and physically, several alterations were tested in terms of shape (taper angle) and of combining densified <b>veneer</b> <b>wood</b> (DVW) with the joint members. A cyclic loading test of the cross joints was made to examine their structural behaviour. The use of less tapered wedges showed higher stiffness and strength, but the beam beneath was undesirably embedded. Different combinations of reinforcement with densified <b>veneer</b> <b>wood</b> showed that the use of the wedges alone provided high optimisation, and an increase in bolt axial force. The successful test results observed in the alteration using the densified <b>veneer</b> <b>wood</b> are expressed using the ‘analytical K–N joint diagram', an analytical method modified from a conventional joint diagram used in mechanical engineering, which showed itself to be an applicable method to predict the trend of the altered K–N joint. The use of the new tapered angle and densified <b>veneer</b> <b>wood</b> for optimisation, and the performance predictions using the analytical K–N joint diagram, will need further precise investigations but their great benefits are potentially promising...|$|R

50|$|Some {{projects}} built using <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> {{would not}} be possible to construct using solid lumber, owing to expansion and contraction caused by fluctuation of temperature and humidity. Another advantage of veneer is sustainability—furniture made with <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> uses less <b>wood</b> than the same piece of furniture made with solid <b>wood.</b> Further, <b>veneer</b> may also be more readily available than solid wood as exotic hardwood lumber can be scarce and very expensive.|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of wood and}} wood products in Greece is based greatly on imports necessitating every year a great proportion of public expenditures. The study of wood and wood product imports consequently, {{is important to the}} national economy and can be a useful guide for the forest farms, wood industries and wood firms.

30|$|However, most {{previous}} work focused on wood fiber or wood powder. Since both wood fiber (powder) and <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> have reactive hydroxyl groups, {{there is significant}} interest {{in the application of}} these methods for the improvement of <b>wood</b> <b>veneer.</b> Previous work showed increased compatibility between <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> and plastic film by spraying silane agent on veneers [24, 25], but this chemical-based method was limited in its industrial use because of high modification costs and relatively complicated processing.

It's ideal for residential projects, hotel projects, offices giving to the any interior a unique look and feel. In addition, veneer is also processed to create a variety of products such as veneer parquet, flexible <b>veneer</b> sheets, <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> boards, <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> wallpaper, etc. From the other side, veneered surfaces will always {{to a greater or}} lesser degree could change color, particular upon exposure to natural and artificial light. The degree of color change will depend on such factors as the species chosen, the coating type used and intensity and period of the exposure to light. In addition, conventional finishes have a tendency to yellow with age which can have quite dramatic effects on the original color of the selected timber. To minimize these effects new finishes have to be developed. In the paper new, unvisible nanolevel coating for veneer finish based on the sol-gel process is offered. It is known that the sol–gel technique is an established industrial process for the generation of colloidal nanoparticles from liquid phase, which has been further developed in last years for the production of advanced coatings. It is well adapted for oxide nanoparticles and composites synthesis. The main advantages of sol-gel techniques are comparable low processing temperatures offering unique opportunities for access to organic and inorganic materials. The sol synthesis and application technology as well protective properties of coating will be discussed...|$|R

Currently mainstream, contemporary non-metallic connections are typically constrained to the form of glued connections. However, glued connections require strict quality control, which adds expense and requires off site prefabrication. This has restricted the exploitation of the benefits of non-metallic connections.
