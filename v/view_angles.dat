Three of Zzap!64s reviewers—Julian Rignall, Gary Liddon, and Gary Penn—called the graphics [...] "amazing", well-executed, and [...] "varied"; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game. Computer Gamer reviewer Mike Roberts praised Spindizzys gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a joystick.

Phil South of Your Sinclair gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and addictiveness. He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite. He also lauded the speed and quality of the graphics. Info gave the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a hot little number with much of the appeal of Marble Madness" [...] but better; [...] "Yep, it's a winner ...

There is {{a desire}} for a display {{technology}} which can change the display <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> Controllable <b>Viewing</b> <b>Angle</b> (CVA) device has been developed by using a Guest-Host liquid crystal cell which allows a high light-shielding effect and the control {{with a wide range}} of available <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> By putting the CVA device on a Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) Liquid-Crystal Panel, or placing a Guest-Host Liquid Crystal (GHLC) device between the LED and the backlight, we have realized a simple controllable viewing-angle LCD which could be switched in the narrow and normal(wide) <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> The <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> can decrease to 40 ° when power is on but it also can shift to normal <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> when power is off...|$|R

40|$|Gait {{is a well}} {{recognized}} {{biometric feature}} {{that is used to}} identify a human at a distance. However, in real environment, appearance changes of individuals due to <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> changes cause many difficulties for gait recognition. This paper re-formulates this problem as a regression problem. A novel solution is proposed to create a View Transformation Model (VTM) from the different point of view using Support Vector Regression (SVR). To facilitate the process of regression, a new method is proposed to seek local Region of Interest (ROI) under one <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> for predicting the corresponding motion information under another <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> Thus, the well constructed VTM is able to transfer gait information under one <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> into another <b>viewing</b> <b>angle.</b> This proposal can achieve viewindependent gait recognition. It normalizes gait features under various <b>viewing</b> <b>angles</b> into a common <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> before similarity measurement is carried out. The extensive experimental results based on widely adopted benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better performance than the existing methods in literature. 1...|$|R

40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{over the}} last decade resulted in significant improvements in the LCD's <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> performance. Consequently, the current method to define the viewing cone, with a fixed contrast ratio, does not represent perceived performance differences between displays. Our previous study, with two LCDs and a plasma display, revealed that changes in image quality with <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> are predicted by combining luminance variations and white-point shifts for an intermediate grey level. In this paper, we show that, for viewers comparing the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> dependent quality between displays, that same relation holds. If the calculated <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> is larger than the measured acceptability threshold, the remaining quality at the threshold angle serves as a <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> performance indicator. © 2008 Elsevier B.

50|$|For the {{acquisition}} of the images two different approaches exist. In general, 2D and 3D images can be acquired. If 3D data is acquired, cross sections at arbitrary <b>view</b> <b>angles</b> can be calculated. Three-dimensional data can also be generated by combining 2D data from different slices, but this approach results in lower quality images at <b>view</b> <b>angles</b> different from the original data acquisition. Furthermore, the 3D data can not only {{be used to create}} cross sectional images, but also projections can be calculated from the data. Three-dimensional data acquisition might also be helpful when dealing with complex vessel geometries where blood is flowing in all spatial directions (unfortunately, this case also requires three different flow encodings, one in each spatial direction).Both PC-MRA and TOF-MRA have advantages and disadvantages. PC-MRA has fewer difficulties with slow flow than TOF-MRA and also allows quantitative measurements of flow. PC-MRA shows low sensitivity when imaging pulsating and non-uniform flow.In general, slow blood flow is a major challenge in flow dependent MRA. It causes the differences between the blood signal and the static tissue signal to be small. This either applies to PC-MRA where the phase difference between blood and static tissue is reduced compared to faster flow and to TOF-MRA where the transverse blood magnetization and thus the blood signal are reduced. Contrast agents may be used to increase blood signal - this is especially important for very small vessels and vessels with very small flow velocities that normally show accordingly weak signal. Unfortunately, the use of gadolinium-based contrast media can be dangerous if patients suffer from poor renal function. To avoid these complications as well as eliminate the costs of contrast media, nonenhanced methods have been researched recently.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{aim of the}} {{projects}} was a more sophisticated development of the rather modest MRI techniques available {{in the early eighties}} - mainly with respect to speed and specificity. Already in 1985 the group presented a major breakthrough for the future development of MRI in both science and medicine. The invention of a rapid imaging principle, the FLASH MRI (fast low angle shot) technique, allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH acquisition technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging. Examples include breathhold imaging of the abdomen, electrocardiogram-synchronized quasi-real time movies of the beating heart, dynamic scanning of contrast media uptake, 3D imaging of complex anatomic structures such as the brain that allow for unprecedented high spatial resolution and arbitrary <b>view</b> <b>angles,</b> and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the vasculature. Other achievements extended to MRI and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques based on stimulated echoes - another invention from 1984.|$|E

40|$|Directional thermal {{radiance}} from vegetation {{depends on}} many factors, including {{the architecture of}} the plant canopy, thermal irradiance, emissivity of the foliage and soil, <b>view</b> <b>angle,</b> slope, and the kinetic temperature distribution within the vegetation-soil system. A one dimensional model, which includes the influence of topography, indicates that thermal emissivity of vegetation canopies may remain constant with <b>view</b> <b>angle,</b> or emissivity may increase or decrease as <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> from nadir increases. Typically, variations of emissivity with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> are less than 0. 01. As <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> increases away from nadir, directional infrared canopy temperature usually decreases but may remain nearly constant or even increase. Variations in directional temperature with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> may be 5 C or more. Model predictions of directional emissivity are compared with field measurements in corn canopies and over a bare soil using a method that requires two infrared thermometers, one sensitive to the 8 to 14 micrometer wavelength band and a second to the 14 to 22 micrometer band. After correction for CO 2 absorption by the atmosphere, a directional canopy emissivity can be obtained as a function of <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> in the 8 to 14 micrometer band to an accuracy of about 0. 005. Modeled and measured canopy emissivities for corn varied slightly with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> (0. 990 at nadir and 0. 982 at 75 deg <b>view</b> zenith <b>angle)</b> and did not appear to vary significantly with <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> for the bare soil. Canopy emissivity is generally nearer to unity than leaf emissivity may vary by 0. 02 with wavelength even though leaf emissivity. High spectral resolution, canopy thermal emissivity may vary by 0. 02 with wavelength even though leaf emissivity may vary by 0. 07. The one dimensional model provides reasonably accurate predictions of infrared temperature and can be used to study the dependence of infrared temperature on various plant, soil, and environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Linear-array-based photoacoustic {{computed}} tomography (PACT) {{suffers from a}} limited view. Circular scanning does increase the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> but is time-consuming. Therefore, it is desirable to increase the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of linear-array-based PACT without sacrificing imaging speed. Methods: Two planar acoustic reflectors placed at 120 degrees to each other were added to a linear-array-based PACT system. Each reflector redirects originally undetectable photoacoustic waves back to the transducer array elements, and together they triple the original detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of the PACT system. Results: Adding two reflectors increased the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> from 80 to 240 degrees. As a comparison, a single-reflector PACT has a detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of only 160 degrees. A leaf skeleton phantom with a rich vascular network was imaged with the double-reflector PACT, {{and most of its}} features were recovered. Conclusions: The two acoustic reflectors triple the detection <b>view</b> <b>angle</b> of a linear-array-based PACT without compromising the original imaging speed. This nearly full-view detection capability produces higher-quality images than single-reflector PACT or conventional PACT without reflectors...|$|R
50|$|The {{coronagraph}} {{was introduced}} in 1931 by the French astronomer Bernard Lyot; since then, coronagraphs have been used at many solar observatories. Coronagraphs operating within Earth's atmosphere suffer from scattered light in the sky itself, due primarily to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in the upper atmosphere. At <b>view</b> <b>angles</b> close to the Sun, the sky is much brighter than the background corona even at high altitude sites on clear, dry days. Ground based coronagraphs, such as the High Altitude Observatory's Mark IV Coronagraph on top of Mauna Loa, use polarization to distinguish sky brightness from {{the image of the}} corona: both coronal light and sky brightness are scattered sunlight and have similar spectral properties, but the coronal light is Thomson-scattered at nearly a right angle and therefore undergoes scattering polarization, while the superimposed light from the sky near the Sun is scattered at only a glancing angle and hence remains nearly unpolarized.|$|E

By comparing the different view images horizontally, different parallax information can be obtained. In the range of ± 33 °, you can get the correct reconstructed image of the whole scene. The proposed method is about approximately 4 times the <b>viewing</b> <b>angle</b> of the conventional integral imaging. The different wide-viewing integral three-dimensional imaging methods proposed by Refs.
