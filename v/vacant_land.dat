5|$|After {{capturing}} Kaifeng, the Jurchens went on {{to conquer}} the rest of northern China, while the Song Chinese court fled south. They took up temporary residence at Nanjing, where a surviving prince was named Emperor Gaozong of Song in 1127. Jin forces halted at the Yangzi River, but staged continual raids south of the river until a later boundary was fixed at the Huai River further north. With the border fixed at the Huai, the Song government would promote an immigration policy of repopulating and resettling territories north of the Yangzi River, since vast tracts of <b>vacant</b> <b>land</b> between the Yangzi and Huai were open for landless peasants found in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces of the south.|$|E
5|$|One of the city's {{most recent}} sports-related attractions is the Covelli Centre, which was funded {{primarily}} through a $26 million federal grant. Located {{on the site}} of an abandoned steel mill, the large, high-tech facility opened in October 2005. It was formerly called the Chevrolet Center, and during planning it was known as the Youngstown Convocation Center. The Centre's main tenants are the Youngstown Phantoms, who play in the United States Hockey League. Previously, it was home to the Youngstown Steelhounds hockey team, who played in the CHL. The city plans to develop <b>vacant</b> <b>land</b> adjacent to the Centre for a park, a riverwalk (the Mahoning River flows through the site), an amphitheater, or an athletic stadium for the city's public and private high schools.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{will present}} {{preliminary}} {{results of our}} ongoing study on the soundscapes of <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> in Lisbon Eastern Zone (LEZ). Our methodology comprised two stages. Firstly, all the <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> of Lisbon municipality were identified and georeferenced using remote sensing methods and high-resolution aerial photography. In the second stage, a field survey {{with the purpose of}} characterising the morphology, vegetation, and animal and human occupation of the <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> was conducted, along with field recordings of their soundscapes. The results of our study include the classification of <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> and of their soundscapes. We argue that listening to the sounds of urban <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> defies traditional notions of the urban soundscape as dominated by anthrophonies. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|R

5|$|The station grew {{rapidly as}} traffic increased. Its {{workload}} increased from handling 2,700 parcels {{a month in}} 1838 to 52,000 a month in 1841. By 1845, 140 people were working there and trains began to run late {{because of a lack}} of capacity. The following year, two new platforms (later Nos.9 and 10) were constructed on <b>vacant</b> <b>land</b> to the west of the station that had been reserved for Great Western Railway services. The L amalgamated with the Manchester & Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway in 1846 to form the LNWR, with the company headquarters at Euston. This required a new block of offices to be built between the Arch and the platforms.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{introduced}} {{a case study}} for Route31 for its New Jersey: Future in Transportation project. Over time, the residents and business owners of Raritan Township and Flemington had growing concerns over the congestion along the highway and US202. After trying to use <b>vacant</b> <b>land</b> {{to the east of}} the current alignment, the Department of Transportation put forth the Flemington Bypass, trying to relieve congestion on Route31 along the commercial district and to provide access to the industrial land between the two highways and the South Branch River. The project was never completed and the proposed site remains undeveloped. The Department of Transportation is now looking at a scaled-down bypass, proposed as the South Branch Parkway, to connect Route31 to US202 in Flemington.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1898, the CCE {{published}} another bill to add {{an extension}} and to modify part of the route. The extension was a branch from Camden Town to Kentish Town where a new terminus was planned as an interchange with the Midland Railway's Kentish Town station. Beyond the terminus, the CCE line was {{to come to the}} surface for a depot on <b>vacant</b> <b>land</b> to the east of Highgate Road (occupied today by the Ingestre Road Estate). The modification changed the Euston branch by extending it northwards from Euston to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. Included in the bill were powers to purchase a site in Cranbourn Street for an additional station (Leicester Square). It received royal assent as the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1899 on 9 August 1899.|$|E

40|$|Socially {{vulnerable}} {{populations are}} often concentrated in flood vulnerable urban areas, resulting in multiple cultural, economic, and ecological issues. Sunnyside, a 4096 acre historically African-American community in Houston, Texas, faces {{the issues of}} flooding hazards, high percentage of <b>vacant</b> <b>lands,</b> and low quality of life. Sixteen percent of the neighborhood falls within the 100 - and 500 -year floodplains, with frequent stormwater settling and ponding; 22 % of the neighborhood lots are currently either vacant or abandoned due to population migrations. In addition, {{there is a significant}} lack of open spaces and community facilities in the vicinity. Thus, the study explores how urban regeneration of <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> can seek to enhance revitalization and resilience in the community. Through four months of public engagement, this research-design study incorporates citizen-driven decision making for identifying the existing issues and future goals. The study then develops a toolbox to reclaim existing <b>vacant</b> <b>lands,</b> depending on each lot?s type, size, location, and flood vulnerability. An ArcGIS land suitability analysis with the parameters of elevation, slope, land cover, and existing building footprint is conducted to identify the most suitable <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> for future green infrastructure. A 202 acres site is used as a case site to apply Low Impact Development urban design facilities for regulating stormwater and providing active and passive recreation. Integrating green infrastructure within a majority of <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> in the neighborhood allows for absorption and infiltration of stormwater before channeling it to the nearby Sims Bayou, and creates an open space network for a healthier community. The rest of the <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> are transformed into spatial functions according to identified community needs. For design implementation, the first phase focuses on creating a green infrastructure skeleton to alleviate flood issues, the second phase implements major community facilities as anchor points to spur future development, and the third phase concentrates on infilling housing and new job creation. The design impact analysis projects a significant increase in regeneration of the existing underutilized spaces and decreases in impervious surfaces in the neighborhood, and allows for building capacity and involvement in the community planning process as well...|$|R
5|$|By 1969, WMATA {{had decided}} on the current routing and stations, except for the {{extension}} beyond Rockville to Shady Grove. Montgomery County officials opposed ending the Red Line in downtown Rockville, saying it would cause congestion {{in the area and}} use scarce <b>vacant</b> <b>land</b> for a storage yard. Metro decided to propose to extend the red line one more station to Shady Grove and the U.S. Department of Transportation conditionally approved funding for the extension on July 26, 1975. Construction on the Red Line began with a groundbreaking ceremony on December 9, 1969. Construction proved difficult because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required that the Red Line tunnel under that valley, the tunnel in turn caused both the Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built further underground. The Red Line was proposed to tunnel under Yuma Street from Connecticut Avenue to Wisconsin Avenue, but local residents sued and that court case delayed construction of the tunnel for two years, then WMATA finally won the right to build the tunnel there.|$|E

40|$|Cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) have {{experienced}} rapid uncontrolled urbanism {{due to the}} absence of robust planning measures. This causes lack or ill distributions of facilities and segregation between these facilities and the residences in districts and neighbourhoods across the King-dom. It also encouraged citizens to adopt unhealthy lifestyles which in turn aggravated their health conditions. This paper discusses the critical relationship between the unhealthy lifestyle of diabetic patients and the proximity of public gardens. A survey on 76 diabetic patients and their living conditions was carried out. A visual and mapping survey was conducted on public gardens and <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> around diabeticsâ homes. The study found that cities in the Eastern province, KSA have unhealthy urban and suburban settings in terms of the proximity and characteristics of public gardens. It is revealed that patients have unhealthier lifestyle and frequent diabetic symptoms when gardens are far away and <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> are nearer to their homes. This calls the need for emergent amendment of the present planning regulations for the use of <b>vacant</b> <b>lands</b> and public amenities including public gardens in Saudi cities so they would help improving the physical, psychological and spiritual health of the diabetic patients and the community...|$|R

I have gathered data of advertised and sale prices in the Municipality of Å entjernej. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of individual land prices and the comparison between the advertised and sales price has been made. By calculating the damages for change in intended purpose of use and public utilities charge, I assess the market value of land on individual stages of land development for agricultural <b>land,</b> <b>vacant</b> construction <b>land,</b> <b>vacant</b> construction <b>land</b> with paid compensation for change in purpose of use intended and <b>vacant</b> construction <b>land</b> with paid compensation for change in purpose of use and with paid public utility charge. The conclusion of the research shows that the advertised and the sale price differ substantially. However, the prices in Å entjernej are relatively low compared to the Slovene average. The price discrepancy per square meter is characteristic of different stages of land development.
