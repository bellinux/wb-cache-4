40|$|The {{performance}} of a quantum <b>information</b> <b>processor</b> depends on the precise control of phases introduced into the system during quantum gate operations. As the number of operations increases with the complexity of a computation, the phases of gates at different locations and different times must be controlled, which can be challenging for optically-driven operations. We circumvent this issue by demonstrating an entangling gate between two trapped atomic ions that is insensitive to the optical phases of the driving fields, while using a common master reference clock for all coherent qubit operations. Such techniques may be crucial for scaling to large quantum <b>information</b> <b>processors</b> in many physical platforms...|$|R

We compare several established pulse sequences, and follow the state evolution within them. The agreement between measurements and simple predictions shows the underlying coherence of the atom ensemble, and the inversion infidelity in a ? 80 ?K atom cloud is halved. Composite pulse techniques, especially if tailored for atom interferometric applications, should allow greater interferometer areas, larger atomic samples, and longer interaction times, and hence improve the sensitivity of quantum technologies from inertial sensing and clocks to quantum <b>information</b> <b>processors</b> and tests of fundamental physics...|$|R
