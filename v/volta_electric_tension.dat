50|$|Since 1907 Oriol was {{member of}} the {{executive}} board of Hidroeléctrica Española, the company run by his father-in-law. In 1909 Oriol replaced the ailing Lucas Urquijo {{at the helm of}} the enterprise; though his term lasted only a year, he remained in management structures and contributed to the growth of Hidrola. In 1913 he co-founded Electras Marroquíes, responsible for electrification of Northern zone of the Spanish protectorate. When he returned to the top HE post in 1937, Hidrola was already one of the 20 largest Spanish companies (second in the energy sector), controlling 12,5% of the national energy market. Hidroeléctrica owed its success to the sound financial basis, expansive strategy and responsiveness to particular conditions of the oligopolistic energy market structure. Oriol led Hidrola through the years of the Civil War and resigned in 1941, to be replaced by his son José Maria. Throughout his career he has also remained engaged in many HE subsidiaries like Madrileña Electra, Electra Valencia, Cartagena UE or <b>Volta</b> <b>Electric.</b> Apart from the energy sector, Oriol entered the construction business co-founding the Spanish branch of Babcock & Wilcox. He was also sitting in executive boards of a number of other companies and owned a semi-private chemical manufacturing enterprise. In 1942 Oriol, taking advantage of his family-related position in the banking industry, provided financial backing to an idea developed by Alejandro Goicoechea, namely construction of a new generation, high-speed train. The result was the birth of TALGO, Treno Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol, the new manufacturing and transportation company. The enterprise proved to be a commercial and technological success, though initially it had to rely on the US-based production and was desperately short of foreign currency. By the early 1950s TALGO trains were already providing regular high-speed service, up to 135 km/h, at different national railway routes. They also figured prominently in the Francoist propaganda, expected to demonstrate robustness of the Spanish industry and modernizing capacity of the regime. In 2005 the majority stake in TALGO was bought by Lehman Brothers, though the Oriol family retains a minority share until today.|$|R

Putting an <b>electric</b> <b>tension</b> (order of 1 kV) outside the tube with electrodes spaced 10 cm each other, the ionized atom goes toward one electrode.

The appearance of a homoclinic orbit is investigated assuming an approximated model for the device. On the basis of the parametric equations of the homoclinic orbit and the presence of harmonic disturbances on the platform, it is demonstrated that chaotic oscillations can also appear, and they have been examined by means of the Melnikov theory. Chaotic behavior is corroborated by means of the sensitive dependence, Lyapunov exponents and power spectral density, and it is applied to drive the transducer mobile piece to a predefined set point assuming that noise due to the measurement process can appear in the control signals. The steady-state error associated to such random noise is eliminated by adding a PI linear controller to the control force. Numerical simulations are used to corroborate the analytical results.
