50|$|For 1942, Ford Motor Company {{announced}} a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic. Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, {{as well as an}} electro-mechanical <b>vacuum</b> <b>control</b> that automated the shift between second and third speeds. Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill. Lincolns got an overdrive gear as a bonus.|$|E
50|$|Often {{the least}} {{controlled}} factor in an autoclave, the vacuum {{may or may}} not require modulation. In some instances, it is not automated at all and involves little more than a connection to the plant vacuum system, a few manual valves, and a gauge.

5000|$|The term [...] "vacuum Servo" [...] can {{sometimes}} be mis-translated in vehicle engineering terms, to [...] "vacuum operated valve" [...] whereby a device is controlled either switched or proportionally {{by the use of}} a Vacuum.

40|$|During {{the first}} 3 years of LHC operation, the {{priority}} for the SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) of <b>vacuum</b> <b>controls</b> was to attend to user requests, and to improve its ergonomics and efficiency: access & presentation of information simplified and normalized; coherent functionalities & menus across all accelerators; automatic scripts instead of fastidious manual actions; enhanced tools for data analysis and for maintenance interventions. Several decades of cumulative developments, based on heterogeneous technologies and architectures, have been asking for a homogenization effort. The first LHC Long Shutdown (LS 1) provides the opportunity to further standardize the <b>vacuum</b> <b>controls</b> systems [1], around Siemens-S 7 PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and PVSS SCADA. Meanwhile, exchanges with other Groups at CERN and outside Institutes have been promoted: to follow the global update policy for software libraries; to discuss philosophies and development details; and to accomplish common products.

5000|$|These tape drives were {{mechanically}} sophisticated floor-standing drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to buffer long U-shaped loops of tape.

Before reviewing the various pumping and measurement devices, including the most modern one like Non Evaporable Getter (NEG) coatings, an overview of adequate materials to be used in UHV systems will be given together with their treatment (e. g. cleaning procedures and bake out). Practical examples based on existing or future accelerators will be used to illustrate the topics.

5000|$|Early IBM tape drives, {{such as the}} IBM 727 and IBM 729, were {{mechanically}} sophisticated floor-standing drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to buffer long u-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and <b>vacuum</b> <b>control</b> of these u-shaped tape loops, fast start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved: 1.5 ms from stopped tape to full speed of 112.5 in/s m/s. The fast acceleration is possible because the tape mass in the vacuum columns is small; the length of tape buffered in the columns provides time to spin the high inertia reels. When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in movies and television.|$|E

40|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>control</b> system is, in most cases, {{a subset}} of the general control system of an accelerator. As such, it shares the {{architecture}} and communication infrastructure of the main control system. Considered as a ‘slow process’ to control in the frame of accelerators, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>control</b> system can be built using commercial industrial controllers (PLCs). A data driven approach allows for changes in configuration without changing the software code but at the expense of a solid database. Modelling the equipment allows for easy adaptation of a variety of control units with the same functionality but different physical interfaces. It also allows for a uniform display of the available data and status values. Interlocks are required to protect the vacuum equipment itself against abnormal conditions, but also to protect other systems, like RF, which need a good vacuum to operate. They {{are an integral part of}} any <b>vacuum</b> <b>control</b> system...|$|E

40|$|For {{two years}} (Spring 2013 - Spring 2015), the LHC went through its first long {{shutdown}} (LS 1). It was mainly {{motivated by the}} consolidation of magnet interconnects, to allow operation with 6. 5 TeV proton beams. Moreover, around the accelerator complex, many other systems were repaired, consolidated or upgraded, and several new installations came to life. The standardization of <b>vacuum</b> <b>controls</b> has progressed in the injectors, with the renovation of most of their obsolete equipment. In the LHC, many new instruments were added, the signal transmission integrity was improved, and the exposure to radiation was reduced in critical places.

The new vacuum systems support analysis of status and dynamic processes. Investigation of individual pressure measurements and pressure profiles of a whole machine are possible. Short and long range archives of the recent and distant past are included. The long range archive is a separate system which performs data logging for many other device controls as well. Special emphasis is put onto the data visualisation. Time accelerated views of pressure profiles help to watch the development of vacuum quality or locate a developing leak.

40|$|NA 62 is a {{fixed target}} {{experiment}} to measure very rare decays of Kaons at CERN Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator. The NA 62 experiment line comprises several large detectors installed inside a vacuum vessel with {{a length of}} 250 m and an internal diameter of up to 2. 8 m. The vacuum installation consists of 170 remote controlled pumps, valves and gauges. The operational specifications of NA 62 require a complex <b>vacuum</b> <b>control</b> system: tight interaction between vacuum controllers and detector controllers, including pumping or venting vetoes, and detector start-stop interlocks; most of the valves are interlocked, including the large vacuum sector gate valves; the vacuum devices are driven by 20 logic processes.

40|$|NA 62 is the {{follow-up}} of the NA 48 experiment, in the SPS North Area of CERN, and reuses a large {{fraction of its}} detectors and beam line equipment. Still, there are many new vacuum devices in the beam line (including pumps, valves & gauges), which required a thorough modification of the control system {{and a large number}} of new controllers, many of which were custom-made. The NA 62 <b>vacuum</b> <b>control</b> system is based on the use of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition).

40|$|The initial {{commissioning}} of the 127 {{sectors of}} the LEP vacuum system requires local control facilities. On the scale of LEP, local control of one sector implied the supervision of vacuum equipment which may be spread over 480 metres, with pump power supplies located as far as 1700 metres from the pumps they drive. To minimize the cabling cost, all power supplies and control units are connected together via a local area network. Light pen driven consoles send messages to the equipment and display useful information for the vacuum operators. As for the control system, supervision was possible from the LEP Control Room {{as soon as the}} control system was made available at the various sites.
