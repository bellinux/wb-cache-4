40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the asymptotic covariance matrix (ACM) of maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) of factor loadings and unique <b>variances</b> when one element of MLEs of unique <b>variances</b> is nearly zero, i. e., the matrix of MLEs of unique <b>variances</b> is nearly singular. In this situation, standard formulas break down. We give explicit formulas for the ACM of MLEs of factor loadings and unique <b>variances</b> that could be used even when an element of MLEs of unique <b>variances</b> is very close to zero. We also discuss an alternative approach using the augmented information matrix under a nearly singular matrix of MLEs of unique <b>variances</b> and derive the partial derivatives of the alternative constraint functions with respect to the elements of factor loadings and unique <b>variances...</b>|$|R
25|$|Firstly, if the omniscient mean {{is unknown}} (and is {{computed}} as the sample mean), then the sample <b>variance</b> is a biased estimator: it underestimates the <b>variance</b> {{by a factor}} of (n−1) / n; correcting by this factor (dividing by n−1 instead of n) is called Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the (corrected) sample <b>variance</b> or unbiased sample <b>variance.</b> For example, when n=1 the <b>variance</b> of a single observation about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population <b>variance.</b> If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the <b>variance</b> then this bias does not arise and the <b>variance</b> can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study examines the logic behind choosing <b>variances</b> {{and the design}} of forums during the planning of deliberations in non-routine work environments using a Sociotechnical System design approach. This study was accomplished through review and comparison of literature on sociotechnical applications of non-routine, knowledge work environments. The traditional sociotechnical application applied to factory settings with linear and routine work tasks analyzes unit operations within an open system, identifying technical <b>variances</b> that contribute to problems and social roles that control the <b>variances.</b> A new sociotechnical approach has been developed for systems involved in non-routine, knowledge work environments. This approach focuses on deliberations formed around topics, establishes <b>variances</b> that lead to poor deliberations, designs forums that minimize <b>variances</b> and gives control of <b>variances</b> to discretionary coalitions. These results generally support that <b>variances</b> contributing to poor deliberations are well established and that organizations need only identify the key <b>variances</b> that contribute to problems in their system. Organizations {{need to understand how}} the key <b>variances</b> affect the development of knowledge and how forums can be designed to enhance deliberations.
