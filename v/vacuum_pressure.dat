5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

The MOF Mg(dobdc) has a 21.7 wt% CO2 loading capacity. Estimations showed that, if a similar system would be applied to a large scale power plant, the cost of energy would increase by 65%, while a U.S. NETL baseline amine-based system would cause an increase of 81% (the U.S. DOE goal is 35%). The cost of capturing CO2 [...] would be $57 / ton CO2 captured, while for the amine system the cost {{is estimated to be}} $72 / ton CO2 captured.

40|$|Abstract. Clinical {{results of}} port wine stain (PWS) birthmarks laser therapy {{have shown that}} dark purple lesions usually respond well to the first 3 – 5 treatments. However, for most PWS, {{complete}} blanching is never achieved, and the lesion stabilizes at a red-pink color. We have recently demonstrated that {{with the aid of}} a local vacuum applied to the lesion site prior to laser irradiation, photocoagulation of the smaller vessels in PWS birthmarks can be successfully achieved. We have then hypothesized that the release of cryogen spurts under <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures</b> may also offer many advantages to this therapeutic procedure due to different spray-surface interactions under vacuum conditions. The objective of our work is to study the thermal response of a skin phantom to CSC at <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures.</b> For this purpose, liquid cryogen was sprayed onto a skin phantom under atmospheric and various <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures,</b> ranging from- 17 to- 70 kPa, at two nozzle-surface distances, 30 and 40 mm. We used a temperature sensor mounted on the phantom surface to measure temperature changes as a function of time, and an analytical solution, based on Fourier’s law and Duhamel’s theorem, to calculate heat flux and overall heat removal. Compared to atmospheric pressures, lower minimum surface temperatures and higher heat removal from the skin phantom were observed under all <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures</b> and both surface-nozzle distances used in this study. This approach enhances the heat extraction from the skin surface and, therefore, should help improving epidermal protection provided by CSC during PWS laser therapy...|$|R

For the investigations two different test rigs – a guarded cylinder apparatus and a guarded hot plate apparatus – were used. The lowest effective thermal conductivities were performed with fumed silica at ambient pressure, with the mixture at pressures between 1 and 10 mbar and with fine-grained expanded perlite at 0. 1 mbar and lower. Mixtures of fumed silica and expanded perlites {{appear to be a}} great chance to achieve low effective thermal conductivities and lower prices compared to pure fumed silica at <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures</b> that can be easily achieved for large-volume thermal energy stores...|$|R

50|$|Air {{leakages}} can {{be detected}} using various methods. In some situations air bubbles, and consequentially air leakages {{can be detected}} simply through a visual inspection of the composite. The most simple ‘Leak isolation’ method involves monitoring the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> level {{to determine if there}} are air leaks. If the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> level does not decrease after vacuuming all of the air out of the mold, then it can be determined that there is no air leakages. However, if there was a drop in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> level it would be an indication that there was an air leakage. Unfortunately, this method for identifying the presence of an air leak does not determine the air leak’s location.|$|E

The pressure flow fields of the evacuated tube maglev train under different <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures</b> were analyzed, and then compared under the same blockage ratio condition. The {{results show that the}} environmental pressure of 1 000 Pa in the tube is the best to achieve the effect of aerodynamic drag reduction, and there are no obvious differences in the aerodynamic drag reduction among different streamline head shapes.
