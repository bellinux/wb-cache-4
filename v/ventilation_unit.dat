40|$|Small central <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> for {{apartments and}} single family houses have {{in most cases}} the {{disadvantage}} of not being equipped with a cooling function. For summer operation at high ambient temperatures a bypass is generally used or the devices are switched off. In winter operation state-of-the-art <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> work with high efficient heat recovery. To enable summer operation of these <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> an extension of functionality by implementing indirect evaporative cooling is under development. Although indirect evaporative cooling is a well-known physical concept, the challenges for its implementation in common heat recovery <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are many-sided, especially when aiming at small size <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> The main focus of the development is {{to make use of the}} energy-efficient evaporative cooling effect and provide additional comfort to users of heat recovery <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Work on novel compact and easy-to-clean wetting structures is presented. This includes the presentation of newly designed evaporation structures, their surface characteristics and their wetting and water holding capacity. Working with low pressure nozzles is aimed at in order to reduce the energy consumption of the water spray system. In the presentation an overview is given on the approach and on first experimental results with special focus on the parameters influencing the energy efficiency of the ventilation device. In this context, pressure drop and the cooling capacity of the analyzed structures as well as the different wetting modes are presented...|$|R
40|$|This study reports {{ventilation}} {{measurement and}} occupant questionnaire results from newly built 102 Finnish detached houses. The {{results show that}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were used constantly and the fan speed setting was changed very seldom. There was a slight tendency to use higher speed in the summer than in winter. <b>Ventilation</b> <b>units</b> provide an average actual air change rate of about 0. 4 ach (13 L/s,pers) both in winter and summer which {{is less than the}} code value of 0. 5 ach. Airflow measurements at design fan speed show that only 57 % of houses comply with regulations. Low actual air change rates were caused by low fan speeds used by occupants as 52 % of houses in the winter and 47 % in the summer used the lowest possible fan speed. Correspondingly, actual supply airflow rates in bedrooms were low, in average 4 L/s. Occupant complaints about ventilation noise correlated with noise level in bedrooms. It is concluded that ventilation noise is an important factor affecting the use of <b>ventilation</b> <b>units.</b> Inspection of drawings and ventilation systems showed that in houses not complying with ventilation regulations either <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were undersized or sound attenuation was poor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the various design {{features}} of ventilated garments on cooling performance. Five jackets with small <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> and closable openings were designed. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> with a flow rate of 12 l/s were placed at five different torso sites. They were examined on a sweating thermal manikin in four clothing opening conditions in a warm environment (Ta=Tmanikin= 34 °C, RH= 60 %, Va= 0. 4 m/s). Total torso cooling was increased by 137 to 251 %, and clothing total dynamic evaporative resistance was decreased by 43 to 69 %. Neither the ventilation location nor the opening design had a significant difference on total torso cooling. The ventilation location had a significant difference on localized intra-torso cooling, but not the opening design. When the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> were placed at the local zone where it was ventilated, that zone underwent the highest cooling than other local zones. The study indicated that the <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> should be placed at the region where it required the most evaporative cooling, e. g. along the spine area and the lower back. The openings could be adjusted (closed or opened) to make comfortable air pressure for the wearers but without making significant difference on the whole torso cooling under this flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{emissions}} of <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> are mostly {{referred to as}} noise and are subject to a minimization policy. Silencing causes technical effort and sometimes even higher energy consumption. Additionally, this study reveals that silencing may be counterproductive in open-plan offices, since employees may even benefit from higher volume ventilation sound. This positive effect occurs when disturbing background speech is masked by ventilation sound. In this study acoustics of an open-plan office at one receiver positon incorporating background speech were auralized. Then ventilation sounds of two different decentralized <b>ventilation</b> <b>units</b> at three <b>ventilation</b> rates producing sound emissions in between 25 and 45 dB(A) were added. Participants were exposed to these sound scenarios during a laboratory experiment. Results reveal that participants performed better at a working memory task during presentation {{of one of the}} high volume ventilation sounds and acoustic comfort and privacy were judged to be better as well. However, sound quality of ventilation sounds needs to be investigated and purposefully adapted since different effects were found for the two <b>ventilation</b> <b>units,</b> although the overall A-weighted sound pressure levels were comparable...|$|R

5000|$|To don the suit, the two zips {{that make}} a 'V' on the chest are opened. Underneath, {{there is a large}} tubular opening in the inner {{pressure}} layer known as the appendix. Legs go in first, followed by the arms into the sleeves and head into the helmet. When the suit is on, an airtight seal is made by tightly rolling up the appendix and securing it with strong elastic bands. The large bulge of the rolled-up appendix is secured under the V shaped flap in the suit's outer layer. When worn on the ground, the suit is attached to a portable <b>ventilation</b> <b>unit</b> [...] - a hand-held device that supplies air to the suit, cooling it first with an ice filled heat exchanger. Grey leather outer boots are also worn on the ground; they protect the feet of the suit from damage and are removed before entering the spacecraft to avoid carrying debris into the cabin.|$|E
