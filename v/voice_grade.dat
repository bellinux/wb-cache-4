In the present paper phonation features derived from the glottal source (GS) parameterization, after vocal tract inversion, is proposed for dysphonic voice characterization in Speaker Verification tasks. The glottal source derived parameters are matched in a forensic evaluation framework defining a distance-based metric specification. The phonation segments used in the study are derived from fillers, long vowels, and other phonation segments produced in spontaneous telephone conversations. Phonated segments from a telephonic database of 100 male Spanish native speakers are combined in a 10 -fold cross-validation task to produce the set of quality measurements outlined in the paper. Shimmer, mucosal wave correlate, vocal fold cover biomechanical parameter unbalance and a subset of the GS cepstral profile produce accuracy rates as high as 99. 57 for a wide threshold interval (62. 08 - 75. 04 %). An Equal Error Rate of 0. 64 % can be granted. The proposed metric framework is shown to behave more fairly than classical likelihood ratios in supporting the hypothesis of the defense vs that of the prosecution, thus ofering a more reliable evaluation scoring.

40|$|In this study,the {{main purpose}} {{was to develop a}} grading {{operation}} system for star fruits(carambola) which included functions such as weighing, grading and judging, displaying of <b>grading</b> level and <b>voicing</b> of <b>grading</b> judgement. The system presently constructed mainly combined the computerized <b>voice</b> weight <b>grading</b> system with the data automation treatment software system. These two parts were possessed of the computer, weighing device, related control software, conveyor, printer and barcode reader. The system could be used for computerized weight grading to enhance grading accuracy; moreover, the system also built in the grading operation database, automatic pricing management and automatic data analysis to provide detailed list of the simultaneous dealings for the further accounting treatment. From the experimental results, the grading operation of the newly developed computerized <b>voice</b> <b>grading</b> system showed that under unremoving of the paper bag, the grading operation capacity was about 1300 individuals per hour. However, the grading operation capacity in the product collecting and treatment plant, in associated with the paper bag removing and the product output conveyor, was reduced to about 750 individuals per hour, but which was still about 3 to 4 times larger than the manual treatment capacity and the grading accuracy could be reached up to about 96 % with the error of weighing value within ± 5 grams. It also demonostrated that the system could indeed reach zero damage during the grading operation with highly perfomancing stability, and could be ultilized for grading and warehousing management operation after the picking of star fruits. In the future, the system could be also applied in the grading of other delicate fruits such as guava, wax apple and honey peach. 本研究主要目的，旨在開發一套楊桃採收後分級處理作業系統，具有秤重、分級判斷、級數顯示、語音分級判讀等功能，主要由電腦語音重量分級系統及資料自動化處理軟體系統所組成，包括電腦、秤量裝置、相關控制軟體、輸送機、印表機與條碼機等設備。利用此系統進行電腦重量分級，以提高分級精確度，並建立分級作業資料庫、自動計價管理、自動分析資料，即時提供交易明細，以供帳務處理。 經由試驗得知電腦語音重量分級系統，在不拆紙袋的分級作業方式下，分級作業能力每小時為 1300 粒；於集貨處理場配合輸送機分級楊桃之作業能力每小時為 750 粒，作業能力為原來利用人工處理的三至四倍，分級精確度可達 96 %以上，秤量值的誤差皆在± 5 公克之內，穩定性高，此種分級方式確可達到零損傷與提高分級精確度，是一套適合楊桃採收後分級儲運管理作業自動化之系統，未來可應用於番石榴、蓮霧、水蜜桃等精緻水果之分級。誌謝辭	i 中文摘要	ii Abstract	iii 目 錄	v 表目錄	viii 圖目錄	ix 第一章 緒 論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機	 2 第二章 研究目的	 3 第三章 文獻探討	 4 3. 1 楊桃採收後處理現況	 4 3. 2 楊桃品質分類標準	 7 3. 3 微電腦與秤量裝置之應用	 8 3. 4 電子式重量選別機	 9 3. 5 資料庫管理系統之應用	 10 3. 6 語音辨識系統之應用	 10 3. 7 條碼於農業上的應用	 11 第四章 理論分析與應用	 12 4. 1 Delphi基本操作與環境設定	 12 4. 1. 1 Delphi整合開發環境	 12 4. 1. 2 Delphi 編程架構	 16 4. 1. 3 專案的編譯與執行	 19 4. 1. 4 Delphi的資料庫元件	 19 4. 1. 5 BDE管理員與ACCESS連線設定	 21 4. 1. 6 De 1 phi安裝系統需求	 23 4. 2 Microsoft Access 資料庫管理系統	 24 4. 3 多媒體應用	 26 4. 4 電腦與通訊協定	 28 4. 5 條碼識別系統	 30 第五章 分級處理作業系統之建立	 31 5. 1 系統架構	 31 5. 2 分級處理作業系統作業流程規劃	 32 第六章 分級處理作業系統設計	 34 6. 1 分級處理作業系統硬體設備	 34 6. 2 分級處理作業系統軟體之開發	 40 6. 2. 1 電腦語音重量分級系統控制軟體撰寫內容	 42 6. 2. 2 資料管理自動化系統與主功能操作視窗之建立	 44 6. 3 條碼標籤系統之規劃設計	 51 第七章 實驗設備、材料與方法	 52 7. 1 實驗配置	 52 7. 2 實驗設備	 54 7. 3 實驗材料	 59 7. 4 實驗方法	 60 7. 4. 1 楊桃分級實例之調查實驗	 60 7. 4. 2 楊桃橫斷面面積、長度與重量之關係實驗	 60 7. 4. 3 楊桃採收後分級處理作業系統之測試	 63 7. 4. 4 電腦語音重量分級機分級精確度測試	 65 7. 4. 5 作業能力測試	 66 7. 4. 6 機械損傷程度測試	 67 第八章 結果與討論	 68 8. 1 楊桃產地分級實例調查結果與討論	 68 8. 2 楊桃橫斷面面積、長度與重量之關係實驗結果與討論	 71 8. 2. 1 楊桃橫斷面面積與重量之關係實驗結果與討論	 72 8. 2. 2 楊桃長度與重量之關係實驗結果與討論	 74 8. 3 分級處理作業系統軟體之測試結果與討論	 76 8. 3. 1 靜態穩定性測試實驗結果與討論	 76 8. 3. 2 取果實振動對系統影響測試實驗結果與討論	 77 8. 3. 3 分級處理作業系統軟體可行性之測試結果與討論	 78 8. 4 電腦語音重量分級機分級精確度試驗結果與討論	 85 8. 5 作業能力測試結果與討論	 86 8. 5. 1 電腦語音重量分級機單機作業能力測試結果	 86 8. 5. 2 現場分級作業能力測試結果	 87 8. 6 機械損傷程度測試結果與討論	 87 第九章 結論與建議	 90 9. 1 結 論	 90 9. 2 建 議	 91 第十章 參考文獻	 92 附 錄	 95 附錄 1 楊桃採收後分級處理作業系統使用說明	 95 附錄 2 卓蘭農會果菜市場楊桃分級實例重量值	 112 附錄 3 楠西鄉集貨處理場楊桃分級實例重量值	 112 附錄 4 楊桃投影面積、長度與重量之量測值	 113 附錄 5 靜態穩定性測試之重量值(一) 	 114 附錄 6 靜態穩定性測試之重量值(二) 	 116 附錄 7 頂層位置取果實振動對系統影響測試結果	 118 附錄 8 內層位置取果實振動對系統影響測試結果	 118 附錄 9 卓蘭農會果菜市場特大級楊桃秤量結果	 11...|$|R

This thesis approaches the problem of delivering integrated <b>voice,</b> low <b>grade</b> video and low rate data services to a wireless network operating in a distributed environment {{through the use of}} a packet radio architecture. An overview of the technical specifications to be addressed in the network design is used to define the operational requirement.

The issues related to the operation of a distributed network are then explored, essentially illustrating the design implications of survivability. Several different multiple access techniques are also evaluated for suitability in this network design. Based upon the criteria provided at the onset, a slotted CDMA methodology is recommended. This leads to the establishment of network control parameters including the data structure, routing and scheduling schemes based on slotted CDMA operation in a distributed environment.

In particular the ability to use multiple <b>voice</b> <b>grade</b> telephone lines to create a wideband data channel from almost anywhere has been developed and refined. Link flexibility has been enhanced by the use of dedicated, COTS RF spread-spectrum links, cellular telephones, and other transmission media. The current version of SYSCON 2000 supports test director virtual presence via live data displays and video teleconferencing capability...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The U. S. Coast Guard operates several Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) in major U. S. shipping ports. These systems were designed and implemented twenty years ago. They {{were designed for}} a single mission, port safety. The surveillance and display systems are well beyond the planned service life {{and need to be}} replaced. This thesis investigates and summarizes up-to-date methods of providing surveillance services to a VTS. The author includes a history of VTIS, an analysis of the assigned missions, and a review of the C 1 factors involved. A functional model of a VTS is developed and used to evaluate the best mix of technologies for VTS systems. The author concludes that a mixture of shore-based radar surveillance and satellite-based surveillance can provide the detection and identification information necessary to operate a multi-mission VTS. In order to take advantage of inexpensive narrow band data links, such as <b>voice</b> <b>grade</b> telephone circuits, radar information must be processed through a radar scan convertor. Use of this technology also improves automated target detection, tracking, and display capabilities of the existing radar and display systems. A second generation VTS should have a modular design, centered around a standardized Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) C 2 system. This will reduce the cost of operating a VTS by reducing the manpower needs of a VTC, improving the performance of the VTS system during multi-mission tasking, allowing the use of different sensor types, and creations: a way of integrating VTS information into the main stream of Coast Guard operations.

This thesis describes research work concerned with the teletraffic capacity and the canputer control requirements of such systems. The work involves theoretical analysis and experimental investigations using digital computer simulation. New formulas are derived for the congestion in single-cell systems {{in which there are}} both land-to-mobile and mobile-to-mobile calls and in which mobile-to-mobile calls go via the base station. Two approaches are used, the first yields modified forms of the familiar Erlang and Engset formulas, while the second gives more complicated but more accurate formulas. The results of computer simulations to establish the accuracy of the formulas are described. New teletraffic formulas are also derived for the congestion in multi -cell systems. Fixed, dynamic and hybrid channel assignments are considered. The formulas agree with previously published simulation results. Simulation programs are described for the evaluation of the speech traffic of mobiles and for the investigation of a possible computer network for the control of the speech traffic. The programs were developed according to the structured progranming approach leading to programs of modular construction. Two simulation methods are used for the speech traffic: the roulette method and the time-true method. The first is economical but has some restriction, while the second is expensive but gives comprehensive answers. The proposed control network operates at three hierarchical levels performing various control functions which include: the setting-up and clearing-down of calls, the hand-over of calls between cells and the address-changing of mobiles travelling between cities. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the control netwvork and indicate that small mini -computers inter-connected via <b>voice</b> <b>grade</b> data channels would be capable of providing satisfactory contro...|$|E

[...] Carter Matt, writing for his eponymous entertainment blog, mirrored Molinari's sentiments regarding the song's [...] "fit" [...] with Gilman's persona and also noted [...] "Because of Me" [...] is [...] "easily the catchiest of the four winners' singles," [...] and [...] "could... be an adult-contemporary hit" [...] Reviewing Gilman's performance of the song on The <b>Voice,</b> which he <b>graded</b> a 'B', Michael Slezak of TVLine wrote that the song [...] "painted Billy as a vocalist who might have some radio relevance with the right material," [...] but also described the track as unmemorable.|$|R
5000|$|Mansfield has <b>voiced</b> {{criticism}} of <b>grade</b> inflation at Harvard University, which he claims {{is due in}} part to affirmative action. Mansfield also participated in a debate on affirmative action between Cornel West and Michael Sandel (arguing for affirmative action) with Ruth Wisse and himself (arguing against affirmative action). The debate attracted a [...] "massive audience" [...] of a thousand Harvard students, requiring its campus venue to be changed twice before it could take place on November 3, 1997, in Harvard's Sanders Theater, prompting Professor Sandel to comment, [...] "'This puts to rest the myth that this generation has a political apathy, and apathy to political debates.'" [...] In 2013, Mansfield, after hearing from a dean that [...] "the most frequent grade is an A", claimed to give students two grades: one for their transcript, and the one he thinks they deserve. He commented, [...] "I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade".|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} are to {{investigate}} the effects of diplophonia on jitter and shimmer and to identify measurement limitations with regard to material selection and clinical interpretation. Materials and Methods: Four hundred and ninety-eight audio samples of sustained phonations were analyzed. The audio samples were assessed for the grade of hoarseness and the presence of diplophonia. Jitter and shimmer were reported with regard to perceptual ratings. We investigated cycle marker positions exemplarily and qualitatively to understand their implications for perturbation measurements. Results: Medians of jitter and shimmer were higher for diplophonic voices than for nondiplophonic <b>voices</b> with equal <b>grades</b> of hoarseness. The variance of jitter for moderately dysphonic voices was larger than the variance observed in a corpus from which diplophonic samples had been discarded. The positions of cycle markers in diplophonic voices did not match the positions of the pulses, indicating that the validity of jitter and shimmer values for these voices were questionable. Conclusion: Diplophonia biases the reporting of dysphonia severity via perturbation measures, and their validity is questionable for these voices. In addition, diplophonia is an influential source of variance in jitter measurements. Thus, diplophonic fragments of voice samples should be excluded prior to perturbation analysis.
