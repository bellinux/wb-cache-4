40|$|A {{study was}} {{designed}} to estimate variability of the Limulus amoebocyte lysate test by comparing a reference lysate against itself. Three technicians performed parallel tests, i. e., titrated side by side, the contents <b>of</b> two <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> reference lysate on 4 different days using 24 <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> the United States reference lysate and 12 <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> the United States reference endotoxin. Each parallel test was replicated three times. From the sensitivity endpoints, ratios were calculated for each parallel test. These ratios were converted to the logarithm for estimating variability among technicians and among <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> endotoxin. By using the overall variability of log ratios, a statistical procedure was developed to evaluate the sensitivity of each lot of licensed lysate submitted to the Bureau of Biologics for release...|$|R

When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a <b>vial</b> <b>of</b> laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived.

5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a <b>vial</b> <b>of</b> paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting.

40|$|Objective: Evaluate {{contamination}} on {{the external}} surfaces <b>of</b> cyclophosphamide <b>vials</b> avail-able on the Canadian market during storage in pharmacy departments and {{the efficacy of}} de-contaminating the external surfaces <b>of</b> <b>vials</b> using various cleaning techniques. Methods: The study consisted of three phases: the quantification of cyclophosphamide on the external surfaces <b>of</b> 10 <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> Procytox and 10 <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> Cytoxan available on the Canadian market with or without prewashing (Phases I and II) and the quantification of cyclophospha-mide on the surfaces of 30 deliberately contaminated empty sterile vials cleaned using three dif-ferent washing techniques (Phase III). The quantification of cyclophosphamide was conducted using ultra performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Results: In Phase I, we observed that 9 <b>of</b> 10 <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> Procytox and 4 <b>of</b> 10 <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> Cytoxan had traces of cyclophosphamide. The average concentration of cyclophosphamide measured on the vials was higher for Procytox {{than it was for}} Cytoxan. In Phase II, we observed that simply by washing vials with water we could effectively eliminate the presence of contamina-tion on 6 <b>of</b> 10 Procytox <b>vials</b> and on 10 <b>of</b> 10 Cytoxan <b>vials.</b> Phase III demonstrated the efficacy of using a cloth soaked in soapy water to clean the contaminated vials...|$|R

He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber.

To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood.

5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a <b>vial</b> <b>of</b> what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Facing {{the task}} force unit, she fights the head of Tower's {{security}} forces Kutō, killing him after he uses a <b>vial</b> <b>of</b> Saya's blood to transform into an Elder Bairn hybrid. Finding Fumito in the building's basement, she also finds Kuroto with him, before succumbing to a drug given by Kuroto. Fumito and Kuroto were working together, with each killing the others' families {{to take control of}} Tower and Seventh Heaven, and Saya also learns that the Elder Bairn who tried to kill Mana was Mana's father. Fumito reveals he intends to dissolve Shrovetide with Saya's help as the ratio of humans to Elder Bairns has shifted drastically due to the Elder Bairn seemingly dying out. When Kuroto attempts to kill him for abandoning his role, Fumito stabs him with a phial of Saya's blood, transforming Kuroto into an Elder Bairn seed. As Saya recovers from the drug, Fumito fuses with the seed, which hatches into a giant Elder Bairn which Saya slays. A weakened Fumito reveals that he transformed himself into an Elder Bairn hybrid to become closer to Saya and free her from her oath not to feed on humans.
