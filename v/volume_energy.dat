50|$|The glass {{transition}} of a liquid to a solid-like state may occur with either cooling or compression. The transition comprises a smooth {{increase in the}} viscosity of a material {{by as much as}} 17 orders of magnitude within a temperature range of 500 K without any pronounced change in material structure. The consequence of this dramatic increase is a glass exhibiting solid-like mechanical properties on the timescale of practical observation. This transition is in contrast to the freezing or crystallization transition, which is a first-order phase transition in the Ehrenfest classification and involves discontinuities in thermodynamic and dynamic properties such as <b>volume,</b> <b>energy,</b> and viscosity. In many materials that normally undergo a freezing transition, rapid cooling will avoid this phase transition and instead result in a {{glass transition}} at some lower temperature. Other materials, such as many polymers, lack a well defined crystalline state and easily form glasses, even upon very slow cooling or compression. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass forming ability. This ability depends on the composition of the material and can be predicted by the rigidity theory.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} response theory is developed {{and applied to}} electrostatic interactions between spherical macroions, screened by surrounding microions, in charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions. The theory describes leading-order {{nonlinear response}} of the microions (counterions, salt ions) to the electrostatic potential of the macroions and predicts microion-induced effective many-body interactions between macroions. A linear response approximation [Phys. Rev. E 62, 3855 (2000) ] yields an effective pair potential of screened-Coulomb (Yukawa) form, {{as well as a}} one-body <b>volume</b> <b>energy,</b> which contributes to the free energy. Nonlinear response generates effective many-body interactions and essential corrections to both the effective pair potential and the <b>volume</b> <b>energy.</b> By adopting a random-phase approximation (RPA) for the response functions, and thus neglecting microion correlations, practical expressions are derived for the effective pair and triplet potentials and for the <b>volume</b> <b>energy.</b> Nonlinear screening is found to weaken repulsive pair interactions, induce attractive triplet interactions, and modify the <b>volume</b> <b>energy.</b> Numerical results for monovalent microions are in good agreement with available ab initio simulation data and demonstrate that nonlinear effects grow with increasing macroion charge and concentration and with decreasing salt concentration. In the dilute limit of zero macroion concentration, leading-order nonlinear corrections vanish. Finally, it is shown that nonlinear response theory, when combined with the RPA, is formally equivalent to the mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann theory and that the linear response approximation corresponds, within integral-equation theory, to a linearized hypernetted-chain closure.

Charge-stabilized {{colloidal}} suspensions can be conveniently {{described by}} formally reducing the macroion-microion mixture to an equivalent one-component system of pseudo-particles.
