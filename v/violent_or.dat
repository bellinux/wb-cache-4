5|$|In mid-2001, Universal Music Group {{was criticized}} for airing {{commercials}} promoting the album during episodes of Total Request Live. Manson suspected that former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman {{played a role in}} the criticism. Lieberman and Hillary Clinton had recently introduced the Media Marketing Accountability Act before the United States Congress. This legislation proposed to ban the entertainment-industry from marketing suspected <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> explicit material to minors.|$|E
5|$|The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an American self-regulatory {{organization}} that assigns age and content ratings to consumer video games. The ESRB {{was established in}} 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (formerly the Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of controversial video games with excessively <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> sexual content.|$|E
5|$|Procellariidae {{comes from}} the Latin word procella, which means a <b>violent</b> wind <b>or</b> a storm, and idae, which is added to symbolize family. Therefore, a <b>violent</b> wind <b>or</b> a storm refers {{to the fact that}} members of this family like stormy and windy weather.|$|R

5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E
5|$|Lucas and {{producer}} Gary Kurtz took the script to American International Pictures, who expressed interest, but ultimately believed American Graffiti was not <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> sexual {{enough for the}} studio's standards. Lucas and Kurtz eventually found favor at Universal Pictures, who allowed Lucas total artistic control {{and the right of}} final cut privilege on the condition that he make American Graffiti on a strict, low budget. This forced Lucas to drop the opening scene, in which the Blonde Angel, Curt's image of the perfect woman, drives through an empty drive-in cinema in her Ford Thunderbird, her transparency revealing she does not exist.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} active volcanoes {{such as the}} Mayon Volcano, Mount Pinatubo, and Taal Volcano. The {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20thcentury. Not all notable geographic features are so <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> destructive. A more serene legacy of the geological disturbances is the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, the area represents a habitat for biodiversity conservation, the site also contains a full mountain-to-the-sea ecosystem and {{has some of the}} most important forests in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually <b>violent</b> <b>or</b> bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term has}} been used in the Australian press to {{indicate}} a position of extreme <b>or</b> <b>violent</b> revolution, <b>or</b> of simple lawlessness. During the 1970s and to some extent the 1980s there was a tendency for anarchists to prefer such terms as [...] "libertarian socialist".|$|R
50|$|In another {{experimental}} study conducted on 324 undergraduate college students, Brad Bushman examined brand recall for neutral, sexual <b>or</b> <b>violent</b> commercials embedded in neutral, sexual <b>or</b> <b>violent</b> TV programs. He found that brand recall was higher for participants who saw neutral TV programs and neutral commercials versus {{those who saw}} sexual <b>or</b> <b>violent</b> commercials embedded in sexual <b>or</b> <b>violent</b> TV programs. Other {{studies have found that}} sex in television is extremely overrated and does not sell products in ads. Unless sex is related to the product (such as beauty, health or hygiene products) there is not clear effect.|$|R
