5|$|Among Combs' other accomplishments as {{governor}} were requiring <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> in state elections and {{passage of a}} law making the assessment of state employees for political campaign funds a felony. At {{the end of his}} term, Combs backed Edward T. Breathitt to succeed him {{as governor}}. Breathitt defeated Happy Chandler in the Democratic primary, then went on to defeat Republican Louie B. Nunn in the general election. It was the only time in the 20th century that a Kentucky governor's preferred successor won election.|$|E
5|$|All ballots, {{absentee}} ballot envelopes, and <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, {{absentee ballot}}s were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots {{sent out to}} voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the United States Department of Justice sued the state to ensure {{they would have a}} reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a New York State Supreme Court ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Among Wetherby's other accomplishments {{were the}} {{creation}} of a Department of Mental Health and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children. He constructed new state prisons, modernized the probation and parole systems, and established a more orderly system of selecting grand and petit juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed in his efforts to amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky's counties. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 2006, Felten and {{graduate}} students Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman discovered severe security flaws in a Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions) <b>voting</b> <b>machine.</b> Their findings claimed, [...] "Malicious software running on a single <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> can steal <b>votes</b> with little if any risk of detection. The malicious software can modify all of the records, audit logs, and counters kept by the <b>voting</b> <b>machine,</b> so that even careful forensic examination of these records will find nothing amiss." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the voting}} booth a voter chooses his or her {{preferred}} candidate by pressing the corresponding <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> button. A random number generating device in the booth then generates a fresh random number, displays it, and passes it to the <b>voting</b> <b>machine,</b> which allocates it to the selected candidate. For all other candidates the <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> randomly selects one of the candidate's dummy votes from the dummy vote pool. A dummy vote is used only once. A ballot, then, consists of a random number for each candidate.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} 2000 {{election}} in which Slosberg {{was elected to}} the Florida State House by 88 votes (4,412 votes for Slosberg versus 4,330 for his opponent) and {{at the peak of the}} vote recount during the Bush-Gore United States presidential election in Florida, 2000, Palm Beach Sheriff's Deputies confiscated a Votamatic <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> from Slosberg. [...] When initially approached by the Supervisor of Elections Office and asked about the <b>voting</b> <b>machine,</b> Slosberg denied having it. On November 11, 2000, police confronted Slosberg about the <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> which Slosberg then retrieved from his car and delivered to the police. [...] No reason was ever provided for Slosberg having possession of the <b>voting</b> <b>machine,</b> and despite additional allegations of misconduct Democrat Supervisor of Elections Theresa Lepore neither investigated nor pressed charges against Slosberg.|$|R
25|$|As in the 2004 {{election}}, {{this election}} was also conducted completely using electronic <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> (EVMs), with 1,368,430 <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> deployed across the country.|$|E

On February 18, 2005, Senator Boxer and colleges introduced the Count Every Vote Act of 2005, which would provide a voter verified paper ballot for every vote cast in electronic <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> and ensure access to voter verification for all citizens. The bill mandates that this ballot be the official ballot for purposes of a recount. The bill sets a uniform standard for provisional ballots and requires the Federal Election Assistance Commission to issue standards that ensure uniform access to <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> and trained election personnel in every community. The bill also mandated improved security measures for electronic <b>voting</b> <b>machines.</b> The bill did not pass.|$|E

25|$|The polling {{stations}} were open from 7:00 to 20:00. Voting took place using electronic <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> (EVMs) {{for the first}} time.

25|$|In the United States, some Californian cities, e.g. Oakland and San Francisco, {{administer}} IRV {{elections on}} <b>voting</b> <b>machines,</b> with optical scanning machines recording preferences and software tallying the IRV algorithm {{as soon as}} ballots are tallied. Cary, North Carolina's pilot program in 2007 tallied first choices on optical scan equipment at the polls and then used a central hand-count for the IRV tally. Portland, Maine in 2011 used its usual <b>voting</b> <b>machines</b> to tally first choice at the polls, then a central scan with different equipment if an IRV tally was necessary.|$|E

Preparing the user interface outside of the <b>voting</b> <b>machine</b> dramatically reduces the amount and difficulty of software verification required to assure the correctness of the election result.
