A record in worldwide shipping of Champagne (including domestic French consumption) of 327 million bottles {{was set in}} 1999 in anticipation of end of millennium celebrations, and a new record was set in 2007 at 338.7 million bottles. Since the entire <b>vineyard</b> <b>area</b> authorized by the 1927 AOC regulations is now planted, various ways of expanding the production have been considered. The allowed yield was increased (to a maximum of 15,500kg per hectare during an experimental period from 2007 to 2011) {{and the possibility of}} revising the production region was investigated.|$|E

Malbec, known locally as Pressac, and not much planted in the rest of Bordeaux, is also used.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of agricultural {{systems such as}} viticulture can quantitatively and qualitatively affect the contents of soil organic matter (SOM). These changes may modify the edaphic features of the soil {{as well as the}} soil quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the chemical and physical fraction of SOMand to analyze changes in the carbon stock and C management index in <b>areas</b> of implanted <b>vineyards</b> in altitude regions of Santa Catarina. Four regions were selected: Region I (Urubici); Region II (San Joaquim); Region III (Campos Novos) and Region IV (Água Doce). In each region, we selected vineyards implanted between 2001 and 2005 as well as surrounding forested areas. Disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected from the 0 - 5, 5 - 10, and 10 - 20 cm layers of the soil. Samples were prepared in the laboratory to obtain air-dried soft soil, which was then used for the analysis of several parameters, namely total organic carbon (TOC), carbon stock,and chemical fractionation of the soil. The chemical fractionation was then used to determine carbon content in the fulvic acid fraction (C-FAF), humic acid fraction (C-HAF), and humin fraction (C-HUM). We also analyzed particle size, quantified the levels of particulate carbon (COp) and carbon associated with clay and silt (COam), and calculated the carbon management index (CMI). We evaluated normality and homogeneity for all data. The results were evaluated with an analysis of variance and subsequent F-test. Mean values were compared using a 5 % Student’s t-test and subsequently submitted to a Tukey’s test. The highest TOC levels were observed in Region II in the 0 - 5 cm layer in both <b>vineyard</b> and forested <b>areas.</b> <b>Vineyard</b> <b>areas</b> exhibited lower values of TOC, Cop, and COam compared to forested areas indicating that the management adopted in these areas contributed to the reduction of these fractions. Forested areas exhibited a higher proportion of Cop compared to <b>vineyard</b> <b>areas.</b> The humin fraction represented the largest portion of the TOC and comprised the highest values in both forested and <b>vineyard</b> <b>areas.</b> The carbon management index indicated a low contribution of <b>vineyard</b> <b>areas</b> or a reduction in carbon storage in their soils...|$|R

The wine industry is successful and has been growing after Kosovo War. The main heartland of Kosovo's wine industry is in Orahovac, where millions of litres of wine are produced.

2500|$|Grape {{varieties}} in South Africa {{are known}} as cultivar, with many common international varieties developing local synonyms that still have a strong tradition of use. These include: Chenin blanc (Steen), Riesling (until recently known locally as Weisser Riesling), Crouchen (known as Cape Riesling), Palomino (the grape of the Spanish wine Sherry known locally as [...] "White French"), Trebbiano (Ugni Blanc), Sémillon (Groendruif) and Muscat of Alexandria (Hanepoot). However, wines that are often exported overseas will usually have the more internationally recognised name appear on the wine label. In 2015, SAWIS (South African Wine Information and Systems) reported that the country had 100,146 hectares of vineyards, with about 55% planted with white varieties. Chenin blanc {{has long been the}} most widely planted variety, still accounting for over 18% of all grape area planted in South Africa as of 2015, though it is slowly decreasing in overall share of <b>vineyard</b> <b>area.</b> In the 1980s and 1990s, interest in international varieties saw increase in plantings of Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc.

2500|$|Pinotage, a {{crossing}} of Pinot noir and Cinsaut, {{has seen its}} plantings rise and fall due to the current fashion of the South African wine industry. Today, {{it is the second}} most widely planted red grape variety in South Africa. While there are supporters who want to make the grape South Africa's signature variety, critics of the grape note that hardly any other wine region in the world has planted this variety due to its flaws. In the early 1990s, as Apartheid ended and the world's wine market was opening up, winemakers in South Africa ignored Pinotage in favour of more internationally recognised varieties like Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Towards the end of the 20th century, the grape's fortunes began to turn, and by 1997 it commanded higher prices than any other South African grape. It is a required component (30–70%) in [...] "Cape blends". Here it is made into the full range of styles, from easy-drinking quaffing wine and rosé to barrel-aged wine intended for cellaring. It is also made into a fortified [...] "port-style", and even a red sparkling wine. The grape can be very dependent on the style of winemaking, with well made examples having the potential to produce deep coloured, fruity wines that can be accessible early as well as age. However, critics of the variety believe that the variety's flaws - green vegetal flavours and tannins, and susceptibility to developing banana and nail polish acetate aromas - are present in far more examples of Pinotage that reach the consumer market. Pinotage reached its zenith in 2001, covering 7.3% of the total <b>vineyard</b> <b>area,</b> but this has since decreased to 6%.|$|E
