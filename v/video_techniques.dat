40|$|Time {{series is}} one of the main {{research}} objects in the field of data mining. Visualization is an important mechanism to present processed time series for further analysis by users. In recent years researchers have designed a number of sophisticated visualization techniques for time series.

We propose the pixel <b>video</b> <b>technique,</b> a visualization technique displaying data in video format.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Video {{synopsis}} is {{the process}} of preserving key activities and eliminates the less important parts to create a short video summary of long original <b>videos.</b> These <b>techniques</b> are used for fast browsing, ectracting big data, effective storing and indexing. The <b>video</b> synopsis <b>techniques</b> are broadly classified into two types: object based approaches and frame based approaches. But these approaches cannot handle the complexity of the dynamic videos. In object movement method focus on the movements of a single video object, and remove the redundancies present in the object movement, it helps to generate the more compact and efficient video synopsis. Video synopsis is the most popular research in computer graphics and computer vision area and several researches started on this area. Naturally this is not a complete review of the entire <b>video</b> synopsis <b>techniques.</b> In this review focuses some of the <b>video</b> synopsis <b>techniques...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} multiple video streaming over wireless local area networks. In particular, we propose <b>video</b> streaming <b>techniques</b> {{to improve the quality}} of video streams in the link between an access point and multiple wireless clients. The proposed <b>video</b> streaming <b>techniques</b> decide on clients to be served, packet (re) transmissions as well as FEC rates by considering media, channel, and network properties in rate-distortion optimized manner. Multi-client rate distortion optimized video streaming is the first technique operated by an access point to jointly optimize client, packet, and FEC selection for video streaming. Second, we proposed multi-client sub-optimal <b>video</b> streaming <b>technique</b> that optimizes packet and FEC rate, but not client. The client is selected by using the results of optimization to reduce the computational complexity. The simulation results shows that the proposed <b>video</b> streaming <b>techniques</b> achieve SNR improvement up-to 5 dB as compared with TDMA and packet adaptive TDMA...|$|R
