5|$|During the {{recovery}} phase intravenous fluids are discontinued {{to prevent a}} state of fluid overload. If fluid overload occurs and <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide {{may be used to}} eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} nighttime <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> assessment in predicting acute care transfers (ACT) from inpatient rehabilitation. Design Retrospective chart review. Methods Fifty patients unexpectedly discharged to acute care underwent chart review to determine details of each ACT. Findings Seven of 50 ACT possessed new <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> abnormalities at the 11 pm <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> assessment the night before ACT. None of these seven underwent ACT during the night shift the abnormalities were detected. Two of 50 ACT were transferred between 11 pm and 6 : 59 am; both demonstrating normal <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> at the 11 pm assessment. During study period, an estimated 5, 607 11 pm <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> assessments were performed. Conclusions Nighttime <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> assessments {{do not seem to}} be a good screening tool for clinical instability in the rehabilitation hospital. Clinical Relevance Eliminating sleep disturbance is important to the rehabilitation inpatient as inadequate sleep hinders physical performance. Tailoring <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> monitoring to fit patents' clinical presentation may benefit this population...|$|R

30|$|Life {{detection}} radar {{that combines}} radar technology with biomedical engineering detects human physiological signals (respiration, heartbeat, body movement, etc.) {{from a long}} distance with non-contact method. In this field, <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> detection and parameter extraction are hot issues in current researches, and the acquisition of <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> signal of human target with radar may very helpful. In this paper, a separation method for <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> signals based on time-frequency filtering (TFF) is proposed, which mainly predicts the instantaneous frequency (IF) by combining the Viterbi algorithm (VA) with strong noise immunity and {{taking advantage of the}} high-resolution time-frequency transformation method with good cross-term inhibitory effect in B distribution (BD), so as to extract the weak <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> signals in the radar echo effectively. According to the simulation result, this algorithm has good resolution precision and anti-noise performance, and it is applicable for the extraction of <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> signals in low signal-to-noise ratio, which may provide basis for the further launch of parameter extraction of the <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> signals.|$|R

5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
40|$|Clinicians {{who have}} a continual {{awareness}} of a patient’s <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> levels {{are more likely to}} detect and respond to early indicators of the patient’s physiological deterioration. Auditory displays are informative patient monitoring tools that can convey <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> information through short abstract tones, known as earcons. In an earlier study, Janata and Edwards (2013) tested participants’ accuracy at identifying changes in <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> levels using earcons in which timbre represented oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and tremolo represented heart rate (HR) levels. However, the earcons were only moderately effective at supporting the monitoring of SpO 2 levels. In the present study, we tested participants’ accuracy at identifying <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> levels using a novel set of pitch-based earcons (pearcons). The pearcons used pitch and tremolo to represent SpO 2 and HR levels respectively. It was hypothesized that if pitch is more discernible or more integral with tremolo than timbre is, then participants who listened to pearcons would identify the <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> levels more accurately than participants who listened to earcons. Results showed that participants who listened to the pearcons were more accurate at identifying <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> levels than participants who listened to the earcons. Additionally, SpO 2 identification accuracy was lower when HR level changed at the same time, than when HR level was constant. However, between the pearcons and the earcons condition {{there was no difference in}} each <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> identification accuracy change from trials where the other <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> was constant, to trials where the other <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> changed. This study showed preliminary evidence that pearcons are more effective than earcons for patient monitoring, possibly because pitch is fundamentally more discernible than timbre. Future studies should examine the effectiveness of pearcons in a more clinically representative context...|$|R

5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E

5|$|The season {{centers on}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} and death of her former partner, Fox Mulder (Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, known as X-Files. In this episode, agent Mulder is buried. After the body of alien abductee Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley) revives before an autopsy, assistant director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) orders Mulder's body to be exhumed. When Mulder's body is uncovered, weak <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> are discovered. Meanwhile, rogue FBI agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) uses a nanobot infection in Skinner's blood as leverage to make him kill Scully's unborn child. Eventually, Mulder is revived and reunites with Scully.|$|E
5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his <b>vital</b> <b>signs.</b> She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E
40|$|IntroductionPhysical {{activity}} (PA) {{is strongly}} endorsed for managing chronic conditions, and a <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> tool (indicator of general physical condition) could alert providers of inadequate PA to prompt counseling or referral. This systematic review examined the use, definitions, psychometric properties, and outcomes of brief PA instruments as <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> measures, with attention primarily to studies focused on arthritis. MethodsElectronic databases were searched for English-language literature from 1985 through 2016 using the terms PA, exercise, <b>vital</b> <b>sign,</b> exercise referral scheme, and exercise counseling. Of the 838 articles identified for title and abstract review, 9 articles qualified for full text review and data extraction. ResultsFive brief PA measures were identified: Exercise <b>Vital</b> <b>Sign</b> (EVS), Physical Activity <b>Vital</b> <b>Sign</b> (PAVS), Speedy Nutrition and Physical Activity Assessment (SNAP), General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ), and Stanford Brief Activity Survey (SBAS). Studies focusing on arthritis were not found. Over 1. 5 years of using EVS {{in a large}} hospital system, improvements occurred in relative weight loss among overweight patients and reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin among diabetic patients. On PAVS, moderate physical activity of 5 or more days per week versus fewer than 5 days per week {{was associated with a}} lower body mass index (2 ̆ 2122. 90 kg/m 2).

5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All <b>vital</b> <b>signs</b> remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A Remote <b>Vital</b> <b>Sign</b> Monitor is an in-home {{healthcare}} {{system designed to}} wirelessly monitor core-body temperature. The Remote <b>Vital</b> <b>Sign</b> Monitor provides accuracy and features which are comparable to hospital equipment while minimizing cost with ease-of-use. It has two parts, a bandage and a monitor. The bandage and the monitor both use the Chipcon 2430 (CC 2430) which contains an integrated 2. 4 GHz Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum radio. The CC 2430 allows Remote <b>Vital</b> <b>Sign</b> Monitor to operate at over a 100 -foot indoor radius. A simple user interface allows the user to set an upper temperature and a lower temperature that is monitored {{with respect to the}} core-body temperature. If the core-body temperature exceeds the one of two defined temperatures, the alarm will sound. The alarm is powered by a low-voltage audio amplifier circuit which is connected to a speaker. In order to accurately calculate the core-body temperature, the Remote <b>Vital</b> <b>Sign</b> Monitor must utilize an accurate temperature sensing device. The thermistor selected from GE Sensing satisfies the need for a sensitive and accurate temperature reading. The LCD monitor has a screen size that measures 64. 5 mm long by 16. 4 mm wide and also contains back light, and this should allow the user to clearl...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, an {{algorithm}} {{that can}} separate the micro-Doppler signal of <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> signals in time-frequency filtering is proposed. In this algorithm, the time-frequency of echo signal is analyzed by BD transformation, {{which is good}} in cross-term inhibitory effect and high in resolution. Secondly, the instantaneous frequency of signal is estimated by the Viterbi algorithm, which is not sensitive to noise, and may gain good effect in low SNR condition. Eventually, the time-frequency filter is constructed according to the estimated instantaneous frequency, so as to extract the micro-Doppler of <b>vital</b> <b>sign</b> signals.|$|R
