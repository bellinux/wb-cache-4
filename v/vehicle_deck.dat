25|$|Built {{as a car}} ferry, Caledonian Princess was a roll-on/roll-off design, with {{a single}} vehicle door in the stern. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> had space for 103 cars. To {{facilitate}} the turning of trucks for disembarking, a turntable {{was included in the}} deck. In 1969, she had side loading doors cut into her <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{report was}} {{critical}} of the crew's actions, particularly for failing to reduce speed before investigating the noises emanating from the bow, and for being unaware that the list was being caused by water entering the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck.</b> There were also general criticisms of the delays in sounding the alarm, the passivity of the crew, {{and the lack of}} guidance from the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{first sign}} of trouble aboard Estonia was when a {{metallic}} bang was heard, caused by a heavy wave hitting the bow doors around 01:00, when the ship was {{on the outskirts of}} the Turku archipelago, but an inspection—limited to checking the indicator lights for the ramp and visor—showed no problems. Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew. At about 01:15, the visor in which the ship's bow door opened separated, and the ship immediately took on a heavy starboard list (initial 30 to 40 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 90 degrees) as water flooded into the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck.</b> Estonia was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.|$|E
25|$|The air on <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> became uncomfortably warm, {{either from}} {{the heat of the}} vessel engines or lack of air circulation. This made some people wary of {{bringing}} pets aboard the FastCats; however, the ferries had kennels with improved air circulation at the bow and stern of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|When built, {{the then}} Prins Filip {{incorporated}} several state-of-the-art safety features, such as flood barriers on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks.</b> There {{was also an}} airline-style on-board safety video http://users.pandora.be/eddy.lannoo/PF_frame.htm.|$|R
50|$|A RoLo (roll-on/lift-off) vessel {{is another}} hybrid vessel type, with ramps serving <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> but with other cargo decks only {{accessible}} when the tides change {{or by the}} use of a crane.|$|R
25|$|The aft {{flight deck}} has two landing spots for {{aircraft}} {{the size of}} a Chinook, although it has no hangar or aircraft storage facility. Below the flight deck is the dock and <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck.</b> The latter has the capacity to hold thirty-one large trucks and thirty-six smaller vehicles or six Challenger 2 tanks and thirty armoured personnel carriers. The dock can hold four Landing Craft Utility MK10, each large enough to carry vehicles up to main battle tank size, which are then launched by flooding of the dock area. Four smaller LCVP MK5 that can carry thirty-five men or two light trucks are carried on davits, two each side of the ship's superstructure. Each ship also carries a fifty-two ton tracked beach recovery vehicle for assisting with landing craft recovery, as well as two tractors: one that can lay a track-way across a landing beach, and the second fitted with an excavating bucket and forks.|$|E
25|$|About 6 a.m. on 17 November 2010 a fire {{broke out}} on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> of the MS Pearl of Scandinavia on its way from Oslo to Copenhagen. The ferry's fire {{sprinkler}} system {{put out the fire}} before any of the crew or the 490 sleeping passengers were injured and the ship could dock in Copenhagen under its own power. It was determined that the cause of the fire was a short circuit in the plug of an extension cord used to charge a rebuilt Nissan Qashqai, converted into a battery electric vehicle by the Sakskøbing based company A Future EV. The company owner was returning from Norway where the vehicle had started the approval process for general sale there, and had used an extension cord to charge the vehicle from a general purpose power outlet on the ferry. The ferry operator DFDS Seaways consequently prohibited vehicle charging on board its ferries while the investors withdrew their support for the vehicle company forcing it into bankruptcy.|$|E
2500|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{the city}} of Vancouver has {{investigated}} various options to rectify the situation. [...] The two most prominent options were 1) to introduce bicycle lanes on the bridge's <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> by reallocating one or more vehicle lanes, and 2) to build horizontal extensions {{on the outside of}} the bridge to create additional sidewalk space. Other options have included building an entirely new pedestrian and/or cyclist only bridge, and building another deck on the bridge below the existing deck.|$|E
50|$|There {{are still}} Estonian {{language}} {{instructions on the}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> boilers from the ferry's homeland port in Estonia, as well as Superfast pictures and wallpapers in the Children's Playroom and near the restaurant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> can {{be loaded}} {{on two levels}} from both the bow and stern on decks 3 and 5 {{and there are two}} tier linkspans in both Harwich and Hoek van Holland to {{accommodate}} the ship.|$|R
50|$|Aratere {{has both}} rail and <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks.</b> These can be loaded {{simultaneously}} through the stern via a double linkspan. A lower hold has additional space for cars, though {{access to this}} hold was blocked off after the refit in Singapore.|$|R
2500|$|The Albion-class landing {{platform}} dock is {{a class of}} amphibious warfare ship in service with the Royal Navy. The class consists of two vessels, [...] and , ordered in 1996 to replace the ageing [...] [...] Both ships were built by BAE Systems Marine at the former Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering yard in Barrow-in-Furness. Albion was commissioned in 2003 and Bulwark in 2004. [...] Each of the ships has a crew of 325 and can accommodate up to 405 troops. Thirty-one large trucks and thirty-six smaller vehicles and main battle tanks can be carried inside the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck.</b> To disembark troops and vehicles, the vessels are equipped with eight landing craft.|$|E
2500|$|Ocean was {{designed}} to provide the amphibious assault capabilities last offered by [...] and [...] She can deploy an Embarked Military Force (EMF) of a Royal Marines Commando Group from 3 Commando Brigade supported by aircraft and landing craft. The ship's company includes 9 Assault Squadron (9 ASRM) from 1 Assault Group Royal Marines whose primary role is as an Amphibious Assault Squadron. Secondary tasks include boarding parties, beach reconnaissance and providing amphibious knowledge to the ships Command. Besides these roles they have responsibilities within the ship which include firefighting, watchkeeping and security. 9 ASRM is divided into a HQ unit, Landing Craft Troop, Signals detachment, <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Deck</b> Party and Assault Supply Team.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight deck}} is [...] and {{sits at a}} height of , with six spots for {{helicopters}} up to MRH-90 size to operate simultaneously. Alternately, helicopters up to Chinook size can take off or land simultaneously on four spots on the flight deck. Flight operations can be conducted up to Sea State 5. The standard air group aboard these ships will be a mix of MRH-90 transport helicopters and S-70B Seahawk anti-submarine helicopters. The [...] hangar deck can accommodate eight medium-size helicopters, and an additional ten can be carried if the light <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> is used for additional helicopter space. Two aircraft lifts (one large one centre-aft, and a smaller one to starboard {{and in front of}} the island superstructure) connect the flight and hangar decks.|$|E
50|$|Above two <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks,</b> {{passenger}} accommodation is over two main decks. To create {{an air of}} luxury, there was large scale use of mahogany and brass. Over the years, many refits and overhauls ensured that the ships remained very comfortable.|$|R
50|$|Ben-my-Chree is a Ro-Pax ferry, largely {{designed}} to carry freight, with two <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> (decks 3 and 5) and two passenger accommodation decks (7 and 8). There are 20 four-berth cabins and crew accommodation for 22. Her freight capacity is 200 vehicles (1235m).|$|R
50|$|St Clare is Wightlinks {{flagship}} {{and also}} the biggest ship in Wightlinks fleet, able to hold 878 passengers and 186 cars across 3 <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> compared to all other vessels operating on the Portsmouth to Fishbourne route which carry 771 passengers and 142 cars.|$|R
2500|$|The Burrard Street Bridge (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Burrard Bridge) is a five-lane, Art Deco style, steel truss bridge constructed in 1930–1932 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The high, five part bridge on four piers spans False Creek, connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends. It is one of three bridges crossing False Creek. The other two bridges are the Granville Bridge, three blocks or [...] to the southeast, and the Cambie Street Bridge, about 11 blocks or [...] to the east. In addition to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck,</b> the Burrard Bridge has sidewalks on both sides, [...] wide, the northern one (with a view of English Bay and West Vancouver) for pedestrians and the southern one (with a view of False Creek) now dedicated to cyclists.|$|E
2500|$|The wreck was {{examined}} and videotaped by remotely operated underwater vehicles and by divers from a Norwegian company, Rockwater A/S, contracted {{for the investigation}} work. The official report indicated that the locks on the bow door had failed from the strain of the waves and the door had separated {{from the rest of}} the vessel, pulling the ramp behind it ajar. The bow visor and ramp had been torn off at points that would not trigger an [...] "open" [...] or [...] "unlatched" [...] warning on the bridge, as is the case in normal operation or failure of the latches. The bridge was also situated too far back on the ferry for the visor to be seen from there. While there was video monitoring of the inner ramp, the monitor on the bridge was not visible from the conning station. The bow visor was under-designed, as manufacturing and approval process did not consider the visor and its attachments as critical items regarding ship safety. The first metallic bang was believed to have been the sound of the visor's lower locking mechanism failing, and subsequent noises were the visor 'flapping' against the hull as the other locks failed, before tearing free and exposing the bow ramp. The subsequent failure of the bow ramp allowed water into the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck,</b> which was identified as the main cause of the capsizing and sinking: RORO ferries with their wide vehicle decks are particularly vulnerable to capsizing if the car deck is even slightly flooded because of free surface effect: the fluid's swirling motion across such a large area hampers the boat's ability to right itself after rolling with a wave.|$|E
2500|$|The LHDs {{will be able}} to {{transport}} 1,046 soldiers and their equipment, and can carry 1,600 in overload conditions. The embarked force is called the Amphibious Ready Element Landing Force (ARE-LE) based on an infantry company of up to 220 soldiers. Army planners considered several options for forming an amphibious force including training a dedicated infantry battalion, training several battalions with battalion rotations or creating a brigade size force similar to the U.S. Marines MEU and Royal Marines 3 Commando Brigade structure. In December 2011, 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2RAR) was selected to develop the initial amphibious capability with the Chief of Army stating that as the capability is developed a future model for the force will be decided. A special forces capability [...] will be provided by the 2nd Commando Regiment with the potential in the future for elements of 2RAR to be trained in certain special forces skills. Two vehicle decks (one for light vehicles, the other for heavy vehicles and tanks) have areas of [...] and [...] respectively, and between them can accommodate up to 110 vehicles. The heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> may alternately be used for cargo, with a capacity of 196 shipping containers. Each ship has a [...] well deck, that houses up to four LHD Landing Craft (LLC, the RAN designation for the LCM-1E), which can be launched and recovered in conditions up to Sea State 4. Twelve were ordered from Navantia, which delivered them in batches of four during 2014 and 2015. Six LLC are assigned to each LHD, with the additional craft used for training and trials at shore bases, and rotated to their parent ship when embarked craft require maintenance. The well deck also has room for four Rigid-hulled inflatable boats (although these will not be carried as standard), and can be used by other nations' landing craft and amphibious vehicles.|$|E

She has four <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> and room for around 200 lorries. Her maximum speed is 27 knots, but usually sails at 23 knots maximum.|$|R
50|$|A roll-on, {{roll-off}} {{design with}} a bow visor, Caribou had 2 <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> and 5 decks above, the main passenger deck being Deck 5. She measured 179 metres in overall length and 25 metres in breadth, weighing 27,212 tons. Her capacity included 1,200 passengers and 370 automobiles or 77 tractor trailers. She had up to 106 crewmembers.|$|R
5000|$|... {{there are}} 22 ferries on Puget Sound {{operated}} by the state. The largest vessels in this fleet carry up to 2500 passengers and 202 vehicles. They are painted in a distinctive white and green trim paint scheme, and feature double-ended open <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> and bridges at each end {{so that they do}} not need to turn around.|$|R
2500|$|Union Rotorua was {{the first}} ship {{considered}} for acquisition, with inspection beginning in November 1991, but after the New Zealand Defence Force began {{to look at other}} vessels in mid-1992, Union Rotorua was dropped from contention. In researching New Zealand defence acquisitions, Peter Greener claims he can find no clear reason for Union Rotorua to be dropped, but identifies the size of the [...] ship, which would have been by far the largest vessel ever operated by the RNZN, and the gas-turbine propulsion system, which was due for overhaul, as factors. Shipbroking company Rugg and Co was contracted in July 1992 to identify civilian ships that met the RNZN's criteria and were available to purchase second-hand; the company returned a list of 33 ships of 20 classes, which the Defence Force culled to 21 ships of 9 classes, then again to 4 classes. In October 1992, around {{the same time as the}} second revision or Rugg and Co's list, shipyards in Spain, Korea, and Poland were asked about the cost of new-build vessels. By January 1993, a Mercandian 2-in-1 class vessel was identified as the preferred type; although there was a loss of capability compared to a purpose-built vessel, this was seen as an acceptable tradeoff as the RNZN would have great difficulty affording a new ship, particularly after acquiring the Anzac class frigates. An independent review by British company BMT Defence Services indicated that conversion of such a vessel for military service was feasible, but warned that the ramp size and <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> height were smaller than the RNZN had specified, and that motion in heavy conditions, particularly with the later-planned modification to carry helicopters, was a concern. Approval was sought from Cabinet in April 1993 to purchase a ship, although the decision to buy a new-build or second-hand vessel was unresolved. The Australian government offered to lease or sell the Royal Australian Navy's heavy lift ship, , to the New Zealanders in late 1993; although the offer was responded to favourably, it was rejected because of the lower cargo capacity and higher personnel requirement compared to the Mercandian design, despite Tobruks capability for beach landings.|$|E
50|$|The Interislander {{operates}} three {{roll-on roll-off}} ferries: Aratere, Kaiarahi and Kaitaki. Aratere is a rail ferry, carrying rail wagons {{on the lower}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> and road vehicles on the upper <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck.</b> Kaitaki and Kaiarahi do not have rail capacity, and carry road vehicles across two decks.|$|E

Wahine had two <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> with a combined capacity for more than 200 cars.|$|R
25|$|The PacifiCats were {{designed}} by Philip Hercus of Australia and Robert Allan Limited of Vancouver. Hercus and Incat developed the hull form and Robert Allan handled the outfitting aspects of the design. The PacifiCats were custom-designed to fit BC Ferries' docks, which allow simultaneous loading on two full-length roll-through <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks.</b> This trait gives the PacifiCats their unique appearance in comparison with other fast ferries.|$|R
50|$|Queen of New Westminster {{initially}} had six sister ships, {{of which}} only one {{is still in}} service with BC Ferries. These ships were originally built as a single class but were modified through different combinations of deck-stretching, addition of more <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks,</b> and installation of more powerful engines. Though New West is a sister of these ships, the ship does not fit into either the V class or the Burnaby class.|$|R

50|$|The ships {{had both}} {{bow and stern}} doors leading onto the main <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck,</b> making them roll-on/roll-off, {{combined}} with ramps that led to upper and lower vehicle decks. Thanks to their shallow draught, they could beach themselves and use the bow doors for speedy unloading of troops and equipment. The ships also had helicopter decks on both the upper <b>vehicle</b> <b>deck</b> and behind the superstructure.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteel truss bridges with {{continuous}} {{reinforced concrete}} slab as <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> are often found in Indonesia. The use of {{continuous reinforced concrete}} slab along the steel truss bridges has still have some problems in the field such as the occurrence of cracks. Cracks that occur on the concrete slab are required to be repaired, which is mostly done by grouting method. However, the method are still unsuccessful in addition to costly expensive. Study on partial prestressed concrete slab as <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> of steel truss bridge was done. The system used was a partial prestressed concrete segmental slab in one direction which was set transversely the bridge. Two concrete slab specimens were cast which had a length of 7000 mm, a width of 1000 mm and a height of 250 mm, respectively. Symmetrical reinforcement consists of four non-prestressed steel bars and three strands, placed {{on the top and}} bottom sides of the slab. The steel bars have a diameter of 18 mm and the strands have a diameter of 0. 5 inches. Plain steel bars with a diameter of 10 mm were used as stirrups, spacing at 200 mm. The slabs were then tested in the laboratory with a gradual loading increament. At every stage of loading, crack width and strain of steel reinforcement were measured. The test results showed that at the service load condition according to the BMS standard, no cracks was occurred on the concrete slab and the non-prestressed reinforcing steels were still under compression. At maximum load condition, cracks occurred evenly spaced at 85, 5 mm to 112, 5 mm and a maximum crack width was 3. 2 mm. Based on the test results, it can be concluded that such partial prestressed concrete segmental slab was very good to be used as an alternative for the <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks</b> of steel truss bridges...|$|R
50|$|At 19:01, the Tōya Maru {{lowered its}} anchor near Hakodate Port {{to wait for}} the weather to clear up again. However, due to high winds, the anchor did not hold and Toya Maru was cast adrift. Water entered the engine room due to the poor design of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>decks,</b> causing its steam engine to stop and the Tōya Maru to become uncontrollable. The captain decided to beach the sea liner onto Nanae Beach, on the {{outskirts}} of Hakodate.|$|R
