40|$|In concentrating {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) {{solar radiation}} is concentrated up to 1000 times using inexpensive optics. This leads to high heat flux {{in the system}} of up to 100 W/cm² and requires an efficient thermal design. There are actively and passively cooled systems. The thermal design of those systems is investigated with theoretical simulations. In this paper we present how to validate the simulations using indoor experiments. To manufacture CPV modules industrially, standard processes from the electronic industry like wire bonding or pick-and-place are used and adapted wherever possible. In this paper a process to mount solar cells with areas > 1 cm² using <b>vacuum</b> <b>soldering</b> is presented.

40|$|There the {{purposes}} are {{to develop and}} to introduce the structural and manufacturing methods of reliability rise of Integrated Circuits (IC) of 142 series {{as well as the}} methods of quality inspection in full-scale production. The method of equalization to rise the IC reliability has been grounded by theory; the statistic system of quality inspection of IC, which is distinguished by use of results of accelerated tests and of equalization method, has been developed. It was ascertained that the capillary <b>vacuum</b> <b>soldering</b> of crystals gives the decrease of porosity of soldered seam in comparison with the hydrogen soldering. The technique of rejection of potentially-unreliable IC of 142 series has been developed. It was showed by practice that the reliability of IC of 142 series may be risen not lesser than 2 times at the expense of improvement of construction of body, at the expense of improvement of assembly and test process only. The introduction has been realized at the Voronezh Works of Semiconductor Devices.

40|$|Voids in {{solder joints}} are {{representing}} {{one of the}} main problems especially for power electronics. A low and homogeneous thermal resistance of solder joints is demanded for a quick and uniform conduction of the heat loss from the power chip. The same applies for the electrical conductivity of solder joints. Enclosed voids can cause a displacement of electrical and thermal paths and a local concentration of power and heat. In addition, gas voids are anxious to form spheres in the solder gap, which could be a cause for tilting of chip components and a wedge-shaped solder gap. This is tightening the problem of patchy distribution of current or heat and is causing stress and cracks. The amount of voids can be influenced by different measures, e. g. a good wettability of metallization, solder pastes with special adopted solvents and an adequate preheating profile. However, a special vacuum process step during soldering is demanded for absolutely void free solder joints. But this vacuum process is associated with some essential disadvantages. Besides of the technical expenses for vacuum pumps and additional locks, the vacuum process excludes the use of gas convection for heating and cooling. Apart from a special vapour phase-vacuum technology, most machines are using infrared radiation or heat conduction for soldering. The same principles as used in <b>vacuum</b> <b>soldering</b> technology are applicable also for a higher pressure level. If the void in the solder joint is arising for an excess pressure, the normal atmosphere pressure could be sufficient for escaping of enclosed gas. Essential for this effect is the pressure difference between inside and outside of solder joint. A benefit of soldering with excess pressure is the possibility of gas convection for heat transfer. This allows the application of conventional components and the realization of the usual temperature distribution and profiles...|$|E
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{has a strong}} demand for highly reliable and cost-efficient electronics. Especially the upcoming generations of hybrid cars and fully electrical vehicles need compact and efficient 400 V power modules. Within the engine compartment installation space is of major concern. Therefore small size and high integration level of the modules are needed. Conventionally IGBTs and diodes are soldered to DCB (Direct Copper Bond) ceramics substrates and their top contacts are connected by heavy Al wire bonds. These ceramic modules are <b>vacuum</b> <b>soldered</b> to water-cooled base plates.

50|$|It is good {{practice}} to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering—desoldering braids or <b>vacuum</b> desoldering equipment (<b>solder</b> suckers) can be used. Desoldering wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination from the copper trace and any device leads that are present.

25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature <b>vacuum</b> tubes <b>soldered</b> in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} behaviour of semiconductor lasers {{has a distinct}} influence on their application to pumping solid state lasers and material processing. The goal was to carry out experimental and theoretical investigations with {{particular attention to the}} temperature dependence of the emission properties, in order to increase output power, efficiency, and lifetime of such devices. Potential use in <b>vacuum</b> deposited Pb-Sn <b>solders</b> have been tested for mounting high-power laser diodes and arrays. For the chip mounting, a special apparatus device has been developed. By means of the Finite-Element Method, numerical simulations of the {{temperature behaviour}} of GaAlAs/GaAs high-power laser diodes have been performed. From calculated two- and three-dimensional temperature distributions, design rules for the construction of high-power laser diodes could be derived. A model has been developed, which allows a unified description of output power and efficiency as functions of the internal loss processes. Using this model, quantum well laser structures have been examined with respect to their optimization. The facet temperature was measured by means of photoluminescence and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Under operating conditions, facet temperatures as high as 100 C have been measured for GaAlAs/GaAs lasers. The error was about #+-# 4 K. For one special structure, it was possible to measure the temperature distribution along the resonator by means of electroluminescence. (orig.)
