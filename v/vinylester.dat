50|$|The basic {{reinforcement}} {{material for}} this process is glass-fibre rovings, which are chopped to a length of 10 to 40 mm and then applied on the mould. For improved mechanical properties, a combination of fabric and chopped fibre layers is used. The most common material type is E-glass, but carbon and Kevlar rovings can also be used. Continuous strand mat, fabric, and various types of core materials are embedded by hand whenever required. The weight fraction of reinforcement in this process is typically 20 to 40% of the total weight of the part. The most common resin system used for the spray-up process is general purpose or DCDP polyester; isophthalic polyesters and <b>vinylesters</b> are also sometimes used. Fast-reacting resins with a pot life of 30 to 40 minutes are typical. The resin often contains {{a significant amount of}} filler. The most common fillers are calcium carbonates and aluminium trihydrates. In filled resin systems, fillers replace some of the reinforcements; 5 to 25% filler is used by weight.|$|R

40|$|Being {{completely}} bio-based, {{fatty acid}} starch esters (FASEs) are attractive materials that represent {{an alternative to}} crude oil-based plastics. In this study, two synthesis methods were compared {{in terms of their}} efficiency, toxicity and, especially, product solubility with starch laurate (C 12) as model compound. Laurates (DS&# 62; 2) were obtained through transesterification of fatty acid <b>vinylesters</b> in DMSO or reaction with fatty acid chlorides in pyridine. The latter lead to higher DS-values in a shorter reaction time. But due to the much better solubility of the products compared to lauroyl chloride esterified ones, vinylester-transesterification was preferred to optimize reaction parameters, where reaction time could be shortened to 2 h. FASEs C 6 -C 18 were also successfully prepared via transesterification. To determine the DS of the resulting starch laurates, the efficient ATR-IR method was compared with common methods (elementary analysis, 1 H NMR). Molar masses (Mw) of the highly soluble starch laurates were analyzed using SEC-MALLS (THF). High recovery rates (&# 62; 80 %) attest to the outstanding solubility of products obtained through transesterification, caused by a slight disintegration during synthesis. Particle size distributions (DLS) demonstrated stable dissolutions in CHCl 3 of vinyl laurate esterified - contrary to lauroyl chloride esterified starch. For all highly soluble FASEs (C 6 -C 18), formation of concentrated solutions (10 wt%) is feasible...|$|R
40|$|With its {{worldwide}} {{availability and}} its low market-price native starch provides {{the potential for}} the use as a bio-based material. However, in its native form it is highly hydrophilic, not cold-water dispersible and only forms brittle films. So, our work aimed at the chemical modification of degraded starch for the application in the coating sector as binder, with the focus on paints and varnishes. For this purpose, cold-water dispersible hydrophobized starch esters and ethers with high solid contents (≥ 30 % (w/w)) and viscosities between 100 and 1000 mPa•s should be synthesized. Additionally, they should form continuous films and show adhesion to different substrates. As starting product a degraded potato starch with a molar mass of 1. 18 • 105 g/mol was used and modified by carboxylic acid anhydrides (C 2 -C 4) and carboxylic acid <b>vinylesters</b> (C 6) {{in the case of the}} esters. Epoxy alkane derivatives were used for the synthesis of hydroxyalkyl starch ethers (C 3 -C 4, C 6). Beside the type of substituent and the chain length, also the degrees of substitution (DS) and molar substitutions (MS) were varied from 0. 05 to 1. 1. The modification led to cold water-soluble or dispersible products with applicable concentrations between 30 and 45 % (w/w) and viscosities in the range of 102 - 103 mPa•s (100 s - 1). The most samples had a newtonian flow behaviour and showed viscoelastic properties with higher values for the loss modulus (G’’). Continuous films were observed with starch esters in the DS range of 0. 11 - 0. 81 and in the case of the starch ethers with MS values of 0. 77 - 0. 91. Wet and dry layer thicknesses of 25 - 50 μm and 7 - 12 μm were obtained (doctor blade: 100 μm). In the cross cut test the esters had clearly better results with values of 0 and 1, in contrast to the tested ether with values of 4. The compatibility tests with 3 commercial binders showed that two Acronal binders (A 754 & S 559) (42 %) showed compatibility with the modified starches (58 %). According our experiments and especially based on the results of the film formation and the cross cut test the starch esters and not the ethers could be the preferred class for an application in the coating sector. Additionally, the results showed that the starch esters could be an alternative to petroleum-based polymers as binder in paints and varnishes potentially...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{the wide}} variety of {{thermoset}} resin formulations (epoxy, <b>vinylester,</b> polyester, etc.), their cure behavior is qualitatively identical. The resin viscosity drops initially upon the application of heat, passes through a region of maximum flow and begins to increase as the chemical reactions increase the average length and the degree of cross-linking between the constituent oligomers. This process continues until a continuous 3-dimensional network of oligomer chains is created - this stage is termed gelation. In terms of processability of the resin this marks an important watershed: before gelation the system is relatively mobile, after it the mobility is very limited, the micro-structure of the resin and the composite material is fixed and severe diffusion limitations to further cure are created. Thus in order to achieve vitrification in the resin, it is usually necessary to increase the process temperature after gelation. Cure monitoring methods give a significant insight to the chemical process and define process actions towards achieving specific quality indices of the cured resin systems.__notoc__ ...|$|E
5000|$|Hull and Deck:The {{construction}} of the C&C 37/40 was ahead of it's time. Utilizing aircraft grade pre-impregnated balsa core material and Kevlar / fibreglass fabric, the hull and deck are laid up using <b>vinylester</b> resin for strength, blister resistance and light weight. The C&C 37 Plus series are built up with isophthalic (Hydrex) gelcoat, C&C's exclusive Kevlar hybrid, E-Glass, pre-impregnated end-grain Baltek AL-600 balsa (1 in balsa core in hull and [...]75 in in deck) and Hydrex resin. Hydrex, a modified isophthalic, has higher hydrolytic stability, toughness and is more crack resistant than conventional resins. The layups of the R and XL series use Kevlar hybrid exclusively with Hydrex resin {{on both sides of}} a core of Balteck AL-600 aircraft grade balsa. All materials are Lloyd's approved. These exclusive C&C laminate schedules result in hulls and decks which despite significant weight reduction are stronger than the conventional glass laminates of the time. They are not only much lighter, but stiffer and more rigid. Additional unidirectional glass is used in highly stressed areas with aluminum and coremat hardware backing. The boot stripe is molded in the hull for fairness to the hull surface and to reduce maintenance requirements.|$|E
50|$|The hulls {{of early}} 505s {{were built in}} cold-molded marine plywood. Many of these are still {{actively}} raced. New hulls are now built using composite molding: glass fibre and/or carbon fibre mats and <b>vinylester</b> or epoxy resin using either a wet layup technique or using heat-cured prepreg sheets. Hulls are usually cored with foam, balsa or Nomex to increase stiffness and durability: new hulls will remain competitive for well over ten years, and boats several times that age have won races in major championships. Spars traditionally were aluminum alloy, but recent rule changes have permitted the use of carbon fibre for booms and spinnaker poles (though not for masts.) The hull shape and sail plan are tightly controlled, while the spars, foils and rigging are more open. This allows the boat's rig and controls {{to be set up}} to the preferences of the sailor, rather than dictated by the class rules (as they are for the Laser class, for example.) The rig itself is highly adjustable for wind and sea conditions, with the result that the boat can be sailed in a relatively wide range of wind speeds and by crews of varying sizes. Successful teams come in many combinations, including all-female, all-male, mixed, and child/adult or child/teen. As of 2009, over 9000 505s had been built.|$|E

While GRP, wood, and even concrete hulls are technically made of composite materials, the term [...] "composite" [...] is often used for plastics reinforced with fibers other than (or in addition to) glass. Cold-molded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline.

Design/methodology/approach: Prior to production of the composites, the chicken feather fibres (CFF) were cleaned, tested and analyzed in terms of physical properties; linear density and tensile behaviour. The unidirectional CFF reinforced composites were produced with <b>vinylester</b> and polyester resins with three fibre reinforcement loadings (2. 5, 6, 10 wt%). Following experiments were conducted to determine physical properties of the control (0 %) and CFF reinforced composites; tensile, flexural and Charpy impact testing. Findings: It was found that the impact properties of the CFF reinforced composites are significantly better than the control composites however both the tensile and the flexural properties of the CFF reinforced composites have poorer values compared to the control composites. For the 10 % CFF reinforced <b>vinylester</b> composite, Charpy impact value was 4. 42 kgj/mm 2 which was 25 % higher than the control <b>vinylester</b> composites (3. 31 kgj/mm 2) and also for the 10 % CFF reinforced polyester (4. 56 kgj/mm 2) composite had three times better impact resistance than the control composite (1. 85 kgj/mm 2). Practical implications: The CFF reinforced composite have potential applications due to its improved impact behaviour.
