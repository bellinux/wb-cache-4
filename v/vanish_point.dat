However, {{not only does}} INS have system error, but also it is very expensive. Therefore, in this paper error distributions of <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> are studied and tested in order to substitute INS for MMS in some special land-based scene, such as ground façade where usually only two <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> can be detected. Thus, the traditional calibration approach based on three orthogonal <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> is being challenged. In this article, firstly, the line clusters, which parallel to each others in object space and correspond to the <b>vanishing</b> <b>points,</b> are detected based on RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) and parallelism geometric constraint. Secondly, condition adjustment with parameters is utilized to estimate nonlinear error equations of two <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> (V X, V Y).

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented for automatic camera calibration from single images with three finite <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> in mutually orthogonal directions (or of more independent images having two and/or three such <b>vanishing</b> <b>points).</b> Assuming ‘natural camera’, {{estimation of the}} three basic elements of interior orientation (camera constant, principal point location), along with the two coefficients of radial-symmetric lens distortion, is possible without any user interaction. First, image edges are extracted with sub-pixel accuracy, linked to segments and subjected to least-squares line-fitting. Next, these line segments are clustered into dominant space directions. In the <b>vanishing</b> <b>point</b> detection technique proposed here, the contribution of each image segment is calculated via a voting scheme, which involves the slope uncertainty of fitted lines to allow a unified treatment of long and short segments. After checking potential <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> against certain geometric criteria, the triplet having the highest score indicates the three dominant <b>vanishing</b> <b>points.</b> Coming to camera calibration, a main issue here is the simultaneous adjustment of image <b>point</b> observations for <b>vanishing</b> <b>point</b> estimation, radial distortion compensation and recovery of interior orientation in one single step. Thus, line-fitting from <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> along with estimation of lens distortion is combined with constraints relating <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> to camera parameters. Here, the principal point may be considered as the zero point of distortion and participate in both sets of equations as a common unknown. If a redundancy in <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> exists – e. g. when more independent images from the same camera with three, or even two, <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> are at hand and are to be combined for camera calibration – such a unified adjustment is undoubtedly advantageous.

40|$|Camera {{calibration}} is {{an important}} step in obtaining 3 D information from 2 D images. <b>Vanishing</b> <b>points</b> of parallel lines have proven to be useful features for selfcalibration task.

40|$|<b>Vanishing</b> <b>points</b> are {{valuable}} in many vision {{tasks such as}} orientation estimation, pose recovery and 3 D reconstruc-tion from a single image. Many methods have been pro-posed to address the problem, however, a consistent framework to quantitatively analyze the stability and ac-curacy of <b>vanishing</b> <b>point</b> estimation is still absent. This paper proposes a new concept, vanishing hull, which solves the problem. Given an edge error model, the range of a true edge can be modeled using a fan region. The intersection of all these fan regions is a convex hull, which is called vanishing hull. A vanishing hull gives the region of a true <b>vanishing</b> <b>point,</b> and its distribution determines the probability of the <b>vanishing</b> <b>point.</b> The expectation of the vanishing hull is the optimal solution of the <b>vanishing</b> <b>point,</b> its variance defines {{the accuracy of the}} estimation, and its shape determines the stability of the <b>vanishing</b> <b>point.</b> Hence, we can quantita-tively analyze the stability and accuracy of the <b>vanishing</b> <b>point</b> estimation using <b>vanishing</b> hull.
