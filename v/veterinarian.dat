5|$|In May 2005, a <b>veterinarian</b> named Kris Nelson filed {{a series}} of {{complaints}} against the zoo regarding animal care and management.

Another <b>veterinarian,</b> 15-year zoo employee Kathy Orr, discounted many of Nelson's claims as being either invalid, or having been corrected already.|$|E

40|$|Since 1966, {{approximately}} 1 000 <b>veterinarians</b> graduate {{each year}} from 16 veterinary schools in Japan. According to reports submitted by <b>veterinarians</b> to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in January 2007, there were over 35 818 <b>veterinarians</b> in Japan {{at the end of}} 2006. Of this total, 13 202 (36. 8 %) were engaged in companion animal practice, 9 112 (25. 4 %) were civil servants and 4 180 (11. 7 %) were engaged in food animal practice. The total number of <b>veterinarians</b> has increased gradually over the past 40 years. Recently, the number of <b>veterinarians</b> engaged in companion animal practice has increased while the number of <b>veterinarians</b> engaged in food animal practice is declining.

50|$|Behavior {{consultants}} do {{not practice}} veterinary medicine, {{unless they are}} also <b>veterinarians.</b> <b>Veterinarians</b> may choose to refer animals with behavioral issues to behavior consultants, and some <b>veterinarians</b> maintain working relationships with specific behavior consultants for this purpose.

While few veterinary schools have extensive behavioral programs, some general practice <b>veterinarians</b> may choose to further their own education in this area. Additionally, a veterinary behavior specialty exists. Veterinary behaviorists are veterinary specialists with extensive education and experience in working with behavior problems. Behavior consultants may refer cases to veterinary behaviorists, especially animals who may benefit from behavioral medication, as only <b>veterinarians</b> are legally able to prescribe medications for animals.|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} fixation and the microimmunofluorescence tests {{were used to}} determine the prevalence of antibodies to Coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of Q fever, among <b>veterinarians</b> and slaughterhouse workers in Nova Scotia. Seventeen percent of the 65 <b>veterinarians</b> and 12. 5 % of the 96 slaughterhouse workers tested had complement fixing antibodies to phase II C. burnetii antigen. Forty-nine percent of the <b>veterinarians</b> and 35 % of the slaughterhouse workers had an antibody titer of ≥ 1 : 8 to phase II C. burnetii antigen using the microimmunofluorescence test while 30 % of the <b>veterinarians</b> and 14. 5 % of the slaughterhouse workers had antibodies detected to phase I antigen. Male <b>veterinarians</b> had a significantly higher rate of antibodies to C. burnetii phase II antigen compared with female <b>veterinarians</b> (p < 0. 0087). An univariate analysis revealed that positive antibody titers (microimmunofluorescence test) to phase II antigen among <b>veterinarians</b> were significantly associated with exposure to cow, sheep and goat placentas; to stillborn calves, newborn foals, lambs and kids.

Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the level of}} biosecurity training among Australian equine <b>veterinarians</b> and to assess their perceptions of biosecurity and infectious disease risk and their opinions about {{the management of the}} 2007 equine influenza (EI) outbreak. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A survey was conducted among equine <b>veterinarians</b> attending the 2010 annual conference of the Equine <b>Veterinarians</b> Australia (EVA) in New South Wales, Australia. Data were collected using a self-completed questionnaire and analysed using Fisher's exact tests to assess veterinarians' levels of biosecurity training, their perceptions of infectious disease and views regarding the 2007 EI outbreak management. Results: A total of 46 of the 196 (23. 5 %) attending <b>veterinarians</b> completed the questionnaire. Significantly greater proportions of recently graduated <b>veterinarians</b> received theoretical and practical biosecurity training at veterinary schools than their older counterparts. The majority of respondents considered their likelihood of spreading infectious diseases from one client's horse to another to be low (84 %). More than half (58 %) of the <b>veterinarians</b> considered that hand-washing/wearing gloves was very effective in preventing disease spread. However, around one-quarter (27 %) reported a degree of reservation about the practicality of performing general biosecurity practices in everyday working life. Overall, <b>veterinarians</b> were satisfied with the EI outbreak response, but had mixed opinions about the control measures and communications used. Conclusion: Levels of biosecurity training and the frequency of biosecurity advice provided by <b>veterinarians</b> have increased over time, although the practicality of biosecurity practices is a concern for some <b>veterinarians.</b> Further investigations of the barriers to the use of various biosecurity practices are required in order to inform training programs. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Feline obesity {{has become}} a common disease and {{important}} animal welfare issue. Little is known about how, or how often, <b>veterinarians</b> and feline-owning clients are addressing obesity during clinical appointments. The purpose of this qualitative study was to characterize verbal and non-verbal communication between <b>veterinarians</b> and clients regarding feline obesity. The sample consisted of video-recordings of 17 <b>veterinarians</b> during 284 actual appointments in companion animal patients in Eastern Ontario. This audio-visual dataset served to identify 123 feline appointments. Of these, only 25 appointments were identified in which 12 <b>veterinarians</b> and their clients spoke about feline obesity. Thematic analysis of the videos and transcripts revealed inconsistencies in the depth of address of feline obesity and its prevention by participating <b>veterinarians.</b> In particular, in-depth nutritional history taking and clear recommendations of management rarely took place. <b>Veterinarians</b> appeared to attempt to strengthen the veterinary–client relationship and cope with ambiguity in their role managing obesity with humor and by speaking directly to their animal patients. Clients also appeared to use humor to deal with discomfort surrounding the topic. Our findings have implications for communication skills training within veterinary curricula and professional development among practicing <b>veterinarians.</b> As obesity is complex and potentially sensitive subject matter, we suggest a need for <b>veterinarians</b> to have further intentionality and training toward in-depth nutritional history gathering and information sharing while navigating obesity management discussions to more completely address client perspective and patient needs...|$|R
