5|$|Starting {{from the}} Long Depression (1873–1896), Lyonnais silk {{production}} had become totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The synthesis of aniline {{was used to}} make mauveine (aniline purple) dye and the synthesis of quinine was used to make indigo dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated {{to the production of}} artificial silk (<b>viscose),</b> which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.|$|E
25|$|VGF quickly {{expanded}} <b>viscose</b> production.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1928 VGF opened a <b>viscose</b> factory nearby.|$|E
25|$|After the 1929 merger AKU {{opened a}} <b>viscose</b> plant in Asheville, North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|He {{planned to}} fully convert the Donnersmarcks plant to the <b>viscose</b> process.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 1953, Cudd {{resigned}} {{as director of}} the EES to become Vice President and Manager of Research and Development of the American <b>Viscose</b> Corporation, which has since been acquired by FMC Corporation. In 1960, Cudd became the head of the polypropylene manufacturer AviSun Corporation, which was jointly owned by the American <b>Viscose</b> Corporation and Sun Oil Company.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 Courtaulds {{remained}} one of {{the four}} groups which dominated the man-made fibre industry in Europe (counting the German VGF and the Dutch AKU as one group, and including also the CTA—later merged into Rhone-Poulenc~-in France, and Snia <b>Viscose</b> in Italy). Courtaulds activities in continental Europe consisted in a wholly owned, one-factory <b>viscose</b> fibre business employing some 3,000 people in France, a 50% share in a similar business in Germany (of which the other 50% was owned by VGF, the major competitor), and a minority shareholding which controlled 20% of the voting capital in the Italian firm Snia Viscosa, also primarily a <b>viscose</b> fibre producer. This activity expanded until the 1960s, when these products were replaced by newer developments.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{industrial uses}} of carbon disulfide, consuming 75% {{of the annual}} production are the manufacture of <b>viscose</b> rayon, cellophane film.|$|E
25|$|It {{was clear}} by 1909–10 that <b>viscose,</b> with its cheaper raw {{materials}} and simpler spinning process, was economically superior to cuprammonium.|$|E
25|$|Although VGF's {{product was}} less {{versatile}} than rayon {{produced by the}} <b>viscose</b> process {{the scale of the}} operation allowed for reduced prices.|$|E
25|$|The German plants {{accounted}} {{for the bulk of}} AKU's production, and made 60% of the <b>viscose</b> in Germany in the early 1930s.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 Courtaulds and VGF {{founded a}} joint venture named Glanzstoff Courtaulds to build and operate a large <b>viscose</b> {{manufacturing}} facility in Cologne.|$|E
25|$|Courtaulds became {{concerned}} about competition from VGF after {{the purchase of}} the Donnersmarck <b>viscose</b> plant, and initiated discussions on ways to avoid harmful competition.|$|E
25|$|The German government, {{faced with}} a cotton {{shortage}} due to the Allied blockade, ordered 3,000 tons of <b>viscose</b> staple from VGF, which was used {{for a variety of}} military textiles including clothing.|$|E
25|$|In July 1911 the {{chairman}} of VGF, Hans Jordan, decided to pay 2 million marks for all the German patent rights for the <b>viscose</b> process and for the Donnersmarcks Kunstseide und Acetatwerke near Stettin.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is the basis}} of the manufacture of regenerated cellulose, the main ingredient of <b>viscose,</b> rayon and cellophane. Both xanthates and the related thioxanthates (derived from treatment of CS2 with sodium thiolates) are used as flotation agents in mineral processing.|$|E
25|$|Commonly, {{toothbrushes}} {{are made}} of plastic. Such brushes constitute a source of pollution. In {{order to reduce the}} environmental impact, some manufacturers have switched to using biodegradable materials and/or use replaceable heads. In order to avoid plastic altogether alternative toothbrushes on offer consist of wooden handles (often bamboo) and bristles of bamboo <b>viscose</b> or pig bristles.|$|E
25|$|Saugbrugsforeningen ran trial {{production}} of <b>viscose</b> in 1922. This {{led to the}} approving of a 7,000 tonne mill in 1928. It was built {{at the same time}} as the 3,000-tonne PM3. Both began production in 1929, after an investment of NOK2 million. 1931 was dominated by a major strike from 8 April to 11 September and the annual production was halved.|$|E
25|$|The {{head saw}} mill was closed in 1931, but the edger mill was kept and refined coarse-cut wood from other mills in the area. <b>Viscose</b> became {{gradually}} more important; it {{was responsible for}} 30 percent of production in 1930 and 57 percent in 1937. Newsprint production was cut out and the remaining production move to finer grades of paper. The company also established production facilities for wood engraving and pressure treating. The 1930s were generally good times for the company, with a steady increase in prices. Then the bottom fell out the market in 1938, resulting in NOK2 million in losses.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, the DuPont Highway (now {{known as}} DuPont Boulevard and U.S. 113) was completed. While this {{was seen as}} a great boon to the town, it would {{eventually}} lead to the decline of the railroad and the town's economy, leading to the closing of all the towns factories. In May 1920, after several fires in the town, the Town Council met to establish a fire department to protect the citizens and businesses of Ellendale and surrounding communities. The newly formed fire department purchased a Ford Model T fire truck for $1400 from the <b>Viscose</b> Silk Company in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|From there, {{he was the}} {{director}} of the Georgia Tech Research Institute, where he created a solution to a long-standing debate about the role of research engineers in a tenure system and significantly increased the number of researchers. He would then lead or hold a leadership role in several oil companies, including American <b>Viscose</b> Corporation, AviSun Corporation, Sun Oil Company, and finally Amoco Chemical Corporation; Cudd would be president of the latter from 1963 to 1974. From 1976 until his retirement in 1983, Cudd served on the Board of Directors for R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} paper {{machines}} (PM1 and PM2) opened in 1914 and 1915. <b>Viscose</b> production was introduced along with PM3 in 1929. The mill underwent a gradual modernization through the 1950s, {{resulting in the}} opening of PM4 in 1963 and PM5 in 1968. From the mid 1970s through the early 1990s the mill cut most of its pollutants which had severely polluted Iddefjord and Tista. This coincided with a cut in most manufacturing not related to magazine paper. Norske Skog bought the mill in 1989 and opened PM6 in 1993. The mill's forests and three hydroelectric power stations were sold in 2001 and 2002.|$|E
25|$|The global {{chemicals}} {{industry was}} in a distinct recession, and the company faced difficult times. The company employed 23,000 and had £2 billion in annual revenue, with 30% from the United States, 40% from Europe and 15% from Asia-Pacific. CEO Sipko Huismans had focused the company on rationalisation and cost cutting: We have to cut costs. We can't count on sales growth to pay us more or {{to allow us to}} buy more of our favorite things. In 1991, the company closed its <b>viscose</b> plant in Calais, France, allowing its other plants to boost output to 93% capacity, compared with an industry average of 75%. This enabled the share price to double in the first three years following the demerger.|$|E
25|$|Sulfuric acid {{is a very}} {{important}} commodity chemical, and indeed, a nation's sulfuric acid production is a good indicator of its industrial strength. World production in 2004 was about 180 million tonnes, with the following geographic distribution: Asia 35%, North America (including Mexico) 24%, Africa 11%, Western Europe 10%, Eastern Europe and Russia 10%, Australia and Oceania 7%, South America 7%. Most of this amount (≈60%) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20% is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment. About 6% of uses are related to pigments and include paints, enamels, printing inks, coated fabrics and paper, and the rest is dispersed into a multitude of applications such as production of explosives, cellophane, acetate and <b>viscose</b> textiles, lubricants, non-ferrous metals and batteries.|$|E
2500|$|Courtaulds also {{entered the}} market of {{cellulosics}} (<b>viscose</b> and acetate) in North America with the setting {{up of the}} American <b>Viscose</b> Corporation (AVC) in 1909. The investment in the US was highly successful, but its sale at a knock-down price was enforced in 1941 {{as part of the}} negotiations which preceded Lend-Lease.|$|E
2500|$|The company {{headed by}} Count Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck (1830–1916) {{had been the}} first in Germany to use the <b>viscose</b> [...] process invented by Courtaulds in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of the railroad also made Roanoke attractive to manufacturers. [...] American <b>Viscose</b> opened a large rayon plant in Southeast Roanoke in October 1917. [...] This plant closed in 1958, leaving 5,000 workers unemployed. [...] When N converted to diesel, 2,000 railroad workers were laid off.|$|E
2500|$|Weldon wasn't {{active in}} {{politics}} until 1977, {{when he became}} the Mayor of Marcus Hook. Prior to that, he served as an educator in local Delaware County schools, and for the Insurance Company of North America, {{as well as a}} volunteer line officer chief for the <b>Viscose</b> Fire Company in Marcus Hook.|$|E
2500|$|Coventry {{has been}} the home to several pioneers in science and engineering. Samuel Courtauld and Co Ltd's {{director}} H.G.Tetley chose Foleshill in Coventry in 1904 {{as the site of}} the world's first man-made fibre factory which produced an [...] "artificial silk" [...] later known as <b>viscose</b> rayon. [...] In 1987, also in Foleshill, Courtaulds Research produced the world's first solvent-spun cellulose fibres Tencel.|$|E
2500|$|While {{flooding}} {{from the}} Juniata River was somewhat controlled {{due to a}} dam at Raystown Lake, [...] west of Lewistown, the county experienced extensive flooding from the river and major streams {{which resulted in the}} permanent closure of many businesses along the river. Most notably, the flood submerged much of the American <b>Viscose</b> Corporation plant, then a division of FMC Corporation. The facility, located {{on the banks of the}} Juniata River across from Lewistown proper, manufactured rayon fiber (primarily for rayon-belted automobile tires), polyester and Avistrap.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{artificial}} fiber, {{known as}} art silk from 1799 onwards, {{became known as}} <b>viscose</b> around 1894, and finally rayon in 1924. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood. Although these artificial fibers were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later in the 1930s. Nylon, the first synthetic fiber, made its debut in the United States {{as a replacement for}} silk, and was used for parachutes and other military uses.|$|E
2500|$|Flintshire - A {{subsidiary}} of a German company, the British Glanzstoff Manufacturing Company started an artificial silk factory in Flint in 1907. During World War I the factory closed down but {{was taken over}} by Courtaulds in 1917. In 1913, the company had started making the synthetic fibre <b>viscose</b> rayon, made from cellulose derived from imported wood pulp or cotton waste. Courtaulds in September 1919 bought the old Muspratt Alkali factory in Flint from United Alkali Co Ltd and called it Castle Works, where after conversion they started production in 1922 of manufactured <b>viscose</b> rayon yarn. Courtaulds also in December 1927 bought the Holywell Textile Mill in Flint which they called Deeside Mill and after reconstruction and alterations was used for yarn processing. At its height Courtaulds employed over 10,000 people at four sites. At Greenfield, some [...] further down the Dee estuary, two additional large rayon production facilities existed from 1936 onwards, named Number 1 and Number 2. These mills employed over 3,000 people. Textile production declined from 1950, and Aber works shut initially in 1957, opened for rayon in 1966, and pulled down in 1984. Castle works closed in 1977 and Deeside Mill in 1989. The number 1 facility at Greenfield was mothballed in 1978, and the entire site was decommissioned in the mid 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Wishing {{to reduce}} their {{dependence}} on natural silk, [...] in 1904, Courtaulds acquired the Cross and Bevan patents to the <b>viscose</b> process for manufacturing artificial silk or rayon from dissolving pulp. [...] They set up the first factory to produce it in Coventry UK in 1905. [...] The early yarns were first woven into fabrics at the Halstead Mill in Essex in March 1906, but the process remained troublesome until further inventions improved yarn strength. [...] However, {{in a few years}} the process became highly successful and was responsible for transforming the silk weaver into the world's leading man-made fibre production company.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{prices were}} stable, {{the company had}} a {{potential}} revenue generator in Tencel, a man-made fibre Courtaulds had spent £100 million and 10 years bringing to market. Like <b>viscose,</b> Tencel is made from cellulose derived from dissolved wood pulp. While rayon production generates large amounts of sulfurous waste, Tencel is made with a [...] "closed loop" [...] chemical {{process in which the}} solvent can be filtered and reused. The final product is far stronger than rayon or cotton, which allows a huge variety of different forms and feels - from ultrasoft yet strong denim jeans, to shirts that feel like silk, to scarves that ape the texture of cashmere.|$|E
