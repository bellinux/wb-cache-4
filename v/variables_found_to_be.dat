40|$|Summary: Reasons for {{performing}} study: Superficial digital flexor (SDF) tendinopathy {{is a common}} injury in Thoroughbred horses racing over hurdles. Identification of risk factors may allow the introduction of measures to minimise the incidence of this injury. Objective: To identify risk factors for SDF tendinopathy in Thoroughbred horses in hurdle races in the UK. Methods: Potential risk factors for SDF tendinopathy were studied between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2009 using a retrospective cohort study design with 1031 case starts and 168, 637 control starts. Potential risk factors were screened using univariable logistic regression prior to multivariable model building. Results: In the final multivariable model, 20 statistically significant risk factors were identified. <b>Variables</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with increased odds of SDF tendinopathy included: firmer going; increased horse age at first race; having had a previous SDFT injury; and racing in the summer compared to other seasons. <b>Variables</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with decreased odds included: being trained by a more successful trainer; and having raced more frequently in the preceding 9 – 12 months. Conclusions: This study identified multiple risk factors associated with SDF tendinopathy, {{some of which are}} difficult to explain with the current data source. Factors resulting in increased cumulative horse and tendon fatigue (increased years in racing; carrying increased weight; and racing over longer distances), firm ground, and the presence of previous tendon injury should be considered when attempting to reduce the likelihood of sustaining SDF tendinopathy...|$|E

The secondary purpose was to determine how the factors of industry, number of employees, business size, geographic location, owner and/or decision maker gender, owner and/or decision maker race, and owner and/or decision maker education explained variances in participation in continuing business education programs. One thousand one hundred forty two business owners and/or decision makers completed a web-based survey to identify motivations for participation, based on the Participation Reason Scale (Grotelueschen, 1985).

40|$|Abstract Background A {{number of}} factors, such as demographics, {{cognitive}} function, personality and interpersonal relationship) {{play a role}} in late-life depression. This study investigates the influence of social inhibition on the inverse emotional stability (neuroticism) and depressive symptoms found in elderly Thai people. Methods In total, 123 elderly Thais aged 60 [*]years of age or older were tested using the 64 -item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, Symptom Checklist- 90, and the 16 Personality Factors Questionnaire. Hierarchical regression and path analyses were performed in order to identify the relationships among these variables. Results The age of the participants ranged from 60 to 93 [*]years old (mean[*]=[*] 71. 7; SD[*]=[*] 6. 2), and out of the group, 51. 2 % were male, 56. 1 % were married and 61. 8 % were on a low income. The average number of years spent in education among the participants was 7. 6 (SD[*]=[*] 5. 1). The <b>variables</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly associated with depression were age, intellect, social inhibition and possession of inverse emotional stability (neuroticism). Low levels of emotional stability were most strongly associated with depressive symptoms (standardized regression coefficients − 0. 29), but this effect was found to be reduced (mediated, to − 0. 26) by social inhibition. In total, 30 % of the total variance could be explained by this model, and there was an excellent statistical fit. Conclusions The <b>variables</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly associated with depression were a younger age, as well as lower levels of intellectual skill, social inhibition and inversed emotional stability (neuroticism). It was found that a lack of emotional stability is, along with a younger age, the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms, but can be mediated by social inhibition. </p...|$|E
