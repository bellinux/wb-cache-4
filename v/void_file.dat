40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on design of project {{documentation}} apartment residence with wellness centre in Beskydy Mountains. It is a three floors apartment residence with wellness centre with basement, with is located in sloping plot {{in the village of}} Staré Hamry in Frýdek-Místek. Nearby are 2 ski lifts and 3 ski slopes. The whole area is very used by tourist in summer and winter season. In building is 13 apartments and they are designed to be suitable for a longer stay with one apartment is designed for people with limited mobility. Residence is possible make accommodation for 36 people. In wellness part are designed swimming pool, whirlpool, finish and infra saunas. The main disposal idea was separate an accommodation part from wellness part. The supporting system consists of two structural systems. As a main building material was in basement part used a permanent formwork from vibropressed concrete blocks and in upper floor are used ceramic block Porotherm with <b>voids</b> <b>filed</b> by hydrophobic mineral wool. Loadbearing interior basement part consist of reinforced concrete columns with make a space for parking space for cars. Ceiling construction consists of prestressed hollow core slab Spiroll. Roof is designed as a saddle roof. The main result is the correct design of the building with a correct layout design, correct structural design, architectural, energy saving and safety in use of the building...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe maintenance of an aircraft carrier's tanks and voids {{has a direct}} impact on ship operability and service life. The scheduling of inspections and repair work for these tanks and voids poses a significant problem for the carrier maintenance community. This thesis contributes to refining strategy in the repair planning process by providing the framework for building comprehensive tank and <b>void</b> database <b>files.</b> To demonstrate this, repair history files are constructed for USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67) and USS Enterprise (CVN 65). These files consolidate tank and void repair documentation from the myriad of carrier maintenance agencies and comprise the most complete database for these ships. A simliar database can be developed for all the carriers by duplicating this effort. A life cycle analysis of the data reveals that paint coating failure rates are more srmilar among tanks and voids on the same ship rather than among tanks of the same flinctional type. A case study for CV- 67 examines model accuracy and predicts the expected number of coating failures at a filture maintenance period. The lessons learned in this thesis directly supports a follow on study of the JP- 5 tanks on the Nimitz class aircraft carriers. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The hydrolytic {{alteration}} of anorthosite fromthe Barro Alto StratiformMafic–Ultramafic Complex (Central Brazil) caused {{the formation of}} an isalteritic bauxite. Petrological studies using X-ray diffraction (XRD),X-ray fluorescence (XRF), mass balance calculation and micromorphological description via optical microscopy were undertaken to understand the evolution of the bauxitic massif. The results suggest the transformation of the isalteritic bauxite (F 1) into varied alteration facies and their filiations as follows: the formation of semi-compact massive bauxite (F 2) and compact massive bauxite (F 3) by the recrystallisation of gibbsite <b>filing</b> <b>voids,</b> resulting in enriched absolute aluminium (9 and 25 %, respectively); the formation of laminar bauxite (F 4) and fragmentary bauxite (F 5), which is associated with different types of fragmented massive duricrust, such as those formed by mechanical (root activity, tectonics, etc.) and geochemical (dissolution of gibbsite, kaolinite neoformation, etc.) processes; the formation of palaeopediment bauxite (F 6); the formation of degraded clay with gibbsitic nodules (F 7), which is associated with the resilicification process by the oscillation of the water table caused by changes in the shapes of slopes and the cycling of silica by vegetation. Isalteritic clay (F 8) facies directly derived fromthe anorthosite are also found. The relationship between the facies reflects the polygenetic evolution of the bauxitic massif...|$|R
