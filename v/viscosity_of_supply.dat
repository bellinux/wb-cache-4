30|$|From Fig.  3, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the <b>viscosity</b> {{variations}} <b>of</b> coal–oil slurry prepared by FCC is different from that prepared by CT. When temperature is less than 100  °C, the <b>viscosity</b> <b>of</b> the two kinds of coal–oil slurries differ by more than 100  mPa s. When temperature is between 100 and 160  °C, the differences <b>of</b> the <b>viscosity</b> <b>of</b> coal–oil slurries are reduced to tens mPa s. The differences <b>of</b> <b>viscosity</b> <b>of</b> coal–oil slurries before 160  °C are caused by the properties of FCC and CT. The <b>viscosity</b> <b>of</b> FCC is larger than CT, so the <b>viscosity</b> <b>of</b> coal–oil slurry prepared by FCC is also larger than that prepared by CT. However, the effect of the property of oil on the viscosity variations decreases with temperature increasing. When temperature is between 160 and 240  °C, the <b>viscosity</b> <b>of</b> the coal–oil slurries is almost the same. This means the properties of FCC and CT have no effect on the <b>viscosity</b> variations <b>of</b> the coal–oil slurries. This finding is consistent with Wang’s findings (Wang et al. 2007).
