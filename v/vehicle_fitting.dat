5000|$|Currently {{there appears}} to be a move toward wheeled <b>vehicles</b> <b>fitting</b> a [...] "tank destroyer" [...] or [...] "assault gun" [...] role, such as the M1128 Mobile Gun System of the US Army, the Centauro Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the Italian and Spanish Armies, the Chinese {{anti-tank}} gun PTL-02 and ZBL08 assault gun, and the French AMX 10 RC heavy armoured car. While these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role, none were developed with this specifically in mind, reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the US military in the assault gun role during World War II.|$|R

40|$|Augmented reality {{technology}} is applied so that driving tests may {{be performed in}} various environments using a virtual reality scenario with {{the ultimate goal of}} improving visual and interactive effects of simulated drivers. Environmental conditions simulating a real scenario are created using an augmented reality structure, which guarantees the test taker’s security since they are not subject to real-life elements and dangers. Furthermore, the accuracy of tests conducted through virtual reality is not influenced by either environmental or human factors. Driver posture is captured in real time using Kinect’s depth perception function and then applied to driving simulation effects that are emulated by Unity 3 D’s gaming technology. Subsequently, different driving models may be collected through different drivers. In this research, nearly true and realistic street environments are simulated to evaluate driver behavior. A variety of different visual effects are easily available to effectively reduce error rates, thereby significantly improving test security as well as the reliability and reality of this project. Different situation designs are simulated and evaluated to increase development efficiency and build more security verification test platforms using such technology in conjunction with driving tests, <b>vehicle</b> <b>fittings,</b> environmental factors, and so forth...|$|R

50|$|In 1961 the County Borough of West Ham in London {{purchased}} two S&D TZ vehicles {{equipped for}} flushing out sewers and drains and for street washing. 251 BJD {{was one of}} this pair. In 1965 local government reorganisation resulted in the vehicles belonging to the newly created London Borough of Newham.

50|$|Due to {{improvements}} in modern tank armor, anti-tank hand grenades are generally considered obsolete. However, {{in the recent}} Iraq War, the RKG-3 anti-tank hand grenade has made a reappearance with Iraqi insurgents who used them primarily against U.S. Humvees, Strykers and MRAPs, which lack the heavier armor of tanks.

50|$|The {{remaining}} Renault FT vehicles, though having shown {{themselves to}} be very effective in trench warfare, were not well adapted in their present state of technological development to peacetime conditions. The main problem was their low top speed, which necessitated special tank transporters whenever the vehicles had to be moved outside their base area and made them fundamentally unsuited to patrolling duty in the colonies. It was therefore decided to modify a number of existing <b>vehicles,</b> by <b>fitting</b> them with a more effective suspension system. The first modifications were of the Renault FT Kégresse-type, which featured the suspension of the Kégresse half-track, fitted with a special rubber steel-reinforced track. In 1925 42 vehicles were rebuilt this way and deployed in 1926 during the Berber insurrection in Morocco. The modification allowed for {{a top speed of}} 17 km/h but field experience showed that the track was liable to suddenly snapping at top speed with often catastrophic consequences and the modification project was therefore discontinued. Nine Renault FT Kégresse vehicles were later sold to Yugoslavia and five to Poland.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{design process}} of a {{double-sided}} slotted TORUS axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) motor suitable for direct drive of electric vehicle (EV) is presented. It used sizing equation and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). AFPM motor is a high-torque-density motor easily mounted compactly onto a <b>vehicle</b> wheel, <b>fitting</b> the wheel rim perfectly. A preliminary design is a double-sided slotted AFPM motor with 6 rotor poles for high torque-density and stable rotation. In determining the design requirements, a simple vehicle-dynamics model that evaluates vehicle performance through the typical cruising trip of an automobile was considered. To obtain, {{with the highest}} possible torque, the initial design parameters of the motor, AFPM’s fundamental theory and sizing equation were applied. Vector Field Opera- 3 D 14. 0 commercial software ran the FEA of the motor design, evaluating and enhancing accuracy of the design parameters. Results of the FEA simulation were compared with those obtained from the sizing equation; at no-load condition, the flux density at {{every part of the}} motor agreed. The motor’s design meets all the requirements and limits of EV, and fits the shape and size of a classical-vehicle wheel rim. The design process is comprehensive and can be used for an arbitrary EV with an arbitrary cruising scenario. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It is {{believed}} that the lateral line found in most fish and some other aquatic organisms {{plays an important role}} in many behaviors by providing hydrodynamic information about the sur-rounding fluid. This paper presents a lateral line inspired feedfor-ward control design for the autonomous underwater vehicles. The goal of this paper is to improve maneuvering accuracy for under-water exploration and environmental monitoring. The proposed controller takes pressure measurements at multiple locations over the entire vehicle hull and forms a B-spline surface approxima-tion of the pressure distribution. Hydrodynamic forces acting on the vehicle are then estimated and passed to the controller for the improved trajectory tracking performance. The algorithm is for-mulated in such a way that the force estimation is a linear, fixed weight combination of the pressure signals, which enables rapid on-line computation. The performance of the feedforward controller is simulated in conjunction with the “robust integral of the sign of the error ” control design. Trajectory tracking is investigated for control accuracy in the presence of localization errors. Reduced tracking errors are observed with the feedforward design. Exper-imental tests with pressure sensors on a moving cylinder further vindicate the force estimation algorithm.
