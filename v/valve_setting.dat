50|$|Tests on replica bypass {{assemblies}} {{showed that}} bellows squirm could occur at pressures below the safety <b>valve</b> <b>setting,</b> but that squirm {{did not lead}} to a leak (either from damage to the bellows or from damage to the pipe at the mitre welds) until well above the safety <b>valve</b> <b>setting.</b> However theoretical modelling suggested that the expansion of the bellows as a result of squirm would lead to a significant amount of work being done on them by the reactor contents, and there would be considerable shock loading on the bellows when they reached the end of their travel. If the bellows were 'stiff' (resistant to squirm), the shock loading could cause the bellows to tear at pressures below the safety valve setting; it was not impossible that this could occur at pressures experienced during start-up, when pressure was less tightly controlled. (Plant pressures {{at the time of the}} accident were unknown since all relevant instruments and records had been destroyed, and all relevant operators killed).The Inquiry concluded that this ("the 20-inch hypothesis") was 'a probability' but one 'which would readily be displaced if some greater probability' could be found.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hydrocephalus causes {{impaired}} gait, balance, cognition and continence, all {{of which}} can be reversed by shunt treatment. Adjustable valves are commonly used in the shunt treatment of hydrocephalus but randomized controlled trials (RCT) are scarce. The aim of the present thesis was to evaluate adjustable valves in the treatment of hydrocephalus. Patients and Methods: In Study I, 450 hydrocephalus patients undergoing primary shunt insertion were followed over 10 years to investigate the short-term perioperative risk factors of shunt surgery. In Study II the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and ICP wave amplitude (AMP), valve settings and body positions were studied in 15 hydrocephalus patients. During the shunt operation an intraparenchymatous ICP-sensor was simultaneously inserted and ICP/AMP analyzed with the shunt ligated and when opened at different opening pressures and body positions. A double-centered RCT was conducted in studies III and IV, including 68 patients with iNPH. The patients received a ventricular shunt and were randomized into two groups; in one group (20 - 4) the valve was initially set to 20 cm H 2 O and gradually reduced to 4 cm H 2 O {{over the course of the}} 6 month study period. In the other group (12), the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> was kept at a medium level of 12 cm H 2 O during the whole study period. In study III the time to and type of complications and overdrainage symptoms were recorded. In Study IV clinical variables were continuously compared between the two groups. Results: In total, 538 patients were included and the six month shunt revision rate was 19 %. Fifty-four percent of the patients received adjustable valves. Both adjustable valves and right frontal placement of the shunt were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but not independently. ICP and AMP decreased significantly when the shunt was opened but the difference in ICP between the highest and lowest valve settings (in vivo) was smaller than previous measurements in vitro. Gradual reduction of the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> from 20 to 4 cm H 2 O neither improved clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> at 12 cm H 2 O. The clinical improvement was seen within 3 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Gradual reduction of the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> from a high to a low level neither improved the clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> at medium level. The pressure window in an adjustable valve is narrower in vivo than in vitro. ICP in the upright position is significantly different from the supine position. Right frontal shunt placement and the use of adjustable valves were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but a coincidence of these two variables was found...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SVC is {{a dynamic}} {{reactive}} compensator based on switching type HV electrical and electronic devices, well recognized as {{an effective means of}} resolving power quality problems. SVC is complex in structure, consisting of TCR <b>valve</b> <b>sets,</b> FC filter channel, etc. In particular, TCR <b>valve</b> <b>set</b> adopts thyristor serial connecting technology, and over 100 thyristors are adopted, which requires real-time status of devices in SVC to be monitored and uploaded, and even failures to be recorded. Therefore, the monitoring software becomes an important part in ensuring SVC safe operation.

40|$|The {{aeration}} cone is {{the main}} equipment of pure oxygen absorption system for the recently domestic used water recirculating culture system. The operational control of the aeration cone which controls the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) value of water outlet and the oxygen transfer rate, is mainly by changing the inlet water flowrate and the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure of pure oxygen. In this study, the temperature of water was maintained at about 30 â. When the inlet water flowrate of the aeration cone was controlled between 270 - 330 L/min, the DO value of water outlet would demonstrate a decreasing tendency with the increasing of the inlet water flowrate. When the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure was controlled between 0. 35 - 0. 40 kg/cm 2 (cm square), both of the DO value of water outlet and the oxygen transfer rate would increase as the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure raised. The experimental {{results showed that the}} oxygen transfer rate was between 1. 137 - 1. 647 g/min, the oxygen absorption efficiency was maintained between 72. 4 - 81. 5 %, the oxygen transfer efficiency was between 0. 0681 - 0. 0941 kg/kW-hr, the aeration effectiveness was 60. 67 - 70. 87 %, and the utilization efficiency was maintained between 44. 2 - 58. 7 %. Furthermore, the relative height between positions of the culture tank and the aeration cone can be designed and planned using Bernoulli's equation. The water lever inside the aeration cone would drop as the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure increased and raise as the inlet water flowrate increased. The water level inside the aeration cone must be kept at least over 60 cm to avoid the water level being too low as the undissolved oxygen inside the aeration cone smuggled with the water flow to the culture tank resulting a waste of oxygen leaking to the atmosphere. ç®ååå§å¾ªç°æ°´é¤æ®ç³»çµ±ä¸­ï¼å¶ç´æ°§å¸æ¶ç³»çµ±ä¸»è¦ä»¥æ°§æ°£éçºä¸»ï¼èæ°§æ°£éå¨æä½æ§å¶ä¸ï¼ä¸»è¦æ¯æ¹è®å¶å¥æ°´å£æµéèç´æ°§èª¿ç¯é¥è¨­å®å£åä¾æ§å¶å¶åºæ°´å£æº¶æ°§éèæ°§æ°£å³è¼¸éçãå¨æ¬ç ç©¶ä¸­ï¼æ°´æº«ç¶­æå¨ 30 âå·¦å³ï¼æ°§æ°£éå¥æ°´å£æµéæ§å¶å¨ 270 - 330 L/minä¹éæï¼å¶åºæ°´å£æº¶æ°§éæé¨å¥æ°´å£æµéçå¢å èåç¾ä¸éä¹è¶¨å¢ï¼èæ°§æ°£å³è¼¸éçåæé¨å¥æ°´å£æµéä¹å¢å èå¢å ãèª¿ç¯é¥è¨­å®å£åæ§å¶å¨ 0. 35 - 0. 40 kg/cm 2 (å¬æ¤/å¹³æ¹å¬å) ä¹éæï¼æ°§æ°£éåºæ°´å£æº¶æ°§éèå¶æ°§æ°£å³è¼¸éçï¼åæé¨èèª¿ç¯é¥è¨­å®å£åä¹å¢å èå¢å ãæ¬è©¦é©çµæé¡¯ç¤ºï¼æ°§æ°£éä¹æ°§æ°£å³è¼¸éçå¨ 1. 137 - 1. 647 g/minä¹éï¼æ°§æ°£å¸æ¶æçç¶­æå¨ 72. 4 - 81. 5 ï¹ªä¹éï¼æ°§æ°£å³è¼¸æçå¨ 0. 0681 - 0. 0941 kg/kW-hrä¹éï¼ææ°£æçå¨ 60. 67 - 70. 87 ï¹ªä¹éï¼æ°§æ°£å©ç¨æçåç¶­æå¨ 44. 2 - 58. 7 ï¹ªä¹éã æ­¤å¤ï¼é¤æ®æ± èæ°§æ°£éå©èä¹ç¸å°é«åº¦ä½ç½®ï¼å¯èç±æåªå©æ¹ç¨å¼ä¾å ä»¥è¨­è¨è¦åãå¶æ°§æ°£éå§æ°´ä½é¢éåºä¹é«åº¦æé¨èèª¿ç¯é¥è¨­å®å£åä¹å¢å èä¸éï¼é¨å¥æ°´å£æµéä¹å¢å èæé«ï¼èæ°§æ°£éå§æ°´ä½é¢éåºä¹é«åº¦è³å°é ä¿æå¨ 60 cmä»¥ä¸ï¼ä»¥é¿åæ°§æ°£éå§æ°´ä½éä½ï¼é ææ°§æ°£éå§æªæº¶è§£ä¹æ°§æ°£ï¼å¤¾å¸¶å¨æ°´æµä¸­ï¼å¾é¤æ®æ± æ´©åºè³å¤§æ°£ä¸­ï¼é ææ°§æ°£ä¹æµªè²»ãç® é è¬èª [...] -I æè¦ [...] II ABSTRACT [...] III ç®é [...] V è¡¨ç®é [...] -VIII åç®é [...] -XI ç¬¬ä¸ç«  ç·è« [...] 1 1 - 1 åè¨ [...] 1 1 - 2 ç ç©¶ç®ç [...] 3 ç¬¬äºç«  æç»æ¢è¨ [...] 4 2 - 1 æº¶æ°§éå°é­é¡ä¹å½±é¿ [...] 4 2 - 2 æ°´ä¸­æº¶æ°§ä¹å³è¼¸éç [...] 6 2 - 3 æ°§æ°£éç´æ°§å¸æ¶ç³»çµ± [...] 9 2 - 4 æ°§æ°£éèé¤æ®æ± å©èæ°´ä½é«åº¦å·®ä¹æ¢è¨ [...] - 11 2 - 5 ç´æ°§å¸æ¶è¨­åä¹ç¸éåæ¸ [...] 13 2 - 5 - 1 æ°§æ°£å³è¼¸éç [...] 13 2 - 5 - 2 æ°§æ°£å³è¼¸æç [...] 13 2 - 5 - 3 æ°§æ°£å¸æ¶æç [...] 14 2 - 5 - 4 æ°§æ°£å©ç¨æç [...] 15 2 - 5 - 5 ææ°£æç [...] 15 2 - 6 ç´æ°§å¸æ¶è¨­ååå¼ [...] - 16 2 - 7 ç´æ°§ä¹ä¾æº [...] 20 ç¬¬ä¸ç«  å¯¦é©è¨­åãææèæ¹æ³ [...] 21 3 - 1 è©¦é©è¨­å [...] 21 3 - 1 - 1 å¾ªç°æ°´é¤æ®ç³»çµ±çµæ [...] - 21 3 - 1 - 2 ç´æ°§å¸æ¶ç³»çµ± [...] - 22 3 - 1 - 3 è©¦é©åå¨ [...] - 23 3 - 2 è©¦é©ææ [...] - 25 3 - 3 è©¦é©è¨­è¨ [...] - 26 ç¬¬åç«  çµæèè¨è« [...] 30 4 - 1 æ°§æ°£éå§å£åä¹è®å [...] - 32 4 - 2 æ°§æ°£éå§æ°§æ°£åæ°®æ°£æ¯ä¾ä¹è®å [...] - 35 4 - 3 æ°§æ°£éåºæ°´å£æº¶æ°§éä¹è®å [...] 40 4 - 3 - 1 æ°§æ°£ééè½åæï¼å¶åºæ°´å£æº¶æ°§éä¹è®å [...] - 40 4 - 3 - 2 èª¿ç¯é¥è¨­å®å£åå°æ°§æ°£éåºæ°´å£æº¶æ°§éä¹å½±é¿ [...] - 43 4 - 3 - 3 æ°§æ°£éå¥æ°´å£æµéå°æ°§æ°£éåºæ°´å£æº¶æ°§éä¹å½±é¿ [...] 44 4 - 4 æ°§æ°£éæ°´ä½ä¹è®å [...] - 46 4 - 5 é¤æ®æ± æ°´ä½é«åå¶åºæ°´å£æµéä¹è®å [...] 51 4 - 5 - 1 æ°§æ°£éå¥æ°´å£æµéå°é¤æ®æ± æ°´ä½é«åå¶åºæ°´å£æµéä¹å½±é¿ [...] 51 4 - 5 - 2 èª¿ç¯é¥è¨­å®å£åå°é¤æ®æ± æ°´ä½é«åå¶åºæ°´å£æµéä¹å½±é¿ [...] - 54 4 - 6 æåªå©æ¹ç¨å¼ [...] - 56 4 - 6 - 1 æ°§æ°£éèé¤æ®æ± éä¹æ©æ¦æå¤± [...] - 56 4 - 6 - 2 é¤æ®æ± èæ°§æ°£éå§æ°´ä½å·®é æ¸¬å¼èå¯¦æ¸¬å¼æ¯è¼ä¹çµæ [...] - 58 4 - 7 æ°§æ°£éæ§è½åæ¸ [...] 66 4 - 7 - 1 æ°§æ°£å³è¼¸éçï¼OTRï¼ [...] - 66 4 - 7 - 2 æ°§æ°§å³è¼¸æçï¼TEï¼ [...] 69 4 - 7 - 3 æ°§æ°£å¸æ¶æçï¼AEï¼ [...] - 73 4 - 7 - 4 ææ°£æçï¼Eï¼ [...] 75 4 - 7 - 5 æ°§æ°£å©ç¨æçï¼UEï¼ [...] - 77 4 - 8 é¤æ®æ± æ°´ä¸­æº¶æ°§éä¹æ§å¶ [...] 79 4 - 9 é¤æ®æ± ä¸­å¨æç£æ¸¬éæ¸¬é»æº¶æ°§éèå¹³åæº¶æ°§éä¹å·®ç° [...] 85 ç¬¬äºç«  çµè«èå»ºè­° [...] - 93 ç¬¬å­ç«  åèæç» [...] 97 ééA [...] - 100 ééB [...] - 10...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a model for}} <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> in water distribution networks (WDNs), {{with the aim of}} reducing the level of leakage. The approach is based on the harmony search (HS) optimization algorithm. The HS mimics a jazz improvisation process able to find the best solutions, in this case corresponding to valve settings in a WDN. The model also interfaces with the improved version of a popular hydraulic simulator, EPANET 2. 0, to check the hydraulic constraints and to evaluate the performances of the solutions. Penalties are introduced in the objective function in case of violation of the hydraulic constraints. The model is applied to two case studies, and the obtained results in terms of pressure reductions are comparable with those of competitive metaheuristic algorithms (e. g. genetic algorithms). The results demonstrate the suitability of the HS algorithm for water network management and optimization...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of fuel efficient internal combustion engines (ICE) {{have resulted in}} a variety of different solutions. One of those are the variable valve timing and an implemenation of such is the Continuous Variable Cam Phasing (CVCP). This thesis have used a simulation package, psPack, for the simulation of the gas exchange process for an ICE with CVCP. The purpose of the simulations was to investigate what kind of design parameters, e. g. the length of an intake pipe or the duration of combustion, that were significant for the gas exchange process with the alternation of intake pressure, engine speed and <b>valve</b> <b>setting.</b> The parameters that showed a vast impact were those who affected the amount of residual gas and the temperature of the air charge. Furthermore a validation was made between simulation data acquired from psPack and measured data provided in Heywood (1988). The validation showed that for the general behaviour the simulation results from psPack corresponded well to the measured data...|$|E
40|$|The vortex tube, {{invented by}} G. J. Ranque, {{is a simple}} device which {{separates}} a flow of compressed gas into a hot and a cold stream {{by means of a}} high speed vortex. It may have useful applications as a refrigerator and one of the aims of the present investigation was to widen the field of application by increasing the vortex tube's cooling performance. The tests, described in this report, determined the effect of the hot <b>valve</b> <b>setting,</b> the cold outlet diameter, the inlet nozzle size and the inlet pressure ratios, upon the temperature drop ratio characteristics of a vortex tube. The results show that, by matching the inlet nozzles and cold outlet diameter to the inlet pressure ratio, it is possible to obtain, over a wide pressure range, a temperature drop which is 0. 50 of the isentropic temperature drop. The optimum cold outlet area is almost independent of the inlet pressure, whilst the optimum inlet area decreases as the pressure ratio increases.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of transistors, the earlier ones suitable for audio frequencies only, car radios were <b>valve</b> <b>sets</b> with a transistor output stage; makers promoted them as transistor sets. Some historic car radios badged as transistorised are in reality of this type. All-transistor sets eventually replaced sets with vacuum tube after transistor technology improved and prices fell significantly.|$|R
25|$|Alongside {{these changes}} to the SSA, the company also {{declared}} publicly the incorporation of Valve S.a.r.l., a subsidiary based in Luxembourg. <b>Valve</b> <b>set</b> up a physical office in Luxembourg Kirchberg. According to Valve's project manager Mike Dunkle, the location was chosen for eCommerce capabilities and infrastructure, talent acquisition, tax advantages and central geographic locationâ most major partners are accessible, with 50% within driving distance.|$|R
2500|$|The RAF 1 {{was based}} on the Renault 70/80 hp engine, being {{intended}} specifically to replace that engine in the B.E.2c. It featured larger cylinders (...) for a total displacement of 540 cubic inches (8.8 L). It was rated at 92hp (70kW) at 1,600 rpm. The heads were cast integrally with the cylinders, with the intake and exhaust <b>valves</b> <b>set</b> one above the other in an upside-down F-head configuration.|$|R
