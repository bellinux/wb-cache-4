If the bellows were 'stiff' (resistant to squirm), the shock loading could cause the bellows to tear at pressures below the safety valve setting; it was not impossible that this could occur at pressures experienced during start-up, when pressure was less tightly controlled. (Plant pressures {{at the time of the}} accident were unknown since all relevant instruments and records had been destroyed, and all relevant operators killed).The Inquiry concluded that this ("the 20-inch hypothesis") was 'a probability' but one 'which would readily be displaced if some greater probability' could be found.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hydrocephalus causes {{impaired}} gait, balance, cognition and continence, all {{of which}} can be reversed by shunt treatment. Adjustable valves are commonly used in the shunt treatment of hydrocephalus but randomized controlled trials (RCT) are scarce. The aim of the present thesis was to evaluate adjustable valves in the treatment of hydrocephalus. Patients and Methods: In Study I, 450 hydrocephalus patients undergoing primary shunt insertion were followed over 10 years to investigate the short-term perioperative risk factors of shunt surgery. In Study II the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and ICP wave amplitude (AMP), valve settings and body positions were studied in 15 hydrocephalus patients. During the shunt operation an intraparenchymatous ICP-sensor was simultaneously inserted and ICP/AMP analyzed with the shunt ligated and when opened at different opening pressures and body positions. A double-centered RCT was conducted in studies III and IV, including 68 patients with iNPH. The patients received a ventricular shunt and were randomized into two groups; in one group (20 - 4) the valve was initially set to 20 cm H 2 O and gradually reduced to 4 cm H 2 O {{over the course of the}} 6 month study period. In the other group (12), the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> was kept at a medium level of 12 cm H 2 O during the whole study period. In study III the time to and type of complications and overdrainage symptoms were recorded. In Study IV clinical variables were continuously compared between the two groups. Results: In total, 538 patients were included and the six month shunt revision rate was 19 %. Fifty-four percent of the patients received adjustable valves. Both adjustable valves and right frontal placement of the shunt were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but not independently. ICP and AMP decreased significantly when the shunt was opened but the difference in ICP between the highest and lowest valve settings (in vivo) was smaller than previous measurements in vitro. Gradual reduction of the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> from 20 to 4 cm H 2 O neither improved clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> at 12 cm H 2 O. The clinical improvement was seen within 3 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Gradual reduction of the <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> from a high to a low level neither improved the clinical outcome nor the complication rate, compared to a fixed <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> at medium level. The pressure window in an adjustable valve is narrower in vivo than in vitro. ICP in the upright position is significantly different from the supine position. Right frontal shunt placement and the use of adjustable valves were associated with a lower shunt revision rate, but a coincidence of these two variables was found...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SVC is {{a dynamic}} {{reactive}} compensator based on switching type HV electrical and electronic devices, well recognized as {{an effective means of}} resolving power quality problems. SVC is complex in structure, consisting of TCR <b>valve</b> <b>sets,</b> FC filter channel, etc. In particular, TCR <b>valve</b> <b>set</b> adopts thyristor serial connecting technology, and over 100 thyristors are adopted, which requires real-time status of devices in SVC to be monitored and uploaded, and even failures to be recorded. Therefore, the monitoring software becomes an important part in ensuring SVC safe operation.

40|$|The {{aeration}} cone is {{the main}} equipment of pure oxygen absorption system for the recently domestic used water recirculating culture system. The operational control of the aeration cone which controls the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) value of water outlet and the oxygen transfer rate, is mainly by changing the inlet water flowrate and the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure of pure oxygen. In this study, the temperature of water was maintained at about 30 ℃. When the inlet water flowrate of the aeration cone was controlled between 270 - 330 L/min, the DO value of water outlet would demonstrate a decreasing tendency with the increasing of the inlet water flowrate. When the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure was controlled between 0. 35 - 0. 40 kg/cm 2 (cm square), both of the DO value of water outlet and the oxygen transfer rate would increase as the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure raised. The experimental {{results showed that the}} oxygen transfer rate was between 1. 137 - 1. 647 g/min, the oxygen absorption efficiency was maintained between 72. 4 - 81. 5 %, the oxygen transfer efficiency was between 0. 0681 - 0. 0941 kg/kW-hr, the aeration effectiveness was 60. 67 - 70. 87 %, and the utilization efficiency was maintained between 44. 2 - 58. 7 %. Furthermore, the relative height between positions of the culture tank and the aeration cone can be designed and planned using Bernoulli's equation. The water lever inside the aeration cone would drop as the regulatory <b>valve</b> <b>setting</b> pressure increased and raise as the inlet water flowrate increased. The water level inside the aeration cone must be kept at least over 60 cm to avoid the water level being too low as the undissolved oxygen inside the aeration cone smuggled with the water flow to the culture tank resulting a waste of oxygen leaking to the atmosphere. 目前國內循環水養殖系統中，其純氧吸收系統主要以氧氣錐為主，而氧氣錐在操作控制上，主要是改變其入水口流量與純氧調節閥設定壓力來控制其出水口溶氧量與氧氣傳輸速率。在本研究中，水溫維持在 30 ℃左右，氧氣錐入水口流量控制在 270 - 330 L/min之間時，其出水口溶氧量會隨入水口流量的增加而呈現下降之趨勢，而氧氣傳輸速率則會隨入水口流量之增加而增加。調節閥設定壓力控制在 0. 35 - 0. 40 kg/cm 2 (公斤/平方公分) 之間時，氧氣錐出水口溶氧量與其氧氣傳輸速率，均會隨著調節閥設定壓力之增加而增加。本試驗結果顯示，氧氣錐之氧氣傳輸速率在 1. 137 - 1. 647 g/min之間，氧氣吸收效率維持在 72. 4 - 81. 5 ﹪之間，氧氣傳輸效率在 0. 0681 - 0. 0941 kg/kW-hr之間，曝氣效率在 60. 67 - 70. 87 ﹪之間，氧氣利用效率則維持在 44. 2 - 58. 7 ﹪之間。 此外，養殖池與氧氣錐兩者之相對高度位置，可藉由柏努利方程式來加以設計規劃。其氧氣錐內水位離錐底之高度會隨著調節閥設定壓力之增加而下降，隨入水口流量之增加而提高，而氧氣錐內水位離錐底之高度至少須保持在 60 cm以上，以避免氧氣錐內水位過低，造成氧氣錐內未溶解之氧氣，夾帶在水流中，從養殖池洩出至大氣中，造成氧氣之浪費。目 錄 謝誌 [...] -I 摘要 [...] II ABSTRACT [...] III 目錄 [...] V 表目錄 [...] -VIII 圖目錄 [...] -XI 第一章 緒論 [...] 1 1 - 1 前言 [...] 1 1 - 2 研究目的 [...] 3 第二章 文獻探討 [...] 4 2 - 1 溶氧量對魚類之影響 [...] 4 2 - 2 水中溶氧之傳輸速率 [...] 6 2 - 3 氧氣錐純氧吸收系統 [...] 9 2 - 4 氧氣錐與養殖池兩者水位高度差之探討 [...] - 11 2 - 5 純氧吸收設備之相關參數 [...] 13 2 - 5 - 1 氧氣傳輸速率 [...] 13 2 - 5 - 2 氧氣傳輸效率 [...] 13 2 - 5 - 3 氧氣吸收效率 [...] 14 2 - 5 - 4 氧氣利用效率 [...] 15 2 - 5 - 5 曝氣效率 [...] 15 2 - 6 純氧吸收設備型式 [...] - 16 2 - 7 純氧之來源 [...] 20 第三章 實驗設備、材料與方法 [...] 21 3 - 1 試驗設備 [...] 21 3 - 1 - 1 循環水養殖系統組成 [...] - 21 3 - 1 - 2 純氧吸收系統 [...] - 22 3 - 1 - 3 試驗儀器 [...] - 23 3 - 2 試驗材料 [...] - 25 3 - 3 試驗設計 [...] - 26 第四章 結果與討論 [...] 30 4 - 1 氧氣錐內壓力之變化 [...] - 32 4 - 2 氧氣錐內氧氣及氮氣比例之變化 [...] - 35 4 - 3 氧氣錐出水口溶氧量之變化 [...] 40 4 - 3 - 1 氧氣錐運轉初期，其出水口溶氧量之變化 [...] - 40 4 - 3 - 2 調節閥設定壓力對氧氣錐出水口溶氧量之影響 [...] - 43 4 - 3 - 3 氧氣錐入水口流量對氧氣錐出水口溶氧量之影響 [...] 44 4 - 4 氧氣錐水位之變化 [...] - 46 4 - 5 養殖池水位高及其出水口流量之變化 [...] 51 4 - 5 - 1 氧氣錐入水口流量對養殖池水位高及其出水口流量之影響 [...] 51 4 - 5 - 2 調節閥設定壓力對養殖池水位高及其出水口流量之影響 [...] - 54 4 - 6 柏努利方程式 [...] - 56 4 - 6 - 1 氧氣錐與養殖池間之摩擦損失 [...] - 56 4 - 6 - 2 養殖池與氧氣錐內水位差預測值與實測值比較之結果 [...] - 58 4 - 7 氧氣錐性能參數 [...] 66 4 - 7 - 1 氧氣傳輸速率（OTR） [...] - 66 4 - 7 - 2 氧氧傳輸效率（TE） [...] 69 4 - 7 - 3 氧氣吸收效率（AE） [...] - 73 4 - 7 - 4 曝氣效率（E） [...] 75 4 - 7 - 5 氧氣利用效率（UE） [...] - 77 4 - 8 養殖池水中溶氧量之控制 [...] 79 4 - 9 養殖池中全時監測量測點溶氧量與平均溶氧量之差異 [...] 85 第五章 結論與建議 [...] - 93 第六章 參考文獻 [...] 97 附錄A [...] - 100 附錄B [...] - 10...|$|E
