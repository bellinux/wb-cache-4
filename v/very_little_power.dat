5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante {{justice and the}} Montana Vigilantes began in 1863 in what {{was at the time}} a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. Vigilantism arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar is a semi-presidential {{representative}} democratic multi-party republic, {{wherein the}} popularly elected {{president is the}} head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power,</b> allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E

25|$|ARM {{chips are}} also used in Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, BeagleBone, PandaBoard and other single-board computers, because they are very small, {{inexpensive}} and consume <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the method}} of {{coupling}} two complementary MOSFETS (P-channel and N-channel) into one high/low switch, known as CMOS, means that digital circuits dissipate <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> except when actually switched.|$|E
25|$|So-called quartz analog {{wristwatches}} {{contain the}} smallest commonplace stepping motors; {{they have one}} coil, draw <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power,</b> and have a PM rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepping motor.|$|E
5000|$|Because LEDs consume <b>very</b> <b>little</b> electricity, <b>power</b> over Ethernet (PoE) {{and power}} over RS232 {{can be used}} in {{conjunction}} with UPS power located in wiring closets to keep these devices functioning for a significant period of time during a general power outage in a building.|$|R
40|$|The pneumococci {{hitherto}} {{known as}} Group IV have been separated into ten types {{which have been}} designated by Roman numerals from IV to XIII. These have been correlated {{as far as possible}} with the types described by others. The prevalence and mortality of cases due to each type have been estimated in the limited number of cases studied. Laboratory tests indicated that therapeutic antiserums for Types I, II and III have <b>very</b> <b>little</b> protective <b>power</b> against the recently separated types. Monovalent antiserums of high agglutinative and protective power were prepared in rabbits for each type. Several monovalent antiserums each specific for a type, which are suitable for agglutination and experimental therapeutic use, have been obtained by immunizing horses. An antiserum prepared for one type had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> cross-protective <b>power</b> against other types...|$|R

Unlike earlier designs, the overlap between the acoustic and optical waves is complete, so <b>very</b> <b>little</b> acoustic <b>power</b> is required. Maximum coupling in an experimental device was attained for an electrical drive power of just 0. 5 mW...|$|R
25|$|Traditional Duala {{society was}} divided into three strata. At the top were the Wonja, native Duala, with full rights of land ownership. The next tier {{consisted}} of the Wajili, either non-Duala peoples or the descendants of slaves. Finally, the Wakomi, or slaves, made up the bottom rung. Chiefs and headmen sat {{at the pinnacle of}} this hierarchy in the past, though today such figures have <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> in their own right. Instead, such individuals are more likely to own property and to have inherited wealth. Councils of elders and secret societies allow communities to decide important issues.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, after {{announcing the}} {{abolition}} of serfdom, peasants acquired civil rights, among them a right to self-governmence. To facilitate such a right townships (Russian: volost, Lithuanian: valsčius) and elderates (Russian: mir, Lithuanian: seniūnija) were established. By the end of 1861 there were 1,479 elderates in 181 townships of Vilna Governorate and 1,033 elderates in 153 townships of Kovno Governorate. The elderates would elect an elder (Russian: starosta, Lithuanian: seniūnas) and representatives to a township council (Lithuanian: valsčiaus sueiga). However, these institutions had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> and were dependent on the local nobles. The power was concentrated {{in the hands of}} governors, all of whom were appointed by the tsar.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, {{the money}} earned by these {{electric}} trams exceeded {{the cost to}} maintain the trams. Furthermore, the electric trams were used whenever the horse-drawn or steam-powered trams had difficulty. Nevertheless, the system's horse-drawn trams were in use until 1895, and the last steam-powered cars ran until 1904, when a diesel electric station, on the so-called Dachnaya (Dachna) to Puschya-Vodytsia line was built. This station had lasted until the 1930s. These trams required <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power,</b> which caused any electric trams, which used the line, to move so slowly that the passengers could get {{on and off the}} tram, while the tram remained in motion.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to investigate, using Monte Carlo methods, whether Hall’s (2000) {{centered}} test of overidentifying restrictions for parameters estimated by Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is more powerful, once the test is size-adjusted, than the standard test introduced by Hansen (1982). The Monte Carlo evidence shows that <b>very</b> <b>little</b> size-adjusted <b>power</b> is gained over the standard uncentered calculation...|$|R
25|$|As {{oversize}} wooden racquets have {{a strong}} tendency to warp and also lack solidity when produced at a playable weight, only one was produced, the Prince Woodie, which had many layers of graphite to improve its stability. That racquet was used successfully by male and female professionals, such as Gabriela Sabatini and professionals in development, such as Tommy Haas. Although it offered <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power,</b> when compared with a graphite racquet, due to its flexibility, it absorbed ball shock well due to its wood construction, making it an excellent racquet for training. Similarly, fiberglass was quite flexible, like wood. The desire for more power led to graphite eventually completely displacing fiberglass, although graphite racquets with approximately 20% fiberglass were produced long after 100% fiberglass racquets disappeared from the market.|$|E
25|$|As of 4 January, {{there is}} almost total {{blackout}} in Gaza City, North Gaza, Middle Area and Khan Yunis. 90% of the telephone network, including both cellular service and land lines, is down, since it depends on backup generators with dwindling fuel stocks. Since the Israeli ground operation, 75% of Gaza's electricity has been cut off and the Palestinian technicians face difficulties reaching damaged lines because of the military attacks. As of 7 January, much {{of the population of}} the Gaza Strip continues to live without electricity. By 16 January, the twenty first day of the attacks, most households still do not have any electricity. As of 22 January, twenty five days after the beginnings of the attacks, 40 percent of the 1.5 million population remains without electricity. The remaining 60 percent receive only intermittent supply that can reach only 6 hours per day in the north of the Gaza strip. Spare parts and other equipments are a priority. After 8 days of the ceasefire, a month since the beginning of the attacks, the power plant is working on only one turbine, producing 30 MW instead of the daily full capacity of 80 MW cause of the lack of industrial fuel. By 29 January, the electricity situation has returned to its pre-27 December status, with much of the Gaza strip receiving only intermittent electricity. Certain areas are receiving <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> as a result or some low-voltage lines breakage. In order to meet demand throughout the territory, GEDCO (Gaza Electricity Distribution Co.) has put in place a power cut schedule where Gaza and North Gaza will face power cuts of eight hours three times a week; and the Middle Area and Khan Yunis will face power cuts of 6–8 hours twice per week. Those cuts does include unintentional power cuts.|$|E
500|$|While this {{administrative}} structure was decreed {{by a government}} anxious to deal with [...] interlocutors, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance. Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy. It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian anthropologist Paolo Palmeri, {{the leader of the}} village has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics are inextricably linked to religion, the real holders of power are the fetish priests. The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: it might be more appropriately considered a clan or an aggregation of kinship. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of mound-building termites, in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable.|$|E
50|$|The PCX {{compression}} algorithm requires <b>very</b> <b>little</b> processor <b>power</b> or memory to apply, a significant {{concern with the}} computer systems when it was designed. As computers and display hardware grow more sophisticated, the PCX algorithm becomes less space-efficient. Compression algorithms used by newer image formats are more efficient when compressing images such as photographs, and dithered or otherwise complex graphics.|$|R

500|$|The Supreme Soviet was {{the highest}} organ of state power, and was the sole organ to hold {{legislative}} power in the Soviet Union. Sessions of the Supreme Soviet were convened by the Presidium twice a year; however, special sessions could be convened on the orders of a Union Republic. In {{the event of a}} disagreement between the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities the Presidium could form a conciliation commission. If this commission failed the Presidium could dissolve the Supreme Soviet and order new elections. The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, along with the first and fifteen other vice chairmen, were, according to the 1977 Soviet Constitution, elected by the deputies of the Supreme Soviet. Just as with the CEC under Joseph Stalin's rule, the Chairman of the Presidium had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> [...] because supreme power was {{in the hands of the}} General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).|$|E
2500|$|Modern dimmers {{are built}} from {{semiconductors}} instead of variable resistors, {{because they have}} higher efficiency. A variable resistor would dissipate power as heat and acts as a voltage divider. Since semiconductor or solid-state dimmers switch quickly between a low resistance [...] "on" [...] state and a high resistance [...] "off" [...] state, they dissipate <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> compared with the controlled load.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{effective}} CMGs include {{only a single}} gimbal. [...] When the gimbal of such a CMG rotates, the change in direction of the rotor's angular momentum represents a torque that reacts onto the body to which the CMG is mounted, e.g. a spacecraft. [...] Except for effects due to {{the motion of the}} spacecraft, this torque is due to a constraint, so it does no mechanical work (i.e., requires no energy). [...] Single-gimbal CMGs exchange angular momentum in a way that requires <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power,</b> with the result that they can apply very large torques for minimal electrical input.|$|E
2500|$|Near-field or nonradiative region – This {{means the}} area within about 1 {{wavelength}} (λ) of the antenna. In this region the oscillating electric and magnetic fields are separate and {{power can be}} transferred via electric fields by capacitive coupling (electrostatic induction) between metal electrodes, or via magnetic fields by inductive coupling (electromagnetic induction) between coils of wire. These fields are not radiative, meaning the energy stays within a short distance of the transmitter. If there is no receiving device or absorbing material within their limited range to [...] "couple" [...] to, no power leaves the transmitter. The range of these fields is short, and depends on {{the size and shape}} of the [...] "antenna" [...] devices, which are usually coils of wire. The fields, and thus the power transmitted, decrease exponentially with distance, so if the distance between the two [...] "antennas" [...] Drange is much larger than the diameter of the [...] "antennas" [...] Dant <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> will be received. [...] Therefore, these techniques cannot be used for long range power transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Far-field or {{radiative}} region – Beyond about 1 wavelength (λ) of the antenna, {{the electric}} and magnetic fields are perpendicular {{to each other}} and propagate as an electromagnetic wave; examples are radio waves, microwaves, or light waves. [...] This part of the energy is radiative, meaning it leaves the antenna {{whether or not there is}} a receiver to absorb it. [...] The portion of energy which does not strike the receiving antenna is dissipated and lost to the system. The amount of power emitted as electromagnetic waves by an antenna depends on the ratio of the antenna's size Dant to the wavelength of the waves λ, which is determined by the frequency: λ=c/f. [...] At low frequencies f where the antenna is much smaller than the size of the waves, Dant<<nbsp&λ, <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> is radiated. [...] Therefore the near-field devices above, which use lower frequencies, radiate almost none of their energy as electromagnetic radiation. [...] Antennas about the same size as the wavelength [...] Dantnbsp&≈nbsp&λ [...] such as monopole or dipole antennas, [...] radiate power efficiently, but the electromagnetic waves are radiated in all directions (omnidirectionally), so if the receiving antenna is far away, only a small amount of the radiation will hit it. [...] Therefore, these can be used for short range, inefficient power transmission but not for long range transmission.|$|E
