40|$|We {{investigate}} the etching of a pure hydrogen plasma on graphite samples and graphene flakes on SiO$_ 2 $ and hexagonal Boron-Nitride (hBN) substrates. The pressure and distance {{dependence of the}} graphite exposure experiments reveals the existence of two distinct plasma regimes: the direct and the remote plasma regime. Graphite surfaces exposed directly to the hydrogen plasma exhibit numerous etch pits of various size and depth, indicating continuous defect creation throughout the etching process. In contrast, <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> forming regular and symmetric hexagons starting only from preexisting defects and edges {{is seen in the}} remote plasma regime, where the sample is located downstream, outside of the glowing plasma. This regime is possible in a narrow window of parameters where essentially all ions have already recombined, yet a flux of H-radicals performing <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> is still present. At the required process pressures, the radicals can recombine only on surfaces, not in the gas itself.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{isotropic}} dry {{plasma etching}} {{was used to}} release the suspended SiO 2 microcantilever from the substrate of SOI wafer. Employing the plasma dry etching technique, the frontside etching for the SiO 2 microcantilever release is done using the Oxford Plasmalab System 100. To obtain the optimum condition for the microcantilever release using the plasma etcher, the etching parameters involved are 100 sccm of SF 6 flow, 2000 W of capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) power, 3 W of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) power, 20 ºC of etching temperature and 30 mTorr chamber pressure. The optimum parameters yield lateral etch rate of about 5 μm/min and vertical etch rate of about 8 μm/min. Two etching methods have been considered in this study. The first method employs only the isotropic etching to realize the microcantilever release while the second method utilizes both the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> and the isotropic etching. For the second method, the process starts with the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> from the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) system which is then followed by the isotropic etching to complete the microcantilever releasing process.

Wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching,</b> which is low cost and best suitable for batch process, is a well-established technique in silicon bulk micromachining [1 – 8]. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) are most commonly used etchant in wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> [9 – 17]. In wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching,</b> the sidewalls of the stable etched profile are formed by { 111 } planes.

The exposure of the number of { 111 } planes and their angle with wafer surface during etching depend on the orientation of wafer surface. In the case of Si{ 100 } wafer, four { 111 } planes emerge during etching along 〈 110 〉 directions and make an angle of 54.7 ° with wafer surface, while on Si{ 110 } wafer { 111 } planes expose along six directions in which two slanted (35.3 °) at 〈 110 〉 directions and four perpendicular at 〈 112 〉 directions [2, 18].

30|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, in wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> {{the circular}} mask openings on { 111 } surface take the hexagonal shape with sharp corners. Figure  5 shows the optical images of mask pattern in oxide layer and the etched profile with 3  µm depth after wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching.</b> As Si{ 111 } is a slowest etch rate plane in wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching,</b> {{there is an}} obvious question about the formation of hexagon pattern {{on the surface of}} Si{ 111 } wafer if only wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> is used. In other words, how does hexagonal shape develop on wet etching of a circular pattern on Si{ 111 } surface? There are two ways to explain the formation of hexagon pattern on the etching of a circular pattern. First explanation is based on the off-axis cut of silicon surface. It is not possible to get the wafer surface perfectly parallel to the crystal orientation. Commercial standard wafers usually are cut[*]±[*] 0.5 off-axis. Although the wafers of more precise orientation can be ordered, these can never be cut perfectly parallel to crystal orientation at the atomic scale. So when the circular pattern is etched in wet anisotropic etchant, crystal planes other than { 111 } orientation expose at the mask edges that lead to lateral etching under the mask layer and proceed till it finds the 〈 110 〉 directions where { 111 } planes appear. The lateral undercutting under the mask layer of circular pattern results in hexagon shape pattern. In the second case, if the surface of silicon wafer is perfectly parallel to { 111 } crystal orientation, how will hexagon shape form on the etching of circular mask pattern? In this situation, removal of the first layer of surface atoms will expose non-{ 111 } planes at the mask edge of the circle that will result in lateral etching. The lateral etching will end up when it encounters { 111 } planes which appear at 〈 110 〉 directions and these directions form hexagon shape on { 111 } surface.|$|R

30|$|Wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> based silicon {{micromachining}} {{is an important}} technique to fabricate freestanding (e.g. cantilever) and fixed (e.g. cavity) structures on different orientation silicon wafers for various applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). { 111 } planes are the slowest etch rate plane {{in all kinds of}} anisotropic etchants and therefore, a prolonged etching always leads to the appearance of { 111 } facets at the sidewalls of the fabricated structures. In wet <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching,</b> undercutting occurs at the extruded corners and the curved edges of the mask patterns on the wafer surface. The rate of undercutting depends upon the type of etchant and the shape of mask edges and corners.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a new way to}} micromachine h 111 i oriented plates on h 001 i silicon wafers by <b>anisotropic</b> wet chemical <b>etching.</b> The process involves double-sided wafer-processing. Precision alignment, however, is only required at one side. There are basically two ways to etch silicon: dry and wet chemical etching. In micromachining, the control of the shape of the structure is accomplished by <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> through mask openings. The anisotropy of wet chemical etching is related to the crystal structure of silicon, while that of dry etching stems from the momentum of ions impinging the substrate. The latter gives us much more freedom of design, however, the control of dry etching is much more cumbersome and the equipment much more expensive. Therefore, any new process trick {{to increase the number of}} geometries that can be obtained by wet chemical <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> is of interest. In this paper, techniques are demonstrated to etch thin f 111 g plates in h 100 i silicon. These plates can be used as building blocks in, for example, microfluidic systems for valves and pumps.
