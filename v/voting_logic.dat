40|$|Although often ignored, the {{variation}} of risk attitudes across individuals may have strong implications for democratic representation. I investigate {{the effect of}} risk attitudes {{on the behavior of}} voters and representatives. This work is divided into four papers. The first paper investigates the effect of risk attitudes on the likelihood of voting for a new party in multiparty systems. Using the Swiss case, where two new parties appeared on the political scene, I show that risk aversion decreases the likelihood of voting for a new party. Given that risk aversion is negatively correlated with right ideology, new party entry may be more difficult on the right. Consequently, rightist parties may feel less pressure to adapt to changes in voters preferences than leftist parties. In the second paper, I argue that existing work presents gaps in empirical evidence of strategic voting driven by the wasted <b>vote</b> <b>logic.</b> Testing if risk attitudes affect strategic voting can bring additional evidence of the wasted <b>vote</b> <b>logic.</b> Analyzing survey data from the UK, Canada, and Germany, I find that risk-averse voters are less likely to vote strategically than risk-acceptant ones. Thus, given the correlation between risk and ideology, strategic voting may be stronger on the left, meaning that representation may be more proportional on the right than on the left. In the third paper, I use a new dataset that combines a survey measuring risk propensity of Swiss legislators and their votes, and find that risk propensity has an effect on legislative voting. However, as this effect is mediated by ideology, risk does not have particular implications for representation here. In the fourth paper, I discuss if the heterogeneity of risk preferences should be taken into account in spatial models of parliamentary voting. I suggest three different ways to do so. First, legislators' utility function can have different shapes. Second, one can allow for the status quo bias to be stronger among more risk-averse legislators. Third, risk aversion could affect the predictability of legislators' behavior. The results suggest that relaxing the assumption of similar risk preferences does not appreciably impact the estimation of ideal points...|$|R

Of course, we do not know if the person looking for information on Wikipedia will actually turn out and vote.

40|$|Issue {{importance}} mediates {{the impact}} of public policy issues on electoral decisions (Krosnick, 1988, 1990).

The analysis demonstrates that there is a significant interaction between performance evaluations and issue importance. People concerned about an issue assign more weight to their evaluations of the government on that issue when making up their mind. Issue importance is a significant mediator of issue voting (Krosnick 1988, 1990). The impact of various policy attitudes on candidate appraisal and vote choice is stronger among those individuals who feel that the issue in question is important. Although this interaction has large implications for our estimates of issue voting and our understanding of voting behavior, it has received little attention since the publication of Krosnick’s studies.

30|$|Literature {{shows how}} access {{to land and}} regime type (whether {{democratic}} or authoritarian) {{has become part of}} distributive politics and clientilism in the housing of urban low-income groups in recent years. The use of land as ‘bait’, through election promises is well-documented (for example, Boone 2013). After the elections, the poor residents become subject to precariousness because there is no security of tenure guaranteed to them. The poor often collaborate to mobilize resources instrumental for their self-help projects housing included. With reference to India, the Ministry of Agriculture (2009 :iv) has argued that, “… the cooperative ability not only to help survival of the people but also of indirectly forcing the market to behave.” The cooperative approach by poor households hinges of the needs and aspirations of the members, a factor which makes them strong (internally) (Shankar 2002). Nevertheless, where cooperatives have existed, the political processes obtaining in their context usually control their influence. They are often apron-tied to the agenda of government. As observed by Birchall (2003 :ix), in the developing world, cooperatives “… have often been used as tools of development by governments that have not allowed them to become fully autonomous, member-owned businesses.” Indeed, there may be internal democracy in a cooperative but the politicians tend to try to exploit this internal strength of the cooperative to their advantage hence the imminence of a clientistic <b>logic.</b> <b>Vote</b> buying, patronage, and machine politics often define this logic.|$|R
5000|$|Reliability can be {{increased}} by using [...] "1oo2" [...] (1 out of 2) redundancy at a part or system level. However, if both redundant elements disagree {{it can be difficult}} to know which is to be relied upon. In the previous train signalling example this could lead to lower safety levels as there are more possibilities for allowing [...] "wrong side" [...] or other undetected dangerous failures. Fault tolerant systems often rely on additional redundancy (e.g. 2oo3 <b>voting</b> <b>logic)</b> where multiple redundant elements must agree on a potentially unsage action before it is performed. This increases both reliability and safety at a system level and is often used for so-called [...] "operational" [...] or [...] "mission" [...] systems. This is common practice in Aerospace systems that need continued availability and do not have a fail-safe mode. For example, aircraft may use triple modular redundancy for flight computers and control surfaces (including occasionally different modes of operation e.g. electrical/mechanical/hydraulic) as these need to always be operational, due to the fact that there are no [...] "safe" [...] default positions for control surfaces such as rudders or ailerons when the aircraft is flying.|$|E
50|$|Soft {{errors in}} logic {{circuits}} are sometimes detected and corrected using {{the techniques of}} fault tolerant design. These often {{include the use of}} redundant circuitry or computation of data, and typically come at the cost of circuit area, decreased performance, and/or higher power consumption. The concept of triple modular redundancy (TMR) can be employed to ensure very high soft-error reliability in logic circuits. In this technique, three identical copies of a circuit compute on the same data in parallel and outputs are fed into majority <b>voting</b> <b>logic,</b> returning the value that occurred in at least two of three cases. In this way, the failure of one circuit due to soft error is discarded assuming the other two circuits operated correctly. In practice, however, few designers can afford the greater than 200% circuit area and power overhead required, so it is usually only selectively applied. Another common concept to correct soft errors in logic circuits is temporal (or time) redundancy, in which one circuit operates on the same data multiple times and compares subsequent evaluations for consistency. This approach, however, often incurs performance overhead, area overhead (if copies of latches are used to store data), and power overhead, though is considerably more area-efficient than modular redundancy.|$|E

Didactics requires a mindset that is sensitive to empirical observation which is not what mathematicians are basically trained for. When mathematicians deal with empirical issues then problems arise in general. The stock market crash in 2008 was caused by many factors, including mismanagement by bank managers and failing regulation, but also by mathematicians and ‘rocket scientists’ mistaking abstract models for reality (Mandelbrot & Taleb 2009). Another failure arises in the modelling of the economics of the environment where an influx of mathematical approaches causes too much emphasis on elegant form and easy notions of risk but insufficient attention to reality, statistics and real risk (Tinbergen & Hueting 1991). Errors by mathematicians on realistic assumptions have important consequences for civic discourse and democracy as well (Colignatus 2007). The failure in math education is only one example in a whole range. The discussion of mathematics in this book can be understood by anyone with a decent command of highschool mathematics.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} understand the distributive strategies of local politicians in India, {{a context in which}} a robust secret ballot is in place and villagers have information on the allocation of selective state benefits due to the high information context of village politics. Specifically, it seeks answers to three questions. Can local politicians in India identity voters' partisan preferences, which is a critical assumption of theory on clientelism in comparative politics? Does a context in which citizens {{have a great deal of}} information on the beneficiaries of programs implemented by local governments and villagers and politicians are personally tied to one another pose constraints on targeting strategies relative to work on clientelism, elite capture, and citizen candidate models that predict co ethnic targeting preferences? And do voters perceive that co partisanship vis a vis sarpanch affects their access to selective state benefits and services? To address these questions, I draw on a unique original survey of village council presidents (sarpanch) and citizens across 96 village council areas (gram panchayats) in Rajasthan, India. First, I argue that under a secret ballot, which voters overwhelmingly believe to protect the anonymity of their <b>votes,</b> the clientelistic <b>logic</b> that supports quid pro quo distributive politics does not hold. This has powerful implications for the role we should understand local leaders (who perform brokerage functions) to serve and whom we should expect sarpanch to target with antipoverty benefits implemented through the gram panchayat. I argue that if local politicians cannot identify the partisan preferences of uncertain voters, we should expect local politicians to target benefits in order to maintain their political constituencies, rather than pursuing a vote buying strategy to attract new supporters through a quid pro quo strategy. Second, I argue that the social and political context of the gram panchayat severely constrains sarpanch targeting behavior. In a context in which sarpanch and voters know each other and the latter can directly (or by rumor) observe who received visible and coveted selective benefits, and in which sarpanch and their kin are very likely to live in their village permanently, there is a powerful social cost to providing benefits to the non poor. At the same time, citizens accept that local elections have consequences, which means that some favoritism toward supporters, but not kinship or ethnic lines, is tolerated as long as the pro poor targeting norm is heeded. Finally, I check the validity of my argument on sarpanch distributive strategies by testing for the effect of co partisanship on voters' expectations of receiving selective benefits using a vignette experiment. I randomize partisan cues (Congress or BJP) based on prominent politicians identified by respondents themselves and find support for the claim that partisanship broadly affects access to state benefits. Empirically, I draw on a unique survey of sarpanch and voters across rural Rajasthan. The survey includes two behavioral measures that cross-reference voters within sarpanch surveys. I ask sarpanch to guess sampled voters' partisan preferences and ask them to allocate tokens across these individuals to affect a lottery with a cash prize. I also embed a survey experiment within the voter survey...|$|R
40|$|Subject: The {{education}} in mathematics, its failure and costs, {{and how to}} redesign this market. The political economy of mathematics education. Method: We do not require statistics to show that mathematics education fails but {{can look at the}} math itself. Criticism on mathematics itself can only succeed if it results into better mathematics. Similarly for the didactics of mathematics. Proof is provided that the mathematics that is taught often is cumbersome and illogical. It is rather impossible to provide good didactics on what is inherently illogical. Basic observations: We would presume that school mathematics would be clear and didactically effective. A closer look shows that it is cumbersome and illogical. (1) This is illustrated here with some twenty examples from a larger stock of potential topics. (2) It appears possible to formulate additional shopping lists for improvement on both content and didactic method. (3) Improvements appear possible with respect to mathematics itself, on <b>logic,</b> <b>voting</b> theory, trigonometry and calculus. The latter two improvements directly originate from a didactic approach and it is amazing that they have not been noted earlier by conventional mathematics. (4) What is called mathematics thus is not really mathematics. Pupils and students are psychologically tortured and withheld from proper mathematical insight and competence. Spatial sense and understanding, algebraic sense and competence, logical sense and the competence in reasoning, they all are hindered and obstructed. Mathematics forms a core element in education and destroys much of school life of pupils and students in their formative years. Basic analysis: This situation arises not because it is only school math, where mathematics must be simpler of necessity, but it arises because of the failure of mathematicians to deliver. The failure can be traced to a deep rooted tradition and culture in mathematics. Didactics requires a mindset that is sensitive to empirical observation which is not what mathematicians are trained for. Psychology will {{play a role in the}} filtering out of those students who will later become mathematicians. Their tradition and culture conditions mathematicians to see what they are conditioned to see. Higher order observations: When mathematicians deal with empirical issues then problems arise in general. The failure in education is only one example in a whole range. The stock market crash in 2008 was caused by many factors, including mismanagement by bank managers and failing regulation, but also by mathematicians and “rocket scientists” mistaking abstract models for reality (Mandelbrot & Taleb 2009). Another failure arises in the modelling of the economics of the environment where an influx of mathematical approaches causes too much emphasis on elegant form and easy notions of risk and insufficient attention to reality, statistics and real risk (Tinbergen & Hueting 1991). Improvements in mathematics itself appear possible in <b>logic</b> and <b>voting</b> theory, with consequences for civic discourse and democracy, where the inspiration for the improvement comes from realism (Colignatus 2007). Economics as a science suffers from bad math and the maltreatment of its students – and most likely this is also true for the other sciences. Professors and teachers of mathematics – or at least 99. 9 % of them – apparently cannot diagnose their collective failure themselves and apparently ‘blame the victims’ for not understanding mathematics. The other scientific professions are advised to verify these points. Higher order analysis: Application of economic theory helps to understand that the markets for education and ideas tend to be characterized by monopolistic competition and natural monopolies. Regulations are important. Apparently the industry of mathematics education currently is not adequately regulated. The regulation of financial markets is a hot topic nowadays but the persistent failure of mathematics education would rather be high on the list as well. It will be important to let the industry become more open to society. Without adjustment of regulations at the macro-level it is rather useless to try to improve mathematics education and didactics at the micro level. Mathematical tradition and culture creates a mindset, and mathematicians are like lemmings that are set to go into one direction. Trying to micro-manage change with some particular lemmings will not help in any way. An example layout is provided how the industry could be regulated. Conundrum: Mathematicians might be the first to recognize the improvements in mathematics and didactics presented here. Mathematical tradition clearly is an improvement from alchemy and astrology. Most people will also tend to let the professors and teachers decide on whether these items are improvements indeed. It is tempting to conclude that the system then works: an improvement is proposed, it is recognized, and eventually will be implemented. This approach however takes a risk with respect to potential future changes. With the present failure and analysis on the cause we should rather be wary of that risk. We better regulate the industry of mathematics {{education in}} robust manner. The mathematical examples presented here can be understood in principle by anyone with a highschool level of mathematics. They are targetted to explain didactically to a large audience how big the failure in the education in mathematics actually is. Advice: The economic consequences are huge. National parliaments are advised to do something about this, starting with an enquiry. Parents are advised to write their representative. The professional associations of mathematics and economics are advised to write their parliament in support of that enquiry. ...|$|R

While core-level DMR and TMR {{have been shown to be}} effective when errors are rare, a large amount of core-level redundancy will be required for attaining system reliability goals in face of high error rates. This makes voting latency and bandwidth significant performance bottlenecks for such systems. In this paper, we present a scalable NMR framework for error prone chip multiprocessors(CMPs). The framework supports in-network fault tolerance where <b>voting</b> <b>logic</b> is integrated into routers to allow for truly distributed voting. The in-network fault tolerance router utilizes the expected redundancy in vote messages, to reduce some of the blocking overhead incurred at the leader, and also provide a mechanism to trade-off network bandwidth with latency. Our framework also supports proactive checkpoint deallocation which allows cores participating in voting to continue on with execution instead of waiting on notification from the <b>voting</b> <b>logic.</b> Finally, the framework supports dynamic constitution that allows an arbitrary core on this chip to be a part of an NMR group. This allows bypassing faulty cores as well as scheduling for performance. Our experiments show significant performance/bandwidth benefits from these optimizations...|$|E
