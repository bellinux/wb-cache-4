5|$|Chesbro was {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 balloting by the Veterans Committee, which considers individuals who are eligible for the Hall of Fame, but no longer eligible to be elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). That year, the Veterans Committee elected eleven players: Chesbro, Jesse Burkett, Frank Chance, Johnny Evers, Clark Griffith, Tommy McCarthy, Joe McGinnity, Eddie Plank, Joe Tinker, Rube Waddell, and Ed Walsh. During years where Chesbro was eligible on the BBWAA ballot, Chesbro received zero <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1936 balloting, one vote in the 1937 balloting, two <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1938 balloting, and six <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1939 balloting, zero <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1942 balloting, and zero <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1945 balloting.|$|E

30|$|Here, we {{consider}} elections for U.S. President {{and members of}} Congress. There is a consistent pattern of higher voter turnout in Presidential election years (2004, 2008, etc.) than in years when there are only Congressional elections (2002, 2006, etc.). Assume that those who <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> a given Congressional election year also <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous Presidential election. Then, data on <b>voting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediately past Congressional election {{can be used to}} classify persons by three <b>voting</b> statuses: <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last (Congressional) election (L), did not <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last election but voted within the last 4  years (P), and has not <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last 4  years (N).|$|R

5|$|Another pet project Johnson {{supported}} {{was prompted}} by his friendship with John Cleves Symmes, Jr., who proposed that the Earth was hollow. In 1823, Johnson proposed in the Senate that the government fund an expedition {{to the center of}} the Earth.

5|$|Georgia's jury <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand Final {{were all}} {{declared}} invalid, {{as all the}} jury members had voted exactly the same from 3 points up to 12 points.

5|$|Within {{six months}} of his election, Patton instituted the state's first mandatory, county-wide garbage {{collection}} program, to combat illegal garbage dumping, which was rampant in the county. The program won Patton statewide acclaim. When Patton sought re-election in 1985, he again faced Rutherford in the Democratic primary. Rutherford campaigned against the garbage-collection program, promising to repeal it if elected. This stance may have hurt him, because although some county residents resented the mandatory fee for garbage pick-up, many more recognized the benefits, as illegal dump sites became less common. Patton won the primary again, {{and went on to}} re-election. However, he won both races by much smaller margins than in 1981 (2,524 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary and 3,916 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election).|$|E

5|$|After Southern Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, allowing him to win the election. Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from baseball, Grove {{continued to work}} with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning. Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1958 balloting (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the 1960 balloting (2.6% of the required votes needed).|$|E
5|$|As was {{usual in}} California at the time, both Nixon and Voorhis cross-filed {{in the other}} party's primary, a {{practice}} Voorhis had long adopted.

Nixon gained momentum, however, when the newspapers pointed out that Voorhis's total percentage of the vote had decreased from 60% in 1944 to 53.5%.|$|E

Between the election and the legislative session, Breckinridge formed a new law partnership with Owsley's former Secretary of State, George B. Kinkead; his previous partner having died in a cholera epidemic earlier in the year. He also co-founded the Kentucky Statesman, a semi-weekly Democratic newspaper, and visited his cousin, Mary Todd, where he met her husband, Abraham Lincoln, for the first time; despite their political differences, they became friends.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies {{gained control}} of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his {{administration}} and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform.

The party won only 100,000 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904 the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, re{{gained control of}} the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.|$|E
