25|$|In most Serbian towns {{there are}} several streets named after Greek {{individuals}} or regions. In downtown Belgrade there are streets named after Rigas Fereos, Eleftherios Venizelos, Athenian street, Thessaloniki street, Agion Oros street, Macedonian street, Corfu street, to name a few. There are also monuments dedicated to Rigas Fereos and Eleftherios Venizelos in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Serbian capital.|$|E
25|$|The 15th century saw {{the struggles}} between the most {{important}} families of the city (De Valle and Melatino). The exemplary hanging of 13 followers of Melatino’s family is still remembered in a stone shield in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the city. The monument represents two heads with their tongues out under the writing “A lo parlare agi mesura” (mind what you say).|$|E
25|$|At {{the front}} of 30 Rock is the Lower Plaza, in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the complex, which is reached from 5th Avenue through the Channel Gardens and Promenade. The {{acclaimed}} sculptor Paul Manship was commissioned in 1933 to create a masterwork (see below) to adorn the central axis, below the famed annual Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, but all the other original plans to fill the space were abandoned over time.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{possibility}} of thermal flares in <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> AGNs and microquasars. We present preliminary results of an ongoing study trying to assess the feasibility of a hypothesis suggesting that certain flares observed in these sources originate in the <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> the systems {{and not in the}} relativistic jets. Using a simple toy model we reproduce optical flares with lightcurves very similar to those observed in the sources. The model suits especially well those cases where only the latter peak of a double-peaked optical flare has a radio counterpart.

The crew again meet people they knew from the Light Universe, and from Fire and Water. Only Prince and Priest are able to remember their lives on Fire (though presumably Priest can do this only because Prince allows him to).|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the sculptures were thrown in pieces upon the necropolis found at Mont'e Prama, a low hill 50 m AMSL and strategically located in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Sinis peninsula. Just one other fragmented sculpture– a human head– had been found elsewhere, near the sacred well of Banatou (Narbolia, OR). This site is ca. 2km away from the nuraghe S'Uraki, and the head was found together with various ceramics finds, either Punic and Nuragic.|$|E
25|$|To resolve detail, the eye's {{optical system}} has to project a focused image on the fovea, a region inside the macula having the highest density of cone {{photoreceptor}} cells (the only kind of photoreceptors existing in the fovea's <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> 300 m diameter), thus having the highest resolution and best color vision. Acuity and color vision, despite being mediated by the same cells, are different physiologic functions that do not interrelate except by position. Acuity and color vision can be affected independently.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to traditional agriculture, Alba is a <b>very</b> important <b>center</b> <b>of</b> wine. In {{the area of}} Alba, in fact, there are 290 wineries that cultivate an area of 700 ha of land, producing an average of 61,200 hL of wine annually.|$|R
5000|$|Keel {{effect is}} also called [...] "Pendulum Effect" [...] because a lower <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity {{increases}} {{the effect of}} sideways forces (above the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity) in producing a rolling moment. This is because the moment arm is longer, not because of gravitational forces. A low <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity is like a pendulum (which has a <b>very</b> low <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity).|$|R
50|$|The flat-six {{gives the}} M1 {{motorcycle}} a <b>very</b> low <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity, which enhances stability, but {{the length of}} this engine plus gearbox does not allow a comfortable riding position, which was so cramped that the project moved towards {{the concept of a}} more compact engine.|$|R
25|$|While Ben Gurion Airport is {{conveniently}} {{located in}} the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the country, this fact also means that the airport is surrounded by various residential communities who often complain of noise pollution caused by the airport. Following {{the completion of the}} extension of runway 03/21, residents north of the airport sued the Israeli aviation authorities claiming that the authorities intend to use the runway to a greater degree than was originally agreed with them during the approval process for the airport runways' reconfiguration project.|$|E
25|$|Philadelphia has a {{wide variety}} of {{performance}} venues for music. The city's most senior venue is the famed Academy of Music. Established in 1857, the Academy is the longest continuously operating opera house in the United States that is still being used for its original purpose. At the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Philadelphia's musical life, the Academy is home to many internationally recognized performance ensembles, including the Philly Pops, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Opera Company of Philadelphia. The Academy also presents touring artists and musical theatre of the highest caliber.|$|E
25|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to sorbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the antinode in all sorbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E

25|$|Because quasars are distant objects, {{any light}} which reaches the Earth is redshifted {{due to the}} metric {{expansion}} of space. Quasars inhabit the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> active, young galaxies, and {{are among the most}} luminous, powerful, and energetic objects known in the universe, emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the Milky Way, which contains 200–400 billion stars. This radiation is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum, almost uniformly, from X-rays to the far-infrared with a peak in the ultraviolet-optical bands, with some quasars also being strong sources of radio emission and of gamma-rays.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} foundation, a theater, a chamber of commerce, meeting clubs, public {{libraries}} and dance halls were erected as well. The {{position of the}} city, almost in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the country, made it as a perfect halt and a great communication link, east-west and north-south, creating a slow but unstoppable growth. By the 19th century, Santa Clara was bigger and more populated {{than the rest of}} the towns around, including what was once Remedios. As a necessary stop between Havana and the east of the country, the city gained the title of Las Villas province capital.|$|E
25|$|A {{change has}} also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's {{hard to tell}} if it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas's drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet {{exhibits}} any of Callas's technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality at the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Space-based {{observations}} {{are beginning to}} yield detailed information about the stellar kinematics at the <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> galaxies, within the sphere of gravitational influence of the black hole. The structure and dynamics of these regions is probably determined {{in part by the}} infall and coalescence of black holes during galaxy mergers. A goal of N-body simulations is to reproduce the kinematics near the black holes as well as the relations that exist between the nuclear and global properties of galaxies. However, the problem is computationally difficult due to the wide range of length and time scales, and no single N-body code can efficiently follow the evolution from kiloparsec to sub-parsec scales. We review existing N-body work on this problem and present the first, fully self-consistent merger simulations of galaxies containing dense stellar cusps and black holes. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Scandinavian {{settlements}} were {{larger than}} the early Slavic ones, their craftsmen had a considerably higher productivity, and {{in contrast to the}} early Slavs, the Scandinavians were capable of seafaring. It is not known whether or not the emporia were somehow integrated into the emerging tribal organizations of the Slavs, yet it is taken for certain that they were <b>very</b> important <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> power.|$|R
25|$|The nave is {{the main}} body of the church where most of the worshippers stand, and the {{sanctuary}} is the area around the altar, east of the nave. The sanctuary is usually one to three steps higher than the nave. The Iconostasis does not sit directly on the edge of the sanctuary, but is usually set a few feet back from the edge of the top step. This forms a walkway in front of the iconostasis for the clergy, called a soleas. In the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the soleas is an extension (or thrust), often rounded, called the ambon, on which the deacon will stand to give litanies during the services.|$|E
25|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} put forth to explain the existence of blue stragglers. The simplest is that blue stragglers formed later {{than the rest of}} the stars in the cluster, but evidence for this is limited. Another simple proposal is that blue stragglers are either field stars which are not actually members of the clusters to which they seem to belong, or are field stars which were captured by the cluster. This too seems unlikely, as blue stragglers often reside at the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the clusters to which they belong. Another theory is that blue stragglers are the result of stars that come too close to another star or similar mass object and collide.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the new Minister of Transportation Avigdor Lieberman {{announced}} that in July 2005, work would {{start on the}} renewal of the line. Plans for a national infrastructure project were presented tjat would further alter the rail route, due to changes on the ground since the 1988 plans. These changes included relocating the Afula section to a partially underground route between Afula and Afula Illit, instead of its previous location in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the city. By the end of 2005, many of the plans were approved by the Construction and Planning Committees, which called for {{the completion of the}} line by 2010. Five stations were approved: Haifa East, Nesher, Kfar Yehoshua (in a different location from the historical one), Afula and Beit She'an. Israel Railways also proposed a completely new route to connect the Beit She'an station to Jordan, via the Sheikh Hussein bridge, as well as a future revival of the historical extension to Jenin to serve the Palestinian Authority.|$|E
60|$|That {{you have}} at present no art {{properly}} so called in England at all--whether of painting, sculpture, or architecture[179]--I, for one, do not care. In midst of Scottish Lothians, {{in the days of}} Scott, there was, by how much less art, by so much purer life, than in the midst of Italy in the days of Raphael. But that you should have lost, not only the skill of Art, but the simplicity of Faith and life, all in one, and not only here deface your ancient streets by the Ford of the waters of sacred learning, but also deface your ancient hills with guilt of mercenary desolation, driving their ancient shepherd life into exile, and diverting the waves of their streamlets into the cities which are the <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> pollution, of avarice, and impiety: for this I do care,--for this you have blamed me for caring, instead of merely trying to teach you drawing.
