5|$|The success Napoleon {{needed to}} {{continue}} his offensive had occurred. Ney was on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> breaking the Allied centre.|$|E
5|$|Marseille was {{becoming}} physically {{exhausted by the}} frenetic pace of combat. After his last combat on 26 September, Marseille was reportedly on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> collapse after a 15-minute battle with a formation of Spitfires, during which he scored his seventh victory of that day.|$|E
5|$|Meinertzhargen {{had been}} {{banned from the}} Natural History Museum's Bird Room for 18months for {{unauthorised}} removal of specimens, and suspicions that he was stealing specimens and library material were documented by staff for over 30years, twice reaching the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> prosecution.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} found in the {{grassland}} biome, where its natural habitat is grassy <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> ponds and slow-flowing streams.|$|R
50|$|As well as formal parks, the Trust {{looks after}} 400-acres <b>of</b> lakes, <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> 80 miles of roads and three ancient woodlands.|$|R
50|$|Hennediella heimii {{is found}} in saline environments such as coastal salt marshes, and in recent times on the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> roads salted to prevent icing.|$|R
5|$|On July 16, 2009, Yao {{bought his}} former club team, the Shanghai Sharks, which {{were on the}} <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> {{not being able to}} play the next season of the Chinese Basketball Association because of {{financial}} troubles.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} his signing with QPR, Barton was {{involved}} in an altercation with Gervinho of Arsenal, which resulted in Gervinho being sent off on his debut. Then, Alex Song stamped on Barton, for which Song received a three-match ban. Barton later revealed {{he was on the}} <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> joining Arsenal but his incident with Gervinho ended his hopes of a move to the Emirates, and instead he joined Queens Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
50|$|This tree occurs from Cape Town northwards {{as far as}} Tulbagh and eastwards {{across the}} Cape Fold mountains. It grows amongst fynbos and on the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> forests.|$|R
5000|$|It {{occurs in}} the Robertson Karoo {{vegetation}} of the Breede River Vally in the Western Cape, South Africa. It also extends marginally into the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> the Great Karoo.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} facing the introduction of novel crops is the concerns about their spread into the natural environment. A long-term study of oilseed rape (canola) growing on the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> one of Britain’s busiest motorways provides some encouragement {{that at least some}} crops find the going tough outside the field environment in which they are sown...|$|R
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> victory. He left Thrace {{under the control of}} his son Matthew and moved on to Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited for almost a year for the city to surrender. In his memoirs, he {{explains}} {{that he did not want}} to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} U.S. troops {{were on the}} <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> {{breaking}} through their defenses, Hyakutake's 17th Army headquarters hurriedly sent whatever troops could be found on-hand to bolster the 4th Infantry's defensive efforts. The troops included the 2d Anti-Tank Gun Battalion with 12 guns and the 39th Field Road Construction Unit. These two units took position in pre-prepared fighting emplacements around {{the south and west}} of Point Cruz.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando II died on 23 May 1670 of {{apoplexy}} and dropsy and was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medicean necropolis. At {{the time}} of his death, the population of the grand duchy was 720,594 souls; the streets were lined with grass and the buildings on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> collapse in Pisa, while Siena was virtually abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} found in most {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa, and also Jordan and Yemen. Its preferred habitats are small marshy spots (such as seeps, marshy <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> streams and grassy puddles) in grasslands and savannas.|$|R
50|$|Aloe dinteri {{is found}} in sparse populations across a large arid area of Namibia and around the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> the Namib desert. It usually occurs in deep cracks in {{limestone}} or granite rock, or growing under scrub.|$|R
50|$|Most Pemphis live {{either at}} the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> {{mangrove}} forests, {{well away from the}} forest-ocean interface; or they colonize beaches behind the intertidal zone, taking hold on rocks, gravel or sand, laterite or limestone, and frequently on promontories or crags.|$|R
5|$|In 1850, Scarborough was {{incorporated}} as a township. After incorporation, Scarborough government {{was led by}} a reeve, a deputy-reeve and three councillors, each elected annually. Initially the council met {{in the village of}} Woburn but it was relocated to Birchcliff in 1922, where most of the population was then located. During the Great Depression the local government was on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy. The Ontario Municipal Board stepped in and appointed an oversight committee which prevented the collapse of local government.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Cecil Rhodes paid a {{visit to}} Victoria College. As the leader of the College debating society, Smuts was called upon to deliver the {{welcoming}} address on behalf of the student body. Rhodes, on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> becoming Prime Minister of Cape Colony, was a vocal advocate of Southern African political and economic unity. Now, on the occasion of this visit, Smuts chose to give his address on the theme of Pan-Africanism.|$|E
5|$|In 6BC, on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> {{accepting}} {{command in}} the East and becoming {{the second most}} powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes. The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear. Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, and seemed to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} deadly soft and still, a slight mist hid the furthest <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> the sea's horizon. Behind it, the summer {{lightning}} seemed like portals that opened and shut in the heavens, revealing a glory without form, and closing again.|$|R
5|$|Grasses and sedges {{are common}} {{everywhere}} except dune systems (where marram grass may be locally abundant) and stony mountain tops and plateaux. The {{total number of}} species is large, 84 have been recorded on the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> a single road in West Lothian.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} annual Verge Music Awards, which were handled out on September 22, 2009 and {{broadcast}} live-to-air, Dan Mangan was awarded the <b>Verge</b> Artist <b>of</b> the Year and Alexisonfire was given the <b>Verge</b> Album <b>of</b> the Year Award for their cd Old Crows/Young Cardinals.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, two highly {{elaborate}} metalwork {{covers for}} the treasure bindings of the Epistle and Gospel Books {{for the high}} altar of a large church, probably Ulm Minster, were made around 1506 but are full of spiky Gothic architectural details, although the many figures in high relief are on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> Renaissance style.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E
5|$|In early 1987 Djajakusuma's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} heart disease, which led Djajakusuma to begin dieting and stop smoking. He {{continued to be}} highly respected in Indonesian film circles, but was displeased with {{the condition of the}} country's film industry, which he considered to be on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> collapse. This he blamed on American cultural imperialism, which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films, especially those from Hollywood, and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesia identity.|$|E
5000|$|Scarlet pimpernel flowers {{open only}} when the sun shines, and even close in {{overcast}} conditions. This habit leads to names such as [...] "shepherd's weather glass". It has recently started to occur along the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> salted roads, creating a broad red band along the roadside.|$|R
50|$|Four species, {{occurring}} on {{the other}} side of the continent on the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> the Red Sea, were formerly included in the genus Duvalia. However phylogenetic studies have shown them to be relatively unrelated to the rest of the genus, and more closely related to genus Ballyanthus Bruyns.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} native to the tropical, lowland rainforests of Guyana, French Guiana and northeastern Brazil. There have been {{occasional}} sightings outside its normal range, in west Brazil and east Venezuela. It is an uncommon species and {{is present in the}} forest canopy and at the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> woodland.|$|R
5|$|In late 2012, the Séléka {{coalition}} {{rebelled against}} his autocratic rule {{and entered the}} city. After capturing Bria, Sibut, and other important towns, {{they were on the}} <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> capturing Damara, the last strategic town before Bangui. France and the US refused to support the president and neighbouring countries reinforced the Central African Multinational Force (Fomac).|$|E
5|$|Kevin Nash was {{released}} from the hospital following Bound for Glory. Medical personnel stated he had {{what appeared to be a}} minor heart attack or was on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> having one when he called 9-1-1. The original plan was to have Nash and Raven start a rivalry after Bound for Glory, but due to the circumstances this was changed.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch's {{previous}} {{foray into}} the sport was advising Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar to support Terry Venables's takeover bid for Tottenham Hotspur. The club, on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy, courted newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, someone whom Murdoch regarded as a threat. Murdoch chose {{not to make a}} bid for Tottenham himself, for conflict of interest reasons, and used his newspapers to create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E
5000|$|The genus occurs across {{southern}} Africa, but {{is absent}} {{from most of}} the interior, occurring mainly around the western and southern <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> the subcontinent. The species are mostly very rare and restricted in their range. Only Stapeliopsis saxatilis is relatively widespread in rocky areas of the Cape.|$|R
50|$|The {{range is}} {{restricted}} to Tibet, northern India and northern Bhutan. Its typical habitat is dense scrubby areas in river valleys, grassy hillsides and the <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> both coniferous and deciduous woodland. Although sometimes found at elevations as low as 2400 m, it usually occurs between about 3000 and 5000 m.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is on the}} <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> {{a stretch}} of the East Coast Main Line north of Huntingdon railway station. It is {{calcareous}} clay grassland which has plants which were formerly common on the Huntingdonshire claylands, but are now scarce due to agricultural use. Rabbit grazing and occasional burning maintain the habitat.|$|R
