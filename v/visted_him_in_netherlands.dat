5000|$|Kallenbach {{planned to}} {{accompany}} Gandhi to India in 1914, {{but with the}} outbreak of World War I, he was interned as an 'enemy alien' at detention camps and shifted to the Isle of Man as a Prisoner of War from 1915 until 1917. After the war he returned to South Africa, where he resumed his work as an architect and continued to correspond with Gandhi. The rise of Nazism and Hitler's anti-Semitic propaganda shocked Kallenbach into a rediscovery of his Jewish roots. He became a Zionist and served on the Executive board of the South African Zionist Federation and planned to settle in Palestine ("Ereẓ Israel" [...] in Hebrew). He wanted society there to involve no state, military or industry, {{in order to avoid}} colonialism through Zionist settlements. At the request of Moshe Shertok (Sharett), Kallenbach visited Gandhi in May 1937 to enlist his sympathy and support for Zionism. The architect once again became a simple man, participating in all the activities of Gandhi's ashram life. Kallenbach wrote, [...] "I join the whole programme. ... It is 'almost' as the old joint life, as if the 23 years, with all the events that affected millions of people, had disappeared." [...] Kallenbach disagreed with Gandhi over Zionism and the need to violently resist Hitler. Nevertheless Kallenbach continued his deep friendship with Gandhi, <b>visting</b> <b>him</b> again <b>in</b> 1939.|$|R

5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands,</b> was tried <b>in</b> absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were with <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands.</b> The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned {{they would have to}} stand trial again.|$|R
50|$|Jordi was {{approached}} by both countries, Spain and the Netherlands, when he was eligible {{to play for the}}ir Under-21 teams. He was unsure which country to represent, and in 1996 he declined the possibility to join the Spanish team for the Olympic Games, opting instead to play for the Dutch national team in Euro '96. His performances for Barcelona persuaded coach Guus Hiddink to include <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands</b> squad for the tournament. He made his debut for the national side in a 2-0 friendly defeat against Germany on 24 April 1996. Cruyff scored his only goal for the Netherlands during a 2-0 win against Switzerland at Villa Park on 13 June, and was one of 5 Dutch footballers to be selected for the Dutch national team while never having played in the Eredivisie.|$|R

In 1760, she joined <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Austrian <b>Netherlands,</b> and their relationship lasted until the death of Charles Alexander in 1780.

50|$|His {{unexpected}} {{run at the}} French Open as {{an underdog}} and expressive on-court antics made <b>him</b> popular <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands.</b> The final was watched by even more households <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands</b> than when countrymate Richard Krajicek won Wimbledon in 1996. However, plagued by various injuries and mononucleosis, Verkerk did not reproduce similar results {{during the rest of}} the career, never advancing beyond the third round in subsequent Grand Slams. During his career, he won 2 titles and reached the quarter-finals of the 2003 Rome Masters. Verkerk played a close match against Roger Federer at the 2003 Paris Masters, losing in 3 tiebreak sets after holding multiple matchpoints, 7-6(3), 6-7(12), 6-7(6).|$|R

Ekman graduated in 1836, and was granted a generous traveling scholarship for excelling in his studies.

5000|$|Meit's {{work was}} valued by both Albrecht Dürer, who met <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>in</b> 1520-21, {{and may also}} have known him from Germany, and Lucas Cranach the Elder. Dürer {{referred}} {{to him as the}} ...gute… bildtschniczer mit nahmen Conrad, desgleichen ich kein gesehen hab, der dienet des kaisers tochter, frau Margareth (the good sculptor named Conrad, the like of which I have not seen, who served the Emperor's daughter, lady Margaret). His reputation as an important sculptor stretched across the whole of northern Europe in the early Renaissance, but after his death both he and his sitters were lost to memory, unidentified by inscriptions on the works, and one figure was recorded in the 17th century as by Dürer, of an unidentified figure. [...] It did not help that many works were lost, and that he memorialized the last of the Chalons Princes of Orange in the Brou tombs, and that these soon became sited in French territory, ruled by kings with no family interest in those buried there. Interest in his work revived in the late 20th century, especially in his statuettes, where [...] "sculpture exists for its own sake in a manner unprecedented in the north, with no relation to or support by architecture".|$|R
60|$|Protestant Europe {{was filled}} with horror at this terrible crime. Philip of Spain {{was filled with}} equal delight. Not only was the danger that seemed to {{threaten}} <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands</b> at once and forever, as he believed, at an end, but he saw in this destruction of the Protestants of France a great step in the direction he had so much at heart -- the entire extirpation of heretics throughout Europe. He wrote letters of the warmest congratulation to the King of France, {{with whom he had}} formerly been at enmity; while the Pope, accompanied by his cardinals, went to the church of St. Mark to render thanks to God for the grace thus singularly vouchsafed to the Holy See and to all Christendom. To the Prince of Orange the news came as a thunderclap. His troops wholly lost heart, and refused to keep the field. The prince himself almost lost his life {{at the hands of the}} mutineers, and at last, crossing the Rhine, he disbanded his army and went almost alone to Holland to share the fate of the provinces that adhered to him. He went there expecting and prepared to die.|$|R
50|$|After George V fled Hanover in 1866, {{he raised}} forces loyal to <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the <b>Netherlands,</b> called the Guelphic Legion. They were {{eventually}} disbanded in 1870. Nevertheless, George {{refused to accept}} the Prussian takeover of his realm and claimed he was still the legitimate king of Hanover. His only son, Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, inherited this claim upon George's death in 1878. Ernest Augustus was also first in line to the throne of the Duchy of Brunswick, whose rulers had been a junior branch of the House of Hanover. In 1884, that branch became extinct with the death of William, a distant cousin of Ernest Augustus. However, since Ernest Augustus refused to renounce his claim to annexed Hanover, the Bundesrat of the German Empire ruled that he would disturb the peace of the empire if he ascended the throne of Brunswick. As a result, Brunswick was ruled by a regency until 1913, when his son, also named Ernest Augustus, married the German Emperor's daughter, Princess Viktoria Luise and swore allegiance to the German Empire. The Duke then renounced his claim to Brunswick in favor of his son, and the Bundesrat allowed the younger Ernest Augustus to take possession of Brunswick as a kind of dowry compensation for Hanover.|$|R
5000|$|Trkulja {{collaborated with}} {{numerous}} jazz bands and philharmonic orchestras. He joined the multinational groove-jazz band [...] "Turqumstances,” in Amsterdam.

She was widowed in 1988, and died in 1990 {{at the age of}} 60 of lung cancer. Reacher described his mother as [...] "gallic, feminine, obstinate," [...] and [...] "the most stubborn woman possible." [...] He also branded her a fatalist as she had concealed her cancer from her children and had refused treatment for a one-year period before her death. However Reacher compares her favourably to his father: [...] "My father hadn't killed the enemy at the age of thirteen. But my mother had. She had lived through desperate times and she had stepped up and done what was necessary." [...] Reacher also has great respect for his mother: at her funeral he buried his Silver Star medal with her, and on learning of her role in World War II, states that he became the man he was because of her.|$|R
