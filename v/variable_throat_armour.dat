40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design and}} performance analysis of two exhaust nozzles considered {{for use on}} a vehicle following an accelerating flight profile to a maximum flight speed corresponding to Mach 4. 2 is presented. The vehicle operational requirements were set by the Air Vehicle Baseline Study commissioned by the Office of Naval Research.

The two nozzles investigated here were an axisymmetric convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzle with <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> and exit area and an isentropic plug nozzle with <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> area enabled by a translating outer cowl. Computational fluid dynamics was used to assist in the design process and to investigate the installed performance of the two nozzles at flight points from Mach 1. 2 to Mach 4. 2. For both nozzle configurations, the nozzles could not achieve perfectly expanded exit areas at the highest Mach numbers in order for the nozzle exit area to not exceed the vehicle cross sectional area. At the lower Mach numbers, the installed performance of the C-D nozzle was higher than that of the plug nozzle while at the highest Mach numbers, the performance of the two nozzles was similar...|$|R

40|$|Fundamental {{concepts}} {{in the theory}} and design of the flooded disc scrubber- a new <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> orifice contactor are pre-sented. Test data from laboratory, pilot plant, and full scale operations on lime kiln, electric furnace, open hearth, blast furnace, and basic oxygen furnace applications are presented and compared with available data on other scrubbers. Conclusions are that performance on a given problem is primarily a function of power input- thus supporting the correlation concept of Semrau- and that little scale-up factor exists in utilizing pilot plant data {{in the design of}} full scale systems. The flooded disc scrubber is a new <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> orifice contactor- cyclonic demister which is now operating in some 15 plants and contracted for in some 15 additional plants throughout the United States. Flow capacity of these installations range from approximately 9000 ACFM (actual cubic feet per minute) to over 200, 000 ACFM, and some have been in operation for over four years. Yet no comprehensive treatment of either the basic concepts utilized in the design, or the operating characteristics of this device in actual practice, has appeared in the literature. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to review these basic concepts and to present, for the first time, the performance parameters obtained in a number of tests of pilot and full scale installations. Description of the Flooded Disc Scrubber The basic configuration of the scrubber system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of two principal parts: the flooded disc contactor and a demister.

40|$|In a solar vapor ejector {{refrigeration}} system, {{the solar}} heat supply may vary because of variations in solar irradiation intensity, {{making it difficult}} to maintain a steady generator temperature. To improve ejector performance, this study proposes a <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> ejector (VTEJ) and analyzes its performance using CFD simulations. The following conclusions can be drawn. An ejector with a greater throat area and larger solar collector allows a wider operating range of generator temperatures, but may be overdesigned and expensive. Conversely, decreasing the throat area limits the operating range of generator temperatures. Thus the ejector with a fixed throat area may be unsuitable to use solar energy as a heat source. For a VTEJ, this study derives a curve-fitting relationship between the optimum throat area ratio and the operating temperatures. Using this relationship to adjust the throat area ratio, the ejector can consistently achieve optimal and stable performances under a varying solar heat supply. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

30|$|It {{is because}} of the poor {{reservoir}} qualities and the small and <b>variable</b> pore <b>throats</b> that make it nearly impossible for hydrocarbons in source rocks to migrate over long distances and to accumulate in a concentrated area. Instead, hydrocarbons in such reservoirs tend to form a widespread and continuous distribution. On the contrary, if source-rock reservoirs were similar to conventional reservoirs with high porosities and permeabilities, discontinuous or conventional trap-controlled accumulations rather than continuous accumulations would tend to occur in them. Some coal reservoirs, particularly coals of low to medium rank, are quite similar to conventional reservoirs. The permeabilities of low-ranked coals in the Powder River Basin are, for instance, usually between 10 md and a few darcies (Ayers 2002). The Walloon Formation coals in the Australian Surat Basin are lignite, belonging to typically low-ranked CBM reservoirs, and have relatively good qualities, with an average porosity of approximately 17 % and a permeability of roughly 1 – 300 md. The Blackwater Group coals in the Northern Bowen Basin are at a low metamorphic rank, and their porosities are 6 %– 13 %, while their permeabilities are 5 – 30 md (Li et al. 2014).|$|R

The single stage advanced technology fan was designed to a pressure ratio of 1. 8 at a tip speed of 503 m/sec 11, 650 ft/sec). The fan and booster components are designed in a scale model flow size convenient for testing with existing facility and vehicle hardware. The design corrected flow per unit annulus area at the fan face is 215 kg/sec sq m (44. 0 lb m/sec sq ft) with a hub-tip ratio of 0. 38 {{at the leading edge}} of the fan rotor. This results in an inlet corrected airflow of 117. 9 kg/sec (259. 9 lb m/sec) for the selected rotor tip diameter if 90. 37 cm (35. 58 in.). The variable geometry inlet is designed utilizing a combination of high throat Mach number and acoustic treatment in the inlet diffuser for noise suppression (hybrid inlet). A variable fan exhaust nozzle was assumed in conjunction with the <b>variable</b> inlet <b>throat</b> area to limit the required area change of the inlet throat at approach and hence limit the overall diffusion and inlet length.

40|$|The {{exhaust nozzle}} is an {{integral}} part of a jet engine and critical to its overall system performance. Challenges associated with the design and manufacturing of an exhaust nozzle become greater as the cruise speed of the aircraft increases. The exhaust nozzle of a supersonic cruise aircraft requires additional capabilities such as <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> and exit area, noise suppression, and reverse thrust. The present work is an effort to study the design and analysis of jet engine exhaust nozzle systems such as the axisymmetric plug nozzle, the chevron nozzle and the ejector nozzle with clamshells. ^ High-bypass-ratio jet engines with two or more flow streams have superior noise suppressing and thrust characteristics. Much research has been done in the past to study and understand the flow physics of these engines. In the present work a computational fluid dynamics-based approach was used to study the jet engine exhaust nozzle systems. First, a computer-aided-design model of a three-stream separate-flow axisymmetric plug nozzle was created and axisymmetric flow simulations were performed to study the flow field. The mean flow and turbulent kinetic energy fields were compared with the particle image velocimetry results available in the literature. Next, computational fluid dynamics was used to study the performance of passive chevron mixers in enhancing the turbulent mixing. Three-dimensional calculations were carried out to study the effect of enhanced mixing on the mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy flow fields. Different turbulence models were used to study their performance in predicting chevron-based jet flows. ^ Gas turbine engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, and business class aircraft manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, are collaborating on the development of technologies for a supersonic jet. As part of this collaborative research and development program, an ejector nozzle with clamshell doors, similar to that on an Olympus- 593 engine, which powered the Concorde aircraft, was designed and tested. The ejector nozzle offers additional advantages such as thrust augmentation and noise suppression. ^ Numerical simulations of this ejector nozzle with clamshell doors at 11. 5 ° clamshell angle and without clamshell doors were performed as part of the validation task. Mean flow fields were predicted for low subsonic experimental conditions and compared with the experimental data. Flow separation and recirculation zones were encountered near the inner surface of clamshell doors. Simulations at higher nozzle pressure ratios were also performed to simulate actual flight conditions. Flow separation prevailed at this condition as well. ^ The existing new supersonic noise suppression exhaust nozzle design was improved by the addition of chevrons and its flow field was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. The jet engine exhaust nozzle consisted of three-dimensional ejectors in the form of clamshell doors and chevrons as passive mixers. Chevrons were placed in the ejector slot to introduce streamwise vorticity and enhance mixing. It was observed that the flow separation zone was almost removed and an improvement in the ejector performance was obtained. Computational simulations corresponded to take-off conditions with a nozzle pressure ratio of 1 : 7 and freestream Mach number of 0. 3. ...|$|R
40|$|Future {{generation}} {{gas turbine}} combustors for power production {{are expected to}} have the capability of operating on high hydrogen content fuels. To ensure the implementation of high hydrogen content (HHC) fuel in a power generation unit without negotiating with operational or emission advantages, the study of the flame stability regime and behavior of (HHC) fuel under gas turbine condition leads to the necessity of the development of an optically accessible high-pressure combustor. This dissertation first presents the design of an optically high-pressure combustor facility based on 500 kW power and 1. 5 MPa pressure which is the representative pressure of a real gas turbine. The combustion chamber is designed to accommodate multiple geometrical configurations including a non-swirl stabilized and center-body stabilized swirl flow. The combustor is made of stainless steel 410. It has four primary modular parts: outer stainless steel chamber, inner quartz chamber, front cap and end cap. It has three optically accessible windows and three instrumentation ports for a broad range of investigation techniques. Finite element analysis has performed to get the wall thickness. The test chamber is also fitted with a variable area flow restrictor to control the desired pressure across the combustion chamber. Cooling system is also included in the design to extract heat and avoid structural failure. The outer stainless steel chamber will be equipped with copper coiling using cooling water as a driving fluid and inner quartz chamber will be convectively cooled using nitrogen. The use of a <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> area restrictor, multiple cooling systems, as well as removable modular sections and optical access will allow the combustor to be compatible to work {{in a wide range of}} operations and have the flexibility operating with variable syngas compositions. This will allow analysis of the flame stability, flow field characterization, pollutant emissions in high hydrogen content fuel under realistic gas turbine conditions. ^ The ignition and control systems of this high pressure combustor have also been developed in the present work. LabVIEW was used as the controlling interface that controls the proportional valves, and solenoiod valves. A modified spark plug was used as an ignition source. In order to ignite the main fuel-air stream, a diffusion flame was used. Functional test of the equipment, leak test and pressure testing were carried out prior to conducting the ignition experiments. The system has the capability to withstand the maximum pressure allowed by the air compressor which is 758 kPa. ^ The high-pressure combustion chamber design allows for testing in realistic gas turbine conditions. Fuels that show promise as an energy source are high-hydrogen content fuels derived from coal which have a much higher specific heat, higher diffusivity, flammability limits and higher laminar flame speed compared to other hydrocarbons. These properties induce flame flashback especially when the hydrogen content in the fuels is high. A multi-tube injector has been designed to mitigate the flashback of high hydrogen content fuel. ^ The present work studies the blowout characteristics of syngas mixtures emitted from a novel multi-tube injector. Compositions are varied for syngas from 10...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve por objetivo estudar a influência das variáveis vazão de líquido, comprimento da garganta, número de orifícios e velocidade do gás na garganta na eficiência de coleta de um lavador Venturi. Como {{material}} particulado a ser removido de uma corrente gasosa utilizou-se um concentrado fosfático de densidade 2, 9 g/cm 3 na vazão mássica de 3, 16 g/min. O sistema experimental utilizado neste trabalho consistiu de um lavador Venturi de geometria retangular operando horizontalmente e com injeção de líquido através de 1 a 5 orifícios de 1 mm de diâmetro distribuídos na garganta do mesmo. Para a realização dos experimentos utilizou-se dois planejamentos experimentais do tipo completo, com três fatores em três diferentes níveis. No primeiro planejamento foi estudada a influência das variáveis vazão de líquido na faixa de 300 a 900 cm 3 /min, comprimento da garganta na faixa de 6, 5 a 18, 5 cm e número de orifícios na faixa de 1 a 5 orifícios, mantendo-se constante a velocidade do gás na garganta com um valor de 69, 33 m/s. No segundo planejamento foi estudada a influência da variável velocidade do gás na garganta na faixa de 58, 66 a 69, 33 m/s, utilizando-se apenas 1 orifício para injeção de líquido. Verificou-se que os percentuais de eficiência de coleta no lavador Venturi ficaram na faixa de 50 a 91 % para o primeiro planejamento. Observou-se uma tendência de aumento da eficiência de remoção de partículas com o aumento da vazão de líquido e do comprimento da garganta. Quanto ao fator número de orifícios verificou-se um melhor desempenho do lavador quando utilizou-se apenas 1 orifício. Verificou-se que os percentuais de eficiência de coleta no lavador Venturi ficaram na faixa de 52 a 93 % para o segundo planejamento. Observou-se que o aumento da velocidade do gás na garganta provocou um aumento na eficiência de coleta. Comparou-se as predições das clássicas equações de eficiência de Johnstone et al. (1954), Calvert et. al. (1972) e Leith e Cooper (1980) com os valores experimentais. Observou-se que para os resultados experimentais e para os modelos avaliados que a eficiência global é crescente com o aumento da vazão de líquido. No entanto, verificou-se que os modelos de Johnstone et al. e Calvert et al. subestimaram os valores de eficiência global obtidos experimentalmente enquanto o modelo de Leith e Cooper superestimou os mesmos. Com isso, tornou-se necessário ter um modelo para ajustar aos pontos experimentais. Tomou-se como base o modelo de Calvert et al. por ser um modelo clássico e ser amplamente utilizado na indústria. Propôs-se então uma equação de ajuste para o fator empírico f utilizando os dados experimentais. Como verificou-se em testes anteriores que a variável comprimento de garganta é relevante na eficiência de coleta e a mesma não aparece na equação proposta por Calvert et al., decidiuse ajustar uma equação de f em função de LG da forma f= 3005, 0. 5161, 0 G L. Verificou-se a validade do ajuste pela boa concordância dos valores experimentais de eficiência observados experimentalmente com os valores estimados pelo modelo de Calvert modificado. This {{work had}} for objective {{to study the}} influence of the <b>variables</b> liquid flow, <b>throat</b> length, number of orifices and gas velocity in the throat in the collection efficiency of a Venturi scrubber. As particulate matter to be removed from the gas, a phosphate concentrate of density 2. 9 g/cm 3 was used, fed at a mass flow rate of 3. 16 g/min. The experimental system used in this work consisted of a Venturi scrubber of rectangular geometry operating horizontally, with liquid injection through 1 to 5 orifices with 1 diameter mm each, distributed in the scrubber throat. For the experiments, two experimental planning were used, with three factors in three different levels. In the first planning was studied {{the influence of the}} variables liquid flow in the range from 300 to 900 cm 3 /min, throat length in the range from 6. 5 to 18. 5 cm and number of orifices in the range from 1 to 5 holes; the gas velocity in the throat was kept constant at value of 69. 33 m/s. In the second planning was studied the influence of the variable gas velocity in the throat in the range from 58. 66 to 69. 33 m/s, with the liquid injected by a single orifice. It was verified that the overall collection efficiency of the Venturi scrubber varied within the range from 50 to 91 %, for the studied conditions in the first planning. A tendency of increase of the efficiency was observed with the increase of the liquid flow and of the throat length. As for the number of orifices, a better performance of the scrubber was verified when only 1 orifice was used. It was verified that the overall collection efficiency of the Venturi scrubber varied within the range from 52 to 93 %, for the studied conditions in the second planning. Was observed that the increase in the gas velocity in the throat resulted in an increase in the overall collection efficiency. The predictions of the classical equations for collection efficiency of Johnstone et al. (1954), Calvert et al. (1972) and Leith and Cooper (1980) were compared to the experimental values. It was observed that both for the experimental results and for the models that the global efficiency increases with the increase of the liquid flow. However, it was verified that the models of Johnstone et al. and Calvert et al. underestimated the values of global efficiency obtained experimentally while the model of Leith and Cooper overestimated them. Therefore, it became necessary to adjust a model to the experimental points. It was taken as departure point the model of Calvert et al., for being a classic model and because it is widely used industrially. An adjustment equation for the empiric factor f using the experimental data was then performed. As it was verified in previous tests that the <b>variable</b> <b>throat</b> length is relevant in the collection efficiency and the same does not appear in the equation proposed by Calvert et al., it was decided to adjust an equation of f in function as a function of LG as f= 3005, 0. 5161, 0 G L. The validity of the adjustment was verified by the good agreement of the experimental values of efficiency observed experimentally with the predicted values by the modified Calvert model...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pain is {{the most}} {{important}} complication following tonsillectomy and pharyngeal palatine tonsil, and coupled palatine tonsils and throat. There isno enough investigation about antibiotic therapy on this complication. Furthermore, as there is no agreement in the use of antibiotic on pain complication, this investigation designed for finding of the efficacy of antibiotic therapy on pain complication consequent of tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy and its severity. Method and Materials: This randomized clinical trial (RCT) study was carried out on 138 patients who were candidate for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. The patients according to systematic randomized divided into two equal groups; the first group as the intervention, received antibiotic and the other as the comparison received no antibiotic. Both the groups were compared in the <b>variables</b> such as: <b>throat</b> and ear pains, their severity, and patient's need to analgesic drugs after tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 13 and using chi-square, Fisher and Man-Withny tests and α< 0. 05 considered significant statically. Results: Our finding showed that the mean and standard deviation of severity of the pain were 2. 72 ± 0. 95 and 2. 54 ± 0. 83 in intervention and comparison groups respectively and in comparing there is no observed significant difference (p= 0. 29).

Our intention {{was to determine the}} incidence of postoperative sore throat from a large sample of patients and thus to identify the most important associated factors. METHODS: We prospectively followed up 809 adult patients who underwent elective surgical interventions and examined their history, the applied anaesthetic techniques, perioperative course and the occurrence, intensity and duration of postoperative throat complaints. The assignment and professional experience of the involved intubators were also assessed. The influence of a multitude of <b>variables</b> on postoperative <b>throat</b> complaints was statistically analysed. RESULTS: Postoperative sore throat was present in 40 % overall being significantly higher in female than in male (44 % vs. 33 %; P = 0. 001). The mean pain intensity in the affected patients (n = 323) was 28 +/- 12 mm on a visual analogue scale where 0 = no pain and 100 = extreme pain. The average duration was 16 +/- 11 h. Main factors associated with throat complaints were female sex; history of smoking or lung disease, duration of anaesthesia, postoperative nausea, bloodstain on the endotracheal tube and natural teeth. We could find no influence on the occurrence or intensity of throat complaints by the professional assignment or the length of professional experience of the personnel involved.

40|$|Highly loaded {{single stage}} gas {{turbines}} {{are being developed}} to minimize the turbine size and weight. Such highly loaded turbines often result in transonic flows, which imply {{a reduction in the}} efficiency due to the shock losses. The efficiency of a turbine is defined as the ratio between the real work extracted by the turbine rotor from the fluid and the maximum available enthalpy for a given pressure ratio. The relationship between turbine performance and design parameters is not yet fully comprehended due to the complexity of the flow field and unsteady flow field interactions. Hence, experimental and numerical studies remain necessary to understand the flow behavior at different conditions to advance {{the state of the art}} of the prediction tools. The purpose of the current research is to develop a methodology to determine the efficiency with an accuracy better than 1 % in a cooled and uncooled high pressure (HP) turbine tested in a short duration facility with a running time of about 0. 4 s. Such low level of uncertainty requires the accurate evaluation of a large number of quantities simultaneously, namely the mass flow of the mainstream, the coolant, and leakage flows properties, the inlet total pressure and total temperature, the stage exit total pressure, the shaft power, the mechanical losses and the heat transfer. The experimental work is carried out in a compression tube facility that allows testing the turbine at the temperature ratios, Re and Mach numbers encountered in real engines. The stage mass flow is controlled by a <b>variable</b> sonic <b>throat</b> located downstream of the stage exit. Due to the absence of any brake, the turbine power is converted into rotor acceleration. The accurate measurement of this acceleration as well as those of the inertia and the rotational speed provides the shaft power. The inertia of the whole rotating assembly was accurately determined by accelerating and decelerating the shaft with a known energy. The mass-flow is derived from the measured turbine inlet total pressure and the vane sonic throat. The turbine sonic throat was evaluated based on a zero-dimensional model of the turbine. The efficiencies of two transonic turbines are measured at design and off-design conditions. The turbine design efficiency is obtained as 91. 8 %. The repeatability of the measurements for 95 % confidence level varies between 0. 3 % and 1. 1 % of the efficiency depending on the test case. The theoretical uncertainty level of 1. 2 % is mainly affected by the uncertainty of exit total pressure measurements. Additionally, the effect of vane trailing edge shock formations and their interactions with the rotor blade are analyzed based on the experimental data, the numerical tools and the loss correlations. The changes of blade and vane performances are measured at mid-span for three different pressure ratios which influence the vane and rotor shock mechanisms. Moreover, the unsteady forces on the rotor blades and the rotor disk were calculated by integration of the unsteady static pressure field on the rotor surface. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R
