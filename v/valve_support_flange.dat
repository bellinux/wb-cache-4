40|$|Power {{ultrasonic}} {{applications such}} as cutting, welding, and sonochemistry often use Langevin transducers to generate power ultrasound. Traditionally, it has been proposed that the piezoceramic stack of a Langevin transducer should {{be located in the}} nodal plane of the longitudinal mode of vibration, ensuring that the piezoceramic elements are positioned under a uniform stress during transducer operation, maximizing element efficiency and minimizing piezoceramic aging. However, this general design rule is often partially broken during the design phase if features such as a <b>support</b> <b>flange</b> or multiple piezoceramic stacks are incorporated into the transducer architecture. Meanwhile, it has also been well documented in the literature that power ultrasonic devices driven at high excitation levels exhibit nonlinear behaviors similar to those observed in Duffing-type systems, such as resonant frequency shifts, the jump phenomenon, and hysteretic regions. This study investigates three Langevin transducers with different piezoceramic stack locations by characterizing their linear and nonlinear vibrational responses to understand how the stack location influences nonlinear behavior...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThis study {{investigated}} the optimization of indications to external <b>valve</b> <b>support</b> using the Vedensky Spiral for primary deep venous reflux based on the femoral vein proximal (ostial) valve anatomy type. MethodsThe external Vedensky Spiral was used for correction of valvular insufficiency in 28 extremities of 24 patients (18 women, 6 men) during 1998 to 2002. Patients were {{a mean age of}} 54. 6 years (range, 32 - 76 years). The clinical manifestation was C 4 in 10 limbs and C 5 in 18 limbs. Primary axial deep reflux was present in all 28 extremities, and axial superficial reflux was also present in 26. Duplex scanning and descending phlebography were used to estimate the functional condition of the deep vein valves. Fibrophleboscopy intraoperatively to study the anatomic status of the femoral vein valves and for checking the repaired valve function was used. ResultsPhleboscopy showed the following anatomy of ostial valves of the femoral vein: 16 valves had wide separation of cusps, 11 had elongation of cusps, and one had a monocusp. The competence of femoral vein ostial valves was completely restituted in all cases with wide separation of cusps. Multiple corrections were performed in cases with incomplete competence of the ostial valve (valve with elongation of cusps or monocusp). ConclusionExternal <b>valve</b> <b>support</b> by the Vedensky Spiral is an effective and simple method of correction of incompetent femoral vein valves in limbs with primary deep venous reflux. The technical success of the intervention depends on the type of valve insufficiency and the correct choice of spiral diameter...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{expression of the}} pressure barrier in a capillary-burst valve for flow regulation in centrifugal microfluidics. The analysis considers variations of the interfacial energies at the meniscus of three-dimensional (3 D) configuration in a rectangular microchannel with a sudden expansion in cross-section. We derive a simple expression that predicts the critical burst pressure or rotational speed to overcome the capillary valve. Experiments were carried out for capillary valves that were integrated with microchannels on a rotating disk having various cross-sectional dimensions (300 and 400 mu m in width and 80 - 600 mu m in depth) and wedge angles (30 degrees- 100 degrees) of sudden expansion. The flow visualization of the meniscus development across the capillary <b>valve</b> <b>supports</b> the assumptions made for the present analysis. The measurements of burst rotational speeds for the capillary valves are in good agreement with the predictions by the simple expression except that those with a larger channel width and wider wedge angles are nearly 10 % lower than the predicted values...|$|R
40|$|The ITER Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive (ECH&CD) Upper Launcher, whose {{preliminary}} design was approved in 2009, {{is on its}} way towards the final design. The design work is being done by a consortium of several European research institutes in tight collaboration with F 4 E. The main focus is the finalization of the design of all components for the First Confinement System (FCS), which forms the vacuum and Tritium barrier. The FCS comprises structural components as well as the external waveguide components in the port cell. Structural components of the FCS include the flange seal, backend frame and closure plate. The external waveguide components include the isolation valve, CVD diamond windows, miter bends and straight waveguides. Because finalizing of the design of these components is directly influenced by the layout of many in-vessel components, the design work includes also further development of the entire launcher. This paper summarizes the most recent status of the design work on the structural components of the launcher FCS, which are the <b>support</b> <b>flange,</b> the socket, the closure plate and feed-throughs for waveguides and cooling pipes. The design work includes the engineering layout of these components in accordance with system requirements, load specifications and Quality and Safety classification. An outline of the overall design of the launcher will be presented. The design progress was based on a set of related analyses, of which particular results are given. Also the integration of the associated mm-wave components, assembly strategies, neutronic aspects and the design of the shielding components will be described. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|In 15 {{patients}} with pure or predominant mitral stenosis {{and in a}} control group of 11 {{patients with}}out mitral stenosis the blood flow velocity through the mitral valve orifice was recorded {{by means of a}} directional Doppler ultrasound velocity catheter introduced transeptally and positioned in the orifice of the mitral valve.

Determination of the exact time of mitral valve opening, made possible by the blood velocity record, led to the division of the classical A 2 - 0 S interval (aortic valve closure to opening snap) into two components representing respectively the diastolic isovolumic relaxation period and the time of excursion of the mitral valve cusps.

40|$|ObjectivesHearts with an absent {{atrioventricular}} {{connection and}} a straddling of the solitary atrioventricular valve are rare but significant lesions. They are suitable only for Fontan-like palliation, in which atrioventricular valvar abnormalities {{play a significant}} role in determining the outcome. We studied the segmental arrangements in such lesions and clarified the valvar morphology, particularly its surgical implications. MethodsWe made a macroscopic review of all specimens with an absent atrioventricular connection and a straddling atrioventricular valve that were held in the collections of 3 institutes. We included only those specimens with the straddling <b>valve</b> <b>supported</b> exclusively by either the right-sided or left-sided atrioventricular junction and excluded those with a common atrioventricular junction. ResultsWe found 11 hearts with an absent right atrioventricular connection and a straddling left atrioventricular valve, and 3 with an absent left atrioventricular connection and a straddling right atrioventricular valve. Most had right-hand ventricular topology and discordant ventriculoarterial connections. We found multiple valvar abnormalities, including dysplastic leaflets, short cords, abnormal attachments, and abnormal papillary muscles. The most consistent features were a line of maximal coaptation between the bridging leaflets always perpendicular to the plane of the ventricular septum and a free-floating bridging anterosuperior leaflet. ConclusionsStraddling of a solitary atrioventricular valve with an absent atrioventricular connection produces a uniatrial but biventricular connection. In this setting, the valve guarding the abnormal solitary atrioventricular junction cannot be classified morphologically as mitral or tricuspid. The markedly variable valvar morphology likely makes these valves prone to insufficiency in the long term...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the feasibility of high-resolution phased-array intracardiac imaging. BackgroundIntracardiac echocardiographic imaging of the heart during interventional electrophysiologic (EP) procedures has been limited by inadequate ultrasound penetration and absence of Doppler hemodynamic and flow information produced by rotating mechanical ultrasound elements. MethodsA 10 F (3. 2 mm) phased-array, variable 5. 5 to 10 MHz frequency imaging catheter with a four-way deflectable tip was applied in 24 patients undergoing EP studies. Sixteen prespecified cardiac targets were imaged from a right heart venue. ResultsFifteen patients had no underlying organic heart disease; nine had ischemic, cardiomyopathic, valvular or congenital heart disorders. Longitudinal and short-axis imaging readily disclosed each cardiac <b>valve,</b> <b>support</b> structures and chamber, as well as the pericardium, right and left atrial appendages, the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava, crista terminalis, tricuspid valve isthmus, coronary sinus orifice, membranous fossa ovalis and pulmonary veins. The average target depth was 8. 8 ± 1. 5 cm (range 0. 5 to 15 cm), with adequate penetration at a 7. 5 MHz imaging frequency. Color flow and Doppler utilities clearly characterized transaortic and pulmonic valve and pulmonary vein blood flow, including during low output states. ConclusionsThese first human studies with this technology demonstrate the methods, feasibility and utility of intracardiac phased-array vector and Doppler imaging for long-axis, apex-to-base global cardiac imaging. High resolution of endocardial structures and catheters suggests additional utility for visualizing interventional procedures from the right heart...|$|R
