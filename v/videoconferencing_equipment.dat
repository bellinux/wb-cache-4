40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{relative}} {{rarity of}} {{congenital heart disease}} gives it an orphean disease status, requiring specialised centres. The present maturity of information technology allows telemedicine to be integrated into current medical practice. We report our experience of telemedicine between the cardiology department at St Pierre Hospital {{on the island of}} Réunion and the pediatric cardiology department at the teaching hospital in Toulouse. AimsThe aims of this work were [1] to verify the technical feasibility of transmitting echocardiographic images, [2] determine an optimal therapeutic strategy for each patient, and [3] deliver precise information live to patients and their families. MethodsFive pediatric cardiology videoconference consultation sessions were transmitted between April 2006 and May 2007. The <b>videoconference</b> <b>equipment,</b> POLYCOM VSX 7000 (R), was used to relay information between the two centres, using six high-debit digital telephone lines, allowing a transfer rate of 384 kbits/s and an image frequency of 25 frames per second. The echocardiographic equipment at St Pierre Hospital was connected to the <b>videoconference</b> <b>equipment</b> by an S-VHS video output. The transmitted sources alternated between the echographic video output and the signal from a video camera, with continuous audio transmission. ResultsThe telemedicine meeting was made up of three main elements: [1] a consultation with real-time echocardiographic acquisition and transmission, [2] a discussion between medical colleagues, and [3] a discussion with the family. Five videoconference consultation sessions were organised between April 2006 and May 2007. 22 patients were involved (median age 3 years, age range 7 days to 48 years). Heart disease was congenital in 20 patients, and acquired in 2 patients. The aim of the telemedicine consultation was to specify [1]: medical treatment in 7 patients, and [2] an indication for surgery or interventional catheterisation in 15 patients. There was no significant change in diagnosis, but in 2 patients with complex heart disease some anatomical clarifications were made. For 3 patients, the videoconference discussion was essential to get the extremely reticent families to accept the indication for surgery. ConclusionThis is the first experience in France of telemedicine consultation for pediatric and congenital cardiology. These videoconferences allowed patients in the south of Réunion to benefit from a specialist opinion on optimal therapeutic strategy, with no delay or need to travel a long distance...|$|R

And whichever company ends up leading the charge, there's no question that interoperability is an inevitable must in videoconferencing, just like it was in text messaging on mobile phones. The more use corporate customers {{can get out of}} their videoconferencing systems, the more they'll invest in buying them." [...] In contrast to this, Ari Levy reported in 2013 that BlueJeans Network and similar services had begun to cut into the revenues of larger, room-based hardware system developers, due to their greater flexibility and accessing the market of smaller businesses. That year BlueJeans Network also partnered with Salesforce.com, providing BlueJeans run video conferencing to all Salesforce clients through its [...] "Chatter" [...] tool.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{to examine whether}} a paediatric patient at a regional hospital could be assessed by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist via videoconference, therefore saving at least one journey to the tertiary hospital for a pre-admission appointment. A video-otoscope was used with standard <b>videoconference</b> <b>equipment,</b> and realtime images were transmitted at a bandwidth of 384 kbit/s. In all, 13 telepaediatric ENT clinics were conducted between November 2003 and April 2005, and 98 consultations were facilitated for 64 patients. The main reasons for referral were recurrent tonsillitis (25 %) and obstructive sleep apnoea (23 %). Of the 64 patients examined by telemedicine, 42 (66 %) were recommended for surgery and placed on the surgical waiting list. About 12 patients (19 %) required travel to the tertiary centre for further investigations and tests not available locally, while four patients (6 %) were reviewed via videoconference during a scheduled clinic. Six patients (9 %) required no further follow-up after their initial telepaedliatric consultation. Videoconferencing is an effective method of assessing ENT conditions of paediatric patients and for pre-screening potential surgical admissions to a tertiary hospital. Careful consideration {{of a number of}} economic and logistical factors needs to be made before large investments are made to expand the service...|$|R
5000|$|On 23 August, voice {{contact was}} made with the miners. They {{reported}} having few medical problems; the doctor {{in charge of the}} rescue operation told the media that [...] "they have considerably less discomfort than we might have expected after spending 18 days inside the mine, at 700 m deep and under high temperatures and high humidity". The doctors also reported that the miners had already been provided with a 5% glucose solution and a drug to prevent stomach ulcers resulting from food deprivation. Material was sent down in 5 ft blue plastic capsules nicknamed [...] ("doves", referring to the role of carrier pigeons), taking an hour to reach the miners. Engineers coated the boreholes with a gel in order to ensure the integrity of the shafts and ease the passage of the capsules. In addition to high-energy glucose gels, rehydration tablets, and medicine, rescuers also sent down oxygen after the miners reported there was not enough air. Delivery of solid food began a few days later. Two other boreholes were completed—one for oxygen enriched air, the second for <b>videoconference</b> <b>equipment</b> to allow daily video chats with family members.

40|$|Abstract Background There are few cost-minimisation {{studies in}} telemedicine. We have {{compared}} the actual costs {{of providing a}} telepaediatric service to the potential costs if patients had travelled to see the specialist in person. Methods In November 2000, we established a novel telepaediatric service for selected regional hospitals in Queensland. Instead of transferring patients to Brisbane, the majority of referrals to specialists in Brisbane were dealt with via videoconference. Since the service began, 1499 consultations have been conducted for {{a broad range of}} paediatric sub-specialities including burns, cardiology, child development, dermatology, diabetes, endocrinology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, oncology, orthopaedics, paediatric surgery and psychiatry. Results During a five year period, the total cost of providing 1499 consultations through the telepaediatric service was A$ 955, 996. The estimated potential cost of providing an outpatient service to the same number of patients at the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane was A$ 1, 553, 264; thus, telepaediatric services resulted in a net saving of approximately A$ 600, 000 to the health service provider. Conclusion Telepaediatrics was a cheaper method for the delivery of outpatient services when the workload exceeded 774 consultations. A sensitivity analysis showed that the threshold point was most sensitive to changes related to patient travel costs, coordinator salaries and <b>videoconference</b> <b>equipment</b> costs. The study showed substantial savings for the health department, mainly due to reduced costs associated with patient travel. </p...|$|R

50|$|Video visitation is a {{term used}} for {{technology}} that allows the inmate and visitor to communicate via analog or digital <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Under the old method of face-to-face visitation, inmates were transferred from their housing area to the visitation area, while visitors often had {{to walk through the}} facility. With video visitation, inmates will use a video visitation station located in their cell or cell block, while visitors can use a corresponding station elsewhere—or even use their computers from home. This greatly reduces the amount of manpower needed to conduct visits by reducing the movement of inmates; reducing inmate movement also reduces contraband at the facility.|$|E
5000|$|In {{real-time}} telemedicine, electronic telecommunication allows {{providers and}} patients to {{send and receive}} health-related information instantly or with limited delay. The most predominate method of real-time telemedicine is videoconferencing. The primary advantage of real-time telemedicine is that it significantly reduces wait time rural patients incur when seeking more specialized health services, and information is shared at an increasing speed. [...] Although the costs of <b>videoconferencing</b> <b>equipment</b> may pose strain on the limited financial resources of rural areas, the availability of more advanced and cheaper communication channels, direct two-way audio, and electronic video streaming between rural and more developed urban and metropolitan health centers through computers have led to more economical options.|$|E
30|$|Ultrasound is a {{portable}} (often hand or pocket-carried) noninvasive, cost-effective, multidisciplinary/multisystem diagnostic and resuscitative tool that has potential applicability {{in nearly every}} aspect of patient care [1 – 3]. Tele-ultrasound is a specific form of telemedicine that uses informatics advances to separate the patient from the expert interpreting the ultrasound findings, using techniques that are supported through teleconferencing technology [4]. The teleconferencing equipment to facilitate this is currently ‘big business’ as many health services in developed countries invest {{in it for the}} future. <b>Videoconferencing</b> (VC) <b>equipment,</b> however, can be notoriously expensive and can involve large start-up costs that discourage many health care systems as does the personal time commitment needed to respond to a call considering individual healthcare providers. Costs have been identified as one of the main barriers to the implementation of telemedicine, particularly for developing countries who would likely benefit the most from this technology [5].|$|R
40|$|In Norway, it is a {{national}} goal to provide more patients with thrombolytic treatment. A referring hospital and a specialist hospital have implemented <b>videoconferencing</b> (VC) <b>equipment</b> to share knowledge and discuss stroke patients, regarding thrombolytic treatment. VC has only been used four times within the 19 months that the service has been available. The objective {{in this article is}} to increase the understanding of the contradiction between the need for knowledge-sharing through VC technology, as well as the reasons for low frequency of use when discussing stroke patients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 professionals. The results illustrate how the technology per se is not the reason for the low frequency use. Health care is shaped by behavior, traditional rules, standards and division of labor. By using cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) as a framework, we illustrate the importance of understanding the historic way of performing an activity to be able to expand the treatment activity in the future...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the feasibility of telegeriatrics as a service method for use in cognitive assessment of older adults living in rural or regional areas. The Mt Isa region {{was chosen as the}} site for a five-month pilot trial. Mt Isa is 1800 km from Brisbane. Prior to the commencement of the pilot, patients could travel up to 12 h (by car and plane) to attend a consultation with the nearest geriatrician. Local staff in Mt Isa collected the preparatory paperwork, followed up referrals and appointments, and coordinated the access to <b>videoconference</b> <b>equipment</b> in the Mt Isa region. A second staff member from the Academic Unit in Geriatric Medicine coordinated appointments and equipment access for the geriatrician in Brisbane. Nine patients from the Mt Isa region were identified for a geriatrician consultation based on concerns regarding their memory. All {{agreed to participate in the}} trial. Two were male. The mean Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) score was 19 (SD 6), range 7 – 28. Each patient was referred for the consultation by their general practitioner (GP). The service model consisted of a local clinic nurse administering a battery of standardized assessments with the patient. These were faxed to the geriatrician in Brisbane, along with the referral letter and a patient history. If a computed tomography scan was available, it was electronically transmitted to the geriatrician. The clinic nurse established the videoconference connection to commence the consultation. Each consultation consisted of: (1) a summary of the current patient provided by the clinic nurse; (2) an interview with the patient and carer; (3) a summary of observations from the geriatrician (without the patient and carer present) and a discussion of any administrative details (e. g. the next appointment). The patient interview time varied, depending on case complexity (approximately 30 – 60 min). The geriatrician communicated with the GP via follow-up letter. On one occasion, a GP contacted the geriatrician for additional information. Connections for the video consultation were made via either IP or ISDN. No interviews were terminated as a result of technical difficulties, although two appointments were delayed (by up to 15 min) because of communication errors. The study shows that the practical elements of running a telegeriatric service can be coordinated between a remote and central site, ensuring that cognitive assessments can be carried out via videoconference for rural patients. The clinic model was found to be feasible and will be used in a larger study of the validity of telegeriatric cognitive assessment...|$|R
