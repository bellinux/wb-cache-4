5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the <b>variety</b> <b>in</b> plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German <b>variety</b> <b>in</b> favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{extension}} problems, averaging problems, and generalized Erdos-Falconer distance {{problems associated with}} arbitrary homogeneous <b>varieties</b> <b>in</b> three dimensional vector space over finite fields. In the case when homogeneous <b>varieties</b> <b>in</b> three dimension do not contain any plane passing through the origin, we obtain the general best possible results on aforementioned three problems. In particular, our results on extension problems recover and generalize the work due to Mockenhaupt and Tao who completed the particular conical extension problems in three dimension. Investigating the Fourier decay on homogeneous varieties, we give the complete mapping properties of averaging operators over homogeneous <b>varieties</b> <b>in</b> three dimension. In addition, studying the generalized Erdős-Falconer distance problems related to homogeneous <b>varieties</b> <b>in</b> three dimensions, we improve the cardinality condition on sets where the size of distance sets is nontrivial. Finally, we address a question of our problems for homogeneous <b>varieties</b> <b>in</b> higher odd dimensions. Comment: 18 page...|$|R

5|$|According to Vrba, the impala {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form {{for at least}} five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, <b>variety</b> <b>in</b> diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could {{have played a role in}} preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape <b>variety</b> <b>in</b> Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission.

5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of <b>variety</b> <b>in</b> the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E
