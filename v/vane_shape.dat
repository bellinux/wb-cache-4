The influence of <b>vane</b> <b>shape</b> on the hydrodynamic {{performance of}} a diffuser has been studied. The goal of this effort has been to improve the {{performance of a}} pump stage by optimizing the shape of the diffuser vanes. The shape of the vanes was defined using Bezier curves and circular arcs. Surrogate model based tools were used to identify regions of the vane that have a strong influence on its performance. Optimization of the <b>vane</b> <b>shape,</b> in the absence of manufacturing and stress constraints, led to a nearly 8 % reduction in the total pressure losses compared to the baseline design by reducing the base separation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The VTG system accelerates and maneuvers exhaust gas flow to the turbine. Favorable flow conditions at turbine inlet created by <b>vane</b> <b>shape</b> improve turbine performance. At lower engine speed, {{it is observed that}} the pressure drop across vane system influences overall efficiency. Whereas at higher speed, the pressure drop and guide vane exit flow angle are found to determine the turbine efficiency. Successful practical operation of VTG system also depends on its ability to smoothly open and close the vanes at different gas loads. Stator <b>vane</b> <b>shape</b> greatly influences the smooth operability/controllability of vane system. In the present work, 3 symmetric vanes with different T/C ratios and 2 asymmetric vanes are analyzed. The effect of geometric changes is studied from overall turbine performance as well as VTG system performance perspective. It is observed that symmetric vanes cause higher pressure drop at lower speeds leading to lower efficiency irrespective of the vane width. It is also observed that the pressure drop characteristics and vane exit flow angle are better with the asymmetric vanes, whereas the controllability of symmetric vanes is found to be superior. Analysis methodology is presented for achieving the best compromise between performance and controllability by the modification of vane geometric parameters through CFD simulations...|$|E

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} the {{conventional}} source of clean {{and renewable energy}} {{and it is the}} fastest-growing source of sustainable energy in the world. Numerical computation can offer important insight and data that are either difficult or expensive to measure or to perform tests experimentally. In this dissertation, we used the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to present effects of the Omni Direction Guide <b>Vane</b> <b>shape</b> on the performance of a H-rotor Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT). For this purpose, five straight-bladed VAWTs have been simulated via the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Hence, the VAWTs without the ODGV covering were simulated and validated via the Experimental Fluid Dynamics (EFD) data. The grid and time step independence test, as well as the effect of the domain size and turbulence model have been conducted. In the next step, the VAWT was shrouded by the ODGV cover and simulated by the coupling of the CFD and RSM method in different shapes and angle conditions. Results of this study indicates that the output power of the VAWT with α= 55 º and β= 20 º ODGV guide vanes angles has been improved by 12 %, 56 % and 29 % respectively at three different TSRs including 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6. Furthermore, all the shape ratios had a positive effect on the power and torque coefficient improvement when the TSR is higher than one. Moreover, results showed that the best case has a shape ratio of 0. 55, which improves the power coefficient by 56 %. In the final step, result of the optimized ODGV was compared with three different types of guide vanes in different flow angles. Results showed an optimized ODGV had the best improvement in terms of performance of the VAWT compared to the 4, 5, 6 bladed ODGVs.

40|$|The {{influence}} of swirler design parameters namely, <b>vane</b> <b>shape</b> (flat or curved), vane outlet angle, aspect ratio and space-to-chord ratio (number of vanes), on the pressure drop-mass flow characteristics {{and the size}} and turbulence characteristics of the downstream recirculation region has been determined experimentally. A five-hole spherical pressure probe and hot-wire anemometry {{have been used for}} the investigation. A technique for simple and reasonably accurate interpretation of the signals from the hot-wire anemometer has been formulated. Its performance has been tested at first in round jets for which experimental turbulence data are already available for comparison purposes. The method has been applied subsequently to swirling flows issuing from the swirlers; the mean and turbulence characteristics of the flow fields have been determined in this way. In addition to these, the turbulent viscosities Ĭrr, Ĭrz, Ĭrθ and Ĭθθ have been calculated. Also, detailed accounts of the previous experimental work on swirling flows and of some finite difference procedures for the computation of weakly and strongly swirling flows have been given. It has been shown that the hot-wire formulation developed provides a simple, economic and efficient procedure for the measurement of the turbulence quantities in swirling flows. The results have shown that curved vane type swirlers operate more efficiently than flat vane types such that a larger recirculation region and a stronger shear zone are induced at a lower pressure drop. The pressure drop through both the flat and curved vane type swirlers increases with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratio. The size of the downstream recirculation region, the reverse mass flow and the decay rates of the axial and swirl velocities increase with increasing vane angle and decreasing aspect ratio in the case of curved vane type swirlers. The effect of the space-to-chord ratio has not been found very significant in the cases of I 6 and I 2 vanes for the vane angle of 60 ° and the aspect ratio 0. 4. Higher turbulence and stronger shear zones can be obtained in swirling flows with increasing vane angle, decreasing aspect ratio and decreasing space-to-chord ratios. Turbulence is anisotropic in strongly swirling jets issuing from vane type swirlers. The most dominant stresses are in turn ww, uw, and uu; all the other stresses are smaller. In parallel to the anisotropy in the stresses, the turbulent viscosities are also anisotropic; the turbulent viscosity Ĭθθ has shown domination among the four viscosities which have been calculated. Ĭrr values have shown too much scatter. For these reasons, curved vane type swirlers should prove much more efficient than flat vane types in the application to combustion process...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} {{investigation of the}} shock-IGV (inlet guide vane) interaction in a transonic compressor is conducted at the Laboratoire de Thermique Appliquée et de Turbomachines (LTT) at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The objective of the presented research work {{is to determine the}} impact of the upstream propagating shock pattern of an axial transonic compressor rotor on an aerodynamically loaded IGV and the influence of this interacting process on the compressor flow field for different operating points and aerodynamic setups. For the approach to the subject, a literature review shed light on the different research efforts over the past years. A large numerical study is conducted including the work with two different flow solvers. A numerical 3 D transient analysis (commercial code) was conducted in order to provide information about the influence of the axial spacing on the overall mass flow through the stage. A numerical Q- 3 D transient analysis (industry owned code) on one streamline at a constant rotor inlet Mach number is performed in order to compare the shock-IGV interaction for different vane types similar to what is known in literature. A semi-analytical model was developed in order to evaluate in a fast approach the impact of a rotor bow shock on an upstream situated vane. The results of the numerical investigation can be summarized as following: The overall results of this investigation show that the upstream vane of a transonic compressor rotor transforms the rotor forcing function into an excitation with <b>vane</b> <b>shape</b> depending orientation and force. The time averaged flow field of the IGV does not show a measurable change of the exit flow angle due to the shock-IGV interaction for the studied operating points and axial distances. The 3 D transient calculations do not show any influence of the examined axial spacing between vane and blade on the mass flow rate through the stage. The results of the Q 3 D analysis are compared with the semi-analytic approach and the measurements, both showing with some restrictions good accordance to the model. The results of the numerical investigation give an accurate prediction of the transient aerodynamic load of the upstream vane. An analytic tool was developed which uses three input parameters, the rotor relative inlet Mach number, the stagger angle of the rotor and the axial spacing between vane and rotor in order to provide an estimation of the amplitude of the pressure variation on the upstream situated vane. An extensive modification of the existing test facility of the LTT precedes the experimental study. The main steps of the approach are: A subsonic axial compressor test facility was modified to allow test runs at transonic rotor inlet conditions. A perfect leak tightness of the closed circuit was accomplished to enable its operation in heavy gas. Heavy gases like refrigerants have been used in many studies for compressor testing. While respecting certain restrictions during the use of heavy gas, a reduction of operation and manufacturing costs of the facility is beneficial. A high molecular weight of the gas reduces the sonic speed to the half of that of air thus reducing the dimension and the rotational speed of the rotor significantly and consequently reduces the demand in the material quality of the blading. A 1. 5 stage transonic compressor had been designed and manufactured for the heavy gas (R 134 a) in a first step. Preliminary measurements showed that the influence of the downstream stator makes it difficult to separate the influence of shock-IGV interaction on the compressor flow field from loss generation mechanisms downstream of the rotor. Thus, the stator was removed and measurements were conducted in a one stage transonic compressor. Modifications on the construction of the testing setup are done {{in a way that the}} distance between IGV and rotor can be varied by means of spacers. Thus the flow can be determined for up to four different axial distances at varying rotational speed for different operating points. For transonic operation the time-dependent load of the IGV (inlet guide vane) due to the forcing function of the rotor bow shock was recorded with a high speed data acquisition system. The results of the experimental investigation can be summarized as following: No influence of the axial spacing on the efficiency and the mass flow was observed in the investigation. The operation characteristics remained equal between the minimum and the maximum vane-blade spacing. The measured global values of the stage are close to the values the design was made for, although the overall efficiency was generally lower than predicted. The experimental results of the pressure variation on the upstream vane agree well with the predicted values. The study in general showed a good matching between the numerical and the experimental investigation taking into account a rotor blade shape which is not optimized to the extend. The shock-vane interaction is responsible for an excitation of the entire vane blade. With decreasing distance between the rotor leading edge and vane trailing edge the excitation increases. The strength and orientation of the reflected shock/pressure wave part depends upon the <b>vane</b> <b>shape.</b> A more sophisticated design of the rotor blade shape should be in the focus of further investigations using this test facility at transonic rotor inlet conditions. Within this investigation a tool was developed in order to predict the load variation on the vane driven by the transient rotor forcing function. The tool maps the fact that the pressure on the vane surface oriented against rotational direction of the rotor exceeds the pressure of the passage shock due to the amplification effect of the reflection of the shock on a surface. Its possible application not only for compressors but also for turbine related topics should be an objective for similar investigations...|$|E
40|$|Small {{centrifugal}} compressors {{are more and}} more widely used in many industrialsystems because of their higher efficiency and better off-design performance comparing to piston and scroll compressors as while as higher work coefficient perstage than in axial compressors. Higher efficiency is always the aim of the designer of compressors. In the present work, the influence of four partsof a small centrifugal compressor that compresses heavy molecular weight real gas has been investigated in order to achieve higher efficiency. Two parts concern the impeller: tip clearance and the circumferential position of the splitter blade. The other two parts concern the diffuser: the pinch shape and <b>vane</b> <b>shape.</b> Computational fluid dynamics is applied in this study. The Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver Finflo is used. The quasi-steady approach is utilized. Chien's k-e turbulence model is used to model the turbulence. A new practical real gas model is presented in this study. The real gas model is easily generated, accuracy controllable and fairly fast. The numerical results and measurements show good agreement. The influence of tip clearance on the performance of a small compressor is obvious. The pressure ratio and efficiency are decreased as the size of tip clearance is increased, while the total enthalpy rise keeps almost constant. The decrement of the pressure ratio and efficiency is larger at higher mass flow rates and smaller at lower mass flow rates. The flow angles at the inlet and outlet of the impeller are increased as the size of tip clearance is increased. The results of the detailed flow field show that leakingflow is the main reason for the performance drop. The secondary flow region becomes larger as the size of tip clearance is increased and the area of the main flow is compressed. The flow uniformity is then decreased. A detailed study shows that the leaking flow rate is higher near the exit of the impeller than that near the inlet of the impeller. Based on this phenomenon, a new partiallyshrouded impeller is used. The impeller is shrouded near the exit of the impeller. The results show that the flow field near the exit of the impeller is greatly changed by the partially shrouded impeller, and better performance is achievedthan with the unshrouded impeller. The loading distribution on the impeller blade and the flow fields in the impeller is changed by moving the splitter of the impeller in circumferential direction. Moving the splitter slightly to the suction side of the long blade can improve the performance of the compressor. The total enthalpy rise is reduced if only {{the leading edge of the}} splitter ismoved to the suction side of the long blade. The performance of the compressor is decreased if the blade is bended from the radius direction at the leading edge of the splitter. The total pressure rise and the enthalpy rise of thecompressor are increased if pinch is used at the diffuser inlet. Among the fivedifferent pinch shape configurations, at design and lower mass flow rates the efficiency of a straight line pinch is the highest, while at higher mass flow rate, the efficiency of a concave pinch is the highest. The sharp corner of the pinch is the main reason for the decrease of efficiency and should be avoided. The variation of the flow angles entering the diffuser in spanwise direction is decreased if pinch is applied. A three-dimensional low solidity twisted vaned diffuser is designed to match the flow angles entering the diffuser. The numerical results show that the pressure recovery in the twisted diffuser is higher than in a conventional low solidity vaned diffuser, which also leads to higher efficiency of the twisted diffuser. Investigation of the detailed flow fields shows that the separation at lower mass flow rate in the twisted diffuser is later than in the conventional low solidity vaned diffuser, which leads to a possible wider flow range of the twisted diffuser...|$|E

Experiments were run in a closed loop high speed annular wind tunnel. Unsteady velocity data were measured with a three-dimensional Laser-Two-Focus anemometer between stator and rotor and downstream of the rotor. The unsteady part of the instantaneous velocity, the gust, is split into streamwise, transverse and radial components and harmonically decomposed. This data is compared to numerical results obtained with a quasi 3 D method (UNSFLO) and analysed regarding two aspects: the dependency of the gust on the changed parameters and the impact of the gust on the forcing function (blade excitation pressures) ...|$|R

40|$|In organisms, tissue {{development}} and maintenance must be precisely timed and spatially coordinated to ensure proper form and function. This {{can be difficult}} both to develop and to maintain in the complex environments present in organisms, and thus a mechanism that can be finely tuned and regulated must be present. Therefore, when studying the underlying principles of morphogenesis, {{it is important to}} consider the crucial biochemical, cellular, and tissue scales simultaneously. This creates a need for a mathematical and computational approach to understanding the complex biology of development. One way of achieving a high level of precision of control is through stem cell lineages. These lineages employ the use of stem cells and their progeny to maintain certain properties necessary for proper tissue function. One such system is found in the stratified inter-follicular epidermis. Here, we develop and use a two dimensional, multi-scale, cell lineage model to explore the molecular, cellular, and physical properties of healthy and diseased epidermis. The model recapitulates a variety of healthy epithelial tissue shapes, including the formation and maintenance of undulating structures, known as rete-ridges. We find that the dermis compliance and the cell-cell adhesion at the dermis-epidermis junction, in conjunction with internal physical pressures due to cell lineage dynamics, play an important role in the tissue morphology. We explore these dynamics to get a better understanding of morphological changes found in diseased skin, including thickening of the tissue and deformation of rete-ridges. Another system in which the molecular mechanisms and cell dynamics driving morphogenesis remains unclear is in diversification of feather <b>vane</b> <b>shapes.</b> Here, we integrate a two dimensional, multi modular mathematical model with transcriptome profiling to elucidate the anisotropic signaling modules which break symmetry, alter cell shape, and generate diverse feather shapes.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{developments in}} gas turbine materials and cooling technologies allowed the steady increase in combustor outlet temperature and hence in gas turbine efficiency {{over the last}} half century. However, the efficiency benefits of higher gas temperature, even at the current levels, are significantly offset by the increased losses associated with the required cooling. Additionally, the advancements in gas turbine cooling technology have introduced considerable complexities into turbine design and manufacture. Therefore, a reduction in cooling requirements for the current gas temperature levels is a possible way for gas turbine designers to achieve even higher efficiency levels. The leading edges of the first turbine vane are exposed to high heat loads. The high coolant requirements and geometry constrains limit the possible arrangement of the multiple rows of film cooling holes in the co called showerhead region. Many different showerhead configurations have been tested, varying the number of rows of holes, holes inclination angle and shape, etc. However {{it is hard to}} believe that the present leading edge cooling strategy using showerheads can allow further increase in turbine temperature without excessive use of coolant air. Therefore new cooling strategies for the first vane have to be investigated. In gas turbines with multiple combustor chambers around the annulus the transition duct walls can be used to shield, i. e. protect the first vane leading edges from the high heat loads. In this way the stagnation region at the leading edge and the showerhead of film cooling holes can be completely removed and the total amount of cooling air can be significantly reduced. By eliminating the showerhead the shielding concept significantly simplifies the design and lowers the manufacturing costs. This paper numerically analyses potentials of the leading edge shielding concept for cooling air reduction. Different shielding arrangements and <b>vane</b> <b>shapes</b> were numerically studied. It was concluded that significant reduction of the cooling air can be achieved. It was also found that the internal cooling architecture of the first vane can be simplified and that the new cooling arrangement does not adversely affect the vane aerodynamics...|$|R
40|$|Results from {{experimental}} work on model scale cascade reversers with cold airflow are presented. Sound power level directivity and spectral characteristics for cascade reversers are reported. Effect of cascade exit area ratio, <b>vane</b> profile <b>shape,</b> and emission arc are discussed. Model equivalent diameters varied from 3 to 5 inches, pressure ratios range from 1. 15 to 3. 0. Depending on the reverser type, acoustic power was {{proportional to the}} 4 1 / 2 to 6 th power of ideal jet velocity. Reverser noise peaked at higher frequency and was more omnidirectional than nozzle-alone jet noise. Appreciable reduction in sideline noise was obtained from plane shields. Airfoil-vaned cascades were the most aerodynamically efficient and least noisy reversers. Scaling of cascade reverser data to example aircraft engines showed all cascades above the 95 PNdB sideline goal from STOL aircraft. However, the airfoil-vaned reverser has a good potential for meeting this goal for high-bypass (low pressure ratio) exhausts...|$|R
