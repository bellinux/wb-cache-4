5|$|Chrysolina graminis and C. herbacea {{are similar}} in size and colour and may be {{confused}} in UK populations. Distinguishing the two species in the United Kingdom is particularly important as C. graminis is a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species</b> whereas C. herbacea is much more common. This has previously led to the misidentification of C. herbacea as C. graminis. C. herbacea measures 7–11mm in length. It is coloured iridescent green on dorsal surface throughout. The punctuation on the pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar, unlike in C. graminis. There is a smooth lip running only half {{the length of the}} ventral edge of the elytra, whereas this lip runs the full length on C. graminis.|$|E
5|$|Found {{mainly in}} Central and Southern Europe {{as well as}} North Africa, Boletus aereus is rare in colder climates such as England, and {{classified}} as a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species</b> in the Czech Republic. Boletus aereus can be locally abundant; {{it is the most}} common bolete in the woodlands of Madonie Regional Natural Park in northern Sicily. In contrast, it has been placed on a provisional Red List of endangered species of Montenegro. Boletus aereus has been reported from several other island ecosystems across the Mediterranean, such as Corsica, Cyprus, Lesvos, and Naxos.|$|E
5|$|Hyndum repandum is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus. The fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} {{on the ground or}} in leaf litter in both coniferous and deciduous forests.

5|$|The {{great white}} shark has no known natural predators other than, on very rare occasion, the killer whale. The {{great white shark}} is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, {{and is one of}} the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, {{including}} fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans. The IUCN list the great white shark as a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species,</b> while it is included in AppendixII of CITES.|$|E
5|$|The impala {{occurs in}} {{woodlands}} and sometimes {{on the interface}} (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places close to water. While the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in Gabon and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species,</b> with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that common hippos in Africa experienced a marked population expansion during or after the Pleistocene, attributed {{to an increase in}} water bodies {{at the end of the}} era. These findings have important conservation implications as hippo populations across the continent are currently threatened by loss of access to fresh water. Hippos are also subject to unregulated hunting and poaching. In May 2006, the hippopotamus was identified as a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species</b> on the IUCN Red List drawn up by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of between 125,000 and 150,000 hippos, a decline of between 7% and 20% since the IUCN's 1996 study. Zambia (40,000) and Tanzania (20,000–30,000) possess the largest populations.|$|E

5|$|Green rosellas were {{regularly}} captured and kept as pets {{until the early}} 20th century. The species {{is reported to be}} hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species,</b> which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5m (15ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{the green}} rosella was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range—greater than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)—and small rate of decline in population. The King Island {{subspecies}} is listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as vulnerable, and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species,</b> which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E
5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species does appear to be declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, which is considered a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species</b> by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species.</b> Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western pond turtle, the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
5|$|Sitta przewalskii {{is not yet}} {{treated as}} an {{independent}} species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its threat level is not evaluated by either. Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet, because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species. Concomitantly, it takes on its parent category of least concern. As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species</b> may be warranted.|$|E
5|$|The golden swallow (Tachycineta euchrysea) is a {{passerine}} in the swallow family, Hirundinidae. Two subspecies are recognised, the Jamaican T. e. euchrysea and T. e. sclateri of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). It usually inhabits {{the hills}} {{on the interior}} of islands, preferring open country. Currently, this swallow is restricted to isolated montane forests that primarily consist of the Hispaniolan pine. This species {{is considered to be}} a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>species</b> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although the nominate subspecies, T. e. euchrysea, is likely extinct. The exact cause of extinction is unknown, but likely factors include predation by mammals and habitat loss, although the habitat loss theory is not supported by very much evidence. The last sighting of the nominate subspecies was in Hardwar Gap (located on the boundary between Saint Andrew and Portland parishes), with three birds being seen on 8 June 1989.|$|E
