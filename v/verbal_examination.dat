This project aimed to develop, refine and validate a tool based on the pharmacy threshold learning outcomes (TLOs) to facilitate benchmarking of students' performances in verbal 'capstone' assessments in Australian pharmacy programs. A pilot tool was developed and trialled by local and external examiners during the University of Tasmania (UTAS) 2013 Bachelor of Pharmacy Fourth Year <b>verbal</b> <b>examinations.</b> Usability and acceptability were assessed using a survey and the tool was evaluated for validity and inter- and intra-rater reliability using Pearson correlation coefficients (R). The tool was refined using these results, and a validation exercise is planned for late 2014. Results: In the initial evaluation, agreement on TLO scoring was excellent between UTAS examiners (R values 0. 73 - 0. 88; n= 29 comparisons); and very good between the Tasmanian and external examiners for most TLOs (R= 0. 59 - 0. 68; n= 12). Agreement between allocated marks and TLO scores were also very good (R= 0. 62 - 0. 85; n= 29). Survey results recommended improving alignment of the TLOs with the assessment activity, simplifying the rating scales and providing training regarding the tool. Discussion: Progress is underway towards the development of a relatively simple, flexible and validated benchmarking tool to facilitate high quality student outcomes across Australian pharmacy programs. Training {{in the use of the}} tool has been identified as a major enabler of its successful and consistent application, and a scenario-based training video is currently being produced.

The PrE theory {{of coping with}} threat emphasizes the relationship between level of appraised threat relative to person resources and personal responsibility. This theory has previously been used to investigate the impact of negative threat appeals on preparedness behavior regarding both earthquakes and tornadoes. PrE theory predicts differences in coping behavior based on level of threat under various conditions of personal responsibility. The present investigation was conducted to verify predictions made by PrE theory when applied to a non-disaster topic (academic assessment). College students (N. 65) responded to a questionnaire regarding a <b>verbal</b> assessment <b>examination.</b> Procedures, analysis by MANOVA, and results are described. Support for the theory in both intentions as well as actual preparedness behavior is indicated by results.

40|$|One {{fifth of}} the {{complaints}} voiced by patients of Dutch general practitioners (GPs) consists of psychosocial problems. In most cases these complaints are presented in physical terms. This thesis examines {{the way in which}} GPs and patients relate physical complaints to psychosocial aspects. It is an explorative, descriptive study in conversation analysis in which the research materials consist of videotaped conversations between GPs and patients. Chapter 2 presents a survey of the literature on the communication between GPs and patients. From the late sixties onwards, researchers of various disciplines have studied many aspects of this communication. Among other things, various styles of communication and the relationship between communication and patient satisfaction have been studied. These studies differ not only with respect to their subject, but also with respect to their methodological aspects. On the basis of the methodology adopted, I make a distinction between quantitative studies and qualitative studies. The first type of research focuses on determining the extent of certain communicative behaviours, for example the amount of information provided by the GP. Such studies involve large numbers of interactions, in which the conversation is scored by means of an observation system, after which the scores are subjected to statistical analyses. The second type of research focuses on the description of certain aspects of communication, for example the way in which GPs present information. These studies involve small numbers of consultations, and the communication is usually recorded verbatim, after which it is analysed in detail. I have chosen the latter methodology — more specifically conversation analysis — for the study presented here. Chapter 2 further presents {{a detailed description of the}} methodology of conversation analysis. This methodology originated as a branch of sociology in which recorded natural discourse is studied to investigate the way in which the participants continually accomplish the interaction they are engaged in and the methods they use for doing so. Chapter 3 centres around psychosocial problems in the general medical practice. A large proportion of the complaints voiced by patients to GPs consists of psychosocial problems. Various terms and definitions have been formulated to describe this concept, and various measurements have been used to determine the extent of such problems. Usually the opinion of the GP is used to determine whether the problems are psychosocial in nature. However, GPs differ in their judgment about the number of psychosocial problems they are confronted with, since psychosocial problems cannot be simply classified as a particular symptom or disease. They consist of a complex interplay between somatic and psychosocial aspects of the patients’ complaints. I have opted for the term ‘psychosocial aspects’, which I define as all the aspects of the complaint that are related to the patient’s living situation or biography. Literature on consulting pays little attention to psychosocial aspects, and empirical studies of the way in which psychosocial aspects of consultations are dealt with are few and far between. The research presented here aims to fill this lacuna. It describes the way in which GPs and patients discuss psychosocial aspects during the consultation. Only those consultations in which such aspects were actually discussed have been included in the study. The sample was further reduced by including only those consultations in which the patients present with physical complaints that are somehow related to psychosocial aspects, since most patients couch their psychosocial problems in physical terms. Finally, I only included those consultations in which the psychosocial aspects were seen as the factor causing the patient’s complaints. The research question therefore is: how do GPs and patients relate physical complaints to psychosocial causes in the course of the consultation? A total of 279 consultations of eight GPs were recorded on videotape. Twenty-four of these were selected for analysis, namely the first three consultations of each GP in which a patient presented with physical symptoms that were subsequently related to a psychosocial cause. Each of these consultations was then transcribed verbatim for the purpose of detailed analysis. After each consultation the patient was asked to fill out a questionnaire. It is interesting that these patients do not always indicate that psychosocial aspects had been a topic of conversation. Chapters 4 to 8 describe the empirical research. I examine the ways in which patients and GPs bring up psychosocial aspects of the complaint. Chapter 8 deals with the treatment phase of the consultation. Chapter 4 describes the way in which patients relate their physical complaints to psychosocial causes. Patients usually present their symptoms at the beginning of the consultation. In terms of their function, these presentations of the complaint can be regarded as reports. I distinguish between two types of reports: general reports and specifying reports. General reporting usually occurs at the beginning of the consultation when the patient initially voices his or her complaint. Specifying reports occur at a later stage, usually in response to questions asked by the GP about specific aspects of the complaint. In both types of patient report psychosocial causes of the complaint may be mentioned. I call such patient utterances explanations’, and I make a distinction between explanations and diagnoses, since a diagnosis labels’ a particular complaint as a particular type of disease, while an explanation defines a causal relationship between a complaint and a specific fact. Since psychosocial problems cannot simply be classified as symptoms or diseases (chapter 3), I use the term psychosocial explanations’. Patients may present two kinds of psychosocial explanations. In explicit explanations patients explicitly mark a causal relationship between a psychosocial cause and a complaint. In implicit explanations patiets present psychosocial facts or events, by which they suggest a potential causal relationship between these facts or events and the complaint. Chapters 5 and 6 describe the ways in which patients present explicit and implicit explanations. Explicit explanations are the topic of chapter 5. Such explanations have four components: the complaint (’a headache’); causal relationship (’caused by’); cause (’stress’); and an elucidation of the causes. These elements may be arranged in two ways: either the elucidation is part of an initial report before the cause is mentioned, followed by the causal relationship and the complaint (’i think, well, that must be what caused it’), or the elucidation is given in a report presented after the complaint, the causal relationship and an explicit mention of the causes (’i myself think it may have something to do with ( [...] .) there has been some aggravation at school’). There are two types of explicit explanations: stated explanations and rejected explanations. Rejected explanations are a means through which the patient indicates that his or her symptoms are not caused by a particular psychosocial aspect (’i didn’t get this because of stress’). Such rejections may be explicit or implicit. In the former case, patients explicitly state that their symptoms are not caused by a specific psychosocial aspect. In the latter case, they present a psychosocial explanation which is then followed by ’but’ and a subordinate clause in which the explanation is implicitly refuted (’I thought it was stress, but I no longer experience any’). In other words, an expectation is denied, as it were. It appears that patients generally feel it is not necessary to elaborate on potential causes once they have rejected them. The explanations given can be further divided into outspoken explanations and candidate explanations. In the former case, the explanations are formulated as plain statements (’this is caused by tension because of our daughter’). In the latter case, the statements are formulated more prudently (’i think the stress just became too much’). The last type of explanation is common in our corpus, which illustrates that patients are cautious when presenting statements about causality in connection with their complaints, even though these explanations relate to their living situation. They present their own subjective lay opinions with caution, thereby showing that they regard the act of ‘explaining’ as part of the professional responsibilities of the GP. The discourse function of the candidate explanations is that they are presented to the GP so that he or she can judge them. They are often not direct statements, but couched in the form of a quasi-question. To the patient, the function of the rejected explanation is on the one hand a justification for going to the GP, and on the other hand an attempt to induce the GP to provide an explanation. A rejected psychosocial explanation also paves the way for a somatic explanation of the problem and a somatic solution. At the end of chapter 5 I describe the ways in which GPs respond to the explanations given by the patients. The GP’s judgment depends on the phase of the consultation in which the explanation is presented. The elucidation of the explanation also plays an important part. GPs respond to explanations without prior elucidation by giving the patient opportunities for elaborating on the explanation, without presenting an opinion themselves. It seems as if GPs use elements from the explanation to initiate the process of testing its accuracy. Through their responses GPs reveal their professional identity vis-à-vis the activity of ‘explaining’ during the consultation. Chapter 6 describes the implicit explanations, in which patients present descriptions of psychosocial aspects or circumstances that may be the cause of their symptoms. The patient’s reporting therefore has a potentially dual function: in the context of describing or elucidating the complaint, the patient may simultaneously offer an implicit explanation for the complaint. In other words, patients may present potentially explanatory statements that are subsequently transformed to a psychosocial explanation by the GP. The patient’s implicit statements are essentially a kind of indirect use of language. Conversation analysis assumes that participants in a conversation create meaning through a process of negotiation. Meaning is seen as a result of methodic interactional work. This means that when a speaker performs an implicit act, it depends on the listener whether he or she will respond to the message implicit in the act. This can be gleaned from the listener’s response. Patient reports can be characterized as a specific type of indirect language. They have the potential to be understood and treated as an explanation, but it is ultimately the GP who determines whether the report is regarded as such or not. Through their use of implicit statements patients show that they regard the presentation of explanations as a delicate affair. They use the potentially dual function of reports since, strictly speaking, the patients only report information. They leave it to the GP to infer the explanation from the report. In the same way as with explicit explanations, patients show that they regard the activity of ‘explaining’ as part of the GP’s professional responsibilities. It appears that GPs very rarely distil the potential explanation from the report. Usually they treat the report as information, by responding with silences, phatic utterances (’yes’), or by incorporating elements of the report in follow-up questions. Only in one consultation did the GP immediately infer a potential explanation from the patient’s report. It subsequently turned out, however, that the patient had not implied an explanation in her report. Unprompted, patients may present explanatory material in a global report that has the potential to be understood as an explanation. By using the explanatory potential of reports, GPs may strategically guide patients in the direction of a psychosocial explanation. They may ask questions about psychosocial circumstances, so that the patient is provided with the opportunity to come up with a specific psychosocial report, and subsequently convert elements from the report into a psychosocial explanation. This is one of the ways in which GPs can bring up psychosocial explanations for the patient’s complaint. Chapter 7 describes two other ways in which GPs can achieve this. It appears that they always do so in the form of questions, which I call ‘cause-seeking queries’. In this respect, psychosocial explanations differ from somatic explanations. The latter are nearly always presented in the form of assertions, while cause-seeking queries are always couched in cautious terms. I distinguish two types of cause-seeking queries: the exploratory query and the verificatory query. The two differ with respect to their formulation and their place within the consultation. The follow-up to these questions also differs. In verificatory queries (’do you think this may also have something to do with stress?’), the GP mentions a psychosocial fact that may be the cause of the patient’s complaint. In this way, he or she explicitly leads up to a psychosocial explanation of the complaint. These questions are always couched in cautious terms. The word ’also’, for example, is often used to qualify the statement. The verificatory queries are often posed at the end of the consultation. If they are part of the <b>verbal</b> <b>examination</b> phase of the consultation, the GP uses a lengthy introduction to lead up to the question, to justify it and to initiate another activity. Patients respond to this type of question with cautiously formulated confirmations or denials. GPs use exploratory queries (’have you any idea how this came about?’) to explore the knowledge and insights of the patient concerning possible causes of the complaint. This type of question is always posed in the <b>verbal</b> <b>examination</b> phase. By means of ’and’ and ’but’ at the beginning of these questions GPs demarcates a transition to the activity of explanation-seeking. In response to these questions, patients always indicate that they do not know the cause of their symptoms. The subsequent actions of the GPs show that they use these queries to search for a psychosocial explanation. After listening to the patient’s response, they initiate a domain checklist strategy to investigate potential psychosocial causes. This strategy consists of a series of questions in which various psychosocial domains are checked. The GP then tries to relate the answers to the complaint. However, patients often respond negatively to domain checklist questions, which makes it impossible to reformulate their responses as an explanation for the complaint. It appears, therefore, that the strategy is hardly effective. The use of such a domain checklist strategy indicates that GPs use exploratory queries to implicitly lead up to a psychosocial explanation. Verificatory queries appear to be more effective for determining a mutual psychosocial explanation than exploratory queries. In other words, there is a relationship between the degree of explicitness displayed by the GP on the one hand and the degree of agreement or denial in the patients’ responses to cause-seeking queries on the other hand. It is currently being questioned whether GPs should investigate potential psychosocial causes of symptoms if patients do not bring up this issue themselves. It seems more useful, however, to investigate how GPs do so than to decide if they should do so. Chapter 8 describes the effects of the success or failure to find a psychosocial explanation. What kind of advice or treatment is given? It appears that in nearly all cases GPs give more than one piece of advice or suggest more than one therapy. Even in consultations where a psychosocial explanation is found, GPs still appear to focus on the somatic aspects of the complaint. They will hardly ever give advice about a healthy lifestyle or refer the patient to mental health care. The consultations themselves contain extensive psychotherapeutic episodes. This means that part of the treatment of the psychosocial causes probably occurs immediately. The data further indicates that there is no one-to-one relationship between the type of explanation offered for the complaint and the type of advice or treatment that follows. The analysis shows that GPs and patients depend on each other for the formulation of the explanation, and also for the type of advice or treatment that is suggested in the course of the consultation. Chapter 9 concludes the thesis and presents the conclusions. The two main discourse aspects substantiated by the data are: 1. 	GPs and patients are cautious in their formulation of psychosocial explanations. Psychosocial explanations are formulated and treated in the interaction as delicate activities. Because GPs and patients deal with psychosocial explanations in this way, such explanations become a delicate topic within the context of the consultation. 2. 	Both GP and patient depend on the judgment of the other to come to a psychosocial evaluation of the complaint. In other words, psychosocial explanations are accomplished within the interaction through mutual efforts. The data shows that psychosocial explanations offered by the patient have a greater chance of confirmation than explanations offered by the GP. This confirmation is usually couched in cautious terms, which enhances the delicate nature of the psychosocial explanations even more. I suggest that this delicacy is not only caused by the language used by GPs and patients, but also by the fact that psychosocial subjects are intrinsically delicate in nature, which is why they are dealt with in this way. In other words, their delicate nature is not only reproduced as part of the interaction but reconfirmed. Therefore, psychosocial explanations may be said to be caught in a cumulative vicious circle of delicacy. GPs contribute more to this delicacy than their patients, because of the way in which they implicitly lead up to psychosocial explanations by posing cause-seeking queries and then applying a domain checklist strategy. Moreover, such queries appear to be hardly effective for the mutual determination of a psychosocial cause. Since the data shows that the formulation of a psychosocial explanation has little influence on the type of advice given by the GP, I finally conclude that during the consultation GPs are clearly seeking for psychosocial explanations but do not transfer these explanations to the realm of advice or treatment. The thesis ends with some practical implications for GPs and their training and recommendations for further research. The main advice with regards to GP behaviour concerns the way in which they seek to establish psychosocial explanations. If a GP has a strong notion about a possible psychosocial cause, I recommend that he or she explicitly mention this explanation. In addition, I discuss the relationship between the literature on consulting and the research findings. Some types of advice mentioned in the literature are confirmed by the data, others will have to be reconsidered. Future research into interaction and psychosocial problems should focus on somatic explanations and on the relationship between the consultation and therapy compliance. ...|$|E

Significance of the Study This study was expected to increase the body of knowledge in the area of prediction of academic performance and criteria selection for use in doctoral programs. Hypotheses Four hypotheses were tested. Null hypotheses one. two. and three involved bivariate analyses of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Miller Analogies Test (MAT). and academic performance (GGPA). The fourth null hypothesis employed the same variables in a multiple regression analysis. Subjects The subjects were nineteen doctoral graduates who completed graduate study during the years 1969 - 1983. in the Department of Psychological Services. School of Education at Atlanta University. Instruments The Miller Analogies Test (MAT) and the Graduate Record <b>Examination</b> <b>Verbal</b> and Quantitative Aptitude Test scores were utilized in this study. Conclusions 1. Only the Graduate Record <b>Examination</b> <b>Verbal</b> (GRE-V) was significantly correlated with graduate grade pOint average (GGPA). It made the greatest contribution to the prediction of grade point average (GPA) and was the most consistent predictor variable when used with the GRE-Q and GRE-T. 2. The Miller Analogies Test (MAT) was not a predictor of successful academic performance (GGPA). 3. The GRE-V and GRE-T were statistically significantly correlated with the Miller Analogies Test (MAT), however, the Graduate Record Examination Quantitative (GRE-Q) was not statistically significantly correlated with the Miller Analogies Test (MAT). 4.

To discover whether graduate admissions information can predict a psychologist-trainee's ability to readily engage clients, data were collected over a 6 -year period from 43 c;inical psychology practicum students. The data included: (1) an engagement quotient (EQ) which is the percentage of clients returning to the trainee for more than one session; (2) age; (3) Graduate Record <b>Examination</b> <b>Verbal</b> score (GREV); (4) Graduate Record Examination Quantitative score (GREQ); (5) Miller Analogies Test score (MAT); (6) grades from two clinical diagnosis courses; and (7) a new variable created by subtracting the GREQ score from the GREV score (GREV-GREQ). The results showed that all variables correlated significantly with EQ. Age had the most predictive value followed by GREV scores, GREV-GREQ, and MAT scores. These findings suggest that higher engaging trainees, relative to lower engagers, have better verbal and diagnostic skills and also tend to be older. It appears, from these results, that high engagers can be identified at admission to graduate school and from certain course grades.

The aim {{of the current study}} is to evaluate the degree of cognitive impairment in a cohort of 22 CCFDN patients and its correlation with patients’ age, motor disability, ataxia, and neuroimaging changes. Twenty-two patients with genetically confirmed diagnosis of CCFDN underwent a detailed neurological <b>examination.</b> <b>Verbal</b> and nonverbal intelligence, memory, executive functions, and verbal fluency wеre assessed in all the patients aged 4 to 47 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 20 affected patients. Eighteen affected were classified as having mild intellectual deficit, whereas 4 had borderline intelligence. In all psychometric tests, evaluating different cognitive domains, CCFDN patients had statistically significant lower scores when compared to the healthy control group. All cognitive domains seemed equally affected. The main abnormalities on brain MRI found in 19 / 20 patients included diffuse cerebral atrophy, enlargement of the lateral ventricles, and focal lesions in the subcortical white matter, different in number and size, consistent with demyelination more pronounced in the older CCFDN patients. The correlation analysis of the structural brain changes and the cognitive impairment found a statistically significant correlation only between the impairment of short-term verbal memory and the MRI changes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{identified}} the admissions criteria for selected doctoral programs in vocational-technical education in Oklahoma and Texas and investigated {{the relationship of}} these criteria to success in the doctoral programs. Success in the doctoral programs was identified in terms of cumulative doctoral grade point average. Data were obtained through a questionnaire designed to ©licit both general information concerning admissions criteria for vocational-technical doctoral programs at the selected institutions and to collect specific information on {{a random sample of}} twenty doctoral candidates from each of the four selected institutions. Factors considered included birthdates, gender, scores on admissions tests, grade point average in the masters program, the year the latest masters was completed, number of colleges attended, and cumulative doctoral grade point average. A statistical analysis using nine separate one-way analyses of variance determined that four of the nine factors considered proved to be statistically significant at the. 05 level or better when correlated with the criterion variable (cumulative doctoral grade point average). Those factors were gender, Graduate Record <b>Examination</b> <b>verbal</b> and composite scores, and masters grade point average. The results of the study basically parallel findings of research concerning admissions criteria and success in graduate programs in other areas. Additional research efforts should address the issue of determining the most appropriate decision logic model for making admissions decisions in programs at the graduate levels...|$|R

The aims {{of this study was}} to assess the cognitive functions of institutionalized elderly with clinical diagnosis of depression and compare the severity of depressive symptoms with cognitive performance. From 120 residents at a nursing home in Rio Claro, Brazil, we study 23 individuals (mean age: 74. 3 years; mean schooling: 4. 0 years) with diagnosis of depression. At first, a clinical diagnosis of depression and measurement of its symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale were performed. The patient then underwent a neuropsychological assessment based on the following tests: Mini-Mental <b>Examination,</b> <b>Verbal</b> Fluency, Visual Perception, Immediate Memory, Recent Memory, Recognition, Clock Drawing Test. The patients were divided into two groups: those with less severe depression symptoms (Group 1 : N= 9) and more severe symptoms (Group 2 : N= 14). The significant difference between symptom severity of the two groups was p= 0. 0001. Patients with more severe symptoms revealed a slightly inferior cognitive performance in most of the tests when compared to those with less severe symptoms (p> 0. 05). In relation to Verbal Fluency, patients with more severe depression symptoms presented a significantly inferior cognitive performance when compared to those with less severe symptoms (p= 0. 0082). Verbal Fluency revealed to be a more sensitive test for measuring early cognitive alterations in institutionalized aged with depression, and appears to be a useful resource in monitoring the cognitive functions of patients faced with the risk of dementia. © Copyright Moreira Jr. Editora...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{presented in}} this thesis were designed to examine {{a number of issues}} raised by previous experiments employing the dual task paradigm to investigate cerebral organization. Whereas experiment one failed to support previous findings, experiments two and three did reveal that concurrent verbal tasks interfered more with right-hand tapping than with left-hand tapping in right-handed subjects. Secondly left-handed subjects did not show the same pattern of interference as right-handed subjects and, thirdly, visuo-spatial tasks did not interfere in the same way with single finger pressing as <b>verbal</b> ones. Close <b>examination</b> of both previous and present results revealed two important issues that warranted further examination. Firstly the role task difficulty plays in determining the amount and kind of interference observed in motor performance and, secondly {{the extent to which the}} locus of interference is motor-motor in nature. The results of experiments four, five, six and seven indicated that the level of task demands may play only a minor role in determining the pattern of interference generated. Furthermore, although interference does not appear to arise solely during responding processes, overt speech is more interfering than covert speech. Experiments eight and nine failed to show that this difference stemmed from the necessity to access the phonological properties of the words. A general discussion of the results concluded that proper evaluation of the theoretical explanations of interference and facilitation effects is not possible until the mechanism of such effects is understood. Furthermore, methodological problems and the assumptions underlying the use of the dual-task paradigm were examined, and it was concluded that it is extremely difficult to relate the results of combined motor and cognitive performance to cerebral organization...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{improvement}} of motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease after deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is well documented, there are open questions regarding its impact on cognitive functions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to asses the effect of bilateral DBS of the STN on executive and memory functions in PD patients using an unstimulated PD control group matched on age, education, disease duration, motor symptoms, medication and DBS indication. All PD patients included in study fulfilled the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria for PD. Thirteen PD patients with DBS implantation (DBS group) and 15 PD wait-listed patients (control group) participated in the study. Motor symptoms were assessed by the Unified Parkinson’s Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor score, anxiety by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and depression by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). A neuropsychological battery was used to assess cognitive functions, including general mental ability (Mini Mental State <b>Examination),</b> <b>verbal</b> (digit span) and spatial short-term memory (Corsi block-tapping task), working memory (n-back task) and executive functions (phonemic and semantic verbal fluency, Stroop task, Trail Making B task). Each task was administered twice: before and after surgery in the DBS group with the stimulators on and with a similar time interval between the two task-administration points in the control group. There was no significant difference between the DBS and the control groups’ performance in tasks measuring short-term verbal, spatial and working memory and executive functions assessed by the Trail Making B and the Stroop Tasks. The DBS group showed a significant decline on the semantic verbal fluency task after surgery compared to its own baseline level (p <. 05). The findings are discussed considering different possible effects of the STN DBS on frontosriatal networks. Keywords: Parkinson Disease, deep brain stimulation, executive function, memor...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} general practitioners' use of a computer during consultations, on doctor-patlent communication and the delivery of care. The IBM Sheffield Primary Care System was used by GPs during routine consultations for the review and update of patients' records. The system also provided an interactive protocol {{for the management of}} patients with chronic hypertension. Video recordings were made of over 800 consultations with and without use of the computer. These were used to identify a comprehensive and reliable set of measures of doctor-patient communication. With medical collaboration measures of the standard of delivery of care were also developed. The measures were then used to investigate the effects of computer use. When used for the review and update of records the computer had little effect on doctor-patient communication. Doctors showed more solidarity with patients (e. g. by offering supportive comments), but there was no effect on the amount of information and advice offered or questions asked by either doctor or patient. However, overall, there was a slight impairment of the doctor's interpersonal manner and delivery of care. When the computer was used in direct support of clinical decision-making (i. e. through the hypertension management protocol) there was a marked improvement in the doctors’ clinical performance {{in terms of the number}} of relevant <b>verbal</b> and physical <b>examinations</b> conducted and recorded. The findings suggest ways in which future systems should be designed and used to avoid possible adverse consequences for doctor-patient communications. A research framework, including new methodologies, is also offered for the evaluation of future consulting room systems. Similar evaluative studies need to be performed on the more sophisticated systems now available, especially the clinically oriented ones which offer most potential...|$|R
40|$|Background The CAMCOG {{is a brief}} neuropsychological battery {{designed}} to assess global cognitive function and ascertain the impairments that are required for the diagnosis of dementia. To date, the cut-off scores for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been determined. Given {{the need for an}} earlier diagnosis of mild dementia, new cut-off values are also necessary, taking into account cultural and educational effects. Methods One hundred and fifty-seven older adults (mean age: 69. 6 +/- 7. 4 years) with 8 or more years of formal education (mean years of schooling 14. 2 +/- 3. 8) attending a memory clinic at the Institute of Psychiatry University of Sao Paulo were included. Subjects were divided into three groups according to their cognitive status, established through clinical and neuropsychological assessment: normal controls, n = 62; MCI, n = 65; and mild or moderate dementia, n = 30. ROC curve analyses were performed for dementia vs controls, MCI vs controls and MCI vs dementia. Results The cut-off values were: 92 / 93 for dementia is controls (AUC = 0. 99 : sensitivity: 100 %, specificity: 95 %); 95 / 96 for MCI vs controls (AUC = 0. 83, sensitivity: 64 %, specificity: 88 %), and 85 / 86 for MCI vs dementia (AUC = 0. 91, sensitivity: 81 %, specificity: 88 %). The total CAMCOG score was more accurate than its subtests Mini-mental State <b>Examination,</b> <b>Verbal</b> Fluency Test and Clock Drawing Test when used separately. Conclusions The CAMCOG discriminated controls and MCI from demented patients, but was less accurate to discriminate MCI from controls. The best cut-off value to differentiate controls and demented was higher than suggested in the original publication, probably because only cases of mild to moderate dementia were included. This is important given the need for a diagnostic at earlier stages of Alzheimer`s disease. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Polymorphism of {{the gene}} for apolipoprotein E (APOE) is an {{important}} risk factor {{for the development of}} Alzheimer's disease. The &# 949; 4 allele of the APOE gene has been linked with a number of neuropsychiatric illnesses, and also with stress and depression among geriatric populations. OBJECTIVE: To identify APOE-&# 949; 4 polymorphism and correlate this with cognitive deficit among the elderly population of the island of Fernando de Noronha. METHOD: Neuropsychiatric tests (mini-mental state <b>examination,</b> <b>verbal</b> fluency test and clock drawing test) were applied to 52 elderly people without Alzheimer's disease. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and genotyping of APOE was done by the PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: 87 % of the elderly population (mean age 69. 6 ± 7. 0) had cognitive deficit. CONCLUSION: The observed frequency of the &# 949; 4 allele was 10 %, but the correlation between the presence of &# 949; 4 and cognitive deficit in this population was not statistically significant.

40|$|Objective: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), {{the most}} common cause of dementia, has become an {{important}} public health issue. There is no definite cure for AD, however, early diagnosis can slow the course of the disease. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical entity defined as the transition between dementia and normal aging in which memory and other cognitive abilities can be affected. MCI is an active process that can convert to different forms of dementia at a rate of approximately 15 % per year. Currently, the use of electrophysiological techniques in diagnosing and clinical monitoring of MCI and AD, and during the clinical course of progression from MCI to AD, is limited as compared with structural and functional imaging techniques. In the current study, we aimed to demonstrate that the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) test is an electrophysiological test that can be used in the above-mentioned conditions. Methods: In the current study, MRCPs were recorded in 20 patients diagnosed with AD according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and, 20 patients diagnosed with MCI according to the Petersen criteria, by using a neuropsychological battery, including the mini-mental state <b>examination,</b> <b>verbal</b> memory processes test, clock-drawing test, geriatric depression scale, Stroop test, functional activities questionnaire, Benton facial recognition test, and the global deterioration scale. Latency and amplitude values of the MRCPs in patients were compared with latency and amplitude values of the MRCPs in 25 normal control cases. Results: Comparison of the AD, MCI and control groups revealed that MRCP wave occurred later in the MCI group than in the control group, and occurred later in the AD group than in the MCI group. Motor potential (MP) amplitude in the AD group was lower as compared with the MCI and control groups. Conclusion: In conclusion, the MRCP test can be used as an electrophysiological test in the diagnosis and monitoring of AD as well as in the monitoring of the clinical course of progression from MCI to AD.

5000|$|Steele, Aronson and Spencer, have {{examined}} and performed experiments {{to see how}} stereotypes can threaten how students evaluate themselves, which then alters academic identity and intellectual performance. Steele tested the stereotype threat theory by giving Black and White college students a half-hour test using difficult questions from the <b>verbal</b> Graduate Record <b>Examination</b> (GRE). In the stereotype-threat condition, they told students the test diagnosed intellectual ability. In saying that the test diagnoses intellectual ability it can potentially elicit the stereotype that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites. In the no-stereotype-threat condition, they told students that the test was a problem-solving lab task that said nothing about ability. This made stereotypes irrelevant. In the stereotype threat condition, Blacks who were evenly matched with Whites in their group by SAT scores, performed worse compared to their White counterparts. In the experiments with no stereotype threat, Blacks performed slightly better than in those with a stereotype threat, though still significantly worse than whites. Aronson believes the study of stereotype threat offers some [...] "exciting and encouraging answers to these old questions achievement gaps {{by looking at the}} psychology of stigma -- the way human beings respond to negative stereotypes about their racial or gender group". When pressed, Steele, Aronson, and Spenser, acknowledge that their experiments on stereotype threat only explain a modest portion of test-score gaps. However, their findings have consistently been erroneously attributed to explaining the entirety of the test score gap. The American Psychological Association is one such institution that that misuses the study to posit that stereotype threat undercuts the tendency of evolutionary psychologists to lay the blame on genetic and cultural factors, such as whether African Americans [...] "value" [...] education. Researchers from Heterodox Academy, a think tank dedicated to pursuing intellectual diversity in academia, posit that the tendency of some social scientists to over emphasise the potency of stereotype threat, has to do with their loyalty to politically correct clean slate ideology, rather than objective reasoning. Adherence to such dogma therefore permits these individuals to dismiss the possibility of less palatable explanations for racial group disparities, such as genetics and culture.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Although the {{improvement}} of motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease after deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is well documented, there are open questions regarding its impact on cognitive functions (Fasano et al., 2012). The aim {{of the present study}} was to asses the effect of bilateral DBS of the STN on executive and memory functions in PD patients using an unstimulated PD control group matched on age, education, disease duration, motor symptoms, medication and DBS indication. Method: Thirteen PD patients with DBS implantation (DBS group) and 15 PD wait-listed patients (control group) participated in the study. A neuropsychological battery was used to assess cognitive functions, including general mental ability (Mini Mental State <b>Examination),</b> <b>verbal</b> (digit span) and spatial short-term memory (Corsi block-tapping task), working memory (n-back task), executive functions (phonemic and semantic verbal fluency, Stroop task, Trail Making B task), and event-based prospective memory (see Burgess et al., 2001). Each task was administered twice: before and after surgery in the DBS group with the stimulators on and with a similar time interval between the two task-administration points in the control group. Results: A series of mixed design ANOVAs was used with group (DBS vs. control group) as a between-subjects factor and assessment points (1 st vs. 2 nd) as a within-subjects factor. There was no significant difference between the DBS and the control groups’ performance in tasks measuring short-term verbal, spatial and working memory and executive functions assessed by the Trail Making B and the Stroop Tasks. The DBS group showed a significant decline on the semantic verbal fluency task after surgery compared to its own baseline level (p <. 05). Additionally, the DBS group showed a decreased execution cost score at the second assessment point of the prospective memory task, compared to the control group (p <. 05). Conclusion/Discussion: Our results provide support for the cognitive safety of the STN DBS using a wait-listed PD control group. The DBS group showed impaired performance after the surgery only on the semantic verbal fluency task which is in line with findings of previous studies. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that DBS of the STN boosts prospective memory, in particular intention execution functions. The findings will be discussed considering different possible effects of the STN DBS on frontosriatal networks. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Considerable {{evidence}} exists {{to suggest the}} notion that selected personality traits {{may be related to}} specific aspects of academic achievement. This study was directed toward the investigation of this relationship in the case of non-science majors enrolled in a college course in physical science. Personality was assessed with the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and academic achievement was defined in terms of the subjects' performance on the examinations regularly administered for grading purposes in the course, i. e., the "midterm" and final examinations. Two aspects of academic achievement were measured by classifying all examination questions as either <b>verbal</b> or numerical. <b>Examination</b> questions were classified as "numerical" whenever the use of mathematics was a necessary requisite in selecting the correct response to an item, and verbal if they were not numerical. The population consisted of the students enrolled in the two sections of General Science 104 at Oregon State University during the fall term of 1966, The population was subdivided into four groups on the basis of sex and lecture section. Two hypotheses were tested {{in each of the four}} population subdivisions. A - There is no significant correlation between verbal achievement and personality; and there is no significant correlation between numerical achievement and personality. B - There is no significant correlation between the ratio of numerical achievement to verbal achievement and personality. In three out of four cases A was rejected, leading to the conclusion that personality and achievement in physical science are related. For males, five CPI scales correlated with achievement in physical science at the. 05 level. Four of them were related to verbal achievement and one was related to numerical achievement. Among the females, eleven significant correlation coefficients occurred between CPI scales and achievement in physical science. Six of them were related to verbal achievement and five to numerical achievement. B was accepted in all four null tests, but further interpretation of the results led to the conclusion that discrepant achievement, the ratio of numerical achievement to verbal achievement, is related to personality. The implications of this study relative to current public school science curricula were discussed. The need for further research based upon a theory of discrepant achievement was considered in light of its relevance to the problem of achievement in physical science...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{makes use}} of three commonly used qualitative methods, visual ethnography, rephotography and a type of photo-elicitation, to examine an innovative theory of visual knowledge called Know, Believe, and Imagine. KBI {{is first and foremost}} an innovative model of visual perception. The discovery of KBI led to an award-winning art practice. This study moves the theoretical foundations of KBI from the studio to a qualitative research setting to determine if KBI can be used for reliable and valid knowledge production. The invention of the printing press and the resulting mass production of literature in the fifteenth century presaged an immediate institutional commitment to verbal literacy, as embodied in the field of Library and Information Studies (LIS). However, despite the invention of technologies that have enabled the mass production of both still and moving images, a parallel institutional commitment to visual literacy in the social sciences has not transpired. The twenty-first century is awash in visual imagery due in no small measure to the computer, the Internet, and graphical user interfaces and remediation associated with computerization. Visual literacy refers to a group of vision competencies, integrated with other sensory modes, which are used to make sense of visual experience. Epistemological discourse regarding knowledge claims from visual records has tended to mimic the reductive paradigms applied to written scientific discourse, even though it has long been accepted that visual information is cognitively processed differently than <b>verbal</b> information. The <b>examination</b> of documentary photographs described in this dissertation examines a theory of seeing that emerged from art practice, and form the foundation for a discursive system that accounts for the role that existing knowledge, heuristics, and imagination performs in visual literacy. This study demonstrates that a knowledge-based approach, associated with research in cognitive psychology, is better suited for advancing visual literacy and visual epistemologies. Documentary photographs were examined in two phases using qualitative methods that provided evidence of the robustness of the theoretical model for meaningful social scientific discourse. The specific type of documentary photographs used for this research was black-and-white postcards created {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. While sufficient time has elapsed to provide significant socio-cultural movement, not so much time has elapsed to render the artifactual material obsolete, allowing for the construction of rich socio-cultural narratives grounded in the trace evidence of still images. A pragmatic benefit of this research might include an increased valuation and access to visual archives, and improved methods for making sense of visual experience...|$|R
