5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, <b>vertical</b> <b>movement</b> along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block and the {{resulting}} accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through <b>vertical</b> <b>movement,</b> while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{described}} the Christmas setting as a juxtaposition between the joyful {{time of year}} and the grim world of Gotham City, including decorative Santas near Gothic gargoyles and Christmas lights in dark alleys. The city is dislodged from time and space, contrasting 1930s (and older) buildings with Batman's futuristic technology. The New Gotham area was designed for <b>vertical</b> <b>movement,</b> allowing the placement of enemies above and below Batman to create areas dense with activity. The game features high contrast between darks and lights, with exaggerated shadows and few balancing colors. The city was divided into residential, industrial and commercial neighborhoods, which were decorated accordingly: the industrial setting is bleak, the commercial area has corporate decorations and residential neighborhoods have lights in their windows.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The precise {{geodetic}} levelling {{reveals the}} recent {{activity of the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> of the earth’s crust. However, the main shortcoming of the levelling networks is a scarceness of the measurement tracks {{that can not be}} compensated by high density of the levelling sites within the tracks. The pattern and trends of <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> between the measured lines remains unknown. A special approach has been developed in order to allow the prediction of the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> within the polygons. It is based on the multicomponent statistical correlation of the levelling data with the significant geological parameters. The correlations between different parameters were derived separately for each particular polygon and than combined in one common model. It allowed compilation of a rather detailed map of the recent <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> of Lithuania during the past 30 - 40 years. The rate of the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> of the earth’s surface obtained from the geodetic levelling varies from- 2. 7 mm to 3. 5 mm/y. A close correlation suggests that the heterogeneity of the crust is important for the distribution of the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements.</b> The application of the close correlation with geoparameters allowed considerable improvement of the map of the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> of Lithuania...|$|R

5|$|Like other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus was herbivorous. However, {{while some}} later ornithischian groups possessed teeth capable of {{grinding}} plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only <b>vertical</b> <b>movement,</b> {{due to a}} short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus fed with a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise but simple up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was mashed between the inner side of the upper teeth and the outer side of the lower teeth, without the teeth actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on the lower teeth alone.|$|E
5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted <b>vertical</b> <b>movement</b> relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Water {{currents}} are vertically {{structured in}} many marine systems {{and as a}} result, <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> by fish larvae and zooplankton affect horizontal transport (Power, 1984). In estuaries, the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> of larvae with tidal periods can result in their retention or ingress (Fortier and Leggett, 1983; Rijnsdorp et al., 1985; Cronin and Forward, 1986; Forward et al., 1999). On the continental shelf, the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> of organisms interact daily and ontogenetically with depth-varying currents to affect horizontal transport (Pillar et al., 1989; Barange and Pillar, 1992; Cowen et al., 1993, 2000; Batchelder et al., 2002). ...|$|R
30|$|High-quality data {{concerning}} the Tohoku Earthquake (M 9.0) on March 11, 2011, {{were obtained from the}} deep borehole observation network (maximum depth of 1030  m; epicentral distance of approximately 600  km) of the Tono Research Institute of Earthquake Science. In addition to data acquired via seismometers, stress meters, and strain meters, barometric seismograms were recorded by several barometers that are usually used for weather observations. We examined the characteristics of barometric and stress seismograms and compared them to the data obtained using broadband seismometers, finding a shared feature: large amplitudes and long-period waveforms began with the arrival of surface waves. We also investigated the relationship between <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> observed with GPS and barometric variations and discovered that the barometric variations were related to the differential of <b>vertical</b> <b>movements,</b> while the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> corresponded to the integral of barometric variations. All these results demonstrate that <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> at observation points can be computed from the barometric variations observed at those points.|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the variation in}} availability of demersal fish to bottom trawls and to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} target strength used in acoustic surveys, more knowledge about individual fish behaviour, such as the range, speed and repeatability of the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements,</b> is required. In this paper, data storage tags have been used to study <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> of individually tagged cod (Gadus morhua L.). In general, the short term <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> were less than 10 m. Rapid movements of up to 250 m within 2 h interval were recorded sporadically. During restricted periods some of the fish did move vertically with a distinct diel rhythm. Calculations of the time needed to equalise the pressure to remain at a constant buoyant state indicated that the fish probably were negatively buoyant most of the time. However, the direct effect of the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> on the acoustical target strength could not be quantified. Seasonal differences in mean depth and ambient temperature were observed. As a result of horizontal and vertical migrations, north-east Arctic cod experience higher temperatures in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. # 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

25|$|Tilt-and-roll luggage or wheeled luggage, is {{a variant}} of luggage for {{travelers}} which typically contains two-fixed wheels on one end and a telescoping handle on the opposite end for <b>vertical</b> <b>movement.</b> Tilt-and-roll luggage is pulled and thus eliminates a traveler from directly carrying his or her luggage.

30|$|We {{found that}} an {{elliptical}} uplift area of about 46 mm, corresponding to the uplift areas caused by the large, neighbouring earthquakes in the past, had been formed. Although it was clarified that the observed <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> were caused by the Naganoken Kamishiro Fault Earthquake, their magnitudes were {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than those of the <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> caused due to past earthquakes. Therefore, it was suggested that the distance between the mud volcano and epicentre (or hypocentre) of the earthquakes controls the activity of the mud volcano.|$|R

25|$|In addition, objects {{travelling}} upwards (i.e., out) or downwards (i.e., in) are deflected to {{the west}} or east respectively. This effect is also the greatest near the equator. Since <b>vertical</b> <b>movement</b> is usually of limited extent and duration, {{the size of the}} effect is smaller and requires precise instruments to detect. However, in the case of large changes of momentum, such as a spacecraft being launched into orbit, the effect becomes significant. The fastest and most fuel-efficient path to orbit is a launch from the equator that curves to a directly eastward heading.|$|E
25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and <b>vertical</b> <b>movement</b> due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|E

25|$|For {{his first}} {{exhibition}} in USA, at the Eugenia Butler Gallery of Los Angeles (1970), he exhibited {{a series of}} 37 suitcases filled with cheese on the floor, below pictures made with cheese on the wall. Called Staple Cheese (A Race), a pun on Steeple Chase, the suitcases were to be opened one a day, whilst the wall pictures included a horizontal line tracking the <b>vertical</b> <b>movement</b> of the cheeses as they slid toward it. However, {{within a few days}} the over-powering smell, maggots and flies combined to make it impossible to enter the room. As a gesture to honor what he called “the exhibition’s true audience,” Roth collected some of the dead flies lying {{on the floor of the}} gallery space and put them in a glass jar. The suitcases were later stored in a container designed by Roth for a number of years until Butler's husband threw the whole exhibition away in the desert.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{tetrapods}} with limbs, plesiosaurs {{must have}} had a certain gait, a coordinated movement pattern of the, in this case, flippers. Of the infinite number of possibilities, in practice attention has been largely directed {{to the question of whether}} the front pair and hind pair moved simultaneously, so that all four flippers were engaged at the same moment, or in an alternate pattern, each pair being employed in turn. Frey & Riess in 1991 proposed an alternate model, which would have had the advantage of a more continuous propulsion. In 2000, Theagarten Lingham-Soliar evaded the question by concluding that, like sea turtles, plesiosaurs only used the front pair for a powered stroke. The hind pair would have been merely used for steering. Lingham-Soliar deduced this from the form of the hip joint, which would have allowed for only a limited <b>vertical</b> <b>movement.</b> Furthermore, a separation of the propulsion and steering function would have facilitated the general coordination of the body and prevented a too extreme pitch. He rejected Robinson's hypothesis that elastic energy was stored in the ribcage, considering the ribs too stiff for this.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was felt}} {{over a wide}} area from Alexandria in the southwest to Antioch in the north previously damaged by the earthquake of 526. The area of felt intensity of VIII or more extends from Tripoli in the north to Tyre in the south. Estimates for the magnitude vary from 7.2 on the surface wave magnitude scale to a possible 7.5 on the moment magnitude scale. The rupture length {{is estimated to be}} greater than 100km and possibly as long as 150km. The origin of the tsunami was thought to have been due to an underwater landslide triggered by an earthquake on the Dead Sea Transform itself. More recent analysis suggested that an offshore continuation of the Roum Fault mapped onshore was responsible. However, seabed surveys have discounted this possibility and the discovery of geologically recent fault scarps at seabed indicate that movement on the newly identified Mount Lebanon Thrust was the cause of the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Quaternary uplift recorded by a series of marine-cut terraces between Tripoli and Beirut are consistent with continuing upward movement of the hanging wall of the proposed thrust. At a smaller scale, an uplifted vermetid bench, which indicates <b>vertical</b> <b>movement</b> of about 80cm, is dated to the sixth century A.D. Continued uplift above this thrust since the late Miocene may explain the formation of the Mount Lebanon range.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, {{despite being}} located at a greater distance, the Niigataken Chuetsu-oki Earthquake caused the same <b>vertical</b> <b>movements</b> as the Naganoken Hokubu Earthquake {{in the mud}} volcano.
