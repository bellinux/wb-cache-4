50|$|The {{geological}} {{deformation of}} Iceland is {{mainly caused by}} the active spreading of the mid-oceanic ridge. Extensional cracks and transform faults are found perpendicular to the spreading direction. The transform-fault zones are also known as fracture zones.

5000|$|In 1783-84 Laki, a <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissure</b> in {{the south}} of the island, erupted. The {{eruption}} produced about 15 km³ (3.6 mi³) of basalt lava, and the total volume of tephra emitted was 0.91 km³. The aerosols built up caused a cooling effect in the Northern Hemisphere. The consequences for Iceland were catastrophic, with approximately 25-33% of the population dying in the famine of 1783 and 1784. Around 80% of sheep, 50% of cattle, and 50% of horses died of fluorosis from the 8 million tons of fluorine that were released. [...] This disaster is known as the Mist Hardship (Icelandic: Móðuharðindin).|$|E
50|$|A fissure vent, {{also known}} as a <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissure</b> or {{eruption}} fissure, is a linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is often a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts which run first in lava channels and later in lava tubes. After some time the eruption builds up spatter resp. ash cones and may concentrate on one or some of them. Small fissure vents may not be easily discernible from the air, but the crater rows (see Laki) or the canyons (see Eldgjá) built up by some of them are.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} their fresh appearance, the oldest flows in the Craters of the Moon Lava Field are 15,000 years old and the {{youngest}} erupted about 2000 years ago, according to Mel Kuntz and other USGS geologists. Nevertheless, the <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissures</b> at Craters of the Moon {{are considered to be}} dormant, not extinct, and are expected to erupt in less than a thousand years. There are eight major eruptive periods recognized in the Craters of the Moon Lava Field.

Individual lava flows were up to [...] long with the Blue Dragon Flow being the longest.|$|R
50|$|The {{axis of the}} {{archipelago}} near the mainland of Alaska has a southwest trend, but near 179° its direction changes to the northwest. This change of direction corresponds to a curve {{in the line of}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissures</b> that have contributed their products to the building of the islands. Such curved chains are repeated about the Pacific Ocean in the Kuril Islands, the Japanese chain, and in the Philippines. All these island arcs are {{at the edge of the}} Pacific Plate and experience much seismic activity, but are still habitable; the Aleutians lie between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The general elevation is greatest in the eastern islands and least in the western. The island chain is a western continuation of the Aleutian Range on the mainland.|$|R
50|$|Deformed structures, {{including}} northeast trending eruptive fissure swarms {{and normal}} faults, {{can be found}} in Eastern Volcanic Zone. Long hyaloclastite ridges, formed by subglacial eruptions during the last glacial period, are distinctive structures in the Eastern Volcanic Zone. Compared with Western Volcanic Zone, eruptive fissure swarms and hyaloclastite ridges are generally longer in the Eastern Volcanic Zone. During the past glacial period, a huge volume of basaltic eruptions occurred, producing the long <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissure</b> swarms. The Eastern Volcanic Zone is geologically young, as mentioned above, the Eastern Volcanic Zone will eventually take over the Western Volcanic Zone according to the rift jump process model.|$|E

However, later aerial observations of glacial depressions southeast of the volcano suggested that the now-retracted report of an eruption had been correct and that a short eruption did occur under the ice, but the lack of further melting indicated that this eruption had now ceased.

In this paper we present results from EMEP/MSC-W model simulations to which we added 750  kg s − 1  SO 2 emissions at the Holuhraun plain from September to November (SON), testing three different emission heights. The three simulated SO 2 concentrations, weighted with the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite averaging kernel, are found to be within 30  % of the satellite-observed SO 2 column burden. Constraining the SO 2 column burden with the satellite data while using the kernel along with the three simulated height distributions of SO 2, we estimate that the median of the daily burdens may have been between 13 and 40  kt in the North Atlantic area under investigation. We suggest this to be the uncertainty in the satellite-derived burdens of SO 2, mainly due to the unknown vertical distribution of SO 2. Surface observations in Europe outside Iceland showed concentration increases up to >  500  µg m − 3  SO 2 from volcanic plumes passing. Three well identified episodes, where the plume crossed several countries, are compared in detail to surface measurements. For all events, the general timing of the observed concentration peaks compared quite well to the model results. The overall changes to the European SO 2 budget due to the <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissure</b> are estimated. Three-monthly wet deposition (SON) of SO x in the 28 European Union countries, Norway and Switzerland is found to be more than 30  % higher in the model simulation with Holuhraun emissions compared to a model simulation with no Holuhraun emissions. The largest increases, apart from extreme values on Iceland, are found on the coast of northern Norway, a region with frequent precipitation during westerly winds. Over a 3 -month average (during SON 2014) over Europe, SO 2 and PM 2. 5 surface concentrations, due to the volcanic emissions, increased by only ten and 6  % respectively. Although the percent increase of PM 2. 5 concentration is highest over Scandinavia and Scotland, an increase in PM exceedance days is found over Ireland and the already polluted Benelux region (up to 3 additional days), where any small increase in particulate matter concentration leads to an increase in exceedance days...|$|E

40|$|Four major NE {{trending}} postglacial <b>volcanic</b> and tectonic <b>fissure</b> swarms (<b>volcanic</b> systems) {{occur on}} the Reykjanes Peninsula, and the westernmost three are the main subject of this paper. Two main types of basaltic volcanoes are associated with these systems: shields of picrite and olivine tholeiite and tholeiite fissures. The average volume of 26 shields is 1. 11 km 3, and the total production is 29 km 3, whereas the corresponding figures for lavas from 101 <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissures</b> are 0. 11 km 3 and 11 km 3. The tectonic fractures are either tension fractures or normal faults of widths up to 20 m, throws up to 10 m, and lengths up to several kilometers. The volcanism and tectonics {{can be explained by}} magmatic pressure changes in ellipsoidal magma reservoirs located beneath the fissure swarms. A magmatic pressure increase of the order of 10 MPa is found to be sufficient for an excess uplift of the order of several meters, which is all that is needed to account for the fractures and measured dilation in the fissure swarms. It is concluded that most shield volcanoes, in particular the picrite shields and the large olivine tholeiite shields, formed during the early postglacial period and that their formation was facilitated by the stress field generated as a result of rapid uplift and bending of the crust above the reservoirs. Since that time the reservoirs have become independent systems, the volcanism has been confined to fissures, and the production rate has decreased significantly. During typical fissure eruptions (0. 015 km 3), only the uppermost several hundred meters of the source reservoir, depending on its magma content, supply magma to the eruption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Tokaj Mts, {{situated}} in the northeastern part of the inner arc of the Carpathians, forms {{a part of a}} Miocene calc-alkaline andesitic-dacitic-rhyolitic volcanic island arc. The ancient volcanic structures were reconstructed {{on the basis of the}} 1 : 50 000 -scale and 22 sheets of the 1 : 25 000 -scale geologicpetrologic maps, as well as the revision of the volcanic facies in 150 boreholes. Multispectral and SAR satellite imagery, aerial photos, data and maps of airborne geophysical surveys (magnetic and radiometric), gravity-filtered anomaly maps, geochemical (soil and stream sediment Au, As, Sb, Hg) concentration distribution maps and the K/Ar dating of 132 samples from 80 paleomagnetic measurements were also used. The anomalies were only taken into consideration in the interpretation if the coincident results of at least 3 methods indicated the presence of any volcanic structure. In consequence, 91 map-scale volcanic structures were identified by morphology — complex calderas, single lava domes, <b>volcanic</b> <b>fissures,</b> subvolcanic intrusions, diatremes, stratovolcanoes and postvolcanic formations. Conclusions were also drawn regarding the link to the volcanic structures and prospective occurrences of the mineral resources of the Tokaj Mts: andesite, dacite, welded zeolitic tuff, K-metasomatite, perlite, pitchstone, pumice, bentonitic, illitic, kaolinitic, diatom-bearing and silicified lacustrine sediments, hydrothermal Au-Ag and Pb-Zn veins, and Hg stockwerks...|$|R
