40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{artificial}} heart <b>valves,</b> namely, (i) biological <b>valves</b> and (ii) mechanical <b>valves.</b> biological heart <b>valves</b> are made from tissue taken from animals or human cadavers. They are treated with preservatives and sterilized for human implantation. On the other hand, mechanical heart <b>valves</b> are made of man-made materials. The advantage of mechanical <b>valves</b> over biological <b>valves</b> is that they normally last for a comparatively longer lifetime. The biological <b>valves</b> exhibit a shorter lifetime and tend to wear out with time in service. This chapter discusses mechanical heart <b>valves</b> and highlights the underlying problems faced with biomaterials used in the manufacture of such <b>valves.</b> Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2007, 2016...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Artificial heart <b>valves</b> are {{engineered}} devices {{used for}} replacing dis-eased or damaged natural <b>valves</b> of the heart. Most commonly used for replace-ment are mechanical heart <b>valves</b> and biological <b>valves.</b> This paper briefly outlines the evolution, designs employed, materials being used,. and important {{factors that affect}} the performance of mechanical heart <b>valves.</b> The clinical performance of mechanical heart <b>valves</b> is also addressed. Efforts made in India {{in the development of}} mechanical heart <b>valves</b> are also discussed...|$|R
5|$|<b>Valve</b> {{struggled}} to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. Sierra On-Line signed <b>Valve</b> for a one-game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the Quake engine. <b>Valve</b> first showed Half-Life in early 1997; it was a success at Electronic Entertainment Expo that year, where <b>Valve</b> demonstrated the game's animation and artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Valve,</b> {{based in}} Kirkland, Washington, {{was founded in}} 1996 by former Microsoft {{employees}} Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell. For its first product, <b>Valve</b> settled on a concept for a horror first-person shooter (FPS) using the Quake engine licensed from id Software. <b>Valve</b> eventually modified 70% of the engine's code, adding skeletal animation and Direct3D support.|$|E
5|$|A <b>valve</b> ejected due to {{incompatible}} thread (metric <b>valve</b> in imperial cylinder) injured commercial diver by {{impact on}} the back of the helmet during preparations for a dive. Cylinder had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular triggering event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by the helmet.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, the British Standards Institution {{sets the}} {{standards}}. Included among the standards {{is the use}} left-hand threaded <b>valves</b> for flammable gas cylinders (most commonly brass, BS4, <b>valves</b> for non corrosive cylinder contents or stainless steel, BS15, <b>valves</b> for corrosive contents). Non flammable gas cylinders are fitted with right-hand threaded <b>valves</b> (most commonly brass, BS3, <b>valves</b> for non corrosive components or stainless steel, BS14, <b>valves</b> for corrosive components).|$|R
50|$|When it {{was built}} between March 1971 and October 1977, mercury-arc <b>valves</b> were used to rectify the {{alternating}} current. These <b>valves,</b> supplied by English Electric each had six anode columns in parallel and were the most powerful mercury arc <b>valves</b> ever built. Between 1992 and 1993 the mercury arc <b>valves</b> of Pole 1 were replaced with thyristor <b>valves</b> by GEC Alsthom, increasing the maximum power and voltage of the line to its current levels. The mercury arc <b>valves</b> of Pole 2 were replaced later by Siemens. By the end of 2004 {{the last of the}} mercury arc <b>valves</b> in Pole 2 had been replaced by thyristor <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Control <b>valves</b> are {{normally}} fitted with actuators and positioners. Pneumatically-actuated globe <b>valves</b> and Diaphragm <b>Valves</b> {{are widely used}} for control purposes in many industries, although quarter-turn types such as (modified) ball, gate and butterfly <b>valves</b> are also used.|$|R
5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the <b>valve</b> pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar <b>valve</b> against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and <b>valve.</b> When the <b>valve</b> is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the <b>valve.</b> Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the <b>valve</b> and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return <b>valve</b> in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the <b>valve</b> was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return <b>valve</b> was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|Before {{implementing}} Steam, <b>Valve</b> Corporation {{had problems}} updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches {{would result in}} most of the online user base disconnecting for several days. <b>Valve</b> decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user polls {{at the time of its}} announcement in 2002, <b>Valve</b> also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access to high-speed Internet connections, which would only grow with planned Internet expansion in the following years, and recognized that they could deliver game content faster to players than through retail channels. <b>Valve</b> approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E

50|$|Building and {{industrial}} <b>valves</b> {{are used in}} a complex normative framework, that the Technical Committee is in charge to follow, that includes CEN TC69 and ISO TC153 for industrial <b>valves,</b> CEN TC236 for gas <b>valves</b> and CEN TC164 for building <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{plants with}} {{remote-controlled}} process operation, {{such as oil}} refineries and petrochemical plants, some 2-way <b>valves</b> can be designated as normally closed (NC) or normally open (NO) during regular operation. Examples of normally-closed <b>valves</b> are sampling <b>valves,</b> which are only opened while a sample is taken. Other examples of normally-closed <b>valves</b> are emergency shut-down <b>valves,</b> which are kept open when the system is in operation and will automatically shut by taking away the power supply. This happens {{when there is a}} problem with a unit or a section of a fluid system such as a leak in order to isolate the problem from the rest of the system. Examples of normally-open <b>valves</b> are purge-gas supply <b>valves</b> or emergency-relief <b>valves.</b> When there is a problem these <b>valves</b> open (by switching them 'off') causing the unit to be flushed and emptied.|$|R
5|$|Beginning with Rag Doll Kung Fu in October 2005, {{third-party}} games {{became available}} for purchase and download on Steam, and <b>Valve</b> announced that Steam had become profitable because of some highly successful <b>Valve</b> games. Although digital distribution could not yet match retail volume, profit margins for <b>Valve</b> and developers were far larger on Steam. Large developer-publishers, including id Software, Eidos Interactive, and Capcom, began distributing their games on Steam in 2007. By May that year, 13million accounts had been created on the service, and 150 games were for sale on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder valves must {{be closed}} whilst in transit and checked {{that there are}} no leaks. Where applicable, {{protective}} <b>valve</b> caps and covers should be fitted to cylinders before transporting. Cylinders should not be transported with equipment attached to the <b>valve</b> outlet (regulators, hoses etc.).|$|E
5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder <b>valve</b> trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} <b>valve</b> and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1960, further {{agreements}} with Bendix brought licensed production of hydraulic servo <b>valves</b> to Normalair's range of products. This expertise was then developed into for electro-hydraulic servo <b>valves,</b> actuators and lightweight solenoid operated hydraulic <b>valves.</b> The company also produced marine hydraulics and <b>valves</b> for submarines.|$|R
50|$|Check <b>valves</b> {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball check <b>valves.</b> These <b>valves</b> often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check <b>valves</b> such as ball check <b>valves.</b> The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check <b>valves</b> to prevent back-flow.|$|R

5|$|Half-Life: Opposing Force is an {{expansion}} pack for <b>Valve</b> Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game {{was developed by}} Gearbox Software and <b>Valve</b> Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on November 19, 1999. Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half-Life and was first announced in April 1999. Randy Pitchford, the lead designer on the game, later noted that he believed Gearbox was selected to develop Opposing Force because <b>Valve</b> wanted to concentrate on their future projects. Over the course of development, Gearbox brought {{in a variety of}} outside talent from other areas of the video games industry to help bolster various aspects of design.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven <b>valve</b> gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven <b>valve</b> gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular <b>valve</b> events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

40|$|This paper fully {{describes}} the working principle of slide <b>valves</b> in single-screw expanders (SSEs). A geometric analysis of suction and volume ratio slide <b>valves</b> {{is presented to}} determine the relations between volume ratio, suction closure volume, discharge opening volume and slide <b>valves</b> displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with slide <b>valves</b> is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of slide <b>valves</b> displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with slide <b>valves</b> are much better than those without slide <b>valves.</b> When the condensing temperature is 40 °C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The presented geometric analysis of slide <b>valves</b> and the thermodynamic model integrated with slide <b>valves</b> {{can be used to}} provide a theoretical and technical basis for designing the slide <b>valves</b> of SSEs and the control strategies of slide <b>valves</b> under varied operating conditions...|$|R
