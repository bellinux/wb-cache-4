At the same time, he sent a <b>verbal</b> <b>message</b> suggesting that the enormous crimes which would be laid to his account rendered him liable, {{not only to the}} ban of the Church, but to the deprivation of his crown. Gregory did this {{at a time when he}} himself was confronted by a reckless opponent in the person of Cencio I Frangipane, who on Christmas night surprised him in church and carried him off as a prisoner, though on the following day Gregory was released.|$|E
500|$|In 1888, Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal {{presented}} Wilson with {{a petition}} against the controversial election of Hillyard Mitchell, member for Batoche, over opponent George L. Fisher. Wilson presented the petition, {{as well as}} a <b>verbal</b> <b>message</b> from Lieutenant Governor Royal, initiating a discussion of proper procedures of receiving petitions in the Assembly. The petition was subsequently read, and sent to the Committee on Privileges and Elections. The Committee ruled in its report that the petitioners did not follow correct procedures, and Mitchell's victory was affirmed. On November 30, 1888, Wilson hosted a dinner for members and other guests in a hotel in Regina, the [...] "first of the kind {{in the history of the}} North-West Legislative Assembly".|$|E

Misunderstanding {{the intent of this}} letter (and not for the last time the British government misunderstood Ethiopian customs), Lord Palmerston responded on 4 July 1849 that Shewa lay too far away to send any workmen [...] "and, moreover, the workmen in her dominions are at present much employed."

40|$|We {{presented}} 28 sentences {{uttered by}} 28 unfamiliar speakers to sleeping participants {{to investigate whether}} humans can encode new <b>verbal</b> <b>messages,</b> learn voices of unfamiliar speakers, and form associations between speakers and messages during EEG-defined deep sleep. After waking, participants performed three tests which assessed the unconscious recognition of sleep-played speakers, messages, and speaker-message associations. Recognition performance in all tests was at chance level. However, response latencies revealed implicit memory for sleep-played messages but neither for speakers nor for speaker-message combinations. Only participants with excellent implicit memory for sleep-played messages also displayed implicit memory for speakers but not speaker-message associations. Hence, deep sleep allows for the semantic encoding of novel <b>verbal</b> <b>messages...</b>|$|R

This study aims at {{describing}} (1) quatitative appropriateness between {{verbal and}} nonverbal communicatin acts of Balinese speakers’ loosely respective forms and 2) qualitative appropriateness between {{verbal and nonverbal}} communication acts of Balinese speakers’ loosely respective forms in four villages in Bali. This appropriateness is viewed from the macro and micro linguistic functions. The subjects {{of this study were}} Balinese speakers (young generation, adult people, and old people from four villages in Bali. The data in the form of quantitative appropriateness were collected by means of questionnaire and observation with eliciting technique. The collected data were analyzed descriptively. The result of the study shows that with respect to Balinese speakers’ loosely respective forms of utterances (1) quantitatively, there was no appropriateness between verbal communication acts and nonverbal communication acts and (2) there was an appropriateness between verbal communication acts and nonverbal communication acts, {{in the sense that the}} presence of nonverbal communication acts was notparticularly intended to respect the interlocutors, but it was merely intended (1) to complete <b>verbal</b> <b>messages</b> (2) to clarify <b>verbal</b> <b>messages,</b> and (3) to emphasize <b>verbal</b> <b>messages</b> being delivered...|$|R

40|$|Televideo {{cybersex}} {{provides a}} unique {{example of the}} ways meanings are instantiated, identities constructed, and relationships negotiated across different semiotic modes. This article explores the role of <b>verbal</b> <b>messages</b> in these multimodal exchanges, examining the specific interactional functions they perform. Text, it is argued, plays a rather unique role in this particular kind of interaction. Unlike ordinary face-to-face conversation, in which the body (posture, gestures, gaze) usually plays more of an ancillary role, in televideo cybersex, the bodily performance is primary, with <b>verbal</b> <b>messages</b> functioning to contextualize physical actions. Text is used to help increase the sense of ‘presence’ participants feel, to regulate {{the rhythm of the}} unfolding interaction, to help manage the orderly exchange of information, and to create narrative frames within which bodily displays can be interpreted and made coherent...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of increasing the noticeability of instruction manual warnings on subsequent comprehension and memory performance. Par-ticipants read one of four instruction manuals for a gas-powered electric generator (Experiment 1) or a natural-gas oven (Experiment 2) on the assumption that they would later operate the equipment. The appearance of eight different warning messages in the manuals was altered in two ways: (1) the <b>verbal</b> <b>messages</b> were printed either in conspicuous print (larger text with color highlighting) or in plain print (same as the other text), and (2) either the <b>verbal</b> warning <b>messages</b> were accompanied by compatible pictorial icons or the icons were absent. Results showed that participants who received the conspicuous print, icons present man-ual better comprehended and recalled the <b>verbal</b> warning <b>messages</b> (Experiments 1 and 2) and better identified the semantic meaning of the icons (Experiment 1) than did participants who received the other three manuals. Implications for the design of instruction manual warnings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} (a) {{extended}} {{the assessment of}} an orientation program involving auditory cues (i. e., <b>verbal</b> <b>messages</b> automatically presented from the destinations) with five patients with Alzheimer’s disease, (b) compared {{the effects of this}} programwith those of a program with light cues (i. e., a program in which strobe lights were used instead of the <b>verbal</b> <b>messages)</b> with the same five patients, and (c) conducted a social validation assessment of the two programs with 70 university psychology students employed as social raters. Results confirmed the effectiveness of the program with auditory cues and showed an equally strong impact of the program with light cues with all five patients. The psychology students involved in the social validation assessment provided significantly higher scores for the program involving light cues on a six-item questionnaire. Those scores suggested that this program was perceived as a practically and socially preferable choice. The implications of the findings for daily contexts dealing with patients with Alzheimer’s disease are discussed...|$|R

50|$|A fence insert is {{an object}} {{designed}} to fit or clip into standard chain link fencing. There are three main objectives typically fulfilled by fence inserts.

This focus on the <b>verbal</b> <b>messaging</b> without including the nonverbal aspects has also resulted in a lack of empirical data on the relationship between nonverbal communication and influence strategies.|$|R
