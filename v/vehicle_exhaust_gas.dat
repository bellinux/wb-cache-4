40|$|A novel plasma-driven {{catalysis}} (PDC) reactor {{with special}} structure was proposed to remove <b>vehicle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas.</b> The PDC reactor {{which consisted of}} three quartz tubes and two copper electrodes was a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. The inner and outer electrodes firmly surrounded the outer surface of the corresponding dielectric barrier layer in a spiral way, respectively. Nano-titanium dioxide (TiO 2) film prepared by radiofrequency (RF) magnetron sputtering was coated on the outer wall of the middle quartz tube, separating the catalyst from the high voltage electrode. The spiral electrodes were designed to avoid overheating of microdischarges inside the PDC reactor. Continuous operation tests indicated that stable performance without deterioration of catalytic activity could last for more than 25 h. To verify {{the effectiveness of the}} PDC reactor, a non-thermal plasma(NTP) reactor was employed, which has the same structure as the PDC reactor but without the catalyst. The real <b>vehicle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> was introduced into the PDC reactor and NTP reactor, respectively. After the treatment, compared with the result from NTP, the concentration of HC in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> treated by PDC reactor reduced far more obviously while that of NO decreased only a little. Moreover, this result was explained through optical emission spectrum. The O emission lines can be observed between 870 nm and 960 nm for wavelength in PDC reactor. Together with previous studies, it could be hypothesized that O derived from catalytically O 3 destruction by catalyst might make a significant contribution to the much higher HC removal efficiency by PDC reactor. ...|$|E

Although {{the use of}} catalytic converters for the vehicle gas has resulted in considerable progress in the past twenty years, a theoretical framework for explaining the experimental observations is still lacking. We use the UBI-QEP method to analyze the chemisorption species and calculate the energiti of elementary reactions on six metal single crystal surfaces, Pt(111), Pd(111), Rh(111), Ag(111) Cu(111) and Ni(111). It will help us to realize the reaction mechanism and choose the best suitable catalysts. The sequence of chemisorption heat for NOx is Ni > Rh > Cu > Pd > Pt > Ag. The dissociation of NOx decreases along the series Rh approximate to Ni > Cu > Pd > Pt > Ag. The decomposition of NO can easy happen via N 2 O intermediate. From calculations at low coverage, we can see two possible pathways of NOx reduction, the direct dissociation and CO-aided dissociation. At high coverage, however, CO-aided dissociation is main pathway. For complete oxidation of carbon monoxide, Pt, Pd, Ag and Cu are fine catalysts, but both Ni and Rh can not promote it.

40|$|Male {{rates of}} suicide by hanging {{have more than}} doubled since the early 1980 s. Female rates show a similar pattern, {{although}} at lower levels. Summary Trends in suicide rates Suicide death rates for males, adjusted for age, fluctuated around 20 deaths per 100, 000 population per year in the period 1921 to 2010. Rates for females were about 5 deaths per 100, 000 population per year in most of this period, peaking above twice that rate in the 1960 s. Suicide rates for males in the Baby Boomer generation (those born from 1946 to 1965), Gen X (those born from 1966 to 1975) and Gen Y (those born from 1976 to 1985) rose more rapidly with age in their early adult years than occurred in the generations of their fathers and grandfathers. Rates for males in the iGeneration appear not to have risen as far or fast by about age 20 as the 3 preceding generations. For males born in the 20 th century, suicide rates from about 50 years have been lower in each more recent generation. For females, there was no marked variation in age-specific rates between recent birth cohorts. Male rates of suicide by hanging {{have more than doubled}} since the early 1980 s. Female rates show a similar pattern, although at lower levels. Suicide by hanging has been the most common mechanism of suicide in Australia since 1989 for males and since 1997 for females. Shooting by firearms was the most common mechanism of suicide by males in Australia for at least 60 years, to the mid- 1980 s, with a rate above 5 deaths per 100, 000 males for nearly all of this period. Rates for males and females declined greatly from the late 1980 s. Rates of suicide due to exposure to poisons (except gas) were similar for males and females from the early 1940 s through to 2010. There was a significant peak for both sexes in the 1960 s, attributed mainly to barbiturate sedatives. Poisoning by gas was largely due to carbon monoxide in domestic gas and motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas.</b> Until the 1960 s, when toxic 2 ̆ 7 town gas 2 ̆ 7 was replaced by less toxic gases in most of Australia, domestic gas was the main source, especially for women. Rates rose in the 1980 s and 1990 s, especially for men, when the source was almost always motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas.</b> A sharp decline after 1997 was most likely due to emission controls, which greatly reduced the amount of carbon monoxide permitted in the exhaust gas of new motor vehicles.

Factors such as smoking habit, health status, environmental conditions and seasonal variations were found to be associated with people's perception and complaints.

The circumstances {{that could lead to}} fatal poisonings in residential settings with motor vehicles as the source of CO were explored. The risk of death in a garage (volume = 90 m 3) and a single-family dwelling (400 m 3) was evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation with varying CO emission rates and ventilation rates. Information on emission rates was obtained from a survey of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> composition under warm idle conditions in California, and information on ventilation rates was obtained from a summary of published measurements in the U. S. housing stock. The risk of death ranged from 16 to 21 % for a 3 -hr exposure in a garage to 0 % for a 1 -hr exposure in a house. Older vehicles were associated with a disproportionately high risk of death. Removing all pre- 1975 vehicles from the fleet would reduce the risk of death by one-fourth to twothirds, depending on the exposure scenario. Significant efforts have been made to control CO emissions from motor vehicles with the goal of reducing CO concentrations in outdoor air. Substantial public health benefit could also be obtained if vehicle control measures were designed to take account of acute CO poisonings explicitly. IMPLICATIONS Significant efforts have been made to control CO emissions from motor vehicles with the goal of reducing outdoor CO concentrations. An important, but apparently incidental benefit of these controls is that the rate of accidental deaths from motor vehicle related CO poisoning has declined.

Results Epidemic increases in the use of new methods of suicide were generally associated with rises in overall suicide rates of between 23 % and 71 %. The recent epidemic of barbecue charcoal suicides in Taiwan was associated with the largest rise in overall rates (40 - 50 % annual rise), whereas the smallest rise was seen for car exhaust gassing in England and Wales (7 % annual rise). Joinpoint analyses were only feasible for car exhaust and charcoal burning suicides; these suggested an impact of the emergence of car exhaust suicides on overall suicide rates in both sexes in England and Wales. However there was no statistical evidence of a change in the already increasing overall suicide trends when charcoal burning suicides emerged in Taiwan, possibly due to the concurrent economic recession.

Investigation of nano-particles in different aspects such as lungs, upper airways, batteries and <b>vehicle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> is vital due the smaller size, adverse health effect and higher trouble for trapping than the micro-particles. The Lagrangian particle tracking provides an effective method for simulating the deposition of nano-particles as well as micro-particles as it accounts for the particle inertia effect {{as well as the}} Brownian excitation. However, using the Lagrangian approach for simulating ultraﬁne particles has been limited due to computational cost and numerical difficulties. In this paper, the deposition of nano-particles in cylindrical tubes under laminar condition is studied using the Lagrangian particle tracking method. The commercial Fluent software is used to simulate the fluid flow in the pipes and to study the deposition and dispersion of nano-particles. Different particle diameters as well as different flow rates are examined. The point analysis in a uniform flow is performed for validating the Brownian motion. The results show good agreement between the calculated deposition efficiency and the analytic correlations in the literature. Furthermore, for the nano-particles with the diameter more than 40 nm, the calculated deposition efficiency by the Lagrangian method is less than the analytic correlations based on Eulerian method due to statistical error or the inertia effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present article {{describes}} the methods based on the gradient K-model of diffusion {{and the results of}} experimental-computational investigation of critical-level pollution of atmospheric air with <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> of road <b>vehicles</b> in the vicinity of urban motor roads in conditions of reliably repeatable hazardous meteorological factors and traffic jams, with the results output in the form of electronic cartographic information about excessive concentrations of hazardous substances across the residential areas adjacent to motor roads in regard to the maximum allowable non-recurring concentrations. Using this approach of mathematical modeling of turbulent diffusion is based on feasible approximations and empirical elaborations that were used as the basis of the Russian normative document for calculating the dispersion of hazardous substances in the atmospheric air – “OND- 86 ”.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the methods {{developed for the}} aerodynamic analysis and the shape optimization of the nozzle-afterbody section of a hypersonic <b>vehicle.</b> Initially, <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> were assumed to be air. Internal-external flows around a single scramjet module were analyzed by solving the 3 D Navier-Stokes equations. Then, <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> were simulated by a cold mixture of Freon and Ar. Two different models were used to compute these multispecies flows as they mixed with the hypersonic airflow. Surface and off-surface properties were successfully compared with the experimental data. The Aerodynamic Design Optimization with Sensitivity analysis was then developed. Pre- and postoptimization sensitivity coefficients were derived and used in this quasi-analytical method. These coefficients were also used to predict inexpensively the flow field around a changed shape when the flow field of an unchanged shape was given. Starting with totally arbitrary initial afterbody shapes, independent computations were converged to the same optimum shape, which rendered the maximum axial thrust...|$|R
