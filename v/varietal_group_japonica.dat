The accessions represent {{a variety of}} backgrounds (Additional file 1 : Table S 1) which might {{explain some of the}} variation in root traits. For example, <b>varietal</b> <b>group</b> <b>Japonica</b> cultivars are typically considered to have deeper and thicker roots than those of Indica, facilitating deep soil penetration and water acquisition in upland conditions (Gowda et al. 2011). In this study, the thickest nodal roots in this study were indeed Japonica cultivars, i.e. Yabani 47 and Nabatat Asmar. However, the two cultivars with the greatest root depth were Japonica (Nabatat Asmar) and indica (Egypt 5), and the shortest was Japonica (Yabani 47, Fig. 1).|$|E
40|$|Aluminum (Al) {{toxicity}} {{is a major}} {{stress factor}} limiting agricultural production on highly acidic soils. These types of soils, with pH values [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 5. 0, are distributed over 70 % of the world's potentially arable land. Rice (O. sativa L.) {{is one of the}} most Al tolerant species among smallgrain cereals, and within rice, cultivars from the <b>varietal</b> <b>group</b> <b>Japonica</b> are more tolerant than the Indica cultivar types. The genetic architecture of Al tolerance in rice is complex involving several genes and physiological mechanisms. To explore the natural genetic variation of Al tolerance in rice we developed 4 sets of reciprocal near isogenic lines (NILs), each targeting one of four loci associated with Al tolerance on chromosomes 1, 2, 9, and 12 from a cross between the Al susceptible indica cultivar, IR 64, and the Al tolerant tropical japonica cultivar, Azucena. Phenotypic evaluation for Al tolerance in the NILs validated the effects of the QTLs on chromosomes 1, 9, and 12. We further explored the genetic basis of Al tolerance at the QTL on chromosome 12 by implementing a recombinant fine-mapping approach and narrowed down the target region to a ~ 44 Kb locus that contained 6 predicted genes, including ART 1, a transcription factor known to regulate the expression of 31 genes in an Al-dependent manner, many of them involved in different Al tolerance mechanisms. These newly developed NILs, and two sets of interspecific introgression lines (ILs), constructed using two wild accessions as donors, O. rufipogon Griff., and O. meridionalis Ng., and a common recurrent parent, cv. Curinga (O. sativa ssp. tropical japonica), represent valuable germplasm resources for understanding the genetic basis of Al tolerance in rice. They can be used as parental materials for fine mapping and positional cloning efforts and as the basis for detailed molecular physiology studies. This work is also the first effort to confirm whether ART 1, our strongest candidate gene in the 44 Kb region, is responsible for the Al tolerance effect of the QTL on chromosome 12. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E
30|$|Haplotypes of outgroups (O. officinalis (CC) and O. australiensis (EE)) {{were very}} {{distinct}} {{from those of}} the ORSC. The outgroup haplotypes joined the network at cpGroup V, a haplotype found almost exclusively in W 1 and admixed individuals, further supporting the ancestral nature of the W 1 group. The network had several loops; given the historically non-recombining nature of the chloroplast genome, loops are interpreted as being due to substitutional parallelisms and reversals rather than to recombination. This reticulate structure complicates interpretation of the network; however, outgroup rooting clearly split the network into two large groups strongly associated with the two major O. sativa <b>varietal</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>JAPONICA</b> (tropical japonica, temperate japonica, aromatic) and INDICA (indica, aus), referred to as cpGroup I (or the JAPONICA-cpGroup) and cpGroup VIII (or the INDICA-cpGroup), respectively. cpGroup I haplotypes were found in 87.5  % of cultivated japonica cultivars and 58.8  % of W 6 accessions, the most closely related ancestral group, while cpGroup VIII haplotypes were found in 77.8  % of cultivated indica, 80  % of cultivated aus cultivars, and only 47.6 and 48.4  % of the related W 1 and W 4 accessions, respectively. The divergence between these two chloroplast groups is not as obvious in the ORSC accessions {{as it is in the}} O. sativa groups. This is consistent with the results of the Mantel test suggesting that geographical dispersion of ORSC populations and admixture with O. sativa (particularly for W 1, W 4 and W 6) has eroded the genetic composition of the ancestral populations from which O. sativa was originally domesticated.|$|R

30|$|Recently, a dual or {{multiple}} origin of domesticated rice {{has been the}} prevailing opinion among rice scientists because rice is clearly differentiated into two major <b>varietal</b> <b>groups,</b> indica and <b>japonica,</b> and several minor groups. Molecular clock studies that suggested that divergence in the A-genome wild rice genepool occurred prior to domestication gave further weight to the opinion that rice had a dual origin. However, recent analysis of the major gene {{that is responsible for}} the difference in degree of shattering between rice and wild rice has revealed that it is the same mutation in indica and japonica rice, which is not compatible with a dual origin of domesticated rice. Here, we discuss the geographic and genetic reasons why a single origin for domesticated rice is compatible with current data regarding the evolution of rice. The apparently conflicting data regarding the origin of rice can be resolved by the role hybridisation–introgression has played during rice evolution since domestication.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{domestication}} of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) was {{a complex}} process punctuated by episodes of introgressive hybridization among and between subpopulations. Deep genetic divergence between the two main <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> (Indica and <b>Japonica)</b> suggests domestication from at least two distinct wild populations. However, genetic uniformity surrounding key domestication genes across divergent subpopulations suggests cultural exchange of genetic material among ancient farmers. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we utilize a novel 1, 536 SNP panel genotyped across 395 diverse accessions of O. sativa to study genome-wide patterns of polymorphism, to characterize population structure, and to infer the introgression history of domesticated Asian rice. Our population structure analyses support the existence of five major subpopulations (indica, aus, tropical japonica, temperate japonica and GroupV) consistent with previous analyses. Our introgression analysis shows that most accessions exhibit some degree of admixture, with many individuals within a population sharing the same introgressed segment due to artificial selection. Admixture mapping and association analysis of amylose content and grain length illustrate the potential for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in domesticated plant populations.

30|$|We ran GWASs on {{root cone}} angle in indica and japonica panels of {{intermediate}} size, which were genotyped with two large sets of markers. The root cone angle was assessed {{in a total}} population of 331 accessions and enabled the identification of accessions with exceptionally wide root cone angles. This phenotype seems relatively frequent in O. sativa and distributed in different <b>varietal</b> <b>groups.</b> In our <b>japonica</b> panel, these accessions included all those belonging to the bulu ecotype, confirming the results obtained by Ueno and Sato (1989, 1992) and a few temperate japonica lines from South Asia {{that had not yet}} been identified as carrying such mutations. Ueno and Sato (1992) also found accessions with wide root cone angle among the aus and boro ecotypes from India and tjereh from Indonesia that belong to the indica subspecies. We did not find any such line in our indica panel, but these specific ecotypes were represented by very few accessions, probably too few to detect the mutation. Not considering mutants, the root cone angles of the indica and japonica panels largely overlapped, while indica accessions are said to be generally shallow rooted and japonica accessions to be deep rooted (Lafitte et al. 2001). One could wonder whether this result is specific to our phenotyping system. However, Uga et al. (2009), using the 3 D basket system, also concluded that {{there was no significant difference}} in the distribution of an index based on root cone angle between the indica and <b>japonica</b> <b>groups.</b> On an accession basis, Clark et al. (2011), using a gellan gum culture system, did not find differences in root initiation angle between IR 64 and Azucena, our two controls in the present study that are nonetheless known to have contrasting root depths (Yadav et al. 1997). These results confirm those from Abe and Morita (1994) that the link between narrow root cone angle and increased root depth cannot be generalized in rice.|$|R

New image analysis software tools like Tomato Analyzer, allow obtaining quantitative and objective data for {{a large number of}} fruit shape parameters. The Tomato Analyzer software tool was used for the evaluation of fruit shape in a collection of traditional varieties of eggplant from four <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> (Round, Semi-long, Egg Shaped, and Long). A total of 26 fruit shape parameters were obtained using the Tomato Analyzer software. Significant differences were found among varieties for all traits, except for shoulder height. In addition, considerable differences were identified among <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> for many parameters. Values for broad-sense heritability were high for most of the traits. The principal components analysis clearly separated the four <b>varietal</b> <b>groups.</b> Discriminant analysis allowed the correct classification to their actual variety of almost 60 % of the individual fruits. The wide variation observed and high values for heritability for most fruit shape parameters indicated that the image analysis software tools like Tomato Analyzer are of great utility for the phenotypic characterization of fruit shape in eggplant germplasm.

40|$|The Anatolian {{region of}} modern-day Turkey is {{believed}} to have {{played an important role in}} the history of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) domestication and spread. Despite this, the rich grape germplasm of this region is virtually uncharacterized genetically. In this study, the amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) -based genetic relations of the grapevine accessions belonging to the 2 economically important Anatolian table grape <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> known as V. vinifera 'Misket' (Muscat) and V. vinifera 'Parmak' were studied. Thirteen AFLP primer combinations used in the analyses revealed a total of 1495 (35. 5 % polymorphic) and 1567 (34. 6 % polymorphic) DNA fragments for the 'Misket' and 'Parmak' <b>varietal</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively. The unweighted pair-group method with arthimetic averaging (UPGMA) cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCA) conducted on polymorphic AFLP markers showed that both <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> contain a number of synonymous (similar genotypes known by different names) as well as homony mous (genetically different genotypes known by the same name) accessions. Our results also showed that 6 of the Anatolian 'Misket' genotypes were genetically very similar to V. vinifera 'Muscat of Alexandria', implying that these genotypes might have played some role in the formation of this universally known grape cultivar. Finally, the close genetic similarities found here between 'Muscat of Alexandria' and V. vinifera 'Muscat of Hamburg' support the recent suggestion that 'Muscat of Hamburg' probably originated from 'Muscat of Alexandria' through spontaneous hybridizations. Overall, the results of this study have implications for not only preservation and use of the Anatolian grape germplasm, but also better understanding of the historical role that this region has played during the domestication of grapes...|$|R
40|$|Fragrance in {{the grain}} {{is one of}} the most highly valued grain quality traits in rice, yet the origin and {{evolution}} of the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (BADH 2) underlying this trait remains unclear. In this study, we identify eight putatively nonfunctional alleles of the BADH 2 gene and show that these alleles have distinct geographic and genetic origins. Despite multiple origins of the fragrance trait, a single allele, badh 2. 1, is the predominant allele in virtually all fragrant rice varieties today, including the widely recognized Basmati and Jasmine types. Haplotype analysis allowed us to establish a single origin of the badh 2. 1 allele within the <b>Japonica</b> <b>varietal</b> <b>group</b> and demonstrate the introgression of this allele from Japonica to Indica. Basmati-like accessions were nearly identical to the ancestral Japonica haplotype across a 5. 3 -Mb region flanking BADH 2 regardless of their fragrance phenotype, demonstrating a close evolutionary relationship between Basmati varieties and the Japonica gene pool.

40|$|Abstract Background Citrus {{represents}} a substantial income for {{farmers in the}} Mediterranean Basin. However, the Mediterranean citrus industry faces increasing biotic and abiotic constraints. Therefore the breeding and selection of new rootstocks are now of the utmost importance. In Tunisia, in addition to sour orange, the most widespread traditional rootstock of the Mediterranean area, other citrus rootstocks and well adapted to local environmental conditions, are traditionally used and should be important genetic resources for breeding. To characterize the diversity of Tunisian citrus rootstocks, two hundred and one local accessions belonging to four facultative apomictic species (C. aurantium, sour orange; C. sinensis, orange; C. limon, lemon; and C. aurantifolia, lime) were collected and genotyped using 20 nuclear SSR markers and four indel mitochondrial markers. Multi-locus genotypes (MLGs) were compared to references from French and Spanish collections. Results The differentiation of the four <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> was well-marked. The groups displayed a relatively high allelic diversity, primarily due to very high heterozygosity. Sixteen distinct MLGs were identified. Ten of these were noted in sour oranges. However, {{the majority of the}} analysed sour orange accessions corresponded with only two MLGs, differentiated by a single allele, likely due to a mutation. The most frequent MLG is shared with the reference sour oranges. No polymorphism was found within the sweet orange group. Two MLGs, differentiated by a single locus, were noted in lemon. The predominant MLG was shared with the reference lemons. Limes were represented by three genotypes. Two corresponded to the 'Mexican lime' and 'limonette de Marrakech' references. The MLG of 'Chiiri' lime was unique. Conclusions The Tunisian citrus rootstock genetic diversity is predominantly due to high heterozygosity and differentiation between the four <b>varietal</b> <b>groups.</b> The phenotypic diversity within the <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> has resulted from multiple introductions, somatic mutations and rare sexual recombination events. Finally, this diversity study enabled the identification of a core sample of accessions for further physiological and agronomical evaluations.

30|$|Large genetic {{variability}} {{has been}} observed in rice (Oryza sativa L.) for different root traits such as root depth, root thickness and root-to-shoot ratio (O’Toole and Bland, 1987). This variability partly follows the genetic organization of the species, which is subdivided into two major components: the indica and japonica subspecies, which themselves are subdivided into <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> and ecotypes within <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> (Garris et al. 2005). An ecotype is often characterized by a specific combination of root characteristics that are generally related to its hydrological adaptation (Lafitte et al. 2001). Of course, the ecotype general trends can largely be modified by soil conditions (composition, pH, impedance), soil biology (presence of mycorrhizae or nematodes), water regimes (aerobic or anaerobic or alternating between the two conditions) and genotype x environment interactions. The root cone angle has seldom been considered among the studied architectural root traits, except by Japanese teams who showed that most accessions of some ecotypes (aman, boro {{and some of the}} aus varieties within the indica subspecies; bulu within the japonica subspecies) had a high proportion of crown roots growing horizontally (Ueno and Sato 1992; Kato et al. 2006; Uga et al. 2009). They correlated a wide root cone angle with an absence of response to a gravitropic stimulus (Ueno and Sato 1992).|$|R
40|$|Oryza sativa or Asian {{cultivated}} rice {{is one of}} {{the major}} cereal grass species domesticated for human food use during the Neolithic. Domestication of this species from the wild grass Oryza rufipogon was accompanied by changes in several traits, including seed shattering, percent seed set, tillering, grain weight, and flowering time. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has identified three genomic regions in chromosome 3 that appear to be associated with these traits. We would like to study whether these regions show signatures of selection and whether the same genetic basis underlies the domestication of different rice varieties. Fragments of 88 genes spanning these three genomic regions were sequenced from multiple accessions of two major <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> in O. sativa [...] indica and tropical japonica [...] as well as the ancestral wild rice species O. rufipogon. In tropical japonica, the levels of nucleotide variation in these three QTL regions are significantly lower compared to genome-wide levels, and coalescent simulations based on a complex demographic model of rice domestication indicate that these patterns are consistent with selection. In contrast, there is no significant reduction in nucleotide diversity in the homologous regions in indica rice.

In our GWAS of all accessions (Fig.  2 a), one SNP (id 5007272, P value[*]=[*] 9.61 E- 04) on chromosome five co-localized with qAG 5, which is a QTL controlling submerged shoot elongation (Jiang et al. 2004) according to the physical position of the flanking markers. At the end of chromosome 7 (22.08 – 29.66  Mb) where multiple reported QTLs clustered (Angaji et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2004; Septiningsih et al. 2013), four adjacent SNPs around 27.72  Mb and one SNP at 25.12  Mb were identified in the <b>japonica</b> <b>varietal</b> <b>group</b> (Fig.  2 b).

40|$|Aluminum (Al) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} metal in the earth's crust and is predominantly found as {{a key component of}} soil clays. Under highly acidic soil conditions (pH[LESS THAN] 5. 0) it is solubilized to Al 3 +, which is highly phytotoxic. Al 3 + causes a rapid inhibition of root growth that leads to a reduced and stunted root system, thus having a direct effect on the ability of a plant to acquire both water and nutrients. Over 50 % of the world's potentially arable lands are acidic and therefore Al toxicity {{is one of the major}} limitations to global agriculture. This dissertation examines the genetic and physiological mechanisms of Al tolerance in rice and demonstrates that rice is significantly more tolerant than other cereals. Physiological experiments demonstrate that rice utilizes a novel physiological mechanism that does not involve the well described root tip exclusion of rhizosphere Al mediated by organic acid exudation that has been identified in a number of other crop species. Genetic analysis was conducted using both QTL and whole genome association analysis on a panel of 385 Oryza sativa accessions. This analysis identified that the <b>Japonica</b> <b>varietal</b> <b>group</b> is significantly more Al tolerant than the Indica <b>varietal</b> <b>group</b> and identified loci that confer tolerance both within and across rice subpopulations. Furthermore, admixture analysis identified distinct Japonica loci that increase Indica Al tolerance to levels at or above that of Japonica. The results from this suggest that rice is a unique model to study Al tolerance in cereals and will lead to experiments to further understand Al tolerance and toxicity and develop crop varieties with enhanced Al tolerance...|$|R

3000|$|... haplotype, {{primarily}} {{found in}} the indica subspecies (Hirano and Sano 1991; Dobo et al. 2010), was most probably introduced into the japonica subspecies, which till to some decades ago lacked cultivars with high amylose (Juliano 1979), from indica genotypes, which frequently have longer cycles. It can be supposed that breeding for high AAC japonica cultivars has then been commonly done by crossing within a restrict group of late-maturing materials of indica derivation, thus that the long cycle would be an instance of genetic drift (or draft). On the other hand, {{the fact that no}} significant correlation was observed between cycle length and grain shape parameters suggests that breeding for both early and late cultivars within each of the grain-type <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> has broken up any hitchhiking effect between these traits.

30|$|The main QTL (qSH 1) {{that distinguishes}} {{the degree of}} {{shattering}} between indica and japonica varieties explains 69 % {{of the difference in}} these two groups of non-shattering rice [31]. Non-shattering alleles at some shattering loci are present in Japanese weedy rice [73]. Weedy rice differs in the degree of shattering, but all weedy rice readily shed their seeds either naturally like wild rice or at a slight touch during the harvesting of rice. Therefore, some degree of non-shattering is not a condition that a plant is a domesticate. Only non-shattering that prevents seeds easily falling prior to harvest can be considered a feature of a domesticated cereal. In rice, there is only one known gene that significantly (> 50 %) prevents shattering and that gene is sh 4 [36]. Analysis of this non-shattering allele in 96 indica varieties and 112 japonica varieties has shown that this allele is the same in both <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> [37].|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four alfalfa varieties, {{representing}} four <b>varietal</b> <b>groups,</b> {{were compared}} for nitrogen content and protein yeild. A highly {{significant difference between}} varieties was noted for nitrogen content, and a sinificant difference for protein yield. Saskatchewan 666 had the highest content in the first cutting, but Ledak 22009 had the hightest content in the third. Group differences were not significant. Crop differences were highly significatn for nitrogen content, yield of forage, and of protein. In the case of every variety, the third cutting was richer in nitrogen than the second and the seemd was richer than the first. Protein yield, however, was affected more by forage weight than by nitrogen conent, and most varieties gave more than 45 percent of their total annual production of protein in the first cutting.

40|$|International audienceRetrotransposons are mobile genetic elements, {{ubiquitous}} in Eukaryotic genomes, which {{have proven to}} be major genetic tools in determining phylogeny and structuring genetic diversity, notably in plants. We investigate here the diversity of the Ty 1 -copia retrotransposon Tos 17 in the cultivated rice of Asian origin (Oryza sativa L.) and related AA genome species of the Oryza genus, to contribute understanding of the complex evolutionary history in this group of species through that of the element in the lineages. In that aim, we used a combination of Southern hybridization with a reverse transcriptase (RT) probe and an adapter-PCR mediated amplification, which allowed the sequencing of the genomic regions flanking Tos 17 insertions. This analysis was carried out in a collection of 47 A-genome Oryza species accessions and 202 accessions of a core collection of Oryza sativa L. representative of the diversity of the species. Our Southern hybridization results show that Tos 17 is present in all the accessions of the A-genome Oryza species, except for the South American species O. glumaepatula and the African species O. glaberrima and O. breviligulata. In O. sativa, the number of putative copies of Tos 17 per accession ranged from 1 to 11 and multivariate analysis based on presence/absence of putative copies yielded a varietal clustering which is consistent with the isozyme classification of rice. Adapter PCR amplification and sequencing of flanking regions of Tos 17 insertions in A-genome species other than O. sativa, followed by anchoring on the Nipponbare genome sequence, revealed 13 insertion sites of Tos 17 in the surveyed O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata accessions, including one shared by both species. In O. sativa, the same approach revealed 25 insertions in the 6 <b>varietal</b> <b>groups.</b> Four insertion sites located on chromosomes 1, 2, 10, and 11 were found orthologous in O. rufipogon and O. sativa. The chromosome 1 insertion was also shared between O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata. The presence of Tos 17 at three insertion sites was confirmed by retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphism (RBIP) in a sample of O. sativa accessions. The first insertion, located on chromosome 3 was only found in two japonica accessions from the Bhutan region while the second insertion, located on chromosome 10 was specific to the <b>varietal</b> <b>groups</b> 1, 2, and 5. The third insertion located on chromosome 7 corresponds to the only insertion shown active in rice so far, notably in cv. Nipponbare, where it has been extensively used for insertion mutagenesis. This copy was only found in a few varieties of the <b>japonica</b> <b>group</b> 6 and in one group 5 accession. Taken together, these results confirm that Tos 17 was probably present in the ancestor of A-genome species and that some copies of the element remained active in some Oryza lineages [...] notably in O. rufipogon and O. longistaminata [...] {{as well as in the}} indica and japonica O. sativa L. lineages...|$|R
