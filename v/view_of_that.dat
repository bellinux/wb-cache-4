25|$|The Latécoère 350 first flew on 2 February 1931, piloted by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It {{turned out}} that the 350 had come out more than 30% overweight, an excess of about a tonne. Consequently the useful load was reduced from the design {{estimate}} of 1,000kg (2,205lbs) to about 350kg (772lbs), making the 350 quite unfit for purpose. In <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> it hardly mattered that flight tests showed that some of the performance estimates were optimistic: maximum speed was 5% less and the stalling speed higher. Since the aircraft was government funded and its property, Saint-Exupéry flew it to Villacoublay early in 1933. Its career thereafter is not recorded.|$|E

Fagen remembered being enchanted by the prospects of a [...] "gleaming future," [...] and hoped to give an optimistic look back at it. [...] "Green Flower Street" [...] is a [...] "nod to the jazz standard On Green Dolphin Street." [...] "Ruby Baby" [...] is modeled after the Drifters' version of the song. For his rewrite of [...] "Ruby Baby", he listened to several records from the 1950s to [...] "get a general atmosphere of the period." [...] "Maxine" [...] references the harmonies of the Four Freshmen, and revolves around an [...] "extremely idealized version of high-school romance." [...] The tune was created from an unrelated drum track played by Ed Greene. Fagen felt that drum track was not working for that particular song, but was so taken with it he wrote a new song around it, which became [...] "Maxine".|$|E

However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said the municipality was destroying not just a [...] "monument to humanity" [...] but [...] "humanity itself".

2500|$|A {{significant}} contribution to philosophy of language is Russell's theory of descriptions, set out in On Denoting (Mind, 1905). Frank P. Ramsey described this paper as [...] "a paradigm of philosophy." [...] The theory considers the sentence [...] "The present King of France is bald" [...] and whether the proposition is false or meaningless. Frege had argued, employing his distinction between sense and reference, that such sentences were meaningful but neither true nor false. [...] Russell argues that the grammatical form of the sentence disguises its underlying logical form. [...] Russell's Theory of Definite Descriptions enables the sentence to be construed as meaningful but false, without commitment {{to the existence of}} any present King of France. This addresses a paradox of great antiquity (e.g. [...] "That which is not must in some sense be. Otherwise, how could we say of it that it is not?" [...] etc.), going back {{at least as far as}} Parmenides. [...] In Russell's own time, Meinong held the <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> which is not being in some sense real; and Russell held this view prior to On Denoting.|$|E

Armenian groups felt betrayed at the reversal of promises of recognition made during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election whist Turkish authorities felt that Obama had gone back on promises made during the recent 2009 US presidential visit to Turkey. Despite not saying the word genocide, Obama made it clear that he had not changed his views about the Armenian Genocide in the statement, saying [...] "I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> history has not changed." ...|$|E
