40|$|Abstract—The {{characteristics}} of nanotip-enhanced plasma lamps (NTL) as a backlight for liquid crystal displays {{have been investigated}} on a 14 -in panel. Using a direct-current pulse bipolar waveform driving, the NTL operates with lower igni-tion and sustain voltages below 300 V compared with conven-tional plasma lamps due to the tiny discharge gap between the indium tin oxide electrode and nanotip electrodes. Lumi-nous efficiencies of 16 lm/W at the lowest ignition voltage of 150 V have been realized for NTL, which correspond to 3780 cd/m 2 of luminance in 260 V with 50 torr of pure xenon gas. Index Terms—Lamps, LCD, microdischarge. R ECENTLY, backlighting liquid crystal display (LCD) panels has become a key research issue for increasing the <b>diagonal</b> <b>size</b> for monitor to television applications. In increasing the <b>diagonal</b> <b>size</b> of the panel, cost is a major factor. Light-emitting diode backlight is still expensive compared with other backlights such as cold cathode fluorescent lamp, hot cathode fluorescent lamp, external electrode fluorescent lamp, and flat fluorescent lamp. Furthermore, the driving voltage of the existing backlights {{is higher than the}} 1 – 2 kV required to operate LCD. Producing difficulties in terms of luminous efficiency, cost, and electrical hazard. In this paper, we report on the nanotip-enhanced plasma lamp (NTL) using nanotip electrodes which are fabricated by semiconductor processes. The NTL ignites a wide and stable plasma along the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and silver electrodes on the front and rear panels, respectively [1]. The NTL excited the phosphor layer by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and generated visible white light at a lower ignition voltage because of the field emission at the nanotip electrodes. A plasma lamp has been reported, which used carbon nanotube as a needle electrode to converge the equipotential lines to improve the local electric field and generate the field emission [2]. The NTL uses xenon as a discharge gas to replace mercury. We investigated a 14 -in NTL mercury free flat plasma lamp for LCD backlight with low driving voltage, high luminance, and luminous efficiency...|$|R
