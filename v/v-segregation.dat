40|$|The {{fluid flow}} and {{solidification}} of ingot casting was studied. In this study, the fluid flow during the bottom teeming process was investigated with water model experiments and numerical simulation. A user-defined liquid-solid two-phase solidification solver was developed {{based on the}} software platform of OpenFOAM, using Euler-Euler two-phase approach. The solidification solver was performed on a 3 -dimensional model of steel ingot to simulate the solidification and macrosegregation distribution. In water model experiments, water and vegetable oil were used to simulate the molten steel and slag phase, respectively. The influence of model parameters, such as the filling rate, nozzle dimensions and oil film thickness, on the filling conditions was investigated, concerning two aspects: one is the slag entrapment, {{and the other is}} reoxidation of molten steel. Both of the two situations should be avoid to provide a better filling condition. The numerical simulation on water-air two-phase flow with the interFoam solver of OpenFOAM was performed. The obtained predictions were in good agreement with the water model experiments. The simulation of solidification can obtain the evolution of the solid fraction, velocity, temperature, concentration and grain density fields. The macrosegregation was indicated by the concentration of the only solute âˆ’ carbon. The cone-shaped negative segregation at the bottom, positive segregation at the top, <b>V-segregation</b> at the upper center of the ingot, and the channel-shaped A-segregation were predicted. The simulation results of macrosegregation ratio on certain lines were generally in agreement with the experimental measurements from the literature, except for some deviations at the bottom and the near-wall regions, where the predicted degree of negative segregation was much stronger than the measured one...|$|E
