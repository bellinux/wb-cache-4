Throughout the book runs a wry impatience with {{the vagaries of}} modern officialdom, from the “matey automaton” on the phone who can’t understand the command “I’d {{like to speak to}} someone”, to the security system at a newspaper that tells a man standing outside that he’s on record as being dead, and that they’ll need photographic proof of ID and a <b>verification</b> <b>meeting</b> with the news group’s lawyers before they’ll accept otherwise. This same faceless bureaucracy, with its emphasis on efficiency and streamlining over joy and common sense, is destroying library services. Let’s hope that those responsible will read this collection and be distracted from their thankless task." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{design for}} {{modifications}} to the CSB Cask Receiving pit guides was verified by the informal design <b>verification</b> (<b>meeting)</b> method on August 9, 2000. The invited list of attendees and the meeting attendance sheet are included in attachment 1. The design modifications that were reviewed are documented in ECN 654484 (attachment 2). The requirement that the design is to be verified against is to ''center the transportation cask sufficiently to allow installation of the guide funnel on the cask ({+-} 0. 25 inches or less) ''. The alternatives considered are detailed in attachment 3. Alternative number 4, ''Modify The Pit Guides'', {{was determined to be}} the preferred alternative primarily due to considerations of simplicity, reliability, and low cost. Alternative 1, ''Rotate the impact Absorber 180 {sup o}'', was successfully performed but was considered a temporary fix that was not acceptable for a long term operational mode. The requirement to position the receiving crane accurately enough to lower the transportation cask into the pit with the redesigned guides was discussed and considered to be achievable without undue effort from the operator. The tolerance on the OD of the transfer cask was discussed ({+-} 1 / 8 inch) relative to the clearance with the guides. As-built dimensions for the cask OD will be looked at to verify sufficient clearance exists with the maximum cask OD. The final design thickness of the shims under the guides will be based on the as-built cask OD dimensions and field measurements between the pit guides. The need for a ''plastic'' cover for the guides was discussed and deemed unnecessary. Thermal growth of the cask OD was calculated at 3 - 5 mils and considered insignificant. The possibility of reducing the OD of the guide funnel was reviewed but this was considered impractical due to the requirement for the MCO to miss the edge of the funnel in case of a MCO drop. One of the transportation casks have the lift trunions installed 3 / 8 inch off center. This is not expected to present a problem, but needs to be verified. Operations personnel were not in attendance to discuss the method for lowering the cask into the pit, however it was the consensus of those who observed the lowering operation performed by startup that it is operationally viable. The proposed design will be presented to Operations for review prior to issuance of the ECN. The final conclusion of the attendees is that the design meets the requirement ''center the cask sufficiently to allow installation of the guide funnel. '...|$|E

40|$|Frédérique Six (1962) studied Environmental Engineering at Wageningen University. Upon {{graduation}} in 1987 {{she joined}} McKinsey & Company {{as a business}} analyst and obtained her MBA at INSEAD (Fontainebleau, France) in 1988. She rejoined McKinsey & Company as an associate {{and worked in the}} Amsterdam and London offices from 1989 - 1993 providing management consulting services to top management of large corporations and government institutions. From 1993 through 1999 she worked with KPMG Environmental Consulting as a senior management consultant and with KPMG Inspire Foundation as a senior researcher researching new ways of organizing. She has coedited The trust process, empirical studies of the determinants and the process of trust development (with Bart Nooteboom, Edward Elgar, 2003). In 2004 she obtained her Ph. D. in management at Erasmus University Rotterdam and joined the department of Public Administration and Organization Science at Free University (Amsterdam). Her research focuses on integrity and trust within and between organizations in both public and private sector. Her research interests are integrity dilemmas; dynamics of trust processes in work relations; creating structures and processes that stimulate integrity and trust; creating conditions for learning, innovation and change in organizations; tackling social challenges with dialogue in issue networks, social entrepreneurship and social partnerships. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out more about how trust works as an interactive and asymmetrical process, how trust is built up against the inevitable occurrence of trouble and how organizational policies and settings affect the generation and maintenance of trust. A theory of interpersonal trust building is developed based on relational signalling theory. The key argument put forward in this study is that for interpersonal trust to be built in work relations within organizations, both individuals in the relationship need to have their actions guided by a stable normative frame. Thus the stability of normative frames becomes a joint goal and likely to be jointly produced within the relationship. The theory shows that for interpersonal trust to be built (1) legitimate distrust situations must be taken away through interest alignment arrangements, (2) institutional arrangements must be put in place that stimulate frame resonance, (3) both individuals must regularly perform actions conveying positive relational signals and (4) both individuals involved in a trouble situation must at least act in ways that are not perceived as negative relational signals. A multiple case study strategy was applied covering two organizations. Embedded within the case study strategy, a multi-method approach was used with interviews, observations, a questionnaire survey, documents and <b>verification</b> <b>meetings</b> as instruments for three types of analysis: a quantitative trust and trouble event analysis, a quantitative survey analysis and qualitative analyses...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{component}} based methodology for the description of complex systems and its application {{to the field of}} avionics components design. Avionics design involves several engineering branches, namely physics, electronics and computational science. Three viewpoints are extracted from this context: architectural, operating and functional viewpoints. The case study we use to illustrate this paper describes the compositional design of a subsystem of an aircraft's flight controls. We show the description and composition of multiple viewpoints, the expression of critical properties on independent viewpoints, {{as well as on the}} resulting composite system. In a second step, we discuss how existing formal specification and verification techniques can be used to achieve requirement <b>meeting</b> <b>verification.</b> An application on the case study is also provided...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the task of {{assistance}} to fact-finding has gradually become central {{to the field of}} meeting browsing. Requirements elicitation studies could not lead alone to a precise specification, because they depend on the preliminary assumptions of each study. Therefore, user studies were gradually focused towards the most promising task, namely fact finding or <b>verification</b> in multimedia <b>meeting</b> recordings. This task answers significant user needs, has enough theoretical interest, and is within reach of current technology, as illustrated by a variety of meeting browsers, including end-user products for conference recording and browsing. Assistance to fact-finding has been evaluated using the Browser Evaluation Test, and a set of reference scores are now available. The analysis of these findings departs from the view that a system’s lifecycle forms a closed loop, alternating requirements elicitation with design, implementation, and evaluation. Instead, the paper proposes a helix model that moves forward towards more and more refined systems, sometimes branching out to a new task. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background Intervention {{research}} provides {{important information}} regarding feasible and effective interventions for health policy makers, but few empirical studies have explored the {{mechanisms by which}} these studies influence policy and practice. This study provides an exploratory case series analysis of the policy, practice and other related impacts of the 15 research projects funded through the New South Wales Health Promotion Demonstration Research Grants Scheme during the period 2000 to 2006, and explored the factors mediating impacts. Methods Data collection included semi-structured interviews with the chief investigators (n = 17) and end-users (n = 29) {{of each of the}} 15 projects to explore if, how and under what circumstances the findings had been used, as well as bibliometric analysis and verification using documentary evidence. Data analysis involved thematic coding of interview data and triangulation with other data sources to produce case summaries of impacts for each project. Case summaries were then individually assessed against four impact criteria and discussed at a <b>verification</b> panel <b>meeting</b> where final group assessments of the impact of research projects were made and key influences of research impact identified. Results Funded projects had variable impacts on policy and practice. Project findings were used for agenda setting (raising awareness of issues), identifying areas and target groups for interventions, informing new policies, and supporting and justifying existing policies and programs across sectors. Reported factors influencing the use of findings were: i) nature of the intervention; ii) leadership and champions; iii) research quality; iv) effective partnerships; v) dissemination strategies used; and, vi) contextual factors. Conclusions The case series analysis provides new insights into how and under what circumstances intervention research is used to influence real world policy and practice. The findings highlight that intervention research projects can achieve the greatest policy and practice impacts if they address proximal needs of the policy context by engaging end-users from the inception of projects and utilizing existing policy networks and structures, and using a range of strategies to disseminate findings that go beond traditional peer review publications. <br /...|$|R
