40|$|Survival for any organism, {{including}} people, is {{a matter}} if resource management. To ensure survival, people necessarily budget their resources. Our spatial perceptions contribute to resource budgeting by scaling the environment to our available resources. Effective budgeting requires setting a balance of income and expenditures around some baseline value. For social resources, this baseline assumes that the individual is embedded in their social network. A {{review of the literature}} supports the proposal that our <b>visual</b> <b>perceptions</b> vary based on the implicit budgeting of physical and social resources, where social resources, as they fluctuate relative to a baseline, can directly alter our <b>visual</b> <b>perceptions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and <b>visual</b> <b>perception.</b> Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E

25|$|The {{major problem}} in <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> is that what people see {{is not simply a}} {{translation}} of retinal stimuli (i.e., the image on the retina).

25|$|Ongoing brain {{activity}} {{may also have}} an important role in perception, as it may interact with activity related to incoming stimuli. Indeed, EEG studies suggest that <b>visual</b> <b>perception</b> is dependent on both the phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations.

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to systematically map the visual sensations induced by focal and non invasive stimulation of the human occipital cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We have tried to address the following questions: (i) Is it possible to induce <b>visual</b> <b>perceptions</b> by TMS pulses to the occipital cortex of sighted and blind subjects? (ii) Is there variability in the properties of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptions</b> {{as a function of the}} scalp position stimulated? (iii) Does the orientation of the coil influence the size, intensity, location, or other characteristics of the perceived phosphenes? (iv) Can TMS mapping be used for non-invasive investigation of the functional organization of the human visual cortex? Methods: TMS was applied with a figure of eight coil to 28 positions arranged in a 2 x 2 cm grid over the occipital area. A digitizing tablet connected to a PC computer running customized software, and audio and video recording were used for detailed and accurate data collection and analysis of evoked <b>visual</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Phosphenes were analyzed in regards to subjective size, intensity, characteristics, and position in visual field. A frameless image-guided neuronavigational device was used to describe the position of the actual sites of the stimulation coils relative to the cortical surface. Results: Our results show that TMS is able to elicit <b>visual</b> <b>perceptions</b> in almost all sighted subjects and in some proportion of blind subjects. Many subjects perceived structured phosphenes, as well as chromatic and kinetic phosphenes. Evoked perceptions were topographically organized. Despite minor inter-individual variations, the mapping results was reproducible and showed good congruence among different subjects. Conclusion: We conclude that TMS mapping has potential to improve our understanding of the physiologic organization and plastic changes in the human visual system and to establish the degree of remaining functional visual cortex in blind subjects. Such a non-invasive method could be used for the selection of suitable subjects for a cortical visual prosthesis...|$|R
