500|$|Handel's {{speed of}} {{composition}} was assisted by his inclusion of arias and other numbers from his earlier Italian works, among them [...] "Bel piacere" [...] and [...] "Basta che sol" [...] from Agrippina, [...] "Sibillar gli angui" [...] from the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, and the mermaids' song [...] "Il <b>vostro</b> maggio" [...] from the cantata Arresta il passo. Almirena's aria [...] "Lascia ch'io pianga" [...] {{had appeared in}} the oratorio Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno. The suitability of some of these insertions has been questioned by later commentators; Dean and Knapp cite Argante's [...] "Sibillar gli angui", with its references to the hissing snakes of Alecto and the howls of Scylla, as [...] "ludicrously inappropriate" [...] to accompany the king's grand Act 1 entrance. Many other numbers—Dean and Knapp estimate two-thirds of the arias—were adapted and partly recomposed from earlier sources.|$|E
2500|$|Perissone was a {{versatile}} stylist, and wrote both light and serious madrigals, with a texture varying from the smooth polyphony of the Netherlanders to bright, largely chordal textures. [...] Sometimes he anticipated harmonic {{developments of the}} 17th century, such as when he used the bass voice as a harmonic support {{rather than as an}} equal participant in the motivic interplay of a composition. [...] He was also fond of false relations, as in his setting of Gottifredi's Deh, perchè com'è il <b>vostro</b> al nome mio, a madrigal which also contains deliberately mis-accented text setting, a characteristic which distinguishes him from his teacher Willaert, who was more inclined to follow Pietro Bembo's strict advice on text setting.|$|E
2500|$|Octavian {{returns to}} Rome in [...] "De Patre <b>Vostro</b> (About Your Father)", and {{establishes}} {{his position as}} the first Roman Emperor. During his triumph, Atia, while intimidating Livia out of her rightful place {{and making sure that}} she herself is seen as the First Woman in Rome, begins to realize that she may {{no longer be able to}} control her son. She begins to sadly ponder on how Octavian developed from a good honest child to a cruel liar and the full weight of her failures both as a mother as well as a politician become clear to her. When the trophies of Octavian's victory over Antony are paraded before the Senate, she is seen one last time, with a deep sadness in her eyes.|$|E
