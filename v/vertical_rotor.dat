Initial models were fitted with engines rated at 2,200 horsepower each. The counter-rotating rotors eliminate the need for an antitorque <b>vertical</b> <b>rotor,</b> allowing all power to be used for lift and thrust. The ability to adjust lift in either rotor makes it less sensitive to changes in the center of gravity, important for the cargo lifting and dropping. While hovering over a specific location, a twin-rotor helicopter has increased stability over a single rotor when weight is added or removed, for example, when troops drop from or begin climbing up ropes to the aircraft, or when other cargo is dropped. If one engine fails, the other can drive both rotors. The [...] "sizing" [...] of the Chinook was directly related to the growth of the Huey and the Army's tacticians' insistence that initial air assaults be built around the squad. The Army pushed for both the Huey and the Chinook, and this focus was responsible for the acceleration of its air mobility effort.|$|E

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) {{have been}} utilized widely to support high-speed rotors. However, {{in the case}} of AMB failure, emergencies, or overload conditions, the auxiliary bearing is chosen as the backup protector to provide mechanical supports and displacement constraints for the rotor. With lack of support, the auxiliary bearing will catch the dropping rotor. Accordingly, high contact forces and corresponding thermal generation due to mechanical rub are applied on the dynamic contact area. Rapid deterioration may be brought about by excessive dynamic and thermal shocks. Therefore the auxiliary bearing must be sufficiently robust to guarantee the safety of the AMB system. Many approaches have been put forward in the literature to estimate the rotor dynamic motion, nonetheless most of them focus on the horizontal rotor drop and few consider the inclination around the horizontal plane for the <b>vertical</b> <b>rotor.</b> The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to predict the rotor dynamic behavior accurately for the <b>vertical</b> <b>rotor</b> drop case. A detailed model for the <b>vertical</b> <b>rotor</b> drop process with consideration of the rotating inclination around x- and y- axes is proposed in this paper.

40|$|Abstract. A {{model for}} the coupled lateral and {{torsional}} vibrations of a vertical unbalanced rotor is developed. The equation of motion is obtained using Lagrangian dynamics without considering the external actuating forces and torque. The equation showed coupling and nonlinear interaction between the rotor lateral and torsional vibrations. Most of the earlier work on coupled vibrations has been done for the horizontal rotor model. The coupled vibrations for a <b>vertical</b> <b>rotor</b> have not {{been reported in the}} past. An attempt is made to reveal dynamic characteristics of <b>vertical</b> <b>rotor.</b> The results of the simulation showed the coupled between torsional and lateral vibrations is induced by mass eccentricity. Coupled vibrations have appeared in the start period of the vibration. After a transient vibration process, the vibrations are not coupling. The lateral vibration becomes equal amplitude with shafting speed. And the torsional vibration keeps on attenuating until it stops. When the vibration is coupled, the coupling effect on which torsional vibration to lateral vibration is evident. But there’s no coupling effect on the lateral to the torsional. It is also shown that for some operational parameters, the controlling action may excite large lateral vibrations due to coupling with the torsional motion. ...|$|E

Meanwhile, parameter uncertainties, nonlinearities and external disturbances will further deteriorate {{the performance of the}} rotor. Therefore, in this paper, we present a rotor orientation control system based on an active magnetic bearing with L 1 adaptive control to restrain the influence of the nonlinearity and uncertainty and reduce the vibration amplitude of the <b>vertical</b> <b>rotor.</b> The boundedness and stability of the adaptive system are analyzed via a theoretical derivation. The impact of the adaptive gain is discussed through simulation. An experimental rig based on dSPACE is designed to test the validity of the rotor orientation system. The experimental results show that the relative vibration amplitude of the rotor using the L 1 adaptive controller will be reduced to ∼ 50 % of that in the initial state, which is a 10 % greater reduction than can be achieved with the nonadaptive controller.

Most of the commercial software is designed to calculate rotordynamic and bearing properties based on machines with a horizontally oriented rotor; that is, the bearing properties are calculated at a static eccentricity.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} about <b>vertical</b> <b>rotors</b> immersed in fluid annulus of moderate confinement. Such rotors are subjected to the dynamical effects of the fluctuating co-rotating flows. For high enough spinning velocities, the fluid-elastic forces become significant, and often lead to unstable dynamical regimes. These depend on the fluid gap and density, on the rotor eccentricity and spinning velocity, as well as structural properties. We developed an improved linear model for rotors under moderate fluid confinement {{as well as an}} exact model for the corresponding nonlinear rotordynamics. Recently a symbolic-numerical formulation based on a spectral/Galerkin approach was also developed by the authors. Numerical results showed a quite good agreement between exact solutions and these formulations and experimental validation of the theoretical model has been provided for symmetrically-supported rotors. Numerical simulations carried over immersed rotor configurations maintained by non-isotropic supports show that the rotor stability is affected by support stiffness-asymmetry. In this paper, we briefly summarize the theoretical approaches used in the numerical simulations and present an analysis of the linear rotor-dynamics, {{as a function of the}} support stiffness-asymmetry and of the rotor eccentricity.
