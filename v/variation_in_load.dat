50|$|Steam turbine {{governing}} is {{the procedure}} {{of controlling the}} flow rate of steam to a steam turbine so as to maintain its speed of rotation as constant. The <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>load</b> during the operation of a steam turbine can {{have a significant impact}} on its performance. In a practical situation the load frequently varies from the designed or economic load and thus there always exists a considerable deviation from the desired performance of the turbine. The primary objective in the steam turbine operation is to maintain a constant speed of rotation irrespective of the varying load. This can be achieved by means of governing in a steam turbine.There are many types of governors.|$|E
50|$|Another design {{technique}} to prevent failures is called physics of failure. This technique relies on understanding the physical static and dynamic failure mechanisms. It accounts for <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>load,</b> strength, and stress {{that lead to}} failure {{with a high level}} of detail, made possible with the use of modern finite element method (FEM) software programs that can handle complex geometries and mechanisms such as creep, stress relaxation, fatigue, and probabilistic design (Monte Carlo simulations/DOE). The material or component can be re-designed to reduce the probability of failure and to make it more robust against such variations. Another common design technique is component derating: i.e. selecting components whose specifications significantly exceed the expected stress levels, such as using heavier gauge electrical wire than might normally be specified for the expected electric current.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} L network {{impedance}} matching analytically. The equation describing {{the effect of}} load impedance variation on the impedance matching performance is derived. The deviation from perfect match {{is proportional to the}} <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>load</b> reflection coefficient. However, if the load impedance is too large or too small, resulting in a large reflection coefficient, the solution to the impedance matching problem will have poorer quality in term of variability. The variability factor increases rapidly when the load reflection coefficient is larger than 0. 7. A small variation in the load impedance will cause a large deviation from perfect match.
