Friedrich sought {{not just}} to explore the blissful {{enjoyment}} of a beautiful <b>view,</b> <b>as</b> in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of sublimity, a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature.|$|E
5|$|Leicester {{also built}} a loggia, or open gallery, beside the great keep {{to lead to}} the new formal gardens. The loggia was {{designed}} to elegantly frame the <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the observer slowly admired the gardens, and was a new design in the 16th century, only recently imported from Italy.|$|E
5|$|Like many low-mass stars, Gliese 876 is a {{variable}} star. Its variable star designation is IL Aquarii {{and it is}} classified as a BY Draconis variable. Its brightness fluctuates by around 0.04 magnitudes. This type of variability {{is thought to be}} caused by large starspots moving in and out of <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the star rotates. Gliese 876 emits X-rays.|$|E

5|$|There are, in addition, {{matrices}} {{that effect}} Lorentz boosts. These {{can be thought}} of, in the passive <b>view,</b> <b>as</b> (instantly!) giving the coordinate system (and with it the observer) a velocity in a chosen direction.|$|E
5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's <b>view,</b> <b>as</b> well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's {{original}} offer to travel in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it clear to her that he only wants to be friends and nothing more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes a detour to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from <b>view</b> <b>as</b> she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees her in his telescope and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E

5|$|Even so, Christians {{have noted}} with concern the {{disintegration}} of traditional Huaorani culture and westernization of the tribe, beginning with Nate Saint's own journal entry in 1955 and continuing through today. However, many continue to <b>view</b> <b>as</b> positive both Operation Auca and the subsequent missionary efforts of Rachel Saint, mission organizations such as Mission Aviation Fellowship, Wycliffe Bible Translators, HCJB World Radio, Avant Ministries (formerly Gospel Missionary Union), and others. Specifically, they note the decline in violence among tribe members, numerous conversions to Christianity, and growth of the local church.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive <b>view,</b> <b>as</b> having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2017, Judah {{announced}} that he would have his first fight in over 3 years on January 21 when he fights journeyman Jorge Luis Munguia (12-7, 4 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round bout at Sun National Bank Center in Trenton, New Jersey. The bout was an Internet-only pay per <b>view.</b> <b>As</b> expected, Judah won the bout via 2nd-round TKO. Judah connected with power shots from the opening bell, landed a left hook to the head of Munguia in round 2 which dropped it on his back. The referee stopped the fight at 1 minute and 27 seconds of the round.|$|E

He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{development}} processes of Ultimate Play the Game, which was known for its avoidance of media spotlight. Its founders, brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, were infamously taciturn both to preserve their time and to let their games speak for themselves. Though as the Sabreman series became popular, their silence contributed to the series' mystique. The main criticism of Underwurlde predecessor and the first game in the Sabreman series, Sabre Wulf, was its similarity to an earlier game by the Stamper brothers, as both were depicted in a top-down <b>view</b> <b>as</b> action-adventure games. While Retro Gamer wrote that the sequel, Underwurlde, resolved this criticism by instead using a side <b>view</b> <b>as</b> a platform game, Ultimate Play the Game also had a reputation for releasing games outside the order in which they were developed. Indeed, the Stamper brothers claimed to have finished their third Sabreman title, the epochal Knight Lore, in advance of both of its predecessors. The Stampers primarily developed for the ZX Spectrum home computer and outsourced the work of converting their games to work on other types of computers to external developers more familiar with the hardware architecture of other platforms. For instance, Firebird created the Commodore 64 releases of Sabre Wulf and Underwurlde. The game released alongside Knight Lore for the ZX Spectrum near the 1984 holiday season, and the Commodore 64 version released a year later.|$|E
5|$|Macedonism (Македонизъм) is the {{political}} ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It {{is also used to}} describe what Bulgarians <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the falsification of their history whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.|$|E

50|$|Bourgueticrinida, the sea lilies, has {{traditionally}} been <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> an order of Articulata and a sister taxon to Comatulida. A study published in 2011 suggested {{that it should be}} renamed Bourgueticrinina and <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a suborder of Comatulida.|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Svolder is {{mentioned}} {{in a number}} of historical sources. The earliest written work is by Adam of Bremen (ca. 1080), who wrote from a Danish point of <b>view</b> <b>as</b> his source was King Svein II of Denmark. The later Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus made use of and expanded Adam of Bremen's account in his Gesta Danorum (ca. 1200).|$|E
5|$|The {{culture and}} monuments of ancient Egypt {{have left a}} lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome. The Romans also {{imported}} building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to <b>view</b> <b>as</b> a place of mystery.|$|E
5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III in a post-apocalyptic United States where various gangs prey on towns in which {{survivors}} {{from the war}} have gathered. The player assumes the role the eponymous female protagonist, Angel, as she defends the towns and searches for her lost friend. The game is played from a bird's eye <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the player controls a car and its mounted machine guns in order to destroy enemies and vehicles. Players can find more powerful guns to attach {{to the car and}} can also use special weapons such as napalm or spike strips which are picked up after killing certain enemies.|$|E

5|$|Two of the 8th century picture stones {{from the}} island of Gotland, Sweden depict eight-legged horses, which are thought by most {{scholars}} to depict Sleipnir: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone. Both stones feature a rider sitting atop an eight-legged horse, which some scholars <b>view</b> <b>as</b> Odin. Above the rider on the Tjängvide image stone is a horizontal figure holding a spear, which may be a valkyrie, and a female figure greets the rider with a cup. The scene has been interpreted as a rider arriving at {{the world of the}} dead. The mid-7th century Eggja stone bearing the Odinic name haras (Old Norse 'army god') may be interpreted as depicting Sleipnir.|$|E
5|$|A star in Stan Kenton's famous {{orchestra}} in the 1940s and 1950s, {{as well as}} that of Woody Herman, also in the 1940s, and {{winner of}} numerous awards, Manne slipped from public <b>view</b> <b>as</b> jazz became less central in popular music. In the 1960s and early 1970s, however, he helped keep jazz alive on the Los Angeles scene as part owner of the nightclub Shelly's Manne-Hole on North Cahuenga Boulevard. There, the house band was Shelly Manne and His Men, which featured some of his favorite sidemen, such as Russ Freeman, Monty Budwig, Richie Kamuca, Conte Candoli, and later Frank Strozier, John Morell, and Mike Wofford, among many other notable West Coast jazz musicians. Also appearing was a roster of jazz stars from different eras and all regions, including Ben Webster, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Les McCann, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Sonny Stitt, Thelonious Monk, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae, Milt Jackson, Teddy Edwards, Monty Alexander, Lenny Breau, Miles Davis, and many, many others. Stan Getz was the last to be featured (at a briefly occupied second location at Tetou's restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard), when, late in 1973, Manne was forced to close the club for financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of <b>view,</b> <b>as</b> he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
