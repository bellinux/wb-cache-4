5|$|In late 2013, the House {{passed a}} forest {{management}} bill co-sponsored by Oregon Representatives Peter DeFazio, Greg Walden, and Kurt Schrader {{that would include}} increased timber harvests on O lands along with resumption of some Secure Rural Schools funding. President Obama has indicated {{he is likely to}} <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> bill.|$|E
5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|In the 1941 {{legislative}} session, Johnson vetoed {{a measure}} allowing {{the sale of}} alcoholic beverages to surrounding states, even those with laws forbidding alcohol sales. The bill was very popular, and was supported {{by many of the}} state's powerful special interests. It had passed the Kentucky House of Representatives by a vote of 84–0 and the Kentucky Senate by a vote of 31–3. After Johnson's <b>veto,</b> <b>the</b> House reversed itself, voting 86–3 to sustain the veto.|$|E

5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe has had its lines of credit at international financial institutions frozen, through US legislation called the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA). Section 4C instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to direct directors at international financial institutions to <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> extension of loans and credit to the Zimbabwean government. According to the United States, these sanctions target only seven specific businesses owned or controlled by government officials and not ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Chrétien {{attempted}} to pursue constitutional recognition of distinct society, but {{was stopped by}} the blunt refusal of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to discuss any constitutional matters. Not wanting to engage the same negotiations with provincial governments that had dominated the Trudeau and Mulroney governments, Chrétien opted to pursue unilateral Federal changes to fulfill his government's commitments. This included the Act respecting constitutional amendments, which required permission from the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia for Federal approval to be granted to any Constitutional amendment, granting Quebec a de facto <b>veto.</b> <b>The</b> Federal parliament also officially recognized Quebec as a distinct society. Both changes, not being constitutional amendments, are theoretically reversible by future parliaments.|$|E
5|$|Caesar held {{both the}} {{dictatorship}} and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, {{gave him the}} power to <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised {{the membership of the}} Senate to 900. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus, the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him.|$|E
25|$|Bush <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> Civil Rights Act of 1990, {{which was}} {{intended}} to help women and minorities prove discrimination in hiring. In <b>vetoing</b> <b>the</b> bill, Bush argued that {{it would lead to}} racial quotas in hiring. Congress failed to override <b>the</b> <b>veto,</b> but re-introduced <b>the</b> bill in 1991. Bush ultimately signed the Civil Rights Act of 1991.|$|R

5|$|On April 29, {{the last}} day of the {{legislative}} session, the Senate bill was revived in the Hawaii House following a motion by Majority Leader Blake Oshiro. Speaker Calvin Say immediately ordered a recess and after the representatives returned four votes to suspend legislative rules postponing the issue were taken and the bill passed with 31 to 20 votes. Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum. The House had ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the legislative session.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1873, President Grant {{signed a}} law that {{authorized}} the President's salary to be increased from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year and Congressmen's salaries to be increased by $2,500. Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill. Reforming newspapers quickly exposed {{the law and the}} bonus was repealed in January 1874. Grant missed an opportunity to <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> bill and to make a strong statement for good government.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the deployment, South African {{authorities}} {{threatened to}} <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> involvement of Australian peacekeeping troops because of doubts about their impartiality. This followed the establishment by the Australian Government of a Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 to assist South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was {{on education and}} training {{for the people of}} South Africa and Namibia, and some humanitarian assistance had also been provided. A total of $11.9million was spent under SAPSAN from 1986 to 1990.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority is jointly {{controlled}} by the governors of New York and New Jersey, who appoint {{the members of the}} agency's Board of Commissioners and retain the right to <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> actions of the Commissioners from his or her own state. Each governor appoints six members to the Board of Commissioners, who are subject to state senate confirmation and serve overlapping six-year terms without pay. An Executive Director is appointed by the Board of Commissioners to deal with day-to-day operations and to execute the Port Authority's policies. Under an informal power-sharing agreement, the Governor of New Jersey chooses {{the chairman of the board}} and the deputy executive director, while the Governor of New York selects the vice-chairman and Executive Director.|$|E
5|$|The Whigs also {{maintained}} {{control of}} the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur. As {{a result of the}} 1850 census, the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell vetoed the redistricting, noting that the districts had been gerrymandered to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the <b>veto.</b> <b>The</b> governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a <b>veto,</b> <b>the</b> Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the Presidential Council are not elected, but {{appointed}} by the President on advice of the Cabinet. No public nomination process or vote is stipulated in the Constitution. The President, {{if he does not}} concur with the Cabinet, may <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> appointment. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), a constitutional body that advises the President on appointments of key public officials and matters relating to Singapore's financial reserves. If he exercises his veto without the CPA's concurrence, Parliament may overrule his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current members.|$|E
5|$|To {{become law}} or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E

As he promised, President Bush <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> legislation on 8 March. His <b>veto</b> applied to <b>the</b> authorization for the entire intelligence budget for the 2008 fiscal year, but he cited the waterboarding ban {{as the reason for}} <b>the</b> <b>veto.</b> Supporters of <b>the</b> bill supporters lacked enough votes to overturn <b>the</b> <b>veto.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional <b>veto.</b> <b>The</b> Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|As the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that <b>veto.</b> <b>The</b> Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, and also a variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E
5|$|By 1815 Jennings and the {{territorial}} legislature {{were ready to}} embark on a course for statehood. In December 1815 Jennings's introduced a petition from {{the territorial}} legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. The territorial governor, Thomas Posey, expressed concern that the territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government. In a letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> bill and delay statehood for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey's plea.|$|E
