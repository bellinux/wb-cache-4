50|$|Superheated steam {{was widely}} used in main line steam locomotives. Saturated steam has three main {{disadvantages}} in a steam engine: it contains small droplets of water which have to be periodically drained from the cylinders; being precisely at the boiling point of water for the boiler pressure in use, it inevitably condenses to some extent in the steam pipes and cylinders outside the boiler, causing a disproportionate loss of steam volume as it does so; and it places a heavy demand on the boiler because {{a large amount of}} water has to be evaporated per unit <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is a novel}} idea to make steamed bread {{by adding}} potato flour into wheat flour {{considering}} the production and nutritional factors of potato. In this study, the influence of potato flour (0 – 35 %) on dough rheology and quality <b>of</b> <b>steamed</b> bread were investigated. Potato flour addition significantly influenced the dough rheological properties and steamed bread quality, such as increased water absorption, the maximum gaseous release height, total <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 and hardness, while decreased dough stability and specific <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steamed</b> bread. Moreover, correlation analysis suggested that dough height at the maximum development time, dough stability, water absorption and the phase tangent {{can be used for}} predicting the technological quality <b>of</b> <b>steamed</b> bread. Potato-wheat steamed bread had higher dietary fibre, ash content and antioxidant activity than those <b>of</b> wheat <b>steamed</b> bread. The estimated glycemic index decreased from 73. 63 (0 %) to 60. 01 (35 %). Considering the sensory evaluation, the steamed bread with 20 % potato flour is acceptable. In conclusion, adding appropriate quantity of potato flour to wheat flour for steamed bread production will not only maintain the technological quality, but also can improve the nutritional value <b>of</b> the <b>steamed</b> bread...|$|R

The properties of water itself are studied, including its expansion while freezing (iron vessels are burst by this expansion), and the relative <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> produced when water is vaporized.

50|$|Modern {{locomotives}} {{are also}} {{fitted with a}} blower, which is a device that releases steam directly into the smokebox for use when a greater draught is needed without a greater <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> passing through the cylinders. An example of such situation is when the regulator is closed suddenly, or the train passes through a tunnel. If a single line tunnel is poorly ventilated, a locomotive entering at high speed can cause a rapid compression of the air within the tunnel. This compressed air may enter the chimney with substantial force. This can be extremely dangerous if the firebox door is open at the time. For this reason the blower is often turned on in these situations, to counteract the compression effect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{eruption}} occurred beneath glacial ice. The {{cold water}} from the melting ice chilled the lava quickly, causing it to fragment into very small particles of glass (silica) and ash, which were carried into the eruption plume. The extremely fine ash particles and the large <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> from the glacial [...] sent an ash plume hazardous to aircraft rapidly high into the upper atmosphere. The presence and location of the plume depended upon {{the state of the}} eruption and the winds. The large amount of glacial meltwater flowing into the eruption vent made this eruption so explosive that it injected its ash plume directly into the jet stream, which was unusually stable and south-easterly. The ash was then carried over Europe into one of the busiest airspace in the world.|$|E

25|$|HTP is {{normally}} stable until {{it comes in}} contact with a catalyst. It then expands 5,000 times in volume extremely rapidly, acting as an oxidiser, generating large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> and oxygen. The oxygen is combined with kerosene fuel in the torpedo engine to propel the missile {{at a very high}} speed and greater range than conventional torpedoes. Investigators concluded that the leaking HTP had catalytically decomposed when it came in contact with copper commonly found in the bronze and brass used to manufacture Kursks torpedo tubes. The resulting overpressure ruptured the torpedo's kerosene fuel tank and caused an explosion that was registered as a weak seismic event on detectors hundreds of kilometres away. Once the HTP begins oxidizing, it is impossible to stop until the fuel is exhausted.|$|R

And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing.

He was, for example, engaged on {{projects}} {{to improve the}} water supply to Windsor Castle, during which time he patented (c. 1675) a 'plunger pump' capable of [...] "raising great quantities of water with far less proportion of strength than can be performed by a Chain or other Pump." [...] He also experimented with using gunpowder to make a vacuum that would suck in water (in effect the first internal combustion engine) and worked on ideas for a steam engine. Morland's pumps were developed for numerous domestic, marine and industrial applications, such as wells, draining ponds or mines, and fire fighting. His calculation of the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> (approximately two thousand times that of water) was not improved upon until the later part of the next century, and was of importance for the future development of a working steam engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{method to}} lessen the {{magnitude}} of energy loss to a very long cylinder was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less cylinder wall is exposed, per unit <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> in each cylinder, less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing {{the efficiency of the}} engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, variations of torque can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure cylinder requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders, resulting in larger cylinders.|$|E

The real and effective beginning of the company was in 1907, when the partners decided to capitalise {{on the need for}} local engineers to make temporary or permanent repairs to the increasing number of 'pullcars' and private motor vehicles on the road. By 1912, the organisation had moved to premises in Kendal Street and the number of employees had grown to twenty. In the same year a second, smaller repair centre was opened in Freemason's Row, Liverpool, to cater for the enormous <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> traffic using the docks. Very soon the company made something of a name for itself in the north of England as quality repairers, and the growing number of operators brought new business from far and wide.|$|E

40|$|Steam {{injection}} {{with added}} surface active chemicals {{is one of}} general EOR processes aimed to recover residual oil after primary production processes. It has been demonstrated that, after waterflooding, an oil swept area can be increased by steam surfactant flow due to the reduced steam override effect as well as reduced interfacial tension between oil and water in the formation. To investigate the ability to improve recovery of 20. 5 oAPI California heavy oil with steam surfactant injection, several experiments with a one-dimensional model were performed. Two experimental models with similar porous media, fluids, chemicals, as well as injection and production conditions, were applied. The first series of experiments were carried out in a vertical cylindrical injection cell with dimensions of 7. 4 cm x 67 cm. The second part of experiment was conducted using a horizontal tube model with dimensions of 3. 5 cm x 110. 5 cm. The horizontal model with a smaller diameter than the vertical injection cell is less subject to channel formation and is therefore more applicable for the laboratory scale modeling <b>of</b> the one-dimensional <b>steam</b> injection process. Nonionic surfactant Triton X- 100 was coinjected into the steam flow. For both series of experimental work with vertical and horizontal injection cells, the concentration of Triton X- 100 surfactant solution used was chosen 3. 0 wt%. The injection rates were set to inject the same 0. 8 pore <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> for the vertical model and 1. 8 pore <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> for horizontal model. The steam was injected at superheated conditions of 200 oC and pressure of 100 psig. The liquid produced from the separator was sampled periodically and treated to determine oilcut and produced oil properties. The interfacial tension (IFT) of the produced oil and water were measured with an IFT meter and compared to that for the original oil. The experimental study demonstrated that the average incremental oil recovery with steam surfactant flood is 7 % of the original oil-in-place above that with pure steam injection...|$|R

It was plain that one or two were mad with fear and excitement; and as the ruling passion is strong in death, so it would seem to be by no means weak in the midst of danger from fire; for many of them bent their whole energies to the saving of their goods and chattels--regardless of their lives.|$|R
50|$|The steam blast {{is largely}} self-regulating: an {{increase}} in the rate of steam consumption by the cylinders increases the blast, which increases the draught and hence the temperature of the fire. Modern locomotives are also fitted with a blower, which is a device that releases steam directly into the smokebox for use when a greater draught is needed without a greater <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> passing through the cylinders. An example of such situation is when the regulator is closed suddenly, or the train passes through a tunnel.

5000|$|The steam {{generator}} or boiler {{is an integral}} component of a steam engine when considered as a prime mover. However it needs be treated separately, as to some extent a variety of generator types can be combined {{with a variety of}} engine units. A boiler incorporates a firebox or furnace in order to burn the fuel and generate heat. The generated heat is transferred to water to make steam, the process of boiling. This produces saturated steam at a rate which can vary according to the pressure above the boiling water. The higher the furnace temperature, the faster the steam production. The saturated steam thus produced can then either be used immediately to produce power via a turbine and alternator, or else may be further superheated to a higher temperature; this notably reduces suspended water content making a given <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> produce more work and creates a greater temperature gradient, which helps reduce the potential to form condensation. Any remaining heat in the combustion gases can then either be evacuated or made to pass through an economiser, the role of which is to warm the feed water before it reaches the boiler.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superheater}} {{works like}} coils on an air conditioning unit, however {{to a different}} end. The steam piping (with steam flowing through it) is directed through the flue gas path in the boiler furnace. This area typically is between 1300 - 1600 C. Some superheaters are radiant type (absorb heat by thermal radiation), others are convection type (absorb heat via a fluid i.e. gas) and some are {{a combination of the}} two. So whether by convection or radiation the extreme heat in the boiler furnace/flue gas path will also heat the superheater steam piping and the steam within as well. While the temperature of the steam in the superheater is raised, the pressure of the steam is not: the turbine or moving pistons offer a [...] "continuously expanding space" [...] and the pressure remains {{the same as that of}} the boiler. The process of superheating steam is most importantly designed to remove all droplets entrained in the steam to prevent damage to the turbine blading and/or associated piping. Superheating the steam expands the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> which allows a given quantity (by weight) of steam to generate more power.|$|E
