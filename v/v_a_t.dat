Denote by MC t (r) the number of pairs, of monochromatic beads which are within distance t apart, in the rosary r. What is the minimum value of MC t (Δ), when the minimum is taken over all n-bead rosaries which consists of m white beads and n Γ m black beads? We prove a (reasonably) tight lower bound for this combinatorial problem. Surprisingly, when m = n= 2, the answer is (p 2 Γ 1) Δ nt, rather than nt= 2 that one might have expected. 1.

40|$|Introduction: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (C. F.) is {{the most}} prevalent hereditary life-limiting disorder in the United Kingdom (Cystic Fibrosis Trust, 2008). Contemporary social policy states that, whenever possible, young people are best cared for at home(Department of Health, 2003; Department of Health, 2004 c). Parents are being taught to perform many complex tasks that would only have been undertaken by healthcare professionals, in the hospital setting, in the past. Since the introduction of home intravenous antibiotic therapy, by parents (H. I. <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.)</b> the prevalence of parents administering it has greatly increased. Aims: To undertake a critical review into the administration of H. I. <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> for children who have C. F. All stakeholders will also be identified. The advantages and disadvantages will be explored to investigate who benefits. Methodology: A critical review was undertaken using the ‘Stages of the reviewing process’ framework (Hek et. al., 2000; Figure 1) and a search strategy containing the keywords ‘home’ ‘intravenous’ and ‘cystic fibrosis’. Literature was evaluated using critical appraisal frameworks (Public Health Resource Unit, 2008 a; Langton, 1999). Results: Of 109 articles found, 90 potentially relevant studies were accessible. Of these 90, 23 remained once the inclusion/exclusion criteria was applied. These articles were then supplemented with exploration of social policy and relevant grey literature. Thematic analysis highlighted {{the risks and benefits}} of H. I. <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> from the perspectives of numerous stakeholder groups. Conclusion: It was discovered that in the short-term, H. I. <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> can be beneficial to all stakeholders if implemented effectively, although hospitalisation remains favourable for some service users. ‘The conical model’ was constructed depicting the stakeholders and considerations which must be made before responsibility for administering H. I. <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> is given to parents. Recommendations: The conical model should be implemented by healthcare professionals, when a family is considering H. I. <b>V.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> as an aid-memoir to take into account individual family circumstances, prior to commencing each course of therapy. It is also vital that rigorous, long-term and multi-centred research is undertaken including exploration of the effect it has on all stakeholders...|$|E

40|$|Value Added Tax {{is one of}} {{the major}} type of tax {{currently}} practiced in Sri Lanka. This study focuses on the determinants of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and its future forecasts, which could be used as a guidance of monetary policy decisions. The data used for the study are the VAT data obtained from the Department of Inland Revenue and CCPI data obtained from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for the period of January 2004 to December 2010. It includes monthly data point in each index. VAT is a tax on domestic consumption of goods and services. The goods imported into Sri Lanka and goods and services supplied within the territorial limits of Sri Lanka are the subject matter of this tax. It is a multi stage tax levied on the incremental value at every stage in the production and distribution chain of goods and services. The tax is borne by the final or the ultimate consumer of goods or services. Therefore, VAT revenue directly affects the price of the goods and services. Inflation is simply the percentage change of CCPI which is the official price index in the country. It measures the changes through time in the price level of consumer goods and services purchased by households in Sri Lanka. This study is significant, because there is no previous analysis about VAT with CCPI in Sri Lanka. Value added Tax {{is one of the}} major type of tax currently used to collect taxes in Sri Lanka. <b>V</b> <b>A</b> <b>T</b> is a general consumption tax assessed on the value added to goods and services. Therefore, it is very important to study about effect of goods and services prices to VAT revenue. Inflation is simply the percentage change of CCPI. Thus the intention is to the existing forecasting method change of VAT revenue in Sri Lanka by using CCPI. Forecasting was performed using the time series techniques and Econometrics approaches. This study is to find the relationship between VAT and CCPI and fit a suitable model to forecast monthly <b>V</b> <b>A</b> <b>T</b> Revenue in Sri Lanka, which would be used as a guidance of monetary policy decisions. Time series analysis was used to analysis the VAT data. CCPI data and econometrics modeling approach considers the impact of CCPI factor in forecasting VAT for the future. Then Ganger Causality test were applied to find the direction of causality between <b>V</b> <b>A</b> <b>T</b> and CCPI. Causality between VAT to CCPI. Further co-integration test was used to identify linear combination of the integrated series and best define the long run equilibrium relationships between the variables. Since both VAT and CCPI series are non stationary order one, Therefore, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) was formulated, and it was proved that the changes of price level of CCPI were strongly affected by the VAT. Therefore, in order to assess the significant interrelationship VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) is used to forecast <b>V</b> <b>A</b> <b>T</b> less than 5 % Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). It was found through this study that the CCPI is an influential factor on <b>V</b> <b>A</b> <b>T</b> revenue in Sri Lanka.

Methods: Fifty-eight patients being operated with a miniaturized circuit (minimal extracorporeal circuit, MECC) were prospectively randomized to using a so-called Smart suction device or a routine continuous autotransfusion system (C. <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> S. ®) for collection of mediastinal shed blood. The coagulation response was measured by thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and D-dimer. The inflammatory response was measured by Interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and complement factor 3 a (C 3 a) at three different time points, before surgery, 2 h after surgery, as well as 18 h after surgery. Results: No serious adverse cardiovascular event was observed. Serum levels of TAT significantly differed between both groups 2 h after surgery (Smart suction 16. 12 ± 13. 51 μgl− 1 <b>vs</b> C. <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> S® 9. 83 ± 7. 81 μgl− 1, p= 0. 040) and returned to baseline values after 18 h in both groups.
