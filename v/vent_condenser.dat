Should this vent valve not be opened sufficiently the deaerator will not work properly, causing high oxygen content in the feed water going to the boilers. Should the boiler not have an oxygen-content analyser, a high level in the boiler chlorides may indicate the vent valve not being far enough open.

5000|$|... ==Deaeration of feed water== Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide {{are removed}} from the feed water by deaeration. Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The non-condensables and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact <b>vent</b> <b>condenser,</b> tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and non-condensables are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and non-condensables. The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and non-condensables are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|E

40|$|Testing was {{completed}} {{to demonstrate the}} viability of the newly developed glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet on processing in the Defense Waste Processing Facility's (DWPF) Chemical Process Cell (CPC). The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) initiated a sludge matrix study to evaluate the impact of changing insoluble solid composition on the processing characteristics of slurries in DWPF. Four sludge simulants were prepared to cover two compositional ranges in the waste. The first was high iron/low aluminum versus low iron/high aluminum (referred to as HiFe or LoFe in this report). The second was high calcium-manganese/low nickel, chromium, and magnesium versus low calcium-manganese/high nickel, chromium, and magnesium (referred to as HiMn or LoMn in this report). These two options can be combined to form four distinct sludge compositions. The sludge matrix study called for testing each of these four simulants near the minimum acid required for nitrite destruction (100 % acid stoichiometry) and at a second acid level that produced significant hydrogen by noble metal catalyzed decomposition of formic acid (150 % acid stoichiometry). Four simulants were prepared based on the four possible combinations of the Al/Fe and Mn-Ca/Mg-Ni-Cr options. Preliminary simulant preparation work has already been documented. The four simulants were used for high and low acid testing. Eight planned experiments (GF 26 to GF 33) were completed to demonstrate {{the viability of the}} glycolic-formic flowsheet. Composition and physical property measurements were made on the SRAT product. Composition measurements were made on the condensate from the Mercury Water Wash Tank (MWWT), Formic Acid <b>Vent</b> <b>Condenser</b> (FAVC), ammonia scrubber and on SRAT samples pulled throughout the SRAT cycle. Updated values for formate loss and nitrite-tonitrate conversion were found {{that can be used in}} the acid calculations for future sludge matrix process simulations with the glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet. Preliminary results of the initial testing indicate: (1) Hydrogen generation rate was very low throughout all SRAT cycles. (2) The mercury concentration of the SRAT product was below the 0. 8 wt% limit in all runs. (3) Nitrite in the SRAT product was < 100 mg/kg for all runs. (4) Foaminess was not an issue using the nominal antifoam addition strategy in these tests. (5) The high aluminum sludges (LoFe, HM type sludges) were much more viscous than the Hi Fe sludges. At 100 % acid stoichiometry, the SRAT products from the high aluminum sludges were very viscous but at 150 % acid stoichiometry, the SRAT products from the high aluminum sludges were very thin. This makes the glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet an improvement for processing more viscous sludges. (6) The pH of the SRAT products was from 2. 7 - 3. 1 for the 150 % acid stoichiometry runs and 5. 1 - 6. 1 for the 100 % acid stoichiometry runs, significantly lower than is typical of the baseline nitric acid/formic acid flowsheet...|$|E
40|$|New single-family home {{construction}} {{represents a}} significant and important market for the introduction of energy-efficient gas-fired space heating and water-heating equipment. In the new construction market, the choice of furnace and water-heater type is primarily driven by first cost considerations {{and the availability of}} power <b>vent</b> and <b>condensing</b> water heaters. Few analysis have been performed to assess the economic impacts of the different combinations of space and water-heating equipment. Thus, equipment is often installed without taking into consideration the potential economic and energy savings of installing space and water-heating equipment combinations. In this study, we use a life-cycle cost analysis that accounts for uncertainty and variability of the analysis inputs to assess the economic benefits of gas furnace and water-heater design combinations. This study accounts not only for the equipment cost but also for the cost of installing, maintaining, repairing, and operating the equipment over its lifetime. Overall, this study, which is focused on US single-family new construction households that install gas furnaces and storage water heaters, finds that installing a condensing or power-vent water heater together with condensing furnace is the most cost-effective option for the majority of these houses. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the new construction residential market could be a target market for the large-scale introduction of a combination of condensing or power-vent water heaters with condensing furnaces...|$|R
40|$|A {{heat pump}} clothes dryer (HPCD) is an {{innovative}} appliance {{that uses a}} vapor compression system to dry clothes. Air circulates in a closed cycle through the drum, so no <b>vent</b> is required. <b>Condenser</b> heat evaporates moisture out of the clothes, and the evaporator condenses {{the water out of}} the air stream. As a result, the HPCD can achieve 50 % energy savings compared to a conventional electric resistance dryer. We developed a fundamentals-based, quasi-steady-state HPCD system model with detailed heat exchanger and compressor models. In a novel approach, we applied a heat and mass transfer effectiveness model to simulate the drying process of the clothes load. The system model is able to simulate the inherently transient HPCD drying process, to size components, and to reveal trends in key variables (e. g. compressor discharge temperature, cloth drying rate, etc.) The system model was calibrated using experimental data on a prototype HPCD. In the paper, the modeling method is introduced, and parametric studies show the influences of design parameters (compressor size, air flow circulation rate, and leakages) on system performance (including energy factor and drying time). ...|$|R
40|$|After strontium/transuranics removal by {{precipitation}} {{followed by}} cesium/technetium removal by ion exchange, remaining low activity {{waste in the}} Hanford River Protection Project Waste Treatment Plant is to be concentrated by evaporation prior to being mixed with glass formers and vitrified. To provide a technical basis to permit the waste treatment facility, a relatively organic-rich Hanford Tank 241 -AN- 107 waste simulant was spiked with 14 target volatile, semi-volatile and pesticide compounds, and evaporated under vacuum in a bench-scale natural circulation evaporator fitted with an industrial stack off-gas sampler at the Savannah River Technology Center. An evaporator material balance for the target organics was calculated by combining liquid stream mass and analytical data with off-gas emissions estimates obtained using EPA SW- 846 Methods. Volatile and light semi-volatile organic compounds in the waste simulant were found to largely exit through the <b>condenser</b> <b>vent,</b> while heavier semi-volatiles and pesticides generally remain in the evaporator concentrate. An OLI Environmental Simulation Program evaporator model successfully predicted operating conditions and the experimental distribution of the fed target organics exiting in the concentrate, condensate and off-gas streams {{with the exception of}} a few semi-volatile and pesticide compounds.

40|$|The {{south end}} cap {{calorimeter}} (ECS) {{will need to}} be moved off of the detector platform to allow for the installation of new central tracking components. This engineering note documents the cryogenic and safety issues associated with the planned move. Because of the difficulty involved in building a temporary vent line out of the building, we plan to <b>vent</b> the ECS <b>condenser</b> flow, 6 scfm N 2 into the assembly hall atmosphere. Information contained herein proves that this is safe even for failure/relief conditions. The details regarding the cryogenic and safety aspects of the ECS move have been thought out and planned. The cryogenic operation of the ECS calorimeter will be limited to maintaining it's pressure by keeping it cold and isolated while it is in it's temporary position off the platform. The 4 gph liquid nitrogen flow required for this operation is easily absorbed into the DZero assembly building atmosphere without any safety concerns. Emergency or failure scenarios have been addressed on a conservative basis and also pose little threat. Other safety features built into the system such as the liquid nitrogen excess flow switch, vent line liquid sensor, and monitored ODH heads provide additional assurance that an unexpected hazard would be identified and contained...|$|R

40|$|The US {{department}} of Energy identified 21 design options for increasing furnace and boiler efficiency in its advance notice of Proposed Rulemaking for NAECA minimum efficiency standards. These design options {{may or may}} not improve efficiency. If they do, an economic assessment is made. The energy impacts of some these options on the performace of base case furnace and boiler appliances were evaluated using data available in the general literature, experimental investigations, and a new, validated GRI computer model that simulates the operation of furnaces under specified operating conditions such as the DOE AFUE test procedure, including the steady-state test, the heat-up test, and the cool-down test. When appropriate, appliances currently available on the market that employ {{one or more of the}} design options were evaluated. Furnaces and boilers having current NAECA minimum efficiencies and input ratings of 75, 000 Btu per hour were selected for analysis based on future trends in house heating loads over the time frame of the proposed minimum efficiency rule. For the average US furnace or boiler consumer, appliances having current NAECA minimum efficiencies have the lowest life cycle costs based on rated performance data and survey cost data collected between 1992 and 1994. Estimate of the efficiency-increasing benefits of the DOE specified design options indicate that a one- or two-percentage point improvement in AFUE may be economically justified under ideal installation conditions. Larger increases will result in either more expensive <b>vent</b> systems or <b>condensing</b> appliances, both of which have higher life-cycle costs that the current NAECA minimum efficiency appliance for the average US consumer...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the heat}} that is {{reaching}} the surface from the interior of Enceladus, we ask whether liquid water is likely and at what depth it might occur. The heat may be carried by thermal conduction through the solid ice, by the vapor as it diffuses through a porous matrix, or by the vapor flowing upward through open cracks. The vapor carries latent heat, which it acquires when ice or liquid evaporates. As the vapor nears the surface it may condense onto the cold ice, or it may exit the <b>vent</b> without <b>condensing,</b> carrying its latent heat with it. The ice at the surface loses its heat by infrared radiation. An important physical principle, which has been overlooked so far, is that the partial pressure of the vapor in the pores and in the open cracks is nearly equal to the saturation vapor pressure of the ice around it. This severely limits the ability of ice to deliver the observed heat to the surface without melting at depth. Another principle is that viscosity limits {{the speed of the}} flow, both the diffusive flow in the matrix and the hydrodynamic flow in open cracks. We present hydrodynamic models that take these effects into account. We find that there is no simple {{answer to the question of}} whether the ice melts or not. Vapor diffusion in a porous matrix can deliver the heat to the surface without melting if the particle size is greater than ~ 1 cm and the porosity is greater than ~ 0. 1, in other words, if the matrix is a rubble pile. Whether such an open matrix can exist under its own hydrostatic load is unclear. Flow in open cracks can deliver the heat without melting if the width of the crack is greater than ~ 10 cm, but the heat source must be in contact with the crack. Frictional heating on the walls due to tidal stresses is one such possibility. The lifetime of the crack is a puzzle, since condensation on the walls in the upper few meters could seal the crack off in a year, and it takes many years for the heat source to warm the walls if the crack extends down to km depths. The 10 : 1 ratio of radiated heat to latent heat carried with the vapor is another puzzle. The models tend to give a lower ratio. The resolution might be that each tiger stripe has multiple cracks that share the heat, which tends to lower the ratio. The main conclusion is that melting depends on the size of the pores and the width of the cracks, and these are unknown at present...|$|R
40|$|Since {{early the}} early 20 th century the {{electrical}} tumble dryer became an appliance to dry clothes. During {{many years of}} improvements different configurations to solve issues on decreased drying time and more energy efficient solutions has been performed. Several different configurations have been developed; air <b>vented</b> dryers, <b>condensing</b> dryers {{and the most recent}} heat pump dryers. The heat pumps in drying technology became the next solution based on improved drying time and decreased energy consumption. With today’s focus on energy consumption, with energy demanding appliance such as the clothes dryer; new technology that satisfy the customers need must be available. By introducing the heat pump to the drying technology, a suitable refrigerant must be chosen. The choice should be based on several factors; the performance of the heat pump and the refrigerants GWP and ODP values, its toxicity and safety for the consumer. This report is based on a heat pump dryer made for an R 134 a system. R 134 a has a global warming potential (GWP) 1300 times the value of R 744 (carbon dioxide). This report will present the feasibility of replacing the R 134 a system with a system designed for carbon dioxide as refrigerant. Carbon dioxide or R 744 is a natural refrigerant, and it is in contrast to other commonly used refrigerants operating in the transcritical region. This implies that the heat rejection is performed with gliding temperature exchange, not by condensation as for the R 134 a. This is due to the low critical temperature of carbon dioxide; a critical pressure of 73. 8 Bara and a critical temperature of 31. 1 &# 730;C. Despite the required high pressures, the heat exchange properties of carbon dioxide in the critical region are very good, and new technology can take advantage of this. By SINTEF developed simulation tool HX SIM Basic 2007, based on results from the R 134 a cycle, heat exchangers have been designed to reach the optimal solution. The capacity of the heat changers and the compressor will be the same as the R 134 a system. The system is built with a manual throttling valve in parallel to a capillary tube, during the experiments the system will be tested to find the most optimal set point. Evaporating pressures from 40 to 50 Bara and gas cooler pressures from critical pressures to 120 Bara have been applied in the experiments. The main purpose of the experiments is to find a system design that will fulfil both energy saving requirements and have a simple enough construction for it to be a market product. Based on the experiments on this first prototype and the results obtained; a conclusion is that the dryer with CO 2 as refrigerant is using marginally more energy than the R 134 a system. However this is a first prototype and its potential should be investigated further. </p...|$|R
