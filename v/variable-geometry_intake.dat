25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>intake</b> and exhaust systems, and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E

A transmission control unit re-calibration on models with automatic transmissions reduces the hunting of gears and improves gear changes {{in an attempt to}} mask the dip in the torque curve in the lower and middle rev ranges. In the following year, the Persona came equipped with a new <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>intake</b> manifold module (Campro IAFM engine) which improves low-end torque and high-rev breathing.|$|E

25|$|The Avro 730 was a {{very high}} speed aircraft, {{originally}} designed solely for aerial reconnaissance purposes. In order to achieve the desired high speed performance, the aircraft consisted of a long, slender fuselage with a high fineness ratio; a small tapered almost-rectangular wing was mounted centrally on the fuselage. The characteristics of the wing, being relatively short and straight, enabled the lengthy aerial for the primary reconnaissance sensor, the Red Drover X-band radar, to be contained within the fuselage, as the wing provided little obstruction and therefore interference with the radar. A total of four Armstrong-Siddeley P.156 engines, two each being mounted in an over-under arrangement in pods positioned at the extreme tips of the wings, provided propulsion. The engine nacelles included <b>variable-geometry</b> air <b>intakes,</b> while the engines themselves were equipped with convergent-divergent nozzles. Alternative arrangements {{of two or three}} shock cones could have been installed on the nacelles.|$|R
500|$|The YF-105A {{prototype}} first flew on 22 October 1955, {{with the}} second YF-105A following on 28 January 1956. In spite of being powered by a less potent J57-P-25 engine with [...] of afterburning thrust, the first prototype attained the speed of Mach 1.2 on its maiden flight. [...] (The J75 was expected to generate [...] with afterburner.) [...] Both aircraft featured conventional wing root air intakes and slab-sided fuselages typical of the early jets; Republic viewed the prototypes as not being representative of the true capability of the aircraft due to numerous changes prior to production. Insufficient power and aerodynamic problems with transonic drag, as well as Convair's experience with their F-102, led to a redesign of the fuselage {{to conform to the}} Area rule, giving it a characteristic [...] "wasp waist". In combination with the distinctive forward-swept <b>variable-geometry</b> air <b>intakes</b> which regulated airflow to the engine at supersonic speeds and the J75 engine, this redesign enabled the F-105B to attain Mach 2.15.|$|R
25|$|F-106A : (Convair Model 8-24) Improved {{version of}} the F-102. Fitted with the MA-1 Integrated Fire Control System with SAGE datalink, J-75 {{afterburning}} turbojet, enlarged <b>intake,</b> <b>variable-geometry</b> inlet ramps and shortened intake ducts, refined fuselage shape, modified wings and redesigned tailfin; tailpipe fitted with a device to reduce the tendency of the jet exhaust to blow unsecured objects around while taxiing, yet allowing virtually maximum performance at high thrust settings including afterburner. Performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made. The aircraft was capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner (but with a significant range penalty) and had a maximum altitude at least 57,000ft. Many were fitted with a conically-cambered wing for improved takeoff, supersonic and high-altitude flight. To improve the aircraft's range the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined external supersonic tanks that still kept the aircraft capable of sustained roll rates of 100 degrees per second. Since these tanks produced virtually no significant performance degradation they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around. After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights and provision for a gunpack in the center weapons bay.|$|R
