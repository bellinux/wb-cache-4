40|$|The {{sliding window}} model {{is useful for}} {{discounting}} stale data in data stream applications. In this model, data elements arrive continually and only the most recent N elements are used when answering queries. We present a novel technique for solving two important and related problems in the sliding window model — maintaining variance and maintaining a k– median clustering. Our {{solution to the problem}} <b>of</b> maintaining <b>variance</b> provides a continually updated estimate <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> the last <b>N</b> <b>values</b> in a data stream with relative error of at most ɛ using O (1 ɛ 2 log N) memory. We present a constant-factor approximation algorithm which maintains an approximate k–median solution for the last N data points using O (k τ 4 N 2 τ log 2 N) memory, where τ < 1 / 2 is a parameter which trades off the space bound with the approximation factor of O(2 O(1 /τ)). 1...|$|R

40|$|The <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> the North Atlantic Oscillation index (denoted N) {{is shown}} to depend on its {{coupling}} with area-averaged sea ice concentration anomalies {{in and around the}} Barents Sea (index denoted B). The observed form of this coupling is a negative feedback whereby positive N tends to produce negative B, which in turn forces negative <b>N.</b> The effects <b>of</b> this feedback in the system are examined by modifying the feedback in two modeling frameworks: a statistical vector autoregressive model (F VAR) and an atmospheric global climate model (F CAM) customized so that sea ice anomalies on the lower boundary are stochastic with adjustable sensitivity to the model's evolving N. Experiments show that the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> <b>N</b> decreases nearly linearly with the sensitivity <b>of</b> B to <b>N,</b> where the sensitivity {{is a measure of the}} negative feedback strength. Given that the sea ice concentration field has anomalies, the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> <b>N</b> goes down as these anomalies become more sensitive to N. If the sea ice concentration anomalies are entirely absent, the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> <b>N</b> is even smaller than the experiment with the most sensitive anomalies. Quantifying how the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> <b>N</b> depends on the presence and sensitivity of sea ice anomalies to N has implications for the simulation <b>of</b> <b>N</b> in global climate models. In the physical system, projected changes in sea ice thickness or extent could alter the sensitivity <b>of</b> B to <b>N,</b> impacting the within-season variability and hence predictability <b>of</b> <b>N.</b> © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R

40|$|Peak latency {{variation}} and the temporal interrelationships of the auditory event-related potential were investigated in 12 normal adults (ages 28 - 42). Measures of variation {{were based on}} both conventional averages and single trials. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>N</b> 1, P 2, N 2 and P 3 latencies were made on a trial-by-trial basis to target stimuli recorded from Fz, Cz and Pz scalp locations. Results showed that single-trial latency variability of the auditory ERP differed both among the various components and between subjects. Larger standard deviations were measured for the later N 2 and P 3 components than the earlier N 1 and P 2 components. Regression analyses between various component latencies indicated a strong covarying relationship between N 2 and P 3, with N 2 accounting for up to 61 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> P 3 latency at Pz. Earlier N 1 and P 2 components added little to the overall prediction of either P 3 or N 2. For the other components, P 2 accounted for 9 - 16 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> <b>N</b> 2, while N 1 accounted for approximately 1 % <b>of</b> the <b>variance</b> <b>of</b> <b>N</b> 2; N 1 accounted for 8 - 10 % of the latency variation of P 2. The correlations between single-trial peak latencies and RTs were positive but of low magnitude. The highest correlations between peak latency and RT were found for N 2 (r = 0. 33) and P 3 (r = 0. 24). The low correlations between the single-trial latencies <b>of</b> <b>N</b> 1 and P 3 suggest that the processes reflected by these components are independent and support {{a distinction between the}} earlier and the later components of the ERP.
