40|$|In this study, plastic {{containers}} made of polypropylene (PP) sheets were fabricated via <b>vacuum</b> <b>thermoforming.</b> Thermoforming {{is a process}} used in fabricating plastic parts by changing flat thermoplastic sheet to three dimensional shapes. In preparing these thermo{{plastic containers}}, the design and fabrication of mould were first done by using Catia V 5 software and CNC milling machine, respectively. The thermoforming process was then performed at various temperatures ranging from 160 °C until 200 °C on the PP sheet to form the container. From the experiment, it can be suggested that the outcomes of final thermoplastic containers are significantly depends on temperature control during thermoforming process and also the vent holes design of the mould...|$|E

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of biodegradable and renewable containers from bitter vetch seed protein-based “bioplastics” was investigated. A bitter vetch seed protein concentrate was prepared and analyzed for proteins, carbohydrates, phenols, other several organic compounds and multi-elements. Protein film forming solutions were {{cast in the}} presence of two different glycerol concentrations and the film con- taining higher plasticizer amount was laminated with an additional corn zein layer. Both lamination process and lower glycerol concentration led to reduce film moisture content, total soluble matter and elongation at break, while both film tensile strength and water vapour barrier properties resulted enhanced. The obtained bioplastics were then processed by a new laboratory plastic moulding equip- ment specifically designed and fabricated to convert protein-based films to shaped containers. The use of either lower plasticizer concentration or corn zein lamination gave rise to potentially satisfactory <b>vacuum</b> <b>thermoformed</b> containers with acceptable resistance and stability...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} in hot-melt impregnation, extrusion, and thermoforming offer multiple avenues {{for the design}} and manufacture of low-cost thermoplastic composites for mass transit and automotive applications. Fiber reinforced thermoplastics such as glass/polypropylene (glass/PP) have found their applications in front-end bumper beams, under body shields, and other automotive applications. These materials also have potential usage in mass transit vehicles, such as buses. The present study focuses on the design and manufacture of {{a segment of the}} floor of a mass transit bus using glass/PP woven tape forms developed through a hot-melt impregnation process. An initial study on the existing mass transit buses found that a metal skeletal frame and plywood panels are used {{in the construction of the}} floor structure. The representative thermoplastic composite floor segment featured a glass/PP woven tape material, belt-pressed to form a flat laminate, and adhesively bonded to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>thermoformed</b> ribbed laminate. A combination of analysis software including Pro/Engineer, HyperMesh, and ANSYS 7. 0 were used for the design and analysis. Weight savings up to 40 % were realized using glass/P...|$|R
40|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>thermoforming</b> machine {{works by}} heating a clamped polymer sheet and then {{engaging}} the tooling {{to form the}} desired shape when the plastic is at the proper temperature. The current <b>vacuum</b> <b>thermoforming</b> machine in the Trine University Plastics Lab possesses a single top‐side heater. With the current setup, thicker materials will be scorched on the material’s top side and while the bottom side is not heated enough. In order for thicker materials {{to be used by}} the machine and heated effectively, a second bottom‐side heater is needed. Since an off the shelf solution is not feasible, the second heater must be designed and fabricated. Before fabrication of the secondary thermoforming heater, several analyses were conducted to ensure that the heater would function within the necessary operating parameters. Using thermal simulation software, the designed heater enclosure box was tested to ensure that the correct thermal flow was provided as needed. Material properties were then applied to the CAD files and finite element analysis software was used to ensure that the new heating enclosure and track system would be structurally sound. Although variations of the heating enclosure setup were taken into account as part of these analyses, the results favored mirroring the existing heater layout with some adjustments. Instead of sixteen individual horizontal coils like in the top heater, three coils with three bends each were used. Testing showed that the same watt density could be achieved with only three coils using this design. The new heater was also made thinner in order to allow for more space for the mold. The heater tray was insulated {{in order to protect the}} mold which rests underneath and also for safety purposes. By providing Trine University with a second heater, the group hopes to expand the capabilities and learning possibilities that the plastics lab provide...|$|E
40|$|Wide {{applications}} of thermoforming {{are due to}} its high performance, simplicity, compactness and relatively low-cost equipment. These issues {{make it possible to}} produce complex, large-scale configurations and free form shapes of products. The fundamental defects inherent to the thermoforming technology are wall-thickness variation and warpage of the products due to inadequate thermal processing and frozen-in stresses during production of polymer. A nonlinear viscoelastic rheological model is implemented for developing the process model. This model describes deformation process of a sheet in thermoforming process. The results shown in our work not only leads {{to the understanding of the}} cause of these problems, but also enables us to formulate calculation of parameters that affect warpage and wall-thickness variation of polymeric sheets during plug-assist <b>vacuum</b> <b>thermoforming.</b> The gained experimental results confirm our presented model...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{anisotropic}} fracture behavior of neat and rubber-modified polypropylene cups induced by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>thermoforming</b> process is studied. The effect of different draw-ratios is also examined. An elasto-plastic fracture mechan-ics approach, {{based on the}} method of the essential work of fracture, is applied to samples cut from the thermoformed cups both longitudinally and transversally to the drawing direction. For all the products examined a strong anisotropy in the fracture behavior is observed. The fracture resistance for cracks propagating along the drawing direction is lower than in the transverse direction, this fracture anisot-ropy being enhanced at higher draw-ratio. The presence of the rubber particles results {{in an increase in}} the fracture toughness for cracks running transversally to the drawing direction, but, at the same time, it seriously reduces the fracture resistance for cracks propagating along the drawing direction. In order to better understand the dependence of the fracture behavior upon the processing condi-tions and material structure, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements are also carried out...|$|E
