5000|$|The aurora {{produces}} a reflecting sheet (or metric sized columns) {{which tends to}} lie in a vertical plane. The result of this vertical ionospheric [...] "curtain" [...] is reflection of signals well into the upper VHF band. The reflection is very aspect sensitive. Since the reflecting sheet lies towards the poles, it follows that reflected signals will arrive from that general direction. An active region or coronal hole may persist for some 27 days resulting in a second aurora when the Sun has rotated. There is a tendency for auroras to occur around the March/April, September/October equinox periods, when the geomagnetic field is at right angle to Sun for efficient charged particle coupling. Signals propagated by aurora have a characteristic hum effect, which makes video and audio reception difficult. <b>Video</b> <b>carriers,</b> as heard on a communications receiver, no longer can be heard as a pure tone.|$|R

50|$|While CX greatly {{improved}} the audio quality of LaserDisc's FM audio tracks, its {{primary reason for}} adoption was to decrease the amount of interference between the right channel's FM audio <b>carrier</b> and the <b>video</b> <b>carrier's</b> first chroma sideband. Without CX, strict filtering during mastering and playback as well as keeping color saturation below 75% on the master were required to keep any interference below -35db, which ensured that no beats or other artifacts were visible in the demodulated image. Although CX improved the picture quality, it was not normally used on discs with mono audio. Pioneer Video, the main manufacturer of LD's at the time, required the studios to request CX and, since most {{did not know that}} CX improved the video quality of the finished discs or the audio of mono titles, CX was rarely requested. Due to this lack of knowledge about CX at the studios, there were many stereo titles released without CX encoding and, in fact, CX didn't become standard on all LaserDisc titles until the late 80's. A look at Pioneer's catalogs as late as 1987 shows that the majority of titles did not have CX encoded analog sound - most were not digital either.|$|R

50|$|An NTSC {{television}} channel as transmitted occupies a total bandwidth of 6 MHz. The actual video signal, which is amplitude-modulated, is transmitted between 500 kHz and 5.45 MHz above the lower bound of the channel. The <b>video</b> <b>carrier</b> is 1.25 MHz above the lower bound of the channel. Like most AM signals, the <b>video</b> <b>carrier</b> generates two sidebands, one above the carrier and one below. The sidebands are each 4.2 MHz wide. The entire upper sideband is transmitted, but only 1.25 MHz {{of the lower}} sideband, known as a vestigial sideband, is transmitted. The color subcarrier, as noted above, is 3.579545 MHz above the <b>video</b> <b>carrier,</b> and is quadrature-amplitude-modulated with a suppressed carrier. The audio signal is frequency-modulated, like the audio signals broadcast by FM radio stations in the 88-108 MHz band, but with a 25 kHz maximum frequency deviation, as opposed to 75 kHz as is used on the FM band, making analog television audio signals sound softer than FM radio signals as received on a wideband receiver. The main audio carrier is 4.5 MHz above the <b>video</b> <b>carrier,</b> making it 250 kHz below {{the top of the}} channel. Sometimes a channel may contain an MTS signal, which offers more than one audio signal by adding one or two subcarriers on the audio signal, each synchronized to a multiple of the line frequency. This is normally the case when stereo audio and/or second audio program signals are used. The same extensions are used in ATSC, where the ATSC digital carrier is broadcast at 0.31 MHz above the lower bound of the channel.|$|E

50|$|In NTSC, {{chrominance}} is encoded {{using two}} color signals known as I (in-phase) and Q (in quadrature) {{in a process}} called QAM. The two signals each amplitude modulate 3.58 MHz carriers which are 90 degrees out of phase {{with each other and}} the result added together but with the carriers themselves being suppressed. The result {{can be viewed as a}} single sine wave with varying phase relative to a reference carrier and with varying amplitude. The varying phase represents the instantaneous color hue captured by a TV camera, and the amplitude represents the instantaneous color saturation. This 3.58 MHz subcarrier is then added to the Luminance to form the 'composite color signal' which modulates the <b>video</b> signal <b>carrier</b> just as in monochrome transmission.|$|R
