Mores include an aversion for societal taboos, such as incest. The mores of a society usually predicate legislation prohibiting their taboos.

40|$|During the 1970 s and 1980 s, {{a number}} of <b>vice</b> <b>squads</b> emerged in {{different}} locations in England and Wales {{to respond to the}} growing public concern about street prostitution. They adopted an essentially enforcement approach which was aimed predominantly at female prostitutes. During the 1990 s, however, the nature of police intervention has changed, as they have become increasingly involved in developing multi-agency responses to prostitution. There has also been a significant growth in the last decade of specialist agencies designed to support street prostitutes. This development has produced a changing regulatory framework in which the nature of prostitution and the conception of the female prostitute have been subject to re-examination. In this article, developments in the policing of prostitution over the last decade are reviewed and emerging trends in the regulation of prostitution are identified...|$|R

This {{is not to say}} that it isn’t a serious effort. Indeed, it’s a well performed attempt to accurately portray the totality of the homosexual experience. … Childhood ridicule, repulsion by parental heterosexual relations, brutality and beatings directed against homosexuals, falsified testimony by police <b>vice</b> <b>squads,</b> male prostitution, black and white homosexual attraction, biceps worship, marriage between homosexuals and women are all touched upon. … Georgie Porgie, then, is a limited appeal show since so many find the entire subject unpopular and distasteful.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Critics have {{objected to}} the show's usage of {{violence}} by dressing it with pretty photography.

Civic leaders in Miami have also {{objected to the}} show's airing of the city's crime problems all across America. Most civic leaders, however, have been placated due to the show's estimated contribution of $1 million per episode to the city's economy and boosting tourism to Miami. Gerald S. Arenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the show's glamorous depiction of <b>vice</b> <b>squads,</b> saying [...] "no real vice cops chase drug dealers in a Ferrari while wearing $600 suits.

40|$|Between the mid- 1960 s and early- 1970 s, the {{genres of}} folk and rock music were often {{culturally}} subversive forces that, at times, supported such countercultural mores as illegal drug use, obscenity, and a hedonistic sexuality which offended some governmental agencies {{and law enforcement}} authorities in the United States. Although the countercultural subversion frequently attributed to such music was neither the same as nor necessarily inclusive with revolutionary, leftist political ideologies and movements, such music commonly provided the soundtrack and inspiration for various counter-hegemonic political groups as the antiwar movement, the Youth International Party, the Black Panther Party, and the Weather Underground (all of which challenged government authorities which they condemned as imperialist, racist, and oppressive). Consequently, a variety of officials, including FBI agents, the U. S. Military, {{and local law enforcement}} officers, including municipal narcotics and <b>vice</b> <b>squads,</b> instituted various forms of repression or harassment against certain musical performers, promoters, or concertgoers. Frequently working as independent actors or bureaus, these political officials and law enforcement agents imposed varying degrees of repression or harassment upon musicians, depending on {{the degree to which they}} felt threatened. Targeted by such acts, musicians sometimes witnessed a deleterious effect on their emotional state, careers, and even the general direction of the music industry. Others, however, seemed little affected by police harassment or political repression, suggesting that the thought of dealing with law enforcement authorities did not completely deter all musicians from writing, recording, or performing whatever they wished...|$|R

40|$|Times {{may or may}} not be {{changing}} for gay people in the criminal justice system [...] and for the import of sexual orientation in criminal law. It depends on the nature of the case and, more importantly, exactly whose sexual orientation we are talking about. Signs of positive change include the recent high profile Matthew Shepard and Diane Whipple cases, in which gay and lesbian homicide victims were mourned not only by the gay community, but also by the entire country. It was no doubt helpful that both Shepard and Whipple presented very appealing images of gay people: each was young, attractive, white and college educated [...] 2 ̆ 2 wholly innocent victims. 2 ̆ 2 Probably the vast majority of openly gay or transgendered people who wind up in criminal court are charged with solicitation or prostitution.

They are notoriously badly treated throughout the criminal justice system: police are nasty to them; marshals, court officers and other court personnel often mock them; it is the rare judge or magistrate who treats these defendants with dignity or respect. They are treated badly from a systemic viewpoint as well. For example, in the District of Columbia there is a diversionary program for female prostitutes, through which an accused can avoid prosecution, and a diversionary program for male johns, but no such program for male prostitutes...|$|R

25|$|Three months later, Tony {{returns to}} Miami. All of his assets have been frozen, and {{the districts of}} Miami he used to {{dominate}} have been divided among other drug cartels. His first act is to ask George Sheffield (James Woods) to become his lawyer again. Sheffield reluctantly agrees, but at higher wages than before. As Tony has no real power anymore, he has little choice. He next travels to see his old friend and contact Felix (Carlos Ferro), who tells him Sosa is working with Gaspar Gomez (Cheech Marin) {{in an effort to}} take over all of Tony's old turf. He also warns Tony there are very few dealers who can be trusted anymore, as most report back to Sosa. Tony says he needs to make some small deals so he can make enough money to buy his mansion back from the <b>Vice</b> <b>Squad,</b> and begin to rebuild his empire. Felix advises him to speak to a bartender named Coco (Willa Holland). She puts him in touch with some dealers, as he slowly begins to re-establish his name, earning enough to re-purchase his mansion.

40|$|Bullying among {{children}} in our nation 2 ̆ 7 s schools has gripped the nation 2 ̆ 7 s collective interest, leading to grief, anger, and inquisition. Recent headlines suggest {{that the public is}} asking why bullying is taking place among our youth, so much so that it is costing children their lives. Recent teen deaths have swept the airwaves and headlines in the last two to three years, and {{it appears to be a}} problem that is starting to become a national epidemic. The purpose of this study was to examine bullying within student-sanctioned programs within a school, specifically, whether or not student leaders in those programs exercise bully-like behaviors based on being in a position of power. Examples of these 2 ̆ 2 positions of power 2 ̆ 2 include presidents, <b>vice</b> presidents, <b>squad</b> leaders, section leaders, or other 2 ̆ 2 titles 2 ̆ 2 that the advisors of these programs bestow on these students. Student-sanctioned organizations can carry hierarchal structures much like any bureaucracy we see in our everyday lives. Schools, like most organizations, have multiple layers of bureaucratic structures that are intended to carry out the mission efficiently and maintain order in the process. Student organizations such as cheerleading, student councils, football teams or band programs, can be viewed as smaller versions of the larger bureaucracy. Each of these groups has their own organizational rules, their own way of doing things, their own hierarchies of leadership, and their own ways of disseminating policies among their students. This qualitative study utilized an interview protocol, which explored the power relations between student leaders and non-student leaders in high school organizations that utilize student leaders. Using phenomenology as a guide, the inquiry focused on two urban high school bands, examples of the co-curricular programs that utilize student leaders. The student 2 ̆ 7 s first-hand and personal testimonials to the leadership experiences were crucial to examining these power relations. For some students, being in a leadership position is a way to be a bully, and the experience that the non-leaders have is similar to the experience of a victim of bullying. To date, studies have not looked at the effects of bullying by student leaders in a high school band setting. This study may provide useful insights for leadership policies and practice for a multitude of student activity groups. The study found that while some students did experience bullying to varying degrees during their time spent in their band programs, they all felt a sense of belonging to their band communities. All of the students agreed that leadership is important to a band program 2 ̆ 7 s function, but they felt that some student leaders within their bands did not effectively do their jobs that they were charged to do in a band setting. The details of these findings are reported out in chapter four of this dissertation, the discussion around those findings is found in chapter five, and implications for future practices are discussed in chapter six...|$|R

Pierce shared a film {{treatment}} he had developed with Eastwood, who liked the story and helped Pierce develop it into Sudden Impact (1983), the fourth entry in Eastwood's Dirty Harry film series. Pierce was given a writer's credit for the story along with Joseph C. Stinson. Pierce is said to have written the phrase, [...] "Go ahead, make my day," [...] the film's most famous line, which went on to be identified as one of the ten best movie quotes of all-time by the American Film Institute.
