However, to be useful for labor organizers, workers must first be located as entities in global <b>value</b> <b>chains.</b> Further modification can reveal possible strengths and weaknesses in the chain, identify worker allies and reveal necessary steps in the organizing process. This paper examines ways that labor educators have modified global <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> to teach workers about their industries, and uses two case studies to illustrate the application that global <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> have to comprehensive organizing campaigns. The paper argues that labor organizers should go one step further by using global <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> to conceptualize global plans to stabilize employment for workers {{after the end of}} the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and to raise wages in this context...|$|R

These include functions such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service, supported by systems and technology infrastructure. By aligning the various activities in its <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> with the organization's strategy in a coherent way, a firm can achieve a competitive advantage. Porter also wrote that strategy is an internally consistent configuration of activities that differentiates a firm from its rivals. A robust competitive position cumulates from many activities which should fit coherently together.|$|E

Further, core competency is difficult to duplicate, as it involves the skills and coordination of people {{across a variety of}} functional areas or processes used to deliver value to customers. By outsourcing, companies expanded the concept of the <b>value</b> <b>chain,</b> with some elements within the entity and others without.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{investigate}} the <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> {{for two of}} the most important species in the sea food trade in Europe, cod and salmon, using only price data. For cod we investigate <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> from Norway to Portugal and within the UK, while we investigate the <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> from Norway and the UK into France and from Norway to Finland for salmon. For cod, both <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> seem highly competitive, although there is also increased concentration. As expected, given that several market integration studies have shown that Norwegian and Scottish salmon are close substitutes, the <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> between the two producers are also related. The <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> appear to be competitive at the first stages upstream. When one goes further up in the chain the picture is less clear. At some stages the chain still seems competitive, though this is most commonly associated with traditional chains where there are still small firms, and for the least processed products. The evidence against competition is strongest when the retailers are supermarkets. However, this {{does not seem to be}} a sign of utilization of market power, as supermarkets tend to have lower prices. Hence, for both species higher concentration mainly seems to be a necessary adjustment to exploit scale economies in new distribution technologies...|$|R

25|$|Porter {{wrote in}} 1980 that {{companies}} have to make choices about their scope {{and the type of}} competitive advantage they seek to achieve, whether lower cost or differentiation. The idea of strategy targeting particular industries and customers (i.e., competitive positions) with a differentiated offering was a departure from the experience-curve influenced strategy paradigm, which was focused on larger scale and lower cost. Porter revised the strategy paradigm again in 1985, writing that superior performance of the processes and activities performed by organizations as part of their <b>value</b> <b>chain</b> is the foundation of competitive advantage, thereby outlining a process view of strategy.|$|E

It examines new upgrading opportunities for smallholder production in Africa {{as a consequence of}} two dominant trends within global agricultural <b>value</b> <b>chains.</b> The first is caused by the dynamics of the co-existing collaboration and intensified rivalry between lead firms within the same chain. The other is caused by new opportunities and challenges stemming from increased requirements on retailer-driven markets in the North and expansion of new markets in the South. The paper points out the need to rectify the heavily biased policy focus on standard compliance with the purpose of strengthening smallholder incorporation and upgrading in retailer-driven strands of global <b>value</b> <b>chains</b> ending in the North. Instead, markets in the South and in emerging economies may function as a training ground for upgrading of African smallholder production via increases in volume and consistency of exports. tropical products, developing countries, emerging economies, Africa, corporate strategies, smallholders, agro-food production, global <b>value</b> <b>chains,</b> agricultural <b>value</b> <b>chains,</b> collaboration, rivalry, lead firms, standards compliance,...|$|R
