METHODS: Regression analysis was performed on 114 cases on the paired total thyroxine and free thyroxine measurements taken from the same blood sample. Conversion equations were derived using structural relation models. RESULTS: A linear relation was found between log total thyroxine and log free thyroxine <b>values.</b> The <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> for <b>values</b> taken before treatment and values taken while patients were receiving replacement treatment were significantly different.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine how the {{relationship}} between N- 15 of nitrate (N- 15 (NO 3)) in rivers and land use within a river basin changes with varying hydrological conditions. This information would aid in identifying the dominant source contributing to increased nitrate concentrations in rural rivers. For this, N- 15 (NO 3) in river water was investigated monthly in the five subbasins of the Hii River basin (area: 911 km(2)), western Japan, for 1 year and 3 months. There were significant correlations (p< 0. 05) between N- 15 (NO 3) and the land-use ratio (i. e. ratios of forested, agricultural and residential areas in a subbasin) {{for the majority of}} the observation days, indicating that N- 15 (NO 3) reflected land use within the basin. N- 15 (NO 3) ranged from + 1. 4 parts per thousand to + 8. 5 parts per thousand and was lower in a subbasin with a higher forested area ratio. We found that the absolute <b>value</b> of the <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> of the relationship between N- 15 (NO 3) and the land-use ratio decreased with increasing river discharge. This finding demonstrates that differences in N- 15 (NO 3) among subbasins with different land-use compositions became smaller under higher flow conditions. Because N- 15 (NO 3) decreased with increasing river discharge, the small absolute <b>value</b> of the <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> under high flow conditions indicates that forested areas could be the dominant source of river nitrate during high flows in all subbasins investigated regardless of land-use composition. The results suggest that forested areas make a large contribution to the increase in nitrate concentration in downstream rivers during high flows, because the nitrate concentration increased with increasing river discharge. 201...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} indole amide {{derivatives}} bearing a basic side chain, {{in which the}} indole ring replaces the isoster benzimidazole nucleus typical of some well-known antihistamines, were prepared and tested for their H 1 -antihistaminic activity. The 1 -benzyl- 3 -indolecarboxamides 32 – 42 showed antihistaminic (H 1) activity (pA 2 6 – 8); the 3 -indolylglyoxylylamides 7 – 16 and the 2 -indolecarboxamides 48 – 56 showed little or no activity. Insertion of the basic side chain of the active 3 -indolecarboxamide derivatives into a piperazine ring (compounds 57 – 59) led to a dramatic loss of activity.

40|$|International audienceTemperature is a {{powerful}} correlate of large-scale terrestrial and marine diversity patterns but the mechanistic links remain unclear. Whilst many explanations have been proposed, quantitative predictions {{that allow them to}} be tested statistically are often lacking. As an important exception, the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) provides a rather robust technique using the relationship between diversity, temperature and metabolic rate in order to elucidate the ultimate underlying mechanisms driving large-scale diversity patterns. We tested if the MTE could explain geographic variations in marine copepod diversity on both ocean-wide and regional scales (East Japan Sea and North East Atlantic). The <b>values</b> of the <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> of diversity (ln taxonomic richness) over temperature (1 /kT) across all spatial scales were lower than the range predicted by the metabolic scaling law for species richness (i. e. - 0. 60 to - 0. 70).

These results further question the applicability of the MTE for explaining diversity patterns and, despite the relative lack of comparable studies in the marine environment, the generality of the MTE across systems...|$|R

40|$|Two new models, the {{covariance}} and <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> models, {{are proposed}} for assessing validity generalization.

Several simulation (monte carlo) studies showed the new models to be quite accurate in estimating the mean and variance of population true covariances and <b>regression</b> <b>slopes.</b> The results also showed that the accuracy of the covariance, <b>regression</b> <b>slope,</b> and correlation models is affected by the degree to which hypothetical distributions of artifacts match their true distributions; the <b>regression</b> <b>slope</b> model appears to be slightly more robust than the other two models...|$|R

Low organizational justice {{has been identified}} as a major source of distress and a predictor of poor health. Impaired regulation of immunological and inflammatory pathways may, in part, underlie these health effects. The present study investigated the association of organizational justice with leukocyte glucocorticoid sensitivity in vivo. Methods: Organizational justice was assessed among 541 male factory workers (mean [standard deviation] age = 46 [9] years) by questionnaire. Cortisol release was measured at three time points before blood collection and summed as the area under the curve. Blood was used to assess leukocyte (white blood cell [WBC] count) subsets (neutrophils [%WBC], lymphocytes [%WBC], and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio). Glucocorticoid sensitivity was operationalized as the correlation between cortisol release and these hematologic parameters. Associations were adjusted for demographics, work characteristics, and life-style variables. Results: A dose-response relationship between organizational justice and glucocorticoid sensitivity was found. Cortisol and hematologic parameters showed the expected significant association among individuals reporting high (all [beta] values >= |. 26 |; all p values = |. 15 |; all p <b>values.</b> 10). These <b>regression</b> <b>slopes</b> differed significantly between organizational justice groups (p values for interaction <. 050). Conclusions: Low justice at work is associated with an impaired ability of endogenous cortisol to regulate leukocyte distribution in vivo.
