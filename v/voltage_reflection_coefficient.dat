40|$|This thesis reviews design, test, and {{verification}} {{aspects of}} Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). A means of improving edge-placement accuracy and waveform quality in high speed, high performance, ASIC test and verification systems has been developed. Its {{aim is to}} minimize timing skew, maintain signal integrity at the Device Under Test (DUT), and actively reduce waveform distortions caused by uncertain DUT loading and transmission path imperfections. Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) is used to measure <b>voltage</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> of both the load (DUT) and Pin Electronic Card (PEC) ends of the transmission path. Time domain waveform is obtained using Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). Two prototypes, single and dual directional couplers, have been designed and implemented using Thickfilm-Hybrid Technology (TFH). Both couplers employ strip transmission line structures which support a Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) propagation mode. FDR experimental results indicate that a matched dual direction. al coupler {{can be used in}} such an application, yielding results comparable to those obtained from an automatic network analyzer. The path between the PEC and the DUT is modelled using a signal flow graph (SFG) technique. The model contains both lumped, and distributed circuit elements, each of which is represented by scattering parameters. Load models that represent the DUT or PEC receiver are obtained through a direct search optimization algorithm. This thesis implements two such algorithms, the pattern search and simplex algorithms, based on an example load model. A technique to compute compensation waveforms for linear transmission paths has been developed. Two examples, matched and mismatched channels, are presented. Simulation results show that compensation waveforms computed from the channel characteristic almost completely correct edge-placement timing errors and greatly reduce reflection effects. Implementation of compensation waveforms by simple hardware is possible, leading to edge-placement correction which is almost as good as that obtained from a theoretically computed compensation waveform...|$|R

30|$|From Fig.  2, it is {{observed}} that 1 st and 2 nd <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> offer better discriminative features between two classes of mental tasks in comparison with other two <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> For example, the statistical characteristics of the 3 rd and 4 th <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> in channel P 3 exhibit poor discriminative feature, which may affect the performance of classification between two types of mental tasks. This statement is also reflected in nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test which is used to quantify the test of class separability in terms of medians. It tests whether data from two types of tasks come from identical continuous distributions with equal medians, against the alternative {{that they do not have}} equal medians. The probability values (p-value) under this null hypothesis are found 0.00012472, 0.00000058, 0.96163331 and 0.55842113, respectively, for four <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> considering channel P 3. The high p-values observed for 3 rd and 4 th <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> indicate the failure to reject the null hypothesis, i.e., the data obtained from two tasks have almost similar medians reflecting low separability of the feature. On the contrary, very low p-values obtained in case of 1 st and 2 nd <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> indicate that the data obtained from two tasks does not come from identical distributions with almost equal medians. Hence, it is expected that the use of only first two <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> as feature can precisely preserve important discriminative information of the original signal patterns.

40|$|Superconducting {{amplifiers}} are {{key components}} of modern quantum information circuits. To minimize information loss and reduce oscillations a tapered impedance transformer of new design is needed at the input/output for compliance with other 50 Ω components. We show that an optimal tapered transformer of length ℓ, joining amplifier to input line, can be constructed using a variational principle applied to the linearized Riccati equation describing the <b>voltage</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the taper. For an incident signal of frequency ω_o the variational solution results in an infinite set of equivalent optimal transformers, each with the same form for the reflection coefficient, each able to eliminate input-line reflections. For the special case of optimal lossless transformers, the group velocity v_g is shown to be constant, with characteristic impedance dependent on frequency ω_c=π v_g / ℓ. While these solutions inhibit input-line reflections only for frequency ω_o, a subset of optimal lossless transformers with ω_o significantly detuned from ω_c does exhibit a wide bandpass. Specifically, by choosing ω_o→ 0 (ω_o→∞), we obtain a subset of optimal low-pass (high-pass) lossless tapers with bandwidth (0,∼ω_c) ((∼ω_c,∞)). From the subset of solutions we derive both the wide-band low-pass and high-pass transformers, and we discuss {{the extent to which}} they can be realized given fabrication constraints. In particular, we demonstrate the superior reflection response of our high-pass transformer when compared to other taper designs.

40|$|The method {{evolved from}} an Investigation of {{transmission}} line methods of measuring {{the absorption of}} electromagnetic radiations in liquids. An equation was derived relating the phase angle of the <b>voltage</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{to the length of}} the liquid filled line beyond a short circuit. The experimental results show that this equation describes exactly the behaviour of the phase angle as the depth of liquid filling the transmission line is varied. The equation {{has been shown to be}} true for a wide range of liquids (a) Non-absorbing liquids, i. e. Benzole. (b) Liquids with a low absorption, i. e. Chlorobenzene and Cyclohexanol. (c) Dilute solutions of polar substances in non-polar solvents, i. e. Chlorobenzene in Benzole. (d) Liquids with high absorptions, i. e. Water and Alcohol. (e) Electrolytic solutions, i. e. Sodium Chloride in water. Values of the phase constants and attenuation coefficients for these liquids have been deduced from the graphs showing phase angle plotted against liquid depth, with an accuracy that compares favourably with other established methods. The method has been applied to an investigation of the absorption of microwaves (lambda = 9. 1 sms) by ox blood and serum at room temperature and the inner body temperature of 37 °C, and these results have been compared with those obtained for distilled water at these two temperatures. The variation of the phase constant and attenuation coefficient of sodium chloride solutions with concentration has also been investigated, from 0. 15 N (physiological saline) up to 2 N. This method, which depends upon measurement of phase shift alone for the determination of alpha and beta, requires a very much simpler form of apparatus than other methods. The method is best suited to liquids with low values of alpha and high values of beta, and a modification to the apparatus and experimental method has been suggested which should enable values to be obtained more rapidly. This modification has not so far been made, since the accuracy obtainable with this phase shift method is inferior to that of the null techniques recently introduced into dielectric measurements. <p...|$|E
