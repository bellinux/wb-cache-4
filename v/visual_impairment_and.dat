5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E

25|$|Exhall Grange School was {{established}} in 1951 {{on the site of}} a former Second World War army base, and began life with twelve pupils.

Among its features was specially designed lighting to help pupils read and navigate their way around more easily. The school later began to extend its facilities and to enrol students with other disabilities, while in 1960 a grammar school department was added to enable disabled students from across the United Kingdom to attain a grammar school level of education. It was, for many years, predominantly a boarding school with pupils attending from across the United Kingdom, and it was regarded as being among the best in its field.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Charles Bonnet {{syndrome}} (CBS) is by complex {{visual hallucinations}} and ocular pathology causing vision loss. It {{has been considered}} that CBS occurs frequently in elderly visually handicapped patients and the hallucinations are limited to the visual modality. Three hypotheses we examined were: (1) whether <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> are associated with visual hallucinations (2) whether <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> are associated with auditory hallucinations (3) whether the development of visual and auditory hallucinations in patients with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> is associated with age. METHOD: Data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) in the United States were used to examine whether associations between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> <b>visual</b> hallucinations {{can be found in}} the general population, and whether such influences of <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> are limited to the visual modality and to specific age groups. RESULTS: Prevalence of visual and auditory hallucinations in respondents with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> were 12. 8 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) = 3. 4 - 22. 2 %) and 7. 1 % (95 %CI = 2. 6 - 11. 6 %) respectively. Although the point estimates were substantive, the odds ratios between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> existence of <b>visual</b> hallucinations or auditory hallucinations were not statistically significant (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 43, 95 %CI = 0. 92 - 6. 44, P = 0. 07 and OR = 2. 16, 95 %CI = 0. 87 - 5. 33, P = 0. 10, respectively) in the whole sample. Association between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> <b>visual</b> hallucination was significant (OR = 3. 09, 95 %CI = 1. 06 - 8. 99, P < 0. 05) only in the elderly (age group 60 -), while significant association was found between <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> auditory hallucinations in a younger age group (age group 18 - 39, OR = 13. 25, 95 %CI = 2. 99 - 58. 75, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Visual</b> <b>impairments</b> act as a trigger for both visual and auditory hallucinations. In patients with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments,</b> the presence of visual hallucinations was associated with an age over 60, while the existence of auditory hallucinations was associated with an age under 3...|$|R
