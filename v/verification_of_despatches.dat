Programverificationisthecheckthat a given program satisfies given properties. Program verification is called formal if both the semantics of the specifications and the program execution are defined formally as mathematical entities. The verification is called automatic if it is performed automatically without interaction or with limited interaction with a user. Our approach is targeted towards the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the preservation of heap-topological properties. It is also aimed towards the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> the effects and the frame properties of the program statements. Automatic <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> heap structures is crucial for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> multi-object invariants, the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> concurrent programs (e. g., absence of race conditions and deadlocks), software engineering (e. g., enabling encapsulation and modular development, handlingdesign patterns), and the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> security properties (e. g., isolation) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There are {{two main}} streams for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> digital systems: Theorem proving methods such as term {{rewriting}} are used for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> data oriented systems, and model checking of temporal logics is usually used for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> control dominated systems. While theorem proving is an inherently interactive verification method, model checking is performed automatically. In this paper, we investigate for the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> algorithms for computing the discrete cosine transform by means of term rewriting and model checking. We show {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of both approaches at different abstraction levels of the design. ...|$|R
