The formation and migration energies for vacancies of all adequately stable pure elements in both the face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close packing (hcp) crystal structures were determined using ab initio calculations. For hcp migration, both the basal plane and z-direction nearest-neighbor vacancy hops were considered. Energy barriers were successfully calculated for 49 elements in the fcc structure and 44 elements in the hcp structure. These data were plotted against various elemental properties in order to discover significant correlations. The calculated data show smooth and continuous trends when plotted against Mendeleev numbers. The vacancy formation energies were plotted against cohesive energies to produce linear trends with regressed slopes of 0. 317 and 0. 323 for the fcc and hcp structures respectively. This result shows the expected increase in vacancy formation energy with stronger bonding. The slope of approximately 0. 3, being well below that predicted by a simple fixed bond strength model, {{is consistent with a}} reduction in the vacancy formation energy due to many-body effects and relaxation. <b>Vacancy</b> <b>migration</b> barriers are found to increase nearly linearly with increasing stiffness, consistent with the local expansion required to migrate an atom.

30|$|The {{development}} of denser, faster and less energy-consuming non-volatile memory {{is of great}} importance to innovations in modern information technology [1, 2]. While many contenders have emerged {{to be the next}} generation of memory device, resistive random access memory (RRAM) based on metal oxides {{is one of the most}} promising candidates for its advantages of high speed, high scalability, low power consumption and good compatibility with the CMOS process [3]. Although the detailed switching mechanism of the resistive memory remains uncertain, it is widely accepted that the <b>migration</b> of oxygen <b>vacancies</b> under an applied electrical field plays a key role in the switching behaviour [4]. Depending on the switching mechanism, the resistive switching can be classified into filamentary and interfacial (homogeneous) modes. The filamentary mode is achieved by the formation and rupture of oxygen vacancy filament(s) between two electrodes. On the other hand, the resistance switching in the interfacial mode is controlled by the distribution of oxygen vacancies along an interface. The current is localized in the conducting filaments(s) in the the filamentary mode, while is distributed homogenerously across the device area in the interfacial mode [5, 6]. The resistive switching mode characterized in a memory device is strongly dependent on its structure. In general, the exhibition of the interfacial mode in the metal oxide-based system relies on the existence of an oxygen gradient profile along the vertical axis [7, 8]. Recently, the coexistence of both modes in one material system has also been reported [9 – 11]. By modulating the measurement parameters, transformation between these two modes can also be achieved [12]. However, the switching in the interfacial mode is usually attributed to the change of Schottky barrier height induced by the accumulation and depletion processes of carriers through defective states at the electrode/function layer interface [7, 9 – 18] rather than the effect of oxygen <b>vacancies</b> <b>migration</b> at the oxide/oxide interfaces.|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{advances}} in cathode materials {{are key to}} lowering the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Detailed understanding of the structural, electronic and defect formation characteristics are essential for rational design of cathode materials. In this thesis we employ first principles methods to study La(Mn/Co) O 3 and LnBaCo 2 O 5 +δ (Ln = Pr, Gd; δ = 0. 5, 1) as cathode for SOFCs. Specifically, factors affecting the O <b>vacancy</b> formation and <b>migration</b> are investigated. We demonstrate that for LaMnO 3 the anisotropy effects often neglected at high operating temperatures become relevant when the temperature is lowered. We show that this fact has consequences for the material properties and can be further enhanced by strain and Sr doping. Tensile strain promotes both the O <b>vacancy</b> formation and <b>migration</b> in pristine and Sr doped LaMnO 3, while Sr doping enhances the O vacancy formation but not the migration. The effect of A-site hole doping (Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + or Ba 2 +) on the electronic and magnetic properties {{as well as the}} O <b>vacancy</b> formation and <b>migration</b> in LaCoO 3 are studied. All three dopants are found to facilitate O vacancy formation. Substitution of La 3 + with Ba 2 +/Mg 2 + yields the lowest O vacancy formation energy for low/intermediate spin Co, implying that not only the structure, but also the spin state of Co is a key parameter. Only for low spin Co the ionic radius is correlated with the O migration barrier. Enhanced migration for intermediate spin Co is ascribed to the availability of additional space at the transition state. For LnBaCo 2 O 5 +δ we compare the O vacancy formation in GdBaCo 2 O 5. 5 (Pmmm symmetry) and GdBaCo 2 O 6 (P 4 /mmm symmetry), and the influence of Sr doping. The O vacancy formation energy is demonstrated to be smaller in the already O deficient compound. This relation is maintained under Sr doping. It turns out that Sr doping can be utilized to significantly enhance the O vacancy formation in both compounds. The observed trends are explained on a microscopic level. Furthermore, we consider antisite defects as they may modify the electronic and O migration properties but are rarely studied in double perovskite oxides. It turns out that O vacancy formation is significantly easier in PrBaCo 2 O 5. 5 than in GdBaCo 2 O 5. 5, the difference in formation energy being hardly modified by antisite defects. Finally, having established that the O vacancy formation energy is significantly lower in PrBaCo 2 O 5. 5 than in GdBaCo 2 O 5. 5, we study the O Frenkel energy and migration of O ions in PrBa(Co/Fe) 2 O 5. 5. The electronic structure and charge redistribution during defect formation are analyzed.
