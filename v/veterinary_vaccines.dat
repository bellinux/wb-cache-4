Infection may also occur by drinking contaminated water with floating young fasciola or when using utensils washed with contaminated water.

However there are still a significant number of veterinary diseases for which vaccines do not currently exist or where currently available vaccines do not provide adequate immu nity. Adenoviruses have transitioned from tools for gene replacement therapy to bona fide vaccine delivery vehicles because of their ability to elicit potent cell-mediated and humoral responses making them ideal for use against viruses and other intracellular pathogens.

40|$|AbstractVeterinary {{vaccines}} {{contribute to}} improved {{human and animal}} health and welfare by preventing diseases and deaths caused by a wide range of infectious agents. However, testing necessary to ensure vaccine effectiveness and safety can involve large numbers of animals and significant pain and distress. NICEATM and ICCVAM convened an international workshop to review the state of the science of human and <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccine</b> potency and safety testing methods and to identify opportunities to advance new and improved methods that can further reduce, refine, and replace animal use. This workshop report is the fourth in a series of six, and addresses methods and strategies for <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccine</b> potency testing that can avoid or lessen pain and distress, improve animal welfare, and reduce animal use. Vaccine potency tests considered to have the highest priority for further reduction and refinement were those that require an infectious agent challenge test or an in vivo toxin neutralization test, those that require large numbers of animals, and those that require the use of infectious agents hazardous to laboratory workers and/or animals. Vaccines identified as high priorities for improved alternative test methods were rabies, Clostridium spp., Leptospira spp., foreign animal diseases (e. g., foot and mouth disease), and poultry and fish vaccines. The workshop recommended priority research, development, and validation activities to address critical knowledge and data gaps, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Recommendations to support more humane animal use included development and use of humane endpoints for all challenge tests, development of serologic assays to replace challenge tests, and development of in vitro toxin neutralization tests to replace in vivo TNTs. Workshop participants recommended approaches {{to reduce the number of}} animals required for potency testing, and recommended enhanced international harmonization and cooperation, and closer collaborations between human and veterinary researchers to expedite progress in the development and application of alternative methods.

5000|$|Poultry {{vaccines}} for {{bird flu}} are made inexpensively {{and are not}} filtered and purified like human vaccines to remove bits of bacteria or other viruses. They usually contain whole virus, not just hemagglutinin as in most human flu vaccines. Purification to standards needed for humans is far {{more expensive than the}} original creation of the unpurified vaccine from eggs. There is no market for <b>veterinary</b> <b>vaccines</b> that are that expensive. Another difference between human and poultry vaccines is that poultry vaccines are adjuvated with mineral oil, which induces a strong immune reaction but can cause inflammation and abscesses. [...] "Chicken vaccinators who have accidentally jabbed themselves have developed painful swollen fingers or even lost thumbs, doctors said. Effectiveness may also be limited. Chicken vaccines are often only vaguely similar to circulating flu strains — some contain an H5N2 strain isolated in Mexico years ago. 'With a chicken, if you use a vaccine that's only 85percent related, you'll get protection,' Dr. Cardona said. 'In humans, you can get a single point mutation, and a vaccine that's 99.99percent related won't protect you.' And they are weaker human vaccines. 'Chickens are smaller and you only need to protect them for six weeks, because that's how long they live till you eat them,' said Dr. John J. Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester. Human seasonal flu vaccines contain about 45 micrograms of antigen, while an experimental A(H5N1) vaccine contains 180. Chicken vaccines may contain less than one microgram.
