5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and {{she found herself in}} the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E
5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD rules were not fully compatible {{with those of the}} D Basic Set and as a result, D and AD became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> six-figure annual income for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Hughes then {{signed a}} multi-fight {{deal with the}} UFC. Hughes {{defeated}} Renzo Gracie, the 1st cousin once removed of his opponent at UFC 60, via third round TKO at , setting the record for most UFC wins with 17. Both of them seemed <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> fighting on their feet in the early going, with Gracie landing the cleaner and more effective punches and also landing a couple of kicks. Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes connected with a right hook to Gracie's chin, then connected with a leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick. Gracie took {{all the time he}} could before Hughes helped him up and then dropped him with a second leg kick. Gracie stalled again, but when he finally stood up Hughes floored him with a punch, let him get up and then attacked again. Hughes knocked Gracie down again with a fourth punch, when referee Herb Dean ended it.|$|E

These included Bobo Brazil, Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, Bill Watts, Édouard Carpentier, Pat O’Connor, and the Funks, Terry and Dory, Jr., respectively.|$|E

25|$|Typically, for {{a smaller}} {{executive}} car, there is ample room up front for the driver and passenger to sit comfortably, with <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> seats. However, rear seat passengers may find the design restrictive in overall room. The 156 Sportwagon features the addition of fold down rear seats which increases the luggage area normally covered by a privacy screen. Ideally the 156 is a car for four people, rather than five, although later models did add a full centre seatbelt {{in place of the}} lap belt in earlier models.|$|E

[...] Citroën replaced the conventional steel springs on the rear axle of their top-of-range model, the Traction Avant 15 Hydraulique. In 1955, the Citroën DS incorporated four wheel hydropneumatic suspension. This combined a <b>very</b> soft, <b>comfortable</b> suspension, with controlled movements, for sharp handling, together with a self-levelling suspension.|$|R
25|$|Noffke's {{magnificent}} {{start to}} the season was rewarded as on 5 December 2007 he was named in Australia's squad for their Twenty20 International match against New Zealand at Perth on 11 December 2007. In a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> victory for Australia, Noffke took 3/18 off 3.3 overs, the best figures of the match. He did not get an opportunity with the bat, however, as he was run out for a diamond duck whilst attempting a second run with batting partner Andrew Symonds. Noffke won the 2008 State Cricket Players of the Year award.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Douglas {{was a major}} box-office star, playing {{opposite}} some of {{the leading}} actresses of that era. He played a frontier peace officer in his first western Along the Great Divide (1951). He quickly became <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> with riding horses and playing gunslingers, and appeared in many westerns. He considers Lonely Are the Brave (1962), in which he plays a cowboy trying to live by his own code, as his personal favorite. The film, written by Dalton Trumbo, was respected by critics, but did not do well {{at the box office}} due to poor marketing and distribution.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} arts that are {{native to the}} Nashi People, such as the rarely seen Nashi {{handmade}} embroidery, Dongba painting, Dongba wooden carving and so on. Much of the wood carving that characterizes Nashi houses are made by Bai craftsmen today. Absorbing architectural styles of the Han, Nashi houses are built in a standard Han style of one courtyard with one, two, three or four buildings around it, sometimes with linked adjoining courtyards. The mud brick and wood structures at first sight {{have been described as}} crude and simple in appearance, but a closer inspection reveals elaborate and delicate patterns on casements and doors, elegant pillars and pillar supports, and a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> and airy living environment.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, the Penrhos College {{site was}} taken over by the {{government}} for Ministry of Food use. The Duke of Devonshire, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, offered Chatsworth House {{for the use of the}} school. The contents of the house were packed away in eleven days and 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.|$|E
25|$|Zheng's game is characterised by consistency, intellect, quick {{reflexes}} {{and fighting}} spirit. She {{is not the}} strongest player, but makes up for this with her careful thinking of where to place her shots and willingness to change game plans if a strategy is not working. Her shots are {{of a lot of}} pace and very well placed, making Zheng an excellent defensive counterpuncher. She has one of the best footwork and court coverage on the tour, which allows her to keep shots in play that would normally be winners; so few shots get by her that after the final match of 2005 Hobart International, the finalist Gisela Dulko described her game as 'The Great Wall of China' because 'she didn't miss one ball'. Also an accomplished doubles player, she is <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> when playing at the net. Zheng's best shot is her backhand. Zheng's main weakness is her serve; however she is sometimes able to neutralize her weak serve with her quickness or by serving to the body or to the opponent's weaker groundstroke.|$|E
25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> sum, which leads one to wonder {{how many of the}} abbey's {{financial}} problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of the}} First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, should that fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery to keep them out of royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
