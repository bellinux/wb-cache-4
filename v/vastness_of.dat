5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{is one of}} the few {{developed}} nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13% share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E

50|$|Their name derives, {{according}} to ancient writers, from hirpus, the Oscan for wolf; and, {{in accordance with}} this derivation, their first ancestors were supposedly guided to their new settlements by a wolf. This tradition implies that the Hirpini were regarded as having migrated, like the other Sabellian races {{in the south of}} Italy, from the north, but when this migration occurred is unknown. From their position in the <b>vastnesses</b> <b>of</b> the central Apennines, they were probably there long before they first appear in history.|$|R
5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, {{in as much}} as one existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to likely be a highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was a recognition of the problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault of static defensive positions given the room for manoeuvre afforded by the <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E
5|$|In Britain the {{campaign}} emphasised the important lesson previously {{demonstrated in the}} Trafalgar campaign of the year before, that it was immensely difficult in the <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> the Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea: only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons. The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons, {{and the maintenance of}} a tight blockade was essential. The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon, who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade: by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons.|$|E

The artist is prudent in terms of adventurous experimentation, and minimalistic; his works seldom have more than three colours, and he does not use a palette or an easel. Instead of colour, line and form as primary requirements, Basu’s approach uses colour and surface as foundational elements.|$|R

5|$|No more of {{the tale}} is {{recorded}} until about 1165 when copies of what was certainly a forged Letter of Prester John started spreading throughout Europe. An epistolary wonder tale with parallels suggesting its author knew the Romance of Alexander and the above-mentioned Acts of Thomas, the Letter was supposedly written to the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Comnenus (1143–1180) by Prester John, descendant {{of one of the}} Three Magi and King of India. The many marvels of richness and magic it contained captured the imagination of Europeans, and it was translated into numerous languages, including Hebrew. It circulated in ever more embellished form for centuries in manuscripts, a hundred examples of which still exist. The invention of printing perpetuated the letter's popularity in printed form; it was still current in popular culture during the period of European exploration. Part of the letter's essence was that a lost kingdom of Nestorian Christians still existed in the <b>vastnesses</b> <b>of</b> Central Asia.|$|R
25|$|The <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> the North American continent, and {{the variety}} of its climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landforms, led ancient peoples to {{coalesce}} into many distinct linguistic and cultural groups.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there was a}} {{systematic}} failure to appreciate the level of pre-war education in the Soviet military. The ability of the Soviets to improvise and compensate for disorganisation in logistics offset their failings. Extensive use of camouflage and all arms defence against air attack made the Soviets tenacious on the defensive. There was, on the German side, a failure to realise that the unfavourable ratio of Soviet air power to the <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> territory applied even more so to the numerically weaker Luftwaffe.|$|E

40|$|Many have {{experienced}} vastness, the feeling when the visual space seems to extend without limits away from you, {{making you feel}} like a small element within the space. For over 200 years, people have been writing about this experience, for example stating that vastness is important to the experience of awe [Mikulak 2015]. Yet vastness has received little attention in empirical research. Specifically, it is unknown which aspects of the visual stimulus contribute to perceived vastness. This {{may be due to the}} inherent difficulties in presenting a variety of vast stimuli while varying only specific visual cues. Using virtual reality addresses these difficulties, as this technology provides precise control over the presented visual stimuli. Here we investigate whether the feeling <b>of</b> <b>vastness</b> can be evoked using virtual reality and explore potential objective measures to assess vastness. We used three different measures during this experiment: 1) An avatar height adjustment task where participants had to adjust an avatar to be equivalent to their own height as viewed from a distance, 2) a distance estimation task and 3) a subjective vastness rating task. These tasks were performed in four environments: a plain (used in all subsequent environments for the ground and sky surfaces), a forest, a mountain and the mountain and forest environments combined. Our results indicate that the feeling <b>of</b> <b>vastness</b> can indeed be experienced to various degrees in virtual environments, demonstrating the potential of VR as a tool for exploring the perception <b>of</b> <b>vastness.</b> Yet the results combined suggest that the percept <b>of</b> <b>vastness</b> is a rather complex construct...|$|R
60|$|So Westward-ho they ran, {{beneath the}} mighty {{northern}} wall, the highest cliff on earth, some seven thousand feet of rock parted {{from the sea}} by a narrow strip of bright green lowland. Here and there a patch of sugar-cane, or a knot of cocoa-nut trees, close to the water's edge, reminded {{them that they were}} in the tropics; but above, all was savage, rough, and bare as an Alpine precipice. Sometimes deep clefts allowed the southern sun to pour a blaze of light down to the sea marge, and gave glimpses far above of strange and stately trees lining the glens, and of a veil of perpetual mist which shrouded the inner summits; while up and down, between them and the mountain side, white fleecy clouds hung motionless in the burning air, increasing the impression <b>of</b> <b>vastness</b> and <b>of</b> solemn rest, which was already overpowering.|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} {{problem is the}} <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> space. Despite piggybacking on the world's most sensitive radio telescope, Charles Stuart Bowyer said, the instrument could not detect random radio noise emanating from a civilization like ours, which has been leaking radio and TV signals for less than 100 years. For SERENDIP and most other SETI projects to detect a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization, the civilization {{would have to be}} beaming a powerful signal directly at us. It also means that Earth civilization will only be detectable within a distance of 100 light-years.|$|E

25|$|Interstellar {{travel is}} the term used for {{hypothetical}} crewed or uncrewed travel between stars or planetary systems. Interstellar travel {{will be much more}} difficult than interplanetary spaceflight; the distances between the planets in the Solar System are less than 30 astronomical units (AU)—whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in light-years. Because of the <b>vastness</b> <b>of</b> those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the speed of light; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both.|$|E

They staggered and panted like men under heavy burdens; yet the packs on their backs were a matter of but a few pounds. He questioned them eagerly, and their replies seemed to relieve him. He hurried on. Next came two white men, supporting between them a woman. They also behaved as though drunken, and their limbs shook with weakness. But the woman leaned lightly upon them, choosing to carry herself forward with her own strength. At the sight of her a flash of joy cast its fleeting light across Sitka Charley's face. He cherished a very great regard for Mrs. Eppingwell. He had seen many white women, {{but this was the first}} to travel the trail with him. When Captain Eppingwell proposed the hazardous undertaking and made him an offer for his services, he had shaken his head gravely; for it was an unknown journey through the dismal <b>vastnesses</b> <b>of</b> the Northland, and he knew it to be of the kind that try to the uttermost the souls of men.|$|R

25|$|Britain {{realised}} {{the value}} of troops from the Australian colonies. The climates and geography of Southern Africa and Australia were quite similar, and most Australian soldiers, {{the vast majority of}} whom were trained as mounted rifles, were well-suited to operating in such terrain.

At that time, most British troops were recruited from within urban environments, and although their ability as soldiers was not questioned, they did not have the natural horsemanship and bush craft of the Australians, many of whom came from rural backgrounds.|$|E

Nesting in colonies that can number hundreds of birds, the eiders {{are among the most}} conspicuous of tundra-breeding birds. Although female eiders are a study in grays and browns that match the arctic tundra, the males are most boldly patterned in black and white, with striking green head colors. When the nesting season ends, the birds disperse over the <b>vastnesses</b> <b>of</b> the northern oceans, out of range of most human observers. Of the four species of eiders, the two most abundant and largest have circumpolar breeding distributions and extensive marine wintering ranges.
