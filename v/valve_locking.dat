During transportation ambient temperature reaches 400 °C, and the pressure-over 30 MPa. Leakage of the fluid through the details and components of lock valves is not permitted. The batch of high-pressure valves was withdrawn after some time of its usage at the petrochemical enterprise. Premature wear of input branch pipe saddles was dis-covered. The cause of destruction of the input branch pipe saddles was erosion be-cause of abrasive particles, which {{are present in the}} working fluid.

40|$|The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, {{is funding}} the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in {{performing}} research investigating {{the performance of}} gate valves subjected to pressure locking and thermal binding conditions. Pressure locking and thermal binding are phenomena that make a closed gate valve difficult to open. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause {{the pressure of the}} fluid in the bonnet (and, in most gate valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. Thermal binding can occur when thermal expansion/contraction effects cause the disc to be squeezed between the valve body seats. If the loads associated with pressure locking or thermal binding are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The authors tested a flexible-wedge gate valve and a double-disc gate <b>valve</b> under pressure <b>locking</b> and thermal binding conditions. The results show that these valves are susceptible to pressure locking; however, they are not significantly affected by thermal binding. For the flexible-wedge gate <b>valve,</b> pressure <b>locking</b> loads (in terms of stem thrust) were higher than corresponding hydrostatic opening loads by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 5.

5000|$|... 3-Stage VTEC is {{a version}} that employs three {{different}} cam profiles to control intake valve timing and lift. Due to {{this version of}} VTEC being designed around a SOHC valve head, space was limited; so VTEC can only modify the opening and closing of the intake valves. The low-end fuel economy improvements of VTEC-E {{and the performance of}} conventional VTEC are combined in this application. From idle to 2500-3000 RPM, depending on load conditions, one intake valve fully opens while the other opens just slightly, enough to prevent pooling of fuel behind the valve, also called 12-valve mode. This 12 Valve mode results in swirl of the intake charge which increases combustion efficiency, resulting in improved low end torque and better fuel economy. At 3000-5400 RPM, depending on load, one of the VTEC solenoids engages, which causes the second <b>valve</b> to <b>lock</b> onto the first valve's camshaft lobe. Also called 4-valve mode, this method resembles a normal engine operating mode and improves the mid-range power curve. At 5500-7000 RPM, the second VTEC solenoid engages (both solenoids now engaged) so that both intake valves are using a middle, third camshaft lobe. The third lobe is tuned for high-performance and provides peak power at the top end of the RPM range.|$|R

This paper discusses only the pressure locking phenomenon in a flexible-wedge gate valve; we will publish {{the results of our}} thermal binding research at a later date. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause the pressure of the fluid in the bonnet (and, in most valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. This high fluid pressure presses the discs against both seats, making the disc assembly harder to unseat than anticipated by the typical design calculations, which generally consider friction at only one of the two disc/seat interfaces. The high pressure of the bonnet fluid also changes the pressure distribution around the disc in a way that can further contribute to the unseating load. If the combined loads associated with pressure locking are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The results of the NRC/INEL research discussed in this paper show that the relationship between bonnet pressure and pressure locking stem loads appears linear. The results also show that for this valve, seat leakage affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|R

In these latter, the basal margin, towards the tergo-lateral side, is strongly sinuous; the prominences are formed by the terminations of the external longitudinal ridges, and correspond to the interspaces between the valves of the lower whorl. These ridges, which are interesting, from throwing light on similar ridges in some fossil species, are present, both on old and young specimens, and run from the apex of the valve, in a slightly curved line, to the tergo-lateral half of the basal margin, where, as we have just seen, they sometimes form prominences. They consist of three or even four obscure, almost confluent, ridges, of which the middle one is generally (but not always) the smallest: together they cover the whole of that part of the scutum, which is not overlapped along the basal margin by the rostrum and large upper latus; and they seem evidently due to the growth of the shell in this interspace having been freer. So, again, the three or four small, confluent, component ridges have the same relation to the interspaces between the small latera of the lower whorl.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 47). The growing technology associated with petroleum equipment has lead to an increase in electrical components used to measure, adjust and control many aspects of the petroleum extraction process. This increase in electrical use has lead to the conversion of many components from hydraulic operation to electric. Therefore, it is the purpose of this report to detail and propose an engineering solution to the electrical conversion of a surface controlled subsea safety valve (SCSSV). Preliminary analysis has resulted in the following important functional requirements that the SCSSV should operate within: Temperatures up to 350 F. Estimated operational life of 20 years. Peak available power of 4300 W (actual value will be much lower than this due to other power system drains). The three conceptual designs presented in this report are the following: Electric motor actuator with a solenoid latching detent. Linear actuation with a fluid reservoir <b>locking</b> <b>valve.</b> Rotational engagement with an electric locking clutch. After reviewing and comparing these concepts, the last concept was chosen to be further developed. This concept will have the least temperature sensitive components and fewer leak path problem areas. Upon completion of the detailed design phase an electric SCSSV solution has been proposed. The following is a brief list of the performance claims: Power requirement to open: 0. 5 W. Time required to open valve: 10 minutes. Installable inline with 4 - 1 / 2 tubing. Operating temperature range: 20 - 350 F. H?S service certified. Hold open energy requirements 0 ~ 0. 2 W. There are however practical issues that must be addressed to ensure reliable and satisfactory performance of the SCSSV. The actual efficiency of the cylindrical cam mechanism and reliability of the torque overload clutch must be empirically determined due to the number of theoretical assumptions used. Thus these items should be thoroughly tested in order to produce a reliable and satisfactory SCSSV. It is with these claims and working issue that this electrically converted SCSSV be fully developed and installed for electrical petroleum production systems...|$|R

Switch-mode hydraulic {{control is a}} compact and theoretically efficient alternative to throttling valve control or variable displacement pump control. The virtually variable displacement circuit created by a pulse-width modulated high-speed valve has drawbacks, such as large energy losses due to throttling and compressibility during valve transitions. Hydraulic soft switching was proposed as method of reducing the throttling energy loss, by absorbing, in a small variable volume chamber, the flow that would normally be throttled across the transitioning high speed <b>valve.</b> An active <b>locking</b> mechanism was presented by Van de Ven that overcomes the main challenge with soft switching, which is a lock mechanism that releases quickly and with precise timing. A numerical model is developed for a switch-mode pumping circuit, utilizing the proposed soft switch. The model is then used {{as a means of}} designing a proof of concept prototype to further verify the model and provide a future optimization tool. The prototype design includes methods for controlling the soft switch spring preload, travel distance, piston displacement required to unlock the soft switch, valve command duty ratio, switching cycle length, and load pressure. Testing demonstrated that the soft switch circuit performed as expected within a set of parameter values, defining normal operation. High control valve switching periods, high load pressures, high flow rates, low soft switch unlocking distances, and low spring preloads caused the soft switch to unlock prematurely in the switching cycle. This resulted in the soft switch to failing to absorb the switched volume pressure spike during control valve transitions, leading to low efficiencies. Under normal operating conditions, the soft switch circuit was calculated to be 60. 9 % efficient, which is lower than the 62. 1 % efficiency for same circuit without a soft switch, and also lower than the 70. 5 % efficiency predicted by the numerical model. The discrepancies between the numerical and experimental model can be attributed to poor resolution in the measurement instruments, as well as the model not accurately capturing flow dynamics through the check valves behind the soft switch piston. Since the soft switch parameters were chosen to validate the lock release concept, and not to maximize efficiency, it was not unexpected that the baseline soft switch case had lower efficiency than the control case. Using the insights gained from these model comparisons, an efficient locking soft switch can be designed for use in a dual soft switch circuit scheme, shown by Van de Ven to reduce energy losses by 66 % compared to a control circuit. A successful hydraulic soft switch circuit will allow for the use of slower switching valves, which will reduce component cost as well as energy consumption...|$|R
