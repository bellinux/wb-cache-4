40|$|Technological {{innovation}} in Automotive Electronics {{has led to}} the development of Engine Immobilisers. The present day Engine Immobiliser based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) are growing unsafe as professional hackers have been able to break into them. In 2005, a group of students in the Johns Hopkins University, USA hacked an RFID Engine Immobiliser and stole the vehicle in under twenty minutes. It is disturbing that almost a decade later the field of Engine Immobilisers has seen very little advancement. As a result the number of vehicle theft cases has risen exponentially in the past decade globally. The need of the hour is to design a system which enhances the security of the vehicle removing the drawbacks of the existing RFID system. We propose a system which replaces the prevalent technology with a Face Recognition System. Additionally, the system gives the owner remote access to the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> further reducing chances of vehicle theft.

5000|$|AM radio {{technology}} is simpler than later transmission systems. An AM receiver detects amplitude {{variations in the}} radio waves at a particular frequency, then amplifies changes in the signal voltage to operate a loudspeaker or earphone. However, the simplicity of AM transmission also makes it vulnerable to [...] "static" [...] (radio noise, radio frequency interference) created by both natural atmospheric electrical activity such as lightning, and electrical and electronic equipment, including fluorescent lights, motors and <b>vehicle</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b> In large urban centres, AM radio signals can be severely disrupted by metal structures and tall buildings. As a result, AM radio tends to do best in areas where FM frequencies are in short supply, or in thinly populated or mountainous areas where FM coverage is poor. Great {{care must be taken}} to avoid mutual interference between stations operating on the same frequency. In general, an AM transmission needs to be about 20 times stronger than an interfering signal to avoid a reduction in quality, in contrast to FM signals, where the [...] "capture effect" [...] means that the dominant signal needs to only be about twice as strong as the interfering one.|$|R

Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to ferrous metal objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of ferrous metal combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>ignition</b> and charging <b>systems</b> generally result in significant compass errors.|$|R

It is very surprising that the death caused by the non-moving vehicle keep increasing even though the awareness campaign on the safety of children in non-moving vehicle were carried out by government. The methods that were introduced by previous researchers to detect the present {{of the children in}} the unattended vehicle such as the usage of capacitive sensor, microwave sensor, pressure sensor and image sensor have yet to be effective to reduce the number of death in the unattended vehicle. Thus, the research is carried out to provide a comprehensive child detection and feedback system in unattended vehicle by combining the usage of human physiological signals such as voice and body odor with temperature and motion detection systems. The system will integrate all the detection signals and then provide the efficient feedback system by triggering vehicle alarm system and sending message to parents.

The {{results show that the}} free piston Stirling hydraulic system with a two speed transmission has a combined fuel economy nearly twice that of the 1980 spark ignition engine - 21. 5 versus 10. 9 km/liter (50. 7 versus 25. 6 mpg) under comparable conditions. The fuel economy improvement over the 1984 spark ignition engine was 81 percent. The fuel economy sensitivity of the Stirling hydraulic system to system weight, number of transmission shifts, accumulator pressure ratio and maximum pressure, auxiliary power requirements, braking energy recovery, and varying vehicle performance requirements are considered. An important finding is that a multispeed transmission is not required. The penalty for a single speed versus a two speed transmission is about a 12 percent drop in combined fuel economy to 19. 0 km/liter (44. 7 mpg).

Measured parameters were the ignition time, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) run-up distance, DDT times, and Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) velocity. Mixed with air, three fuels, i. e., aviation gasoline, ethylene, and hydrogen, were tested at various initial pressures and equivalence ratios. An aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was employed, along with two plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> to quantify the benefits of each.
