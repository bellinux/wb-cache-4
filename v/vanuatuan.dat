5|$|Vanuatu's {{delegation}} {{left for}} Beijing on August 4; the delegation encompassed {{one of the}} three Olympians, as well as coaches Denison Tari, Sun Hongyi, and Anolyn Lulu; VASANOC president Joe Carlo; and VASANOC secretary general Seru Korikalo. <b>Vanuatuan</b> dignitaries, including the head of state, prime minister, and the minister of sports, also accompanied the team to attend the opening ceremony on August 8. Table tennis player Priscila Tommy and athlete Moses Kamut, the other two <b>Vanuatuan</b> qualifiers, did not accompany the <b>Vanuatuan</b> delegation to Beijing. Tommy arrived in China early for training, while Kamut spent time in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the three}} <b>Vanuatuan</b> Olympians progressed past the first round in their events, and thus did not earn any medals.|$|E
5|$|Priscilla Tommy won the Samsung Scholarship, {{which allowed}} her the {{financial}} backing {{she needed to}} participate in the Beijing games. Tommy was also selected by the Tripartite Commission on May 11, 2008, alongside Marcelo Aguirre of Paraguay. She was the only <b>Vanuatuan</b> participant in Olympian table tennis during the 2008 Summer Olympics. During the preliminary rounds on August 17, Priscilla Tommy was paired with Eva Ódorová of Slovakia, who she faced on the thirteenth of fourteen matches that took place that day. Tommy lost to Ódorová with a 4–0 record, and did not advance to the August 20 matches.|$|E
50|$|Vanuatu {{competed in}} the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland from 23 July - 3 August 2014. A team of 12 athletes in 2 sports are {{representing}} the country. Participating in their ninth Commonwealth Games, <b>Vanuatuans</b> have never yet won a medal.|$|R
5|$|Vanuatu {{has participated}} in the Olympics since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea; its Olympic {{committee}} (VASANOC) was founded a year earlier. Vanuatu's appearance at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, thus, marked its sixth appearance in the summer Olympics. Although Vanuatu's earlier Olympic appearances were primarily characterized by people participating in athletics (with {{the exception of the}} 2000 Summer Olympics, which included an archer), the 2008 Vanuatu team involved the country's debut in Olympic table tennis. Other <b>Vanuatuans</b> attempted Olympic qualification competitions in girl's beach volleyball, men's football, and taekwondo, but did not succeed.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{expansion}} of human sociality and cooperation beyond kith and kin remains an important evolutionary puzzle. There is likely a complex web of processes including institutions, norms, and practices that contributes to this phenomenon. Considerable evidence suggests that one such process involves certain components of religious systems that may have fostered {{the expansion}} of human cooperation {{in a variety of}} ways, including both certain forms of rituals and commitment to particular types of gods. Using an experimental economic game, our team specifically tested whether or not individually-held mental models of moralistic, punishing, and knowledgeable gods curb biases in favor of the self and the local community, and increase impartiality towards geographically distant anonymous co-religionists. Our sample includes 591 participants from eight diverse societies—Native Fijians who practice both Christianity and ancestor worship, the animist Hadza of Tanzania, Hindu Indo-Fijians, Hindu Mauritians, shamanist-Buddhist Tyvans of southern Siberia, traditional Inland and Christian Coastal <b>Vanuatuans</b> from Tanna, and Christian Brazilians from Pesqueiro. In this article, we present cross-cultural evidence that addresses this question and discuss the implications and limitations of our project. This volume also offers detailed, site-specific reports to provide further contextualization at the local level...|$|R
5|$|There were no {{casualties}} as {{a result}} of Xavier. In the Solomon Islands, communications to the Temotu province were lost. When communications were restored on October 24, it was reported that there was only minor tree damage on the islands of Utupua and Vanikolo. On Tikopia, crops sustained damage, though the effects were considered light given the circumstances. Strong and gusty winds, rough seas and moderate to heavy swells were reported within the eastern <b>Vanuatuan</b> islands, however, no significant damage was reported within the islands.|$|E
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Fijian {{archipelago}} of islands, Cyclone Gene moved towards the west across the South Pacific, towards Vanuatu, and was predicted {{to affect the}} archipelago between January 31 and February 2. However, during January 31, the system started to re-curve towards the southeast {{and as a result}} did not make landfall on the island, but Gene's outerbands produced gale force winds and heavy rain on various southern <b>Vanuatuan</b> islands for about 12 hours. However the system only caused no deaths and severe damage to Futuna island, while sparing other nearby islands. On Futuna Island, Gene caused damages to buildings, Plants used for weaving and generating income, trails, native and non native homes, waterlines, food gardens, food producing plants, crops, and other critical structures and littered footpaths with fallen trees and debris. As a result of damages to waterlines from falling debris, flooding and contaminated drinking water were reported in some villages with pipes openly leaking. After an aerial survey found that more than 70% of garden crops had been damaged by Gene, the Vanuatu Government declared Futuna island a disaster zone.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, the JTWC {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about 1145km (710mi) {{to the northwest}} of Suva, Fiji. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further in an area of low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21. Over {{the next couple of days}}, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the <b>Vanuatuan</b> islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, the system started to move towards the south-southeast.|$|E
25|$|At {{this stage}} as the cyclone was moving towards the {{southwest}} it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards {{the southeast and}} subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause gale force winds in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600UTC {{the next day and}} starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several <b>Vanuatuan</b> and Fijian islands. These islands included Viti Levu where a possible tornado destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the <b>Vanuatuan</b> island of Ambrym, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of {{the system}} {{impacting}} Vanuatu, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Council issued various tropical cyclone alerts to warn residents about the approaching cyclone, which included a red alert for the Maewo, Pentecost and Ambae islands. Because of the upcoming cyclone the national radio station extended its programming to run throughout the night of January 5–6. Vanautu's domestic airline Vanair closed its airfields in the northern islands and cancelled all of its flights except for several direct flights between Santo Island and Port Vila {{the capital city of}} Vanuatu. All ships and small boats were advised to seek refuge due to the high seas and swells that were expected from Susan. However, during January 7, Susan moved south-eastwards and the Fijian islands and spared Vanuatu a direct hit. Despite being spared a direct hit, heavy rain and gale force winds caused minor damage to several <b>Vanuatuan</b> Islands, including on Ambrym Island, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with. After the alerts were cancelled on January 7, by the National Disaster Management Council, most shops and government buildings on Efate island kept their shutters up because Cyclone Katrina was predicted to directly affect the archipelago within a few days.|$|E
500|$|Vanuatu competed at the [...] 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. A {{total of}} three <b>Vanuatuan</b> athletes competed in two sports. Moses Kamut and Elis Lapenmal competed in, respectively, the men's and women's 100m sprints, and Priscilla Tommy competed in women's singles table tennis after being {{selected}} by the IOC's Tripartite Commission. Tommy's appearance in particular was Vanuatu's debut into table tennis. Tommy was also the country's flagbearer during the opening ceremony. The <b>Vanuatuan</b> delegation to Beijing included the country's head of state and prime minister, but only included Elis Lapenmal; the other two athletes did not accompany the delegation and arrived in China at different times.|$|E
500|$|Tropical Cyclone Lisa {{moved into}} the South Pacific from the Australian region during May 11, while it was a Category 2 {{tropical}} cyclone with sustained wind speeds of 110km/h (75mph). Over {{the next couple of}} days, Lisa moved south-eastwards and passed in between the <b>Vanuatuan</b> islands of Tanna and Anatom as it gradually weakened and lost its tropical cyclone characteristics. Lisa's remnants subsequently started to deepen during May 14, under the influence of an upper level mid latitude trough and reached a secondary peak intensity of 100km/h (65mph). Over the next few days the system continued to move towards the southeast while slowly weakening until it was last noted dissipating about [...] to the east of Wellington, New Zealand. There were no reports of any significant damage associated with Lisa in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu or the Solomon Islands.|$|E
500|$|Early on November 15, TCWC Nadi {{reported}} that Vania {{had become a}} category two tropical cyclone with peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of between , while the JTWC reported peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 110km/h (70mph) which made it equivalent to a tropical storm. Later that day Vania passed near or over several of the <b>Vanuatuan</b> islands as it continued to move towards the south— southwest, and started to weaken as it encountered a higher amount of vertical windshear. During the following day, TCWC Nadi {{reported that}} Vania had weakened into a category one tropical cyclone as the systems low level circulation stalled, before it turned and started to move westwards while located {{to the north of}} New Caledonia. During November 17, as the system had become sheared the JTWC issued their final advisory on Vania, before the systems remnant low level circulation was last noted by TCWC Nadi and the JTWC during November 19, while it was located about [...] to the west of Port Vila, Vanuatu. Only minor damage to crops and bush houses was reported to have occurred in the archipelago while no deaths were reported. As a result of Vania affecting parts of Vanuatu during November 15, voting in provincial elections had to be extended by 24 hours.|$|E
