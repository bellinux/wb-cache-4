In this report <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations with {{the rated power}} 4 MVA and below has been studied. Models of the stations are modeled and analyzed in PSCAD/EMTDC to study the high voltage transients that are created after current chopping with <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> may chop the current before it reaches zero value, which means that high voltage transients can be created. The equipment of the stations can be destroyed by high voltage transients. The purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} use of <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> in small-scale hydropower stations and the risk for high voltage transients from current chopping. According to the results there is a risk of high voltage transients after current chopping with small synchronous generators in stations with the operating voltages 0. 4 kV and 3. 6 kV. When the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> is placed on the high voltage side of the transformer the risk increases of high voltages transients and reignitions due to the low capacitance of the transformer. The conclusions is that high voltage transients occurs when the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> chops the current at a high chopping level in stations where the synchronous generator rated power is low, high rated voltage and a small capacitance. The risks of high voltage transients in small-scale hydropower stations can be reduced with surge arrester, RC-circuits or protective capacitors. The report is written in Swedish...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Switching {{transients}} {{associated with}} circuit breakers {{have been observed}} for many years. With the widespread applica-tion of vacuum breakers for transformer switching, recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit breaker switching of electric arc furnace and ladle melt furnace (LMF) transformers raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> exhibits virtual current chop and multiple re-ignitions.

40|$|The vacuum {{switching}} technology is preferred {{used in the}} medium voltage level due to its high reliability, {{the high number of}} switching operations, its free-maintenance as well as its long term durability. Contrary to gas-insulated switches, the contact surface of a <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> has a substantial influence on the withstand voltage. Charge carriers, escaped from the contacts due to an electrical field stress, will be accelerated in the contact gap, whereas the absorbed energy could not be reduced significantly, because of the marginal number of collisions. Caused by the impact on the contact surface, additional charge carriers may be generated with a subsequent breakdown. The required withstand voltage of a <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker</b> is reached by a conditioning of the metallic surfaces inside the <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breaker.</b> A mechanical handling alone is not sufficient. All established procedures for conditioning <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> to reach a required withstand voltage use current limited breakdowns to remove emission centers which are the origin of a breakdown. In this work, a conditioning process for industrial type <b>vacuum</b> circuit <b>breakers</b> is investigated, using high-frequency currents in the kHz-range. Due to high current rises before and high voltage rises after a current interruption during a current zero crossing, a reignition of a vacuum insulation can be enforced. On the one hand the high-frequency conditioning process has been evaluated if the required lightning impulse withstand voltage can be reached reliably, on the other hand it has been investigated, how far the lightning impulse withstand voltage can be increased beyond it. It is investigated, to what extend the voltage and current distribution, measured during a high frequency conditioning process, can be used to specify the reached lightning impulse withstand voltage. The conditioning process is successful only, if every critical emission centre is removed. Therefore the spatial distribution of the arcs is an important information for the evaluation of the conditioning process. Here, a circuit breaker model is used for optical investigations of the conditioning arcs. The surfaces of the contacts are investigated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy...|$|R

The search for an alternative insulation gas is driven by the well known extreme global warming potential of SF 6.

40|$|The {{function}} of the suppression-chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers is to relieve vacuum in the drywell. There are four vacuum breakers located outside the primary containment which form {{an extension of the}} primary containment boundary. The vacuum relief valves are mounted in special piping between the drywell and the suppression chamber, which allow air and steam flow from the suppression chamber to the drywell when the drywell is at a negative pressure with respect to the suppression chamber. Therefore, suppression chamber-to-drywell vacuum breakers prevent an excessive negative differential pressure across the wetwell drywell boundary. Each <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> is a self actuating valve with one <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker</b> in each line. Manual isolation valves are located on each side of each <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaker.</b> A negative differential pressure across the drywell wall is caused by rapid depressurization of the drywell. Events that cause this rapid depressurization are cooling cycles, inadvertent drywell spray actuation, and steam condensation from sprays or subcooled water reflood of a break {{in the event of a}} primary system rupture. Cooling cycles result in minor pressure transients in the drywell that occur slowly and are normally controlled by heating and ventilation equipment. Spray actuation or spill of subcooled water out of a break results in more significant pressure transients and becomes important in sizing the vacuum breakers. In the event of a primary system rupture, steam condensation within the drywell results in the most severe pressure transient. Following a primary system rupture, air in the drywell is purged into the suppression chamber free airspace, leaving the drywell full of steam. Subsequent condensation of the steam can be caused in two possible ways, namely, Emergency Core Cooling Systems flow from a recirculation line break, or drywell spray actuation following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These two cases determine the maximum depressurization rate of the drywell...|$|E
