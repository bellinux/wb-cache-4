Experiments which vary sugars, lipases, vegetable oils, emulsifiers, temperature and water content are reported. The solubility of the sugars in oil and their stereochemistry were important factors in the success of these experiments. ^ High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) methods are described for separating sucrose monostearate isomers. The HPLC procedure provides baseline separation of purified monoester isomers into three main peaks at room temperature, and completely separates monoesters with different acyl chain lengths (C 14, C 16, C 18). The TLC method separates up to six of the eight possible positional monostearate isomers, which can be further differentiated by specific color development with a <b>visualizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Isomers collected from HPLC were subjected to treatment with invertase, then resolved and detected by TLC to determine fatty acid substitution patterns on the sucrose molecule. ^ A method is described for the conversion of sucrose esters exhibiting a high degree of acylation to sucrose esters which are mono or disubstituted. This is accomplished by chemically catalyzed transfer of acyl functions from a highly acylated sucrose ester molecule to the hydroxyl groups of free sucrose. This chemical transesterification system was studied under various reaction conditions to find the optimal conditions for the highest yield of sucrose monoester production. ^ A purification system is described which utilizes a two-solvent system, ethanol-water, to precipitate the sucrose esters in the initial step of purification, directly from the reaction solvent. This method removes the sucrose and other unreacted starting materials, color and odor resulting from decomposed starting reactants. This purification system does not require prior distillation of the reaction solvent, pH adjustment or the addition of acids or salts.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} and its connecting subchondral {{bone plate}} are main compartments that {{play an important}} role in proper mechanical functioning of diarthrodial joints. However, in ageing and osteoarthritis structural changes propagate in these tissues, which impairs them for proper functioning. One way to characterize the structural alterations during different stages of degeneration and disease is to perform solute transport tests in an experimental set-up and quantify the parameters such as diffusivity and permeability that represent the quality of the tissue. Therefore, common imaging techniques to investigate diffusion across cartilage have been reviewed and suggestions to select appropriate tools to determine diffusion parameters were made. The primary aim of this thesis is to setup a set of experiments that can capture the transport properties of cartilage and its underlying bone. To this end we designed experiments that used contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography to measure diffusion through cartilage and subchondral bone and applied computational models of these experiments to quantify the physical parameters such as diffusivity and permeability of the tissues concerned. The individual role of the bath osmolality, concentration and solute’s charge on the diffusion in articular cartilage was successfully studied and solute’s charge was identified as the dominant factor. Biphasic-solute and multiphasic finite element models were subsequently developed to precisely simulate the transport of neutral and charged solutes in various cartilage zones, respectively. As the cartilage-bone interface experiences morphological alterations after joint degeneration and during progression of osteoarthritis, characterization of the transport properties of the interface becomes of paramount importance. Therefore, experiments based on contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography were first conducted and a correlation was found between the extent of diffusion and the micro-architecture of the subchondral bone plate and articular cartilage. Multi-zone biphasic-solute finite element models then assisted in determination of diffusion coefficients in different cartilage layers and the subchondral bone plate. To identify the pathways between cartilage and bone responsible for transport, focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy imaging was employed. Using the 3 D data of the pore structure at the osteochondral interface and with the aid of advanced pore-network modeling, the diffusive and permeability attributes of the extracellular matrices were successfully determined. The next theme of this thesis was to assess the effects of collagen fibril conformation under different environmental osmotic pressure on advanced non-enzymatic glycation, a process, responsible for cartilage deterioration during ageing. Sugars were added under different external bath osmotic pressures to study the glycation process when collagen fibrils are either stretched or shrunk. Using micro-indentation, biochemical assays, contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography and cartilage surface colorimetry, the stretching of the collagen fibrils was found to minimize the degenerative effects of sugar-induced glycation. The author believes that the current findings contribute to solve the yet-challenging physico-chemical problems involved in the cartilage and its related joint disease. The current work will lead to new techniques that aim to not only understand the fundamental physico-chemical aspects of cartilage, but also might suggest methods for efficient delivery of drugs into the cartilage tissue and <b>visualizing</b> <b>agents</b> that could better follow and diagnose joint disease...|$|R

The author has developed a prototype visualization to test these claims and preliminary user responses are included...|$|R
40|$|An {{abundance}} of geospatial information is flourishing on the Internet but mining and disseminating these data is a daunting task. With anything {{published on the}} web {{available to the public}} it has become a grand repository of volunteered geographic information (VGI). Internet users often provide location information for videos, pictures, travel destinations, or other events. All of these data can be gathered by a web crawling geospatial agent that later performs geospatial data mining. The discovered geoinformation can be stored, analyzed, queried, and <b>visualized</b> as the <b>agent</b> creates a data repository of what it discovered. This paper presents the design and prototypical implementation of the GEDMWA (Geospatial Exploratory Data Mining Web Agent). It reads webpage data and follows links to acquire knowledge in order to add value to geoinformation usable in a GIS. The agent creates a database of webpage text, mines it for location information, and then converts it to proper geospatial data format. The data is quickly visualized and analyzed after GEDMWA converts it into proper GIS and virtual globe formats. This provides diverse user communities a tool that utilizes a variety of distributed sources to discover additional knowledge about their fields of interest...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{clinical}} imaging is {{an emerging}} technology, which improves disease diagnosis by combining already existing technologies. With {{the combination of}} high-resolution morphological imaging, i. e., MRI/CT, and high-sensitive molecular detection offered by SPECT/PET/Optical, physicians can detect disease progression {{at an early stage}} and design patient-specific treatments. To fully exploit the possibilities of hybrid imaging a hybrid probe compatible with each imaging technology is required. Here, we present a hybrid nanoprobe for triple modality MR/SPECT/Fluorescence imaging. Our imaging agent is comprised of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), labeled with 99 mTc and an Alexa fluorophore (AF), together forming 99 mTc-AF-SPIONs. The agent was stable in human serum, and, after subcutaneous injection in the hind paw of Wistar rats, showed to be highly specific by accumulating in the sentinel lymph node. All three modalities clearly <b>visualized</b> the imaging <b>agent.</b> Our results show that a single imaging agent can be used for hybrid imaging. The use of a single hybrid contrast agent permits simultaneous hybrid imaging and, more conventionally, allow for single modality imaging at different time points. For example, a hybrid contrast agent enables pre-operative planning, intra-operative guidance, and post-operative evaluation with the same contrast agent...|$|R
40|$|In the United States in the 1930 s, {{although}} the pathogen was not known, atypical pneumonia was clinically distinguished from pneumococcal pneumonia by its resistance to sulfonamides. In 1938, Reimann reported seven patients {{with an unusual}} form of tracheobronchopneumonia and severe constitutional symptoms. He believed the clinical picture of this disease differed {{from that of the}} disease caused by influenza viruses or known bacteria and instead suspected primary atypical pneumonia. For many years, the responsible infectious agent was tentatively classified as a filterable virus that could pass through a Seitz filter to remove bacteria and was reported to be a psittacosis-like or new virus. After that, in the early 1940 s, Eaton et al. identified an agent that was the principal cause of primary atypical pneumonia using cotton rats, hamsters, and chick embryos. Eaton and colleagues did not perform an inoculation study in human volunteers. During the 1940 s, there were three groups engaged in discovering the etiology of the primary atypical pneumonia. 1) Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases directed by John Dingle 2) Dr Monroe Eaton’s group, the Virus Research Laboratory of the California State Public Health Department, 3) The Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research directed by Horsfall. During 1940 s, the members of the Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases concluded that the bacteria-free filtrates obtained from the patients, presumably containing a virus, could induce primary atypical pneumonia in human volunteers via Pinehurst trials. During 1950 s, serological approaches for identification of the Eaton agent developed such as Fluorescent-Stainable Antibody, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1960 s, the Eaton agent successfully grew in media, and finally accepted as a cause of primary atypical pneumonia. Thus, technical difficulties with <b>visualizing</b> the <b>agent</b> and failure to recognize the full significance of the Pinehurst transmission experiments　resulted in a lapse of 20 years before acceptance of the Eaton agent as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This review describes the history of M. pneumoniae pneumonia with a special focus on the recognition between the 1930 s and 1960 s of the Eaton agent as the infectious cause. Key words: Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia, Eaton agent, Pinehurst trials, primary atypical pneumonia, histor...|$|R
40|$|Radiolabeled {{chemotactic}} peptides {{have been}} studied for their applicability to the visualization of infectious and inflammatory foci. Because a radiolabeled leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) antagonist allowed visualization of intramuscular E. coli abscesses in rab-bits {{within a few hours}} after injection, we decided to test the imaging characteristics of this agent in a more clinically relevant model of pulmonary aspergillosis. The pharmacokinetics and imaging characteristics of the 111 In-labeled LTB 4 antagonist DPC 11870 were studied in New Zealand White rabbits with experimental pulmonary aspergillosis infection. The imaging characteristics of 111 In-DPC 11870 were compared with those of 67 Ga-citrate, a radiopharmaceutical commonly used to detect pulmonary infections in patients. Methods: Pulmonary aspergil-losis was induced in the left lung of rabbits by intratracheal inoculation of 1 108 conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus. Three days after the inoculation, the rabbits received 111 In-DPC 11870 or 67 Ga-citrate intravenously. Images were acquired at several time points up to 24 h after injection. Results: Pulmonary as-pergillosis was <b>visualized</b> with both <b>agents.</b> Images acquired after injection of 111 In-DPC 11870 showed uptake in the pulmo-nary lesions from 6 h after injection. Because of accumulation at the site of infection and clearance from the background, the images improved with time. Region-of-interest analysis at 24 h after injection revealed infected lung–to–normal lung ratios of 5. 0 1. 5 for 111 In-DPC 11870 and 2. 9 0. 6 for 67 Ga-citrate. Conclusion: The radiolabeled LTB 4 antagonist DPC 11870 clearly delineated experimentally induced pulmonary aspergil-losis in rabbits. Images acquired at 24 h after injection of 111 In-DPC 11870 were superior to those obtained after injection o...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound {{mediated}} {{drug delivery}} {{is an important}} tool {{in the fight against}} cancer. A new concept called Acoustic Cluster Therapy (ACT) is under development, and two pilot imaging studies have been performed on prostate cancer xenografts in mice. A large amount of raw ultrasound data has been recorded, but existing software can not perform the required image processing. The ACT concept is based on clusters of microbubbles and microdroplets. When exposed to diagnostic ultrasound, the microdroplets become microbubbles. This phase-shift from liquid to gas is followed by a microbubble growth to 30 μm. These phase-shift bubbles get stuck in the small capillaries of the tumor vasculature. A complete program has been developed in MATLAB® to process the raw ultrasound data. The program is tailored to the unique properties of the phase-shift bubbles, and is able to reduce noise and motion artefacts, to <b>visualize</b> the contrast <b>agent,</b> and to count the number of ultrasound activated phase-shift bubbles. The program produces high quality videos, displaying both free flowing contrast agent and identified, stuck phase-shift bubbles. The program was validated against a synthesized data set, and we found that the program counted accurately up to 2 bubbles/mm 2. A saturation was experienced above this threshold, and too few bubbles were counted. The program was applied to a data set of 16 tumors, divided into four groups based on different ACT cluster dose and activation ultrasound settings. A significant difference (p = 0. 023) was found between the different doses, while no significant difference (p = 0. 146) was found between the different activation ultrasound settings. There was neither a correlation between the tumor size and the number of stuck phase-shift bubbles. The results show very good correlation with the resultss obtained from manual counting...|$|R
