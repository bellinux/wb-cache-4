25|$|Gashing {{was first}} used to rough out worm wheels using a <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> but then {{dedicated}} gashers were built to rough out other types of gears. Because the processes is carried out on two different machines the process differs.|$|R
50|$|Slab mills {{are used}} either by {{themselves}} or in gang milling operations on manual horizontal or <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> to machine large broad surfaces quickly. They have been superseded {{by the use}} of cemented carbide-tipped face mills which are then used in vertical <b>mills</b> or <b>machining</b> centres.|$|R
25|$|The {{process is}} similar to that {{outlined}} for the <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> except a gashing angle is not used. When gashing spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction. If a helical gear is being roughed out, then the table rotates and moves along the vertical axis to interpolate the helical path.|$|R
25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines,</b> {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Camshaft is a {{key part}} of heavy duty diesel engine. The {{conventional}} process applies the profiling modeling grinders and <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> to manufacture the cam. The weaknesses of this process include unstable cam profilogram, low accuracy, low flexibility, long product cycle and undesirable adaptability. To solve these problems, M 40 turn-milling centre and CN 320 cam grinder are applied to upgrade the process. Compared with the conventional process, the improved process has evident advantages such as higher machining accuracy, surface quality and efficiency. And the compatibility with diverse product category was greatly promoted...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSelf-excited or chatter {{vibrations}} {{are well}} known among <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> builders and users. Nowadays, chatter {{is one of the}} most important restrictions of the milling process. Self-excited vibrations prevent obtaining the required accuracy in workpiece, reducing the lifetime of the cutter and the mechanical components of the machine. Due to chatter vibrations, the dynamic stiffness of the structure of the <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> limits the productivity in steel and cast iron roughing. Hence the stability of this kind of process is an indirect way to measure the dynamic stiffness of the design. This paper presents different stability models and proposes the most suitable for the determination of the cutting performance of <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machines.</b> Finally the cutting performance and the dynamic behaviour of the <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> is determined combining the measurements of the dynamic stiffness of the structure, the stability models, cutting tests and modal analysis...|$|R
50|$|The {{meeting with}} Bannow {{was the start}} of a {{successful}} partnership. The two began by producing electric hedge clippers. After much hard work, their first <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> was built in 1932. By 1936, their company was called the Bridgeport Pattern and Model Works and was offering milling heads (the part of a mill where the spindle is) commercially. The American Precision Museum's biography of Rudolph Bannow reports that he conceived the iconic Bridgeport ram-and-turret, knee-and-column design in 1936 as the logical machine on which to mount the milling head already being built by the company. In 1938 they began selling whole <b>milling</b> <b>machines.</b> The company had now established itself as a machine tool builder named Bridgeport Machines, Inc. After getting into this business line, the company started to become very successful.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present work {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} getting friction surfaced coatings on different combinations of consumable rods and non-ferrous substrates. Aluminium (AA 1050 A), Copper, Stainless Steel (AISI 304), Mild Steel were used as substrates and commercially pure Copper and Stainless Steel (AISI 304) were used as consumable rods. Friction surfacing was carried out using these consumable rods and substrate combinations with a conventional <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> FNU 2213. The investigation revealed that certain combinations metallurgically bonded coating is formed quickly over the substrate while with certain other combinations, this coating is formed {{with the assistance of}} a start-up plate. However, for a certain combination of parameters, no coating is formed whatsoever. The formation of coating is influenced by the coefficient of friction as well as material properties, such as, thermal conductivity and stability at high temperature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{need for}} very precise {{measurements}} has emerged with evolution of automatic and CNC machine tools. Precision and accuracy are amongst main requests on modern machine tools. To define and know this characteristic of machine tools standard measuring procedures {{have been used}} for many years. Yet, others more advanced approaches and equipments, like laser measuring systems, are also available for measuring machine parameters like straightness of movements, repeatability, surfaces flatness, parallelism etc. This paper shows comparison of measuring results and measuring procedure between two different laser measuring systems, Damalini D 525 and Renishaw ML 10. Measurements are performed on DMU monoBlock 60, CNC <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> Same type of measurements, straightness measurement of main shaft movement in Y direction, is performed simultaneously by means of both of the laser systems. Results presented in this paper shows that there are differences in between measuring results as well as in between measuring procedures for selected lasers. Hence, the correct choice of measuring device in that sense can save time and decrease costs of machine maintenance. Index Terms—Laser, laser application, measurements I...|$|R

40|$|Flank wear is a {{critical}} phenomenon which has direct impact on quality of surface finish, dimensional precision and ultimately cost of the finished product. In any metal cutting operation, cutting tool wear estimation will help in identifying tool state, which is {{a critical}} factor in productivity. In this paper, the vibration signals are used for detecting flank wear in face milling. The vibration signals are analyzed using a novel non linear technique called recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA includes time delay and dimensions embedding process so as to reconstruct the time series data of vibration signal, to obtain better information of the changes in nonlinear dynamics underlying the milling process. An investigation of this technique was carried out to see its capability in detecting flank wear in face milling. Experiments were conducted on <b>universal</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> using AISI H 11 steel as work material. The investigation proved that RQA technique has a good potential in detecting flank wear in face milling. The RQA parameters such as percent recurrence (REC), trapping time (TT), percent laminarity (LAM) and entropy (ENT), and also the recurrence plots color patterns for different flank wear, can be used in detecting insert wear in face milling...|$|R
