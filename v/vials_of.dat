5|$|Government {{officials}} {{stood on}} trucks, using loudspeakers {{to call out}} above the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily high school and university students who had arrived on bicycles — to disperse. The announcements were met by jeers when the government spokesperson blamed the unrest on the Vietcong. At 18:30, the military personnel at the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalized for chemical injuries. The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to the apparent use of poison gas, and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diệm.|$|E

50|$|Originally, <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life kits {{came with}} a plastic vial (empty pill bottle or other container). The vial would be labeled with a <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life decal, and the {{completed}} medical information form would be placed inside. These plastic vials tend {{to get lost in}} the refrigerator, pushed towards the back of it over time and can prove hard to find for emergency crews. Nowadays, most programs (including the <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life Project AKA <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life.com) ask patients to place their completed medical form inside of a plastic Ziploc bag. This bag will go {{on the front of the}} refrigerator with a <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life decal on it. While there are a few ways for this information to be kept in the home, this is the most common.|$|R
5|$|Though Green was {{caring for}} Farrar {{in the family}} home while he {{recovered}} from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. In her purse, he discovered seed packets labeled as castor beans, {{a copy of a}} supposedly-anonymous letter that had been sent to Farrar urging him to not divorce Green, and empty <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> potassium chloride.

5|$|Sarah disguises {{herself as}} Katja and gains {{entrance}} to her {{hotel room in}} order to find Katja's briefcase. The room has been ransacked by the time she arrives but a hotel employee gives her the briefcase, which had been left with security. Inside the briefcase Sarah finds medical images, <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> blood, and evidence of more lookalikes, including a woman named Alison Hendrix, whose address is written on a note. Believing Alison to be the woman on the phone, Sarah drives to her address and follows her van to a soccer field, where she discovers that Alison is another of her lookalikes. Alison confronts Sarah, assuming that she is Beth, and refuses to believe Sarah when she explains that Beth killed herself, telling her to leave and wait for another call.|$|E
5|$|Thiomersal (also spelled thimerosal, {{especially}} in the United States) is an organomercury compound used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Following a mandated review of mercury-containing food and drugs in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine makers to remove thiomersal from vaccines {{as quickly as possible}} as a precautionary measure, and it was rapidly phased out of most U.S. and European vaccines. It is still used in all multi-dose <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> flu vaccines in the U.S. In the context of perceived increased autism rates and increased number of vaccines in the childhood vaccination schedule, some parents believed the action to remove thiomersal was an indication that the preservative caused autism.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Jeff Miller {{turned the}} program into a California Public Charity (which later gained 501(c)(3) status) called the <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life Project.

It also supplies many Red Cross Chapters, governmental agencies, hospitals, pharmacies, senior centers, Eagle Scout projects, municipalities, etc. with free <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life Kits or discounted decals for those needing mass quantities. For 32 years Jeff Miller’s organizations have utilized and improved this program, donating over 3 million <b>Vial</b> <b>of</b> Life kits.

5|$|Rona's {{methods were}} also used {{as part of the}} {{experiments}} conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments {{to determine the effects of}} human exposure to radiation. Early in her career, she had been exposed to the dangers of radium. Rona's requests for protective gas masks were denied, as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure. She purchased protective gear with her own money, not believing there was no danger. When <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated, Rona was convinced her mask had saved her. Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris, when Joliot-Curie died, emphasizing the risk of radium-related anemia. In her 1978 book about her experiences, Rona wrote about the damage to bones, hands, and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity. Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection, she noted that their thumbs, forefingers, and ring fingers were often damaged. The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for.|$|E

25|$|Thimerosal is a mercury-containing {{antimicrobial}} that {{is added}} to <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> vaccine that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination and growth of potentially harmful bacteria.

Conversely, in the animated series, Von Reichter's creations carry glowing <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> Sustenance with them, which Cybersix would open and drink.|$|E

25|$|Bioindicators {{can also}} be used to {{independently}} confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat resistant microbe Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside glassine envelopes.

Despite this, the water is itself a strong symbol of devotion for Lourdes pilgrims, and many buy statues and rosary beads containing small <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> it, and take home large plastic containers of it.|$|E
25|$|No one {{suspected}} Cullen was murdering {{patients at}} St. Luke's Hospital until a co-worker found <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> medication, some used, some not, in a disposal bin. The drugs were not valuable outside {{the hospital and}} were not used by recreational drug users, so their theft seemed curious. An investigation showed that Cullen had taken the medication. He was offered a deal by the medical facility: resign {{and he would be}} given a neutral recommendation, or he would be fired. He resigned and was escorted from the building in June 2002. Seven of Cullen's co-workers at St. Luke's later met with the Lehigh County district attorney to alert authorities to their suspicions that Cullen had used drugs to kill patients. Investigators never looked into Cullen's past, and the case was dropped nine months later due to lack of evidence.|$|E
25|$|Morris Kharasch, {{a chemist}} at the University of Maryland, filed a patent {{application}} for thiomersal in 1927; Eli Lilly later marketed the compound under the trade name Merthiolate. In vitro tests conducted by Lilly investigators H. M. Powell and W. A. Jamieson {{found that it}} was forty to fifty times as effective as phenol against Staphylococcus aureus. It was used to kill bacteria and prevent contamination in antiseptic ointments, creams, jellies, and sprays used by consumers and in hospitals, including nasal sprays, eye drops, contact lens solutions, immunoglobulins, and vaccines. Thiomersal was used as a preservative (bactericide) so that multidose <b>vials</b> <b>of</b> vaccines could be used instead of single-dose vials, which are more expensive. By 1938, Lilly's assistant director of research listed thiomersal as one of the five most important drugs ever developed by the company.|$|E
