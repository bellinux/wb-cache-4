5|$|By mintages, the {{key dates}} {{in this series}} are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been {{extensively}} melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate. For example, although more than nine million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, {{second only to the}} 1953-S in price in that grade.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|In January 2003, Raël held a {{ceremony}} {{at which he}} thanked Boisselier for her service and anointed her as his successor. He praised her for spreading the message of Raëlism internationally while publicizing the cloning. In the Raëlian hierarchy, she is one level below Raël {{and serves as a}} spokesperson for the movement. As a leader, she has attempted to rehabilitate the swastika, one of the group's symbols. She maintains that it is <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> an ancient symbol of peace, and that it has been unfairly associated with Nazi Germany.|$|E

60|$|The month {{had been}} one of intense anxiety. Gradually stores of {{provisions}} had been conveyed into the hospital, as it was now called; the well inside the yard had been put into working order, and the residents had sent in stores of bedding and such portable <b>valuables</b> <b>as</b> could be removed.|$|R
5|$|Since 1894, the Naval War College {{had been}} formulating plans for war with Spain. By 1896, the Office of Naval Intelligence had {{prepared}} a plan which included {{military operations in}} Puerto Rican waters. Not only was Puerto Rico considered <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> a naval station, Puerto Rico and Cuba were also abundant in a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked: sugar.|$|E
5|$|Although little-used by passengers, Brill {{station was}} <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> a {{relatively}} rapid {{link between the}} dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.|$|E
5|$|Numerous notable and {{prominent}} {{people of the}} era, who held tickets for the westbound passage or were guests of those who held tickets, did not sail. Others were waiting in New York to board for the passage back to Plymouth, England, on the second leg of Titanics maiden voyage. Many unused tickets that survived, whether they were for the westbound passage or the return eastbound passage, have become quite <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> Titanic-related artifacts. Among those who held tickets for a passage, but did not actually sail, include: Theodore Dreiser, Henry Clay Frick, Milton S. Hershey, Guglielmo Marconi, John Pierpont Morgan, Edgar Selwyn, and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (who died in {{the sinking of the}} RMS Lusitania).|$|E

5000|$|In the Berber {{culture of}} Morocco, the Berber {{equivalent}} of [...] "mekhzen" [...] (warehouse) would be agadir. Berber tribes also considered the agadir (warehouse of the tribe's crops and <b>valuables)</b> <b>as</b> a powerhouse guarded and managed through a legal system.

5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} heavy {{emphasis on}} environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are <b>valuable,</b> <b>as</b> only limited numbers {{can be used in}} a round.|$|E
5|$|The {{various forms}} of the Victoria Cross are {{inherently}} <b>valuable,</b> <b>as</b> was highlighted on 24 July 2006, when at the auctionhouse Bonhams in Sydney, the VC which had been awarded to First World War soldier Captain Alfred Shout, fetched a world-record hammer price of $1 million. Shout had been awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in 1915 for hand-to-hand combat at the Lone Pine trenches in Gallipoli, Turkey. The buyer, Kerry Stokes, has lent it to the Australian War Memorial for display with the eight other Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians at Gallipoli. The Australian War Memorial in Canberra currently holds 66 Victoria Crosses, 63 awarded to Australians—including Mark Donaldson's Victoria Cross for Australia on loan—and three to British soldiers; this formed the largest publicly displayed collection in the world, until {{the opening of the}} Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) in London during November 2010, which displays the 168 VCs owned by Lord Ashcroft and 48 more held by the IWM.|$|E

50|$|Hiding {{behind a}} one-way mirror, Luther watches as Richmond becomes sexually violent towards Christy when he playfully slaps {{her across the}} face. When she retaliates by {{slapping}} him back, Richmond becomes angry and aggressively assaults her. When she attacks him with a letter opener in self-defense, Secret Service agents Bill Burton (Scott Glenn) and Tim Collin (Dennis Haysbert) shoot her to death. Chief of Staff Gloria Russell (Judy Davis) arrives and makes the scene appear as if a burglar killed Sullivan's wife. Luther escapes with some <b>valuables</b> <b>as</b> well as the bloody letter opener.|$|R

5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E
5|$|France {{controlled}} {{a number}} of trading harbours along the Indian coast including Mahé and Chandernagore, all governed from the larger port of Pondicherry. However, the strongest French position in the region was the isolated island of Île de France, later known as Mauritius, with its subordinate bases of Réunion and small settlements on Madagascar in the Seychelles and on Rodrigues. Île de France, centred on the capital Port Louis, had important commercial agricultural features and an economy dominated by African slave labour. The islands were only commercially viable when left ungarrisoned, and if any troops had to be supported or the islands came under blockade there were corresponding economic difficulties and food shortages. The island was most <b>valuable</b> <b>as</b> a naval base, situated in an ideal position for raiders to intercept British trade between Europe and the East Indies. The upheavals of the French Revolution had reached Île de France, with accusations against senior officials leading to arrests in 1792. The arrival of news that the French Convention had abolished slavery in August 1794 almost plunged the island into civil war, and only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented conflict.|$|E
