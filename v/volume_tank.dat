The rearing conditions tested seem to affect the pattern of lipid body depo- sition in broodstock fish of S. dumerili, increasing the muscle and liver triacylglycerides (TG) accu- mulation of fish kept under indoor conditions, probably due to reduced energy expenditure in swimming, with some variations in the fatty acid profile that may respond to the differences in the culture conditions tested. No significant differences were found for Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) or ovary lipid deposition between groups in this study, which may suggest that the conditions tested do not have a major effect on ovary devel- opment. However, one season later the females kept under outdoor conditions released eggs spontaneously, whereas those kept under indoor conditions did not spawn, suggesting that the conditions tested actually have an effect on the broodstock’s reproductive fitness.

The plant {{does not have}} a switchover to recirculation operation and, thus, requires a fully transient analysis of debris transport. To calculate the flow field in a practical computational time and reasonable accuracy, two-dimensional Shallow Water Equations are solved using the Finite Volume Method. An approximate Riemann solver, Harten-Laxvan Leer (HLL) scheme is used to capture dry-to-wet interface. To calculate the debris particle transport, a simple two-dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking model including a drag force is developed. Some efficient schemes are implemented to search a hosting cell, to determine the intersection of a particle trajectory with a cell side, and to find the reflected position of particle.

Lowering the tank operating pressure reduces the stress and therefore allows {{the walls of the}} tank to be thinner. Both the smaller tank volume and thinner tank wall results in an overall smaller and lighter vehicle with increased payload capability. The cryogenic propellant can be supercooled well below the normal boiling point temperature level by transporting the liquid propellant from the vehicle tanks to a ground based cooling unit which utilizes a combination of heat exchanger and compressor. The compressor lowers the coolant fluid bath pressure resulting in a low temperature boiling liquid which is subsequently used to cool the recirculating liquid. The cooled propellant is then returned to the vehicle propellant tank. In addition to reducing the vehicle size and weight the invention also allows location of the vent valve on the ground, elimination of on-board recirculation pumps or bleed systems, smaller and lighter engine pumps and valves, lighter and more stable ullage gas, and significant reduction in tank fill operation.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in propellants with non-toxic reaction products {{has led to}} a resurgence of {{interest in}} hydrogen peroxide for various propellant applications. Because peroxide is sensitive to contaminants, material interactions, stability and storage issues, monitoring decomposition rates is important. Stennis Space Center (SSC) uses thermocouples to monitor bulk fluid temperature (heat evolution) to determine reaction rates. Unfortunately, large temperature rises are required to offset the heat lost into the surrounding fluid. Also, tank penetration to accomodate a thermocouple can entail modification of a tank or line and act as a source of contamination. The paper evaluates a method for monitoring oxygen evolution as a means to determine peroxide stability. Oxygen generation is not only directly related to peroxide decomposition, but occurs immediately. Measuring peroxide temperature to monitor peroxide stability has significant limitations. The bulk decomposition of 1 % / week in a large <b>volume</b> <b>tank</b> can produce in excess of 30 cc / min. This oxygen flow rate corresponds to an equivalent temperature rise of approximately 14 millidegrees C, which is difficult to measure reliably. Thus, if heat transfer were included, there would be no temperature rise. Temperature changes from the surrounding environment and heat lost to the peroxide will also mask potential problems. The use of oxygen flow measurements provides an ultra sensitive technique for monitoring reaction events and will provide an earlier indication of an abnormal decomposition when compared to measuring temperature rise...|$|E

This paper presents {{a case study of}} rainwater tank evaluation and design for large roof areas, located in Melbourne, Australia, based on observed daily rainfall data representing three different climatic regimes (i. e. dry average, and wet years). With the aim of developing a comprehensive Decision Support Tool for the performance analysis and design of rainwater tanks, a simple spreadsheet based daily water balance model is developed using daily rainfall data, contributing roof area, rainfall loss factor, available storage <b>volume,</b> <b>tank</b> overflow and irrigation water demand. In this case study, two (185 m 3 and 110 m 3) underground rainwater tanks are considered. Using the developed model, effectiveness of each tank under different climatic scenarios are assessed. The analysis shows that both the tanks are quite effective in wet and average years, however less effective in dry years. A payback period analysis of the tanks is preformed which reveals that the total construction cost of the tanks can be recovered within 15 - 21 years time depending on tank size, climatic conditions and future water price increase rates. For the tanks, a relationship between water price increase rates and payback periods is developed.

A Landolt pH-oscillator, based on bromate/ sulfite/ferrocyanide, with a room temperature period of 20 min and a range of 3. 1 <pH < 7. 0, has been used to drive periodic oscillations in volume in a pH responsive hydrogel. The gel is coupled to the reaction and changes volume by a factor of at least 6.

In order to assess reliability of domestic rainwater tanks in augmenting partial household water demand in Melbourne (Australia) area, the developed water balance model was used for three different climatic conditions (i. e. dry, average, and wet years). Historical daily rainfall data was collected from a rainfall station near Melbourne city central. From historical rainfall data three representative years (driest, average and wettest) were selected for the current analysis. Reliability is defined as percentage of days {{in a year when}} rainwater tank was able to supply the intended partial demand for a particular condition. For the three climatic conditions, several reliability charts are presented for domestic rainwater tanks in relations to tank volume, roof area, number of people in a house (i. e. water demand) and percentage of total water demand to be satisfied by harvested rainwater. In brief, for a two-people household scenario, - 100 % reliability can be achieved with a roof size of 150 - 300 m^ 2 having a tank size of 5000 - 10, 000 L.

This study was aimed to know the reproduction performance of humpback grouper wild broodstock F- 0, first generation broodstock (F- 1) and second generation broodstock (F- 2).

Fortunately, there are renewable ones, such as wind, which has experienced recent developments {{in the area of}} power generation. Wind pumps can {{play a vital role in}} irrigation projects in remote farms. A methodology based on daily estimation balance between water needs and water availability was used to evaluate the feasibility of the most economic windmill irrigation system. For this purpose, several factors were included: three-hourly wind velocity (W 3 h, m/s), flow supplied by the wind pump as a function of the elevation height (H, m) and daily greenhouse evapotranspiration as a function of crop planting date. Monthly volumes of water required for irrigation (Dr, m 3 /ha) and in the water tank (Vd, m 3), as well as the monthly irrigable area (Ar, ha), were estimated by cumulative deficit water budgeting taking in account these factors. An example is given illustrating the use of this methodology on tomato crop (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) under greenhouse at Ciego de Ávila, Cuba. In this case two different W 3 h series (average and low wind year), three different H values and five tomato crop planting dates were considered.

40|$|Today’s {{system to}} measure the <b>volume</b> in a <b>tank</b> {{consists}} of a vertically placed sensor. When a vehicle is tilted {{the level of the}} fluid might change and if the volume is calculated based only on the information from the sensor it could result in a incorrect value. This thesis exams a new method to calculate the <b>volume</b> in <b>tanks</b> by using sensor fusion to crosscheck the i formation from the level sensors when the vehicle is tilted. The information is then used to see if it is possible to identify the grade of tilt by the change of fluid level. If the grade of tilt can be measured then the volume can be calculated in a more accurate way. The accuracy of measuring the fluid level depends on the tolerance; <b>tank</b> <b>volume,</b> sensor measurement and montage for both tank and sensor. This limitation is also examined. To exam if the tilt can be measured a volume calculation program was created to calculate the <b>volume</b> in <b>tank</b> as a function of tilt and fluid level. Volume calculation was done for both nominal cases and cases with tolerances for the tank and sensor. When analyzing the change in fluid level from the data, the result was that the tilt can’t be determined in a sufficient reliable manner. The tilt combination causing the fluid level to change could be more than one. This means that there are too many non unique solutions to determine the tilt with 5 degree accuracy...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} component of any accountability system for nuclear materials is a tank calibration equation that relates {{the height of}} liquid in a tank to its <b>volume.</b> <b>Tank</b> volume calibration equations are typically determined from pairs of height and volume measurements taken {{in a series of}} calibration runs. After raw calibration data are standardized to a fixed set of reference conditions, the calibration equation is typically fit by dividing the data into several segments [...] corresponding to regions in the tank [...] and independently fitting the data for each segment. The estimates obtained for individual segments must then be combined to obtain an estimate of the entire calibration function. This process is tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, uncertainty estimates may be misleading because it is difficult to properly model run-to-tun variability and between-segment correlation. In this paper, they describe a model whose parameters can be estimated simultaneously for all segments of the calibration data, thereby eliminating the need for segment-by-segment estimation. The essence of the proposed model is to define a suitable polynomial to fit to each segment and then extend its definition to the domain of the entire calibration function, so that it (the entire calibration function) can be expressed as the sum of these extended polynomials. The model provides defensible estimates of between-run variability and yields a proper treatment of between-segments correlations. A portable software package, called TANCS, has been developed to facilitate the acquisition, standardization, and analysis of tank calibration data. The TANCS package was used for the calculations in an example presented to illustrate the unified modeling approach described in this paper. With TANCS, a trial calibration function can be estimated and evaluated in a matter of minutes...|$|E
40|$|For the {{performance}} analysis {{and design of}} rainwater tanks, a simple spreadsheet based daily water balance model was developed using daily rainfall data, contributing roof area, rainfall loss factor, available storage <b>volume,</b> <b>tank</b> overflow and rainwater demand. This water balance model was then used to design an optimum size of domestic rainwater tank {{to be used for}} southwest Nigeria. The optimisation criterion was set to provide uninterrupted intended demand from the selected rainwater tank during the critical (dry) months. For the tank water, two demand scenarios were assessed: (i) toilet flushing only; and (ii) toilet flushing and laundry use. Analysis was performed for a typical dry year (1998) in southwest Nigeria. Current analysis outcomes were compared with an earlier analysis using monthly average rainfall data. It is found that analysis using monthly average rainfall data overestimates the required rainwater tank size. In addition, the newly developed model was used to assess the reliability of domestic rainwater tanks in augmenting partial household water demand. This analysis showed that a reliability of 100 % is possible to achieve with a tank size of 7000 L under low demand. However, with higher demand a bigger tank size (&# 8764; 10, 000 L) is required to achieve 100 % reliability even though very high reliability could also be attained with a tank size of 7000 L. From overflow analysis, {{the results of this study}} showed that a large quantity of water is lost as overflow, even in a dry year with a tank size of 10, 000 L. Thus, harvested rainwater could be used for other purposes if larger tanks are used as these would capture more of the excess rainwater which could then be tasked to other purposes without compromising the reliability of water availability for primary uses...|$|E

The present study conducted to evaluate the impacts of colloidal particles (30 nm - 1 &# 181;m) and fine solids (2 &# 181;m &# 150; 60 &# 181;m) on nauplii and egg production of the copepod A. tonsa in three systems: conventional recirculating system (cRAS), membrane modified recirculating system (mRAS) and flow through aquaculture system (FTAS). The initial copepod density was 75000 ind L- 1 for investigating of growth performance and 15 ind L- 1 for testing of egg production capacity of the copepods within 4 weeks. The results in the present study showed a better water quality regarding nitrogenous waste products and colloidal particles concentration in the FTAS compared to the RAS systems (cRAS and mRAS) during the experiment. The survival rate, nauplii and egg production of the copepods in the FTAS were significantly higher than the RAS systems (p 0. 05). The high concentration of colloidal particles in the RAS systems during the experiment could be an indication for the significant difference of nauplii and egg production compared to the FTAS (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, no effects of fine solids in all systems were observed on the performance of A. tonsa in terms of survival, growth and development, as well as nauplii and egg production rate.
