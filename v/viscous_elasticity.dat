40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{morphological}} parameters (viscosity, <b>viscous</b> <b>elasticity</b> and the rate of volatile component loss) of salicylic and boric acid-containing magisterial formulae (ointments). Moreover, the effects of these parameters on the diffusion rate of a therapeutic agent (salicylic acid) to an in vitro external compartment were analyzed. Finally, the applicatory properties of the ointments prepared by way of a conventional technique (in a mortar) and with the aid of an unguator, were compared. The rheological parameters of the analyzed ointments suggest that the preparations made with an aid of an unguator, irrespective of the physicochemical characteristics of their vehicles, are characterized by higher values of diffusion coefficient (D). In addition, conventionally-prepared formulae containing salicylic were shown to be characterized by better <b>viscous</b> <b>elasticity.</b> Surprisingly, irrespective of the preparation technique, the ointments based on an absorptive vehicle (containing lanolin) were characterized by similar <b>viscous</b> <b>elasticity.</b> The rate of volatile (water) component loss from ointments containing a 3 % solution of boric acid suggests that such formulae lose no more than 2. 3 % of their mass when exposed at 37 ℃. Therefore, the viscosity of such ointments applied onto a patient’s skin should remain relatively stable...|$|E
30|$|Due to a {{high-molecular}} structure {{polymeric materials}} are very temperature-dependent in their mechanical properties. Glass and rubbery transitions under cooling and heating {{are a good}} illustration of such dependence. Mechanical effects occurring during glass transition, particularly for epoxy resins, are well-investigated (Liu et al. 2004, Michels et al. 2015, Shardakov et al. 1991). A large {{number of studies have}} reported on modeling these effects for the case of small deformations. Two formal groups could be derived from the studies: the models of instantaneous elastic relaxation or phase transition (Bartenev and Barteneva 1992, Bugakov 1989, Klychnikov et al. 1980) and the models based on the postulates of the non-isothermal <b>viscous</b> <b>elasticity</b> (Bolotin 1972, Il’ushin and Pobedria 1970, Moskvitin 1972).

30|$|In this paper, we generalize a {{thermomechanical}} {{model of}} composite material undergoing glass transition developed early {{by the authors}} in (Matveenko et al. 2012; 2015) {{to the case of}} fiber-reinforced composite materials with polymeric matrix, which due to variation of temperature can undergo transition from the high-elastic to the glassy state and back. The relations constructed in these papers are based on the specific free energy of the composite, which is used as a scalar measure {{of the state of the}} material undergoing glass transition. We introduce a technique for determining the equation parameters in terms of the effective properties of the composite. We also develop a more general model, in which glass transition is considered as the process of enhancement of the matrix stiffness. We compare the two models to show their advantages and drawbacks. A numerical technique has been proposed to determine the effective material constants and functions for unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites with epoxy matrix undergoing glass transition due to temperature variation. The investigation has been performed taking no account of <b>viscous</b> <b>elasticity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Deflection {{characteristics}} of crop (rice, wheat) stalks {{were examined in}} order to make clear the mechanical interaction between crops and combine harvester. At the beginning, flexural rigidity values (EI) of crop stalks were calculated from the results of de flection test using image processing apparatus. Further, deflection values and posture of crop stalks were predicted by analysis of Finite Element Method (FEM) using parameters of EI. Therefore, propriety of FEM analysis was examined through the comparison with measured values. Finally, in this study, the following results were obtained: 1) The deflection of crop stalks could be returned to initial condition in a moment against a light load. But, against a heavy load, it took a little time to return to initial condition. Namely, the crop stalks were indicated to have {{characteristics of}} <b>viscous</b> <b>elasticity.</b> 2) Deflection values and posture of crop stalks calculated by FEM analysis almost coincided with measured values. From this result, deflection characteristics of crop stalks will be examined theoretically by FEM analysis if EI are obtained accurately. 3) The EI of crop stalks both rice and wheat became larger gradually {{in the direction of the}} root according as cross section area of stalk became larger. 収穫作業時における作物稈に作用する機械的作用を究明するため,画像処理装置を用いて作物(稲･小麦) 稈の撓み計測,曲げ剛さ(EI) の計算並びに有限要素法による作物稈の撓み姿勢や撓み量の計算値を実測値と比較し,撓み特性について考察を行った. 得られた主な結果は次のとおりである. 1) 稲･小麦稈に軽い荷重をかけた場合は,初期状態にすぐに回復したが,荷重が大きくなるに従い回復するのに若干の時間を要する. つまり,稲･小麦稈は粘弾性,応力緩和の特性があることを示した. 2) 有限要素法による作物稈の撓み姿勢や撓み量の計算値を実測値と比較した結果,両者ともほぼ一致する傾向が認められた. このことから,曲げ剛さ(EI) の計算精度が非常に高ければ,稲･小麦稈の撓み特性は理論的に考察できることが示唆された. 3) 稲･小麦稈両者ともに根元に行くに従って,稈の断面形状は少しずつ大きくなり,曲げ剛さ(EI) もわずかなばらつきはあるものの大きくなる傾向が見られた...|$|E

Those theories, which make use of the notion of thermal displacement and allow for heat waves, are at variance with the standard Fourier theory; they have attracted considerable interest, and have been applied in a number of disparate physical circumstances, where heat propagation is coupled with <b>elasticity,</b> <b>viscous</b> flows, etc. However, their derivation is not exempt from criticisms, that we here detail, in hopes of opening the way to reconsideration of old applications and proposition of new ones...|$|R
40|$|Motor vehicle {{riding comfort}} is mainly {{affected}} by road roughness and volumetric engine inertial unbalances. The vibration generated by these last cause propagates till the rider passing through engine mounts, main frame and auxiliary sub systems physically {{in contact with}} driver (handlebar, footrest, seat, fuel tank, etc.). In commercial motorcycle engines, due to higher performances, costs and downsizing requirements, often no balance countershafts are installed. Thus, an innovative approach to reduce {{the negative effects of}} inertial unbalances could consist in a optimal design of mounting system. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology able to numerically predict inertial engine unbalances due to the crank mechanism and eventually to the countershaft, and to reduce the consequent propagating vibrations transmitted to the frame via engine mounts optimizing their layout. The methodology can be applied to different layouts of single/multi-cylinder engine with/without a balancing countershaft and characterized by different angles of bench engine and angular phases of the cranks. To introduce an important step ahead about the ride comfort of a motorcycle during the design process of its frame, it becomes necessary to know both the optimal positions, the number and the <b>viscous</b> - <b>elasticity</b> characteristics of the engine mounts. A numerical tool was realized to calculate engine inertial unbalances and to investigate the dynamical behavior of the engine block forced by such inertial actions. The optimal layout of engine mounts is finally defined trying to minimize the shaking effects of engine block in terms of forces transmitted to the frame. The proposed methodology can consider the frame as rigid or deformable. The methodology has been applied to an existing vehicle knowing engine parameters, dimensions and masses of crank mechanism components and both frame geometry and material. The obtained results from the application of the methodology showing the provided improvement are reported in the article...|$|R
40|$|A {{perturbation}} analysis {{based on}} {{equations of motion}} in Lagrangian form is presented for the oscillatory and mean motions induced by a forced periodic wave propagating in {{a thin layer of}} viscoelastic material. The material is assumed to be a Voigt body, for which the constitutive relation is a linear combination of viscous and elastic parts. In this work, the elastic part of the stress is assumed to be a linear function of the Lagrangian deformation tensor. The aim is to show a proper approach of carrying out the analysis to the second order {{in order to determine the}} mean deformation undergone by the material. This approach is in sharp contrast to the previous studies, which have mistakenly applied the complex viscoelastic parameter to the second order and assumed the mean motion to be a steady Lagrangian drift. It is shown here that for a sufficiently soft and viscous material the mean motion is actually a creeping motion that slowly dies out as a limit of finite deformation is approached. Numerical results are also generated to illustrate the combined effects due to <b>viscous</b> damping and <b>elasticity</b> on the first-order oscillatory and the second-order mean displacements of particles in the material. © 2006 Elsevier B.

In this thesis {{a mathematical model}} of polymer gel dynamics is proposed and analyzed. This work is motivated by problems in biomedical device manufacturing. The goal of this thesis is to develop and analyze models of gels consisting of balance laws {{in the form of}} systems of partial differential equations and boundary conditions. The model based on mixture theory accounts for nonlinear elasticity, viscoelasticity, transport, and diffusion. The derived model includes as limiting cases incompressible <b>elasticity,</b> <b>viscous</b> incompressible fluid, and Doi's stress diffusion equations. Two classes of problems are considered. The first class addresses nonlinear problems in special domains and the second class addresses linear problems in arbitrary domains. Special emphasis is placed on linear problems with the goal of studying and implementing finite element methods. The first class of problems includes a one dimensional free boundary problem analyzed in terms of one dimensional hyperbolic theory. The second class includes coupled elasticity and fluid flow problems. One challenging issue is accounting for the fact that, although the gel may be incompressible, the polymer may experience large changes of volume. Numerical analysis of elastic solids and polymer gels is carried out. The Taylor-Hood algorithm for Stokes flow is applied to linearly visco-hyperelastic polymers. The simulations show the presence of stress concentrations at the boundary which relax over time. In the case of a gel, the conditionally stable mixed finite element method proposed by Feng and He for Doi's stress-diffusion coupling model is modified to handle the case of polymer viscosity. The modified numerical scheme is shown to be unconditionally stable and convergent...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the flow}} of {{polymeric}} fluids is important for optimizing commercial processes such as injection molding and fiber spinning. The combination of streamwise curvature and elastic normal stresses {{can lead to the}} onset of elastic flow instabilities, severely rate-limiting such processes. This thesis focuses on the stability of two complex non-Newtonian flows of dilute polystyrene solutions: the viscometric flow between a rotating cone-and-plate and the flow through an axisymmetric contraction-expansion. Torsional shear flows of elastic fluids with closed streamlines can accumulate heat from viscous dissipation resulting in spatial nonuniformities in the temperature profile and viscometric properties. In this thesis, a detailed study of the effect of viscous heating on the steady shearing of elastic fluids between a rotating cone-and-plate is performed. The relative importance of <b>viscous</b> heating and <b>elasticity</b> can be quantified by a new dimensionless thermoelastic number. This parameter is a fluid material property which is a function of polymer molecular weight, geometry and temperature. As the thermoelastic number is increased, strong temperature gradients reduce the elasticity of the test fluid and delay the onset of the instability, eventually stabilizing the flow completely. The flow of elastic fluids into an axisymmetric abrupt contraction-expansion is a complex flow containing regions of both shear and extension that tests the limits of current viscoelastic constitutive models. (cont.) A large extra pressure drop above that measured for a similar Newtonian fluid is documented and found to correlate to the stress-conformation hysteresis observed in transient uniaxial extension measurements. Laser Doppler velocimetry, particle image velocimetry and flow induced birefringence are used to investigate the global kinematics upstream of contraction-expansions of various contraction ratios and degrees of re-entrant corner curvature. For a contraction ratio of beta= 2 a steady elastic lip vortex is observed whereas for 4 <beta< 8, no lip vortex is observed and instead a corner vortex is seen. At large Deborah numbers a time-dependent elastic flow instability is observed. Measurements of the transient extensional rheology show that the differing vortex growth pathways in viscoelastic fluids can be systematically understood in terms of a dimensionless ratio of the normal stress differences in shear and in extension. by Jonathan P.
