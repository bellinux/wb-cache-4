Lamotrigine is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro.

60|$|<b>Veratrine,</b> Colchicine, Theine.--Solutions {{were made}} of these three {{alkaloids}} by adding one part to 437 of water. Half-minims were placed, in each case; on the discs of at least six leaves, but no inflection was caused, except perhaps a very slight amount by the theine. Half-minims of a strong infusion of tea likewise produced, as formerly stated, no effect. I also tried similar drops of an infusion of {{one part of the}} extract of colchicum, sold by druggists, to 218 of water; and the leaves were observed for 48 hrs., without any effect being produced. The seven leaves on which drops of <b>veratrine</b> had been left for 26 hrs. were given bits of meat, and after 21 hrs. were well inflected. These three alkaloids are therefore quite innocuous.|$|E
60|$|Concluding Remarks on the Effects of the {{foregoing}} Agents.--As the glands, when excited, transmit some influence to the surrounding tentacles, causing them to bend and their glands to pour forth an increased amount of modified secretion, I was anxious to ascertain whether the leaves included any element having the nature of nerve-tissue, which, though not continuous, served as the channel of transmission. This led me to try the several alkaloids and other substances which are known to exert a powerful influence on the nervous system of animals; I was at first encouraged in my trials by finding that strychnine, digitaline, and nicotine, which all act on the nervous system, were poisonous to Drosera, and caused {{a certain amount of}} inflection. Hydrocyanic acid, again, which is so deadly a poison to animals, caused rapid movement of the tentacles. But as several innocuous acids, though much diluted, such as benzoic, acetic, &c., as well as some essential oils, are extremely poisonous to Drosera, and quickly cause strong inflection, it seems probable that strychnine, nicotine, digitaline, and hydrocyanic acid, excite inflection by acting on elements in no way analogous to the nerve-cells of animals. If elements of this latter nature had been present in the leaves, it might have been expected that morphia, hyoscyamus, atropine, <b>veratrine,</b> colchicine, curare, and diluted alcohol would have produced some marked effect; whereas [page 224] these substances are not poisonous and have no power, or only a very slight one, of inducing inflection. It should, however, be observed that curare, colchicine, and <b>veratrine</b> are muscle-poisons--that is, act on nerves having some special relation with the muscles, and, therefore, could not be expected to act on Drosera. The poison of the cobra is most deadly to animals, by paralysing their nerve-centres,* yet is not in the least so to Drosera, though quickly causing strong inflection.|$|E

An intimate relations between the effective minimal dosis of <b>veratrine</b> and temperature were noted. 4. <b>Veratrine</b> contraction was depressed or abolished by calcium or potassium chlorides. Relations between threshold concentration of <b>veratrine</b> and calcium or potassium chlorides were determined. 5.

Height of contraction of veratrinised muscle was higher than normal muscle, in twitch as welt as in tetanus. Refractory period of <b>veratrine</b> muscle was greatly prolonged and found in the descending phase of <b>veratrine</b> contraction. 7. Quinine obviated <b>veratrine</b> contraction.

40|$|<b>Veratrine</b> {{manufactured}} {{from the}} seeds of Veratrum Sabadilla, Aiton, or Schoen-ocaulon officinale, Gray, {{is a mixture of}} various alkaloids. Its chief constituents are cevadine, veratridine, and cevine. Cevadine is the tiglic acid ester of cevine, and veratridine is the veratric acid ester of the same base. Previous studies made with the pure alkaloids have dealt essentially with the quantitative relation of the three alkaloids, while qualitative differences either have not been observed or have not been sufficiently emphasized. Cevacline and an amorphous alkaloid which was probably veratridine were first compared by Lissauer (1) in 1877, who found no differences between the two alkaloids. In 1899 Falk (2) adminis-tered cevine and cevadine to frogs and rabbits, and the brief note referring to his studies suggests some qualitative difference between these two substances. The present investigation was undertaken to extend our knowledge of the action of veratridine and cevine and of the quantitative relation between their effects, and to ascertain the existence of qualitative differences between the two substances. Certain observations on <b>veratrine</b> are included for comparison. Unless otherwise indicated, all dosages mentioned throughout this paper in con-nection with cevine, <b>veratrine,</b> and veratridine refer to cevine hydrochloride + 2 H 2 O, <b>veratrine</b> hydrochloride, and veratridine base respectively. The molec-ular weights of cevine and cevine hydrochloride dihydrate are 509 and 581 respectively, and that of veratricline is 673.

40|$|Background: The {{pattern of}} {{poisoning}} in Russia {{may be different}} from other countries. The study objective was to describe the pattern of poisoning with cardiovascular drugs in a major industrial city in Russia, Yekaterinburg. Methods: This study {{was part of a}} larger prospective multi-center study including all acute poisonings in patients older than 15 years of age in the city of Yekaterinburg, during March 2009 to March 2010. Patients with main diagnosis of acute poisoning by cardiovascular drugs and two other commonly used drugs affecting cardiac system were included. Results: Cardiovascular drugs were the main poisoning agent in 269 cases of 3, 112 acute poisonings (8. 6 %) during the study period. Median age of the patients was 36 (range: 16 - 88) years and 108 patients (40 %) were men. Over 85 % of patients required hospital admission and ICU care was needed for 45. 7 % of patients. Men significantly outnumbered women in <b>veratrine</b> poisoning (P < 0. 001) while women significantly outnumbered men in clonidine (P < 0. 001), drotaverine (P < 0. 001), CCB (P < 0. 001) and beta blocker (P = 0. 012) poisoning. The most frequent complications were hypotension (83 patients; 30. 8 %), cardiac arrhythmias (22 patients; 8. 2 %) and QT prolongation (5 patients; 1. 9 %). The main agents significantly associated with hypotension were the phenylalkylamine and benzothiazepine subclasses of CCBs (verapamil/diltiazem), <b>veratrine,</b> beta blockers, nitrates, ACE inhibitors, clonidine, and adelphan.

The effects on the spike, "positive overshoot," and "potassium potential" were also observed, but where possible concentrations were employed which left these phenomena unaltered. <b>Veratrine</b> augmented the oscillations and the negative after-potential, particularly with repetitive stimulation. Yohimbine caused a small long lasting positive after-potential and depressed the oscillations, effects also enhanced with repetitive activity. Cocaine and procaine suppressed the oscillations and the negative after-potential but DDT was completely inert. An elevation in the medium calcium depressed the oscillations and the naturally occurring negative after-potential; negative after-potentials induced with <b>veratrine</b> were increased by calcium. A decrease in the potassium augmented the oscillations and the negative after-potential. A hypothesis is presented in which these effects are interpreted in terms of potassium concentration at the fiber surface as regulated by a labile permeability and metabolism. This is discussed in relation to the available evidence for these factors. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the author's indebtedness to Dr. D. E. S. Brown, Director, and to his staff at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research for the cooperation and special facilities provided during the initiation of this work. Dr. T.

40|$|The {{depolarization}} of crab nerve during repetitive stimulation is {{unaffected by}} the presence of glucose or by an increase in the calcium content of the medium. It is increased in both amplitude and rate by veratrine; in the presence of this alkaloid mixture the rate but not the magnitude of the depolarization is increased by an elevation in the calcium concentration. Repolarization following stimulation is unaltered by glucose and accelerated by a greater calcium concentration. <b>Veratrine</b> increases both the amplitude and the time constant of repolarization; its effect on the time constant is counteracted by an elevation of the calcium in the medium. Potassium released during stimulation and its reabsorption following activity have been observed by analyses of small volumes of sea water in contact with crab nerve. Under the conditions employed 3 x 10 – 8 µM potassium is liberated per impulse per gm. wet weight of nerve. This loss is increased by low concentrations of <b>veratrine,</b> which also increase the amount reabsorbed during recovery. The depletion of potassium from the medium is appreciably less if the potassium previously released during activity has not been removed. Inexcitability resulting from anoxia can be washed away with oxygen-free solution—rapidly and completely {{in the case of the}} squid axon, slowly and incompletely in crab nerve. The potassium shifts are in the proper direction and of the correct order of magnitude to account for the negative and positive after-potentials in terms of potassium accumulation or depletion in the extracellular space...|$|E
40|$|Rat {{cerebral}} cortex synaptosomes prelabeled with [3 H]gamma-aminobutyric acid [(3 H]GABA) were exposed in superfusion to various concentrations of KCl (9 - 50 mM). The evoked release of [3 H]GABA reached a plateau at about 35 mM KCl. The K+-induced release was Ca 2 +-dependent, {{particularly at the}} lowest K+ concentrations. The GABAB agonist (-) -baclofen concentration dependently inhibited the release of [3 H]GABA evoked by K+; this effect decreased with increasing K+ concentration and disappeared at 35 mM KCl. The GABAA agonist muscimol (1 - 100 microM) was totally ineffective to inhibit the release of [3 H]GABA. <b>Veratrine</b> (1 - 30 microM) induced the release of [3 H]GABA and the effect was tetrodotoxin-sensitive. (-) -Baclofen, but not muscimol, decreased the veratrine-induced [3 H]GABA release; the GABAB agonist was particularly effective in presence of low concentrations of <b>veratrine</b> (1 - 3 microM) but the effect disappeared when 30 microM of the alkaloid was used. The inhibitory effect of (-) -baclofen on the release of [3 H]GABA evoked by 15 mM KCl was dependent on the concentration of Ca 2 +: the effect increased as the concentration of Ca 2 + was raised, reaching a plateau at 0. 6 mM Ca 2 +. Exogenous GABA, in presence of the GABA uptake blocker SK & F 89976 A, inhibited the release of [3 H]GABA evoked by K+; this effect was antagonized by phaclofen.

When applied to the serosal media of mucosal preparations, <b>veratrine</b> or veratndine evoked a biphasic increase in transmural potential difference and short-circuit current, consisting of phasic and tonic increases of both bioelectnc parameters without a change of tissue conductance; these responses were blocked by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin, but unaffected by pretreat mont with atropine, naloxone or yohimbine.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which cyclic AMP facilitates secretagogue stimulated catecholamine (CA) release from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells was investigated. 8 -Br cyclic AMP and forskolin enhanced CA release induced by acetylcholine (ACh). Ouabain, omission of extracellular K⁺ or <b>veratrine</b> enhanced ACh-evoked CA release and counteracted the effects of 8 -Br cyclic AMP and forskolin. Cyclic AMP decreased Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase activity of microsomes from bovine adrenal medulla. 8 -Br cyclic AMP, forskolin and catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (A-PK) reduced [γ-³²P]ATP hydrolysis in digitonin-permealilized chromaffin cells. This reduction of ATP hydrolysis was abolished {{in the presence of}} ouabain and thus suggested to be due to an inhibition of Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase. 8 -Br cyclic AMP and forskolin alone slightly increased ²²Na uptake, intracellular Na⁺ concentration ([Na⁺]i), depolarization and raised intracellular free Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺i), and encouraged these ACh-induced responses. 8 -Br cyclic AMP and Forskolin enhanced CA release elicited by ACh in the presence of Ca²⁺ channel blockers. Potentiations by 8 -Br cyclic AMP or forskolin of stimulation-evoked CA release, increase in ²²Na uptake, [Na⁺]i, depolarization and rise in [Ca²⁺]i were antagonized by tetrodotoxin, amiloride, or by the removal of Na⁺ from the medium, but not affected by K⁺ channel blockers. Ouabain, removal of K⁺ or <b>veratrine</b> mimicked the effects of cyclic AMP and these agents counteracted each other. 8 -Br cyclic AMP enhanced CA release, ⁴⁵Ca efflux and [Ca²⁺]i rise induced by caffeine in the absence of extracellular Ca²⁺. These results may suggest that further enhancement of Ca²⁺ influx through the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange mechanism and mobilization of intracellular Ca²⁺ from its stores due to reduction of the Na⁺ gradient as a result of inhibition of Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase by cyclic AMP, is involved in the facilitation of CA release elicited by cyclic AMP...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{rectification}} {{was demonstrated}} in whole sartorius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens {{and also in}} the single giant nerve fiber of the northern squid, Ommastrephes illecibrossus. It is probably a property of the plasma membrane. Rectification decreases reversibly under the influence of increased concentrations of the potassium ion and with chloroform, <b>veratrine</b> sulfate and isoamyl carbamate. No effect was found with lack of calcium, excess calcium, or barium chloride. Decrease in rectification is invariably accompanied by simultaneous decrease in resting potential. A proposed explanation of the mechanism of rectification is discussed. Rectification in a living membrane, viz. a change in resistance with change in direction of current flow, may possibly be explained in terms of a change in the concentration of potassium ions in the membrane...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Voltage clamp {{measurements}} on myelinated nerve fibers show that tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin, and DDT specifically affect the sodium channels of the membrane. Tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin render the sodium channels impermeable to Na ions and to Li ions and probably prevent {{the opening of}} individual sodium channels when one toxin molecule binds to a channel. The apparent dissociation constant of the inhibitory complex is about I nM for the cationic forms of both toxins. The zwitter ionic forms are much less potent. On the other hand, DDT causes {{a fraction of the}} sodium channels that open during a depolarization to remain open for a longer time than is normal. The effect cannot be described as a specific change in sodium inactivation or as a specific change in sodium activation, for both processes continue to govern the opening of the sodium channels and neither process is able to close the channels. The effects of DDT are very similar to those of <b>veratrine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fast {{cyclic voltammetry}} at a carbon fibre {{microelectrode}} {{was used to}} measure 5 -HT signals following electrical or chemical stimulation in rat substantia nigra pars reticulata slices. Chemical stimulation with (+) -amphetamine or <b>veratrine</b> gave signals which were indistinguishable from those of exogenous 5 -HT Electrical stimulation of sufficient duration gave voltammetric signals which were characteristic of 5 -HT. Release of dopamine was not detected following either chemical or electrical stimulation. The 5 -HT signals were attenuated by TTX and enhanced by fluvoxamine. It was not possible to demonstrate regulation of 5 -HT release in the SNr by 5 -HT 1 B autoreceptors using CGS 12066 A or methiothepin. Signal following electrical stimulation were not enhanced by either benztropine or GBR 12909, or modified in the presence of either quinpirole or sulpiride. We conclude that 5 -HT release can be detected voltammetrically in the SNr; 5 -HT release is likely to be from axon terminals, but somatodendritic DA release could not be detected.
