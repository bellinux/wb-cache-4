5|$|Some artists {{tried to}} alter their sound, while others {{struggled}} on with their original format. In 1995, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996, David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, left the band soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> III. <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> would not tour or record again until 2004. Warrant released Ultraphobic in 1995, an album with more of an alternative/grunge approach, which had little commercial success.|$|E
5|$|June 15, 1988: Monsters of Rock Tour {{featuring}} Metallica, Dokken, Scorpions, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen,</b> and Kingdom Come.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} first {{covered in a}} {{distinctive}} soul style by Labelle on their 1972 album Moon Shadow. <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> began covering the song in concert in 1993. Eddie <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> re-arranged the track so that the synthesizer part was played on the guitar. A live recording was released on , and made it to {{number one on the}} Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.|$|E
5|$|Since its renovation, Jamie Foxx, Eddie <b>Van</b> <b>Halen,</b> and Korn {{have stayed}} at the hotel, and Robert Wagner has {{returned}} from time to time.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{performed}} the rescheduled Japanese concerts, along with headlining gigs at three festivals: Stone Music Festival in Sydney (the band's first concert in Australia since 1998), Ford Festival Park in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and the California Mid-State Fair in Paso Robles.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Best Of – Volume I (1996), <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> renegotiated their {{royalties}} with their label Warner Bros. In 2004, Roth discovered {{that the rest of}} the band had renegotiated a royalty rate five times greater than his for releases made during his time as lead singer. This was later rectified.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as a}} hit, {{the song}} has {{achieved}} critical praise, appearing as one of Rolling Stones The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It has been covered by several artists, such as <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> who took their version to No.1 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. It {{has been used for}} several TV shows and films, and in some political campaigns.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, pop-rock largely {{consisted}} of the radio-friendly glam metal bands, who used images derived from the British glam movement with macho lyrics and attitudes, accompanied by hard rock music and heavy metal virtuosic soloing. Bands from this era included many British groups like Def Leppard, as well as heavy metal-influenced American bands Mötley Crüe, Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi and <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the new {{commercial}} climate glam metal bands like Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up, Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991, and {{while many of}} these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands' commercial viability during the decade. In 1995 <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> III and <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> would not tour or record again until 2004. Guns N' Roses' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident? Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997. Axl Rose, the only original member, worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete. Slash and McKagan eventually rejoined the band in 2016 and went on the Not in this Lifetime... Tour with them.|$|E
5|$|Others {{who have}} covered the song include Ann-Margret, {{who would later}} co-star with Presley in the 1964 motion picture Viva Las Vegas, the Cadets, Delaney Bramlett, Justin Timberlake, Cher, Roger Miller, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, John Cale, Merle Haggard, Tom Jones, Dax Riggs, Roger McGuinn, Suzi Quatro, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen,</b> Jimi Hendrix, Neil Diamond, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Guns N' Roses, and Tones on Tail.|$|E
5|$|Their fifth studio album, titled The Oracle, was {{released}} on May 4, 2010. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200, making Godsmack one of the bands that make three consecutive albums that debuted at #1 in the chart, a feat that also has been accomplished by <b>Van</b> <b>Halen,</b> U2, Metallica, Dave Matthews Band, Staind, Disturbed, and Linkin Park.|$|E
5|$|Black Sabbath have {{influenced}} many acts including Iron Maiden, Slayer, Metallica, Nirvana, Korn, Mayhem, Venom, Judas Priest, Guns N' Roses, Soundgarden, Body Count, Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Disturbed, Death, Opeth, Pantera, Megadeth, the Smashing Pumpkins, Slipknot, Foo Fighters, Fear Factory, Candlemass, Godsmack, and <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b> Two gold selling tribute albums have been released, Nativity in Black Volume 1 & 2, including covers by Sepultura, White Zombie, Type O Negative, Faith No More, Machine Head, Primus, System of a Down, and Monster Magnet.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} instrument in mainstream pop music. It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts, such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top and <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b> It was {{a major influence on}} house music, which grew out of the post-disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs attempted to make the less pop-oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul, dub, rap music, and jazz.|$|E
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{amicably}} {{split from}} their long-time label Warner Bros. Records in 2002, although they would later sign a one-record {{deal with the}} label shortly afterwards for the 2004 release The Best of Both Worlds. The band briefly entered into negotiations with Columbia Records, but these stalled after Roth indicated he would not sign with the label. In November 2011, the band signed with Interscope Records, after its chairman Jimmy Iovine became personally involved in negotiations.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} three warm-up {{shows at}} Cafe Wha? in New York City, Henson Studios in Hollywood, California, and The Forum in Inglewood, California, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> began their A Different Kind of Truth Tour in Louisville, Kentucky on February 18. This tour consisted of 46 shows, ending on June 26 in New Orleans, {{and was the}} eighth most lucrative concert tour of 2012, with a total gross of $54,425,548 and attendance of 522,296. A second North American leg was cancelled, with the band claiming exhaustion. This {{was followed by the}} postponement of three Japanese concerts, as Eddie underwent emergency surgery to treat diverticulitis.|$|E
5|$|Glam {{metal can}} be traced back to music acts like Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Kiss, The New York Dolls, and <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b> It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, {{particularly}} on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Stryper, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, and Dokken. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Skid Row, Cinderella, and Warrant. Glam metal was associated with flashy clothing and makeup. Poison, for example, had long shaggy or backcombed hair, accessories, metal studs, leather, and make-up during their live performances.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's {{two major}} {{projects}} have contrasting temperaments. Slipknot {{is considered to}} be heavy metal, nu metal and alternative metal, and expresses moods such as depression, hostility, anger, misanthropy, and rebellion. Stone Sour is classified as alternative metal, expressing moods of bleakness and somberness as well as anger and rebellion. Taylor cites Mötley Crüe, AC/DC, The Who, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Pink Floyd, Faith No More, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen,</b> Aerosmith, Rush, Motörhead, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Alice in Chains, Bon Jovi, Guns N' Roses, Nine Inch Nails, Dokken, Misfits, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Queen, Anthrax, Black Flag, Slayer, Def Leppard, The Stooges, Sex Pistols, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Neil Young, Cheap Trick, Pearl Jam, The Damned, The Cramps, Soundgarden, Mr. Bungle, Fear Factory, Megadeth, Nirvana, Journey, Bob Dylan, Machine Head, Kiss, ZZ Top, White Zombie, Pantera, Korn, Green Day and Marilyn Manson as influences.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish band Europe {{released}} the anthemic album The Final Countdown which {{reached the top}} ten in several countries, including the U.S. and while the title single reached number one in 26 countries. Stryper made their mainstream breakthrough in 1986 {{with the release of}} their platinum album To Hell with the Devil and brought Christian lyrics to their hard rock music style and glam metal looks. Two Pennsylvania bands, with Harrisburg's Poison and Philadelphia's Cinderella released multi-platinum début albums, respectively Look What the Cat Dragged In and Night Songs in 1986. <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> released 5150 their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the U.S. for three weeks and sold over six million copies. Additionally, some established hard rock bands of the era such as the Scorpions, Whitesnake, Aerosmith, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Judas Priest began incorporating glam metal elements into their sounds and images, as the genre's popularity skyrocketed in 1985-86.|$|E
5|$|Though the Clash {{continued}} to tour, tension {{continued to}} increase. In early 1983, Chimes left the band after the Combat Rock Tour because of in-fighting and turmoil. He {{was replaced by}} Pete Howard for the US Festival in San Bernardino, California, which the Clash co-headlined, along with David Bowie and <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b> The band argued with the event's promoters over inflated ticket prices, threatening to pull out unless a large donation was made to a local charity. The group ultimately performed on 28 May, the festival's New Music Day, which drew a crowd of 140,000. After the show, members of the band brawled with security staff. This was Jones' last appearance with the group: in September 1983, he was fired. Shortly thereafter, he became {{a founding member of}} General Public, but left that band as they were recording their first album.|$|E
5|$|Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed {{hard rock}} with a pop {{sensitivity}} {{and spent a}} total of 8 weeks {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, image-driven, sex-celebrating glam metal {{emanating from}} Hollywood's Sunset Strip, spearheaded by <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> and {{followed}} by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Great White, Ratt and W.A.S.P., quickly replaced other styles of metal in the tastes of many British rock fans. New Jersey act Bon Jovi and the Swedish Europe, thanks to their successful fusion of hard rock and romantic pop, also became very popular in the UK, with the former even headlining the 1987 Monsters of Rock Festival. Record companies latched on to the more polished glam metal subgenre over the NWOBHM bands, which maintained a fan base elsewhere in Europe, but found themselves crowded out of the UK and US markets {{by the success of}} these American groups. While the attention devoted to the NWOBHM bands waned, a new succession of far less mainstream metal subgenres began to emerge and attract many British metalheads. Power metal and thrash metal, both stemming from the NWOBHM and maintaining much of its ethos, were gaining critical acclaim and commercial success {{in the second half of}} the 1980s with their even faster and heavier sound. Bands such as Helloween, Savatage, Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax captured much of the market share of those metalheads who were not content with the sound or style of more mainstream, pop-oriented metal bands.|$|E
25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{released}} {{a total of}} six albums with vocalist David Lee Roth: <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> (1978), <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> II (1979), Women and Children First (1980), Fair Warning (1981), Diver Down (1982), and 1984 (1984).|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> was {{announced}} {{as one of}} that year's inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> brothers, Anthony, Hagar, and Roth were inducted, though only Hagar and Anthony appeared at the induction ceremony {{on behalf of the}} group. Billboard announced on January 24, 2007 that <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> would reunite with Roth for a U.S. tour. This was confirmed shortly after on the official <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> website.|$|E
25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> and Alex formed {{their first}} band {{with three other}} boys, calling {{themselves}} The Broken Combs, performing at lunchtime at Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena, where <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> was in the fourth grade. <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> would later {{say that this was}} when he first felt the desire to become a professional musician.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 2007 The Official <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> Web Site {{released}} {{information that}} Roth had rejoined the band along with current members Alex, Eddie, along with Eddie and Valerie Bertinelli's teenage son, Wolfgang <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b> Michael Anthony, Van Halen's original bass player, played the mid-2004 tour with Sammy Hagar under a 'hired gun' contract. On March 8 the official <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> website posted {{a letter from}} Eddie <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> stating that Ed did not feel he could perform his absolute best and the tour with Roth would be postponed.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{underwent}} {{an emergency}} surgery for a severe bout of diverticulitis. His recovery time was {{four to six}} months, causing <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> to postpone their Japanese tour, which was originally scheduled to begin in November 2012.|$|E
25|$|Simmons {{stated in}} his {{autobiography}} Kiss and Make-Up that Eddie <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> wanted to fill Frehley's spot. Simmons and Eddie's brother Alex convinced Eddie to remain with <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b> Eddie was anxious to break up <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> because of tensions with lead singer David Lee Roth, who left the band soon thereafter. Other notable musicians who auditioned for the band include Punky Meadows of Angel, Doug Aldrich of Whitesnake and Dio, Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi, and Yngwie Malmsteen.|$|E
25|$|On April 21, 2007, Eddie <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{served as}} an Honorary Race Official for the NASCAR race at Phoenix International Raceway. On May 24, he posted a note to the <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> website {{confirming}} that he had completed rehab successfully.|$|E
25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{entered the}} Henson Studio C with {{producer}} John Shanks on January 17, 2011. Shanks posted on his Twitter account {{that he was}} in the studio with the band and posted a picture of one of Eddie Van Halen's signature amps. The new album would be the first full-length <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> album since 1998's <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> III and the first new music from the band since the three new songs from the 2004's Best of Both Worlds compilation. It would also be the first <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> album to feature Eddie's son, Wolfgang <b>Van</b> <b>Halen,</b> on the bass in place of Michael Anthony. This would also be the first full-length album to feature Roth on vocals in over 27 years, and the first new material with him in 15 years, since the two new songs with him on the Best Of – Volume I. It would also be the first recorded music from Roth since 2003's Diamond Dave.|$|E
25|$|On January 24, 2007, {{after much}} anticipation, Billboard.com {{reported}} that Roth would rejoin <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> for a 40-date arena and amphitheater tour in mid-2007. This report, among many others, was confirmed with an official press release {{posted on the}} official <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> website on February 2, 2007.|$|E
25|$|Roth is {{best known}} as the {{original}} (1974–1985) and current (2006–present) lead singer of hard rock band <b>Van</b> <b>Halen.</b> He is also known as a successful solo artist, releasing numerous RIAA-certified Gold and Platinum albums. After more than two decades apart, Roth re-joined <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> in 2006 for a North American tour that became the highest grossing in the band's history and one of the highest grossing of that year. In 2012, Roth and <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> released the comeback album A Different Kind of Truth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{appeared}} on a Ted Templeman-Donn Landee collaboration.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, Warner/Chappell Music {{extended}} its administration agreements with <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> (specifically Eddie and Alex <b>Van</b> <b>Halen).</b> Under the agreement, Warner/Chappell {{will continue to}} administer their catalog of works.

25|$|In December 2011, <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> {{announced}} a 2012 tour with Roth.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, rumors swirled that Roth and {{the members}} of <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> had {{recorded}} several new songs together and were attempting yet another reunion.

Instead, Warner Bros. issued remastered versions of all six early <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> studio albums.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 2007, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} on the band's website that David Lee Roth would rejoin <b>Van</b> <b>Halen</b> for their summer tour.
