The approach is to characterize Li-Na carbonate mixtures {{in terms of their}} segregation properties in an electric field and, if necessary, to modify the observed segregation by adding Ba and Ca carbonates. Both non-segregating properties and MCFC test-cell performance show improvement as the lithium content is modified, up or down, from a baseline of 52 / 48 Li/Na.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Current Planetary Probe Science and TechnologySixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopThe MSL entry vehicle will be experiencing aerothermal environments that no previous Mars entry vehicle has seen, and as such, will require a heatshield that no previous Mars entry vehicle has flown. Early assessments of the environments led engineers down the path to "fly as we've always flown", with the heritage Mars heatshield material, SLA- 561 <b>V.</b> <b>Screening</b> tests in arc jet facilities in stagnation model configurations substantiated the claims that the SLA- 561 V could survive high heating rates expected on the heatshield, albeit, with a melting surface. However, due to the size and mass of the vehicle, along with the need to reenter at angle of attack, high heating and high shear in turbulent flow was predicted on the leeward side of the vehicle. Testing in shear showed that the SLA- 561 V exhibited catastrophic ablation which led to the abandonment of the material for this application and the fast-tracked development of a tiled PICA heatshield design, on track for a 2009 launch...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To {{ensure the}} safety of plasma derivatives, {{screening}} for human parvovirus B 19 V genomic DNA in donated plasma using a pooling strategy is performed in some countries. We investigated the prevalence of B 19 V DNA and anti-B 19 V antibodies in Chinese plasma pools, plasma derivatives and plasma donations to evaluate the risk posed by B 19 V. Methods Using a Q-PCR assay developed in-house, we tested for B 19 V genomic DNA in 142 plasma pools collected between January 2009 and June 2011 from two Chinese blood products manufacturers. Plasma derivatives collected between 1993 – 1995 (10 batches of albumin, 155 batches of intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG) and 2009 – 2011 (50 batches of albumin, 54 batches of IVIG, 35 batches of factor VIII, 7 batches of fibrinogen, and 17 batches of prothrombin complex concentrate, PCC) were also tested for B 19 V contamination. In addition, B 19 V genome prevalence in minipools(including 90 individual donations) of 49680 individual plasma samples collected between August 2011 and March 2012 by a single Chinese manufacturer was investigated. IgM/IgG was also investigated in plasma pools/derivatives and in minipools with B 19 V-DNA titers above 1 x 10 4 and 1 x 10 6 geq/mL using B 19 ELISA IgM/IgG assay(Virion-Serion, Würzburg, Germany), respectively. Results B 19 V-DNA was detected in 54. 2 % of plasma pools from two Chinese blood product manufacturers; among recently produced blood products, B 19 V was detected in 21 / 54 IVIG samples, 19 / 35 factor VIII samples, 6 / 7 fibrinogen samples, and 12 / 17 PCC samples, but not in albumin samples. The levels of B 19 V-DNA in these samples varied from 10 2 - 10 7 geq/mL. In samples with > 10 4 geq/mL genome DNA, B 19 V-specific IgG was also found in all corresponding plasma pools and IVIG, whereas none was detected in the majority of other plasma derivatives. Screening of plasma donations indicated that most minipools were contaminated with B 19 V-DNA (10 2 - 10 8 geq/mL) and one donation had 1. 09 [*]×[*] 10 10 geq/mL B 19 V genomic DNA along with a non-classical IgG/IgM profile. Conclusions Despite the implementation of some inactivation/removal methods designed to prevent viral contamination, B 19 V DNA was detectable in Chinese plasma pools and plasma derivatives. Thus, the introduction of B 19 <b>V</b> <b>screening</b> and discard donation with high viramic concentration for Chinese plasma donors would be desirable. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal {{infection}} {{is a frequent}} cause of mortality in Cambodian HIV-infected patients with CD 4 + count ≤ 100 cells/µl. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of three strategies for cryptococcosis prevention in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: A MARKOV DECISION TREE WAS USED TO COMPARE THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES AT THE TIME OF HIV DIAGNOSIS: no intervention, one time systematic serum cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) screening and treatment of positive patients, and systematic primary prophylaxis with fluconazole. The trajectory of a hypothetical cohort of HIV-infected patients with CD 4 + count ≤ 100 cells/µl initiating care was simulated over a 1 -year period (cotrimoxazole initiation at enrollment; antiretroviral therapy within 3 months). Natural history and cost data (US$ 2009) were from Cambodia. Efficacy data were from international literature. RESULTS: In a population in which 81 % of patients had a CD 4 + count ≤ 50 cells/ µl and 19 % a CD 4 + count between 51 - 100 cells/µl, the proportion alive 1 year after enrollment was 61 % (cost $ 472) with no intervention, 70 % (cost $ 483) with screening, and 72 % (cost $ 492) with prophylaxis. After one year of follow-up, the cost-effectiveness of <b>screening</b> <b>vs.</b> no intervention was US$ 180 /life year gained (LYG). The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis <b>vs.</b> <b>screening</b> was $ 511 /LYG. The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis <b>vs.</b> <b>screening</b> was estimated at $ 1538 /LYG if the proportion of patients with CD 4 + count ≤ 50 cells/µl decreased by 75 %. CONCLUSION: In a high endemic area of cryptococcosis and HIV infection, serum CRAG screening and prophylaxis are two cost effective strategies to prevent AIDS associated cryptococcosis in patients with CD 4 + count ≤ 100 cells/µl, at a short-term horizon, screening being more cost-effective but less effective than prophylaxis. Systematic primary prophylaxis may be preferred in patients with CD 4 + below 50 cells/µl while systematic serum CRAG screening for early targeted treatment may be preferred in patients with CD 4 + between 51 - 100 cells/µl...|$|R

We aim to provide a methodological framework for their systematic validation, by reference to that developed for oncology biomarkers. As for this discipline, the steps for the systematic validation of AD biomarkers need to target analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. However, the premises are different from oncology: the nature of disease (neurodegeneration vs. cancer), the purpose (improve diagnosis in clinically affected <b>vs.</b> <b>screening</b> preclinical individuals), and the target population (mild cognitive impairment patients referring to memory clinics vs. general population) lead to important differences, influencing both the design of validation studies {{and the use of}} selected biomarkers.

5000|$|This {{recommendation}} {{has been}} criticized by many prostate cancer experts for an over-reliance on findings of the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. This trial intended to randomize men between screening and no screening. However, because the study was initiated {{during a time when}} PSA screening was already becoming widely adopted, there were high rates of PSA testing among men who were in the control arm. This rate of [...] "contamination" [...] was very high: acknowledged by the authors to be 44% before the study started and 52% during the course of study. In fact, the rate was likely much higher, since over 90% of the prostate cancers found in the [...] "control" [...] arm were stage T1 or T2, which by definition can only be detected with screening. The PLCO authors stated in a later publication that the PLCO should not be interpreted as a trial of <b>screening</b> <b>vs.</b> no <b>screening,</b> but rather as a trial of annual <b>screening</b> <b>vs.</b> so-called opportunistic or ad-hoc screening. The USPSTF also based their assessment of the [...] "harms" [...] of screening and treatment based on a biased and out-dated literature review.
