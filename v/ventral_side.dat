5|$|Large chromatophores densely {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side.</b> The fins do not possess chromatophores on the underside. Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through pale yellow to brownish pink and brownish violet.|$|E
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her <b>ventral</b> <b>side,</b> the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The fairy shrimp {{is found}} in {{temporary}} pools of water, from seasonal ponds to muddy ruts, preferring sites with regular disturbance, such as passing tractors or livestock. It has {{a broad range of}} ecological tolerances, in terms of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH, but cannot coexist with predatory fish. C. diaphanus swims with its <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> upwards, and is a filter feeder, collecting zooplankton and detritus with its phyllopodia.|$|E

5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to the frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its <b>ventral</b> <b>side.</b> They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{has a small}} {{swelling}} on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of its elbow {{called the}} brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, {{and it has been}} shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi-volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris. The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex, age, health and nutritional status, and dominance.|$|E

50|$|And {{while most}} {{octopuses}} are cannibalistic, {{and have to}} exercise extreme caution while mating, these octopuses mate with their <b>ventral</b> <b>sides</b> touching, pressing their beaks and suckers together in an intimate embrace.|$|R
50|$|The Bombinatoridae {{are often}} {{referred}} to as fire-bellied toads because of their brightly colored <b>ventral</b> <b>sides,</b> which show they are highly toxic. This family includes two genera, Barbourula and Bombina, both of which have flattened bodies.|$|R
5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray has a thin, oval {{pectoral fin}} disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front. The elongated snout {{has a wide}} base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc. The eyes are minute and widely spaced; behind them are large spiracles. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae (two to four large at the center and one to four small to the sides) on the floor. The small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands. There are five pairs of gill slits on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the disc. The pelvic fins are small and thin; mature males have relatively large claspers.|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} system {{is made up}} in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the olfactory bulb (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb. Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC). The AOC gives rise to the olfactory tract, which ends in the olfactory bulb.|$|E

50|$|Like {{almost all}} heterobranchs, Glaucus is a hermaphrodite, having {{both male and}} female {{reproductive}} organs. Unlike most nudibranchs, which mate with their right sides facing, sea swallows mate with <b>ventral</b> <b>sides</b> facing. After mating, both animals produce egg strings.|$|R

25|$|Recent Mesothelae are {{characterized}} by the narrow sternum on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the prosoma. Several plesiomorphic characteristics {{may be useful in}} recognizing these spiders: there are tergite plates on the dorsal side and the almost-median position of the spinnerets on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the opisthosoma. Although it has been claimed that they lack venom glands and ducts, which almost all other spiders feature, subsequent works have demonstrated that at least some, possibly all, do in fact have both the glands and ducts. All Mesothelae have eight spinnerets in four pairs. Like mygalomorph spiders, they have two pairs of book lungs.|$|E
25|$|A related species, {{commonly}} found in North America, is Steatoda borealis. This spider is similar to S. grossa in shape, but slightly smaller, and is generally found in colder climates. This spider can be identified by colored markings on the dorsal side of its abdomen {{rather than on the}} <b>ventral</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
25|$|The abdomen is {{also known}} as the opisthosoma. On the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the abdomen are two {{hardened}} plates covering the book lungs. These are called the epigastric plates. A fold, known as the epigastric furrow, separates the region of the book lungs and epigyne from the more posterior part of the abdomen. In the middle of this furrow is the opening of the oviduct (in females) and at either end are the lung slits.|$|E

50|$|This orange {{coloured}} fritillary has rows of dark dots or chevrons at {{the wing}} edges and black or brown lines more proximally. The <b>ventral</b> <b>sides</b> of the wings are also orange with several rows of white dots. Its wingspan is between 51 and 73 mm.|$|R
25|$|The urajiro (cream {{to white}} ventral color) is {{required}} in the following areas on all coat colors: {{on the sides of}} the muzzle, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs, on the abdomen, around the vent and the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the tail. On reds: commonly on the throat, forechest, and chest. On blacks and sesames: commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the forechest.|$|E
25|$|The terga on {{segments}} II through VI of {{the abdomen}} are dark {{and have an}} almost triangular silvery-white marking on the base that is not aligned with the silvery bands of scales on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the abdomen. The triangular marking and the silvery band are only aligned on abdominal segment VII. The transparent wings have white spots {{on the base of}} the costae. With older mosquito specimens, the scales could be partially worn off, making these characteristics not stand out as much.|$|E
25|$|They usually roost {{with their}} <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> flat against a surface. The Mauritian tomb bat is nocturnal and rests during the day; however, {{it does not}} sleep much and remains watchful while {{roosting}}. If disturbed, they will fly off to another site or move quickly up under the eaves of the building. Very rarely do they travel far from their day roosting site, and roosts are often recolonized. Over time these sites become stained with gular sack secretions and urine. The stains are typically a rectangular brown shape roughly 150mm long and 100mm wide.|$|E
50|$|Generally, Neurergus {{species are}} dark-colored (brown to black) above, with {{a pattern of}} white to yellow to orange spots and lines. On their <b>ventral</b> <b>sides,</b> the lighter color of their spots becomes a solid color. Like most salamanders, they have five toes on their hind feet.|$|R

25|$|In {{this species}} {{the color of}} the shell is very variable. The {{background}} color can be whitish to greenish yellow, and the shell often has darker coloured bands or spots. The <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the shell frequently has two brown bands, and is whitish between the lowest band and the umbilicus. The shell has 4-4.5 whorls. The last whorl descends abruptly below the periphery of the shell. The apertural margin is white, and is reflected (turned back)in adult shells, in juveniles this is true only on the columellar side. The umbilicus is narrow and open in juveniles, only partly covered by the reflected columellar margin,; the umbilicus is however completely closed in adult shells.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{openings}} {{through the}} head of Bothriolepis: a keyhole opening along the midline on the upper side for the eyes and nostrils and an opening for the mouth on the lower side near the anterior end of the head. A discovery regarding preserved structures {{that appear to be}} nasal capsules confirms the belief that the external nasal openings lay on the dorsal side of the head near the eyes. Additionally, the position of the mouth on the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of the skull is consistent with the typical horizontal resting orientation of Bothriolepis. It had a special feature on its skull, a separate partition of bone below the opening for the eyes and nostrils enclosing the nasal capsules called a preorbital recess.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>ventral</b> <b>side</b> of {{the head}} is a lenslike window, admitting light to the naupliar eye, which is aimed both dorsally and ventrally. The first {{antennae}} (antennules) are small, slender filaments on the ventral surface {{of the head}}, {{at about the same}} level as the eyes. The second antennae are similar and lie laterally to the first. They are nonfunctioning. The large, well-developed mandibles oppose each other across the ventral midline. The opposing surfaces bear strong brownish teeth. As the crustacean periodically opens and closes the mandibles the teeth move apart and close together. Of the usual crustacean head appendages, only the mandibles are well developed. In Triops longicaudatus, the larger second maxillae are absent, only maxillules being present.|$|E
