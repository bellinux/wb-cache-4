50|$|The Dunlop valve, (also {{called a}} Woods valve or an English valve) {{is a type}} of {{pneumatic}} valve stem in use in some countries, such as Japan, Czech Republic, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Poland, Romania, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and a number of developing countries, mostly on bicycle inner tubes.

50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which a valve seat may be {{improperly}} positioned or machined. These include incomplete seating during the press fitting-step, distortion of the nominally circular valve seat surfaces such they deviate unacceptably from perfect roundness or waviness, tilt of the machined surfaces relative to the <b>valve</b> guide <b>hole</b> axis, deviation of the valve seat surfaces from concentricity with the <b>valve</b> guide <b>holes,</b> and deviation of the machined conical section of the valve seat from the cone angle that is required to match the valve surface.

40|$|Since {{there are}} no large natural energy {{resources}} in Belarus, energy savings {{ought to be a}} point of the special attention. With this regard it is important to develop modern ways of savings during the process of air conditioning inside new buildings with an air layer in the enclosure, especially in translucent ones. The system of ventilation of air layers in the enclosure of a building has been introduced in which air movement is caused by the gravitational and aerodynamic forces. It makes it possible to arrange further ventilation – a natural, forced or a hybrid one. With the purpose of increasing and streamlining natural draught the partitions are used separating the different parts of air layers. For natural ventilation with the use of gravitational forces the holes in the upper and lower parts of the partitions between adjacent air layers are applied. Natural ventilation in the holes of the partitions is regulated by movable shutters, blinds or other adjusting devices. For combined or forced air exchange between adjacent zones of air layers fans are used pumping air from the air layer zones with a higher temperature to zones of air layers with lower temperature and vice versa. When air exchange is forced, in order to intensify the infiltration of air into zones of air layers jets are laid on a hard surface. In order to cool a multi-layered enclosure of a building, where the movement of air between the air layers (that have been formed by internal partitions) is being fulfilled by a natural, forced or combined mode, a part of the air or the total air processed inside the building (i. e. conditioned or non-conditioned air cooler as compared with the outside one) is being sent to these strata. Combined or forced flow of the air processed inside the building into the air layers is done through the ducts associated with the output channels of the air conditioners.

40|$|Sinus node {{dysfunction}} or sick sinus syndrome (SSS) includes {{clinical conditions}} such as symptomatic sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses or arrest, sinus node exit block, atrial tachycardias and chronotropic incompetence. Even though SSS incidence increases in an exponential-like manner with age, it can occur at all ages, including in the newborn. The mean age of patients with the syndrome is 68 years, with both genders being affected in approximately equal proportion. This condition occurs in 1 of every 600 cardiac patients over 65. Degenerative fibrosis of the tissues of the node has been suggested to be a common cause of SSS. Although it is still disputed. SSS is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation and flutter, tachy-bradycardia syndrome. Tachy-bradycardia syndrome is defined as sinus bradycardia coupled with atrial flutter/fibrillation or reciprocal atrial tachycardia. This syndrome is common in young patients following a surgical treatment of a congenital heart disease. Patients with chronic or persistent atrial flutter/fibrillation show high rates of cardiovascular disorders and mortality while sinus bradycardia is thought as an independent risk factor of atrial flutter/fibrillation. There are certain restrictions to medical treatment: long-term administration of the same medication (sotalol, amiodarone) for atrial flutter/fibrillation can cause symptomatic bradycardia while administration of other medication (a class 1 drug) {{increases the likelihood of}} ventricular arrythmias or evident bradycardia that enhances the risk of sudden cardiac death. Following atrial fibrillation ablation patients saw a significant improvement in the sinus node function, or saw a better sinus node function disrupted due to remodelling that takes place during atrial fibrillation. The surgical methods applications proved most efficient in non-medicational treatment of atrial fibrillation. In the late 1980 s American surgeon J. L. Cox developed a so-called Maze procedure. This is what it is about. The mechanism of atrial fibrillation is regarded as macro-reentry, i. e. there are several circuits for reentrant excitation (base of the pulmonary vein, mitral and tricuspid <b>valves,</b> other <b>holes,</b> particularly the auricle, etc.). The operation involves electrical isolation (cuts and criotherapy) of these areas and transition of three internodal paths into one.

40|$|A simple design {{concept for}} check valves {{has been adopted}} for {{microfluidic}} devices that consist mostly of (1) deformable fluorocarbon polymer membranes sandwiched between (2) borosilicate float glass wafers into which channels, <b>valve</b> seats, and <b>holes</b> have been etched. The first microfluidic devices in which these check valves are intended to be used are micro-capillary electrophoresis (microCE) devices undergoing development for use on Mars in detecting compounds indicative of life. In this application, {{it will be necessary}} to store some liquid samples in reservoirs in the devices for subsequent laboratory analysis, and check valves are needed to prevent cross-contamination of the samples. The simple check-valve design concept is also applicable to other microfluidic devices and to fluidic devices in general. These check valves are simplified microscopic versions of conventional rubber- flap check valves that are parts of numerous industrial and consumer products. These check valves are fabricated, not as separate components, but as integral parts of microfluidic devices. A check valve according to this concept consists of suitably shaped portions of a deformable membrane and the two glass wafers between which the membrane is sandwiched (see figure). The valve flap is formed by making an approximately semicircular cut in the membrane. The flap is centered over a hole in the lower glass wafer, through which hole the liquid in question is intended to flow upward into a wider hole, channel, or reservoir in the upper glass wafer. The radius of the cut exceeds the radius of the hole by an amount large enough to prevent settling of the flap into the hole. As in a conventional rubber-flap check valve, back pressure in the liquid pushes the flap against the valve seat (in this case, the valve seat is the adjacent surface of the lower glass wafer), thereby forming a seal that prevents backflow...|$|R

40|$|Eight animals {{died from}} 1 to 6 {{years after the}} operation, from {{undetermined}} diseases, or from pneumonia. Two animals are still alive 7 years after the operation. 1. Condition of the Pleural and Pericardial Cavities. —In the first experiments, extensive pleural and pericardial adhesions were observed 1 year and more after the patching of the pulmonary artery. There was also {{a great deal of}} fibrous tissue between the pulmonary artery, the aorta, and the left auricle. In the other experiments, the adhesions of the lungs, pleura, and pericardium were less marked. This was due to some improvements in the technique of handling the viscera. At the time of the operations, it was hoped that no pleural or pericardial adhesions would occur. Great care was taken not to injure the endothelial surfaces by rough handling or by sponging. No blood was allowed to flow into the pleural cavity. The surface of the pericardium was protected by fine silk membranes. The pleural cavity was occluded by thick pads made of cotton and Japanese silk. It seemed that the serous surfaces were almost completely protected against infection and mechanical irritation. The occurrence of primary pleurisy and pericarditis was prevented by this technique. But the development of adhesions in several of the experiments shows that the procedures for the handling of the viscera should be perfected. 2. Condition of the Arterial Wall. —In the experiments in which the orifice was patched, a slight dilatation of the artery was observed. It was not possible to ascertain from the specimen preserved in formaldehyde {{whether or not there was}} an insufficiency of the valves. It is probable that there was no leakage, as in none of these cases could any diastolic murmur be heard 6 months after the operation. The only animal which presented clinical evidence of pulmonary insufficiency died during the War. The normal condition of the pulmonary orifice was due to the incision which did not extend far enough on the ventricle, and to the power of redintegration possessed by an organ which is not diseased. The cicatrization of the grafted flap was excellent. Its outline could not be seen on the external side of the wall. Even after opening the artery, the transplant could not be located easily. However, in Experiment 1 the anterior wall of the artery showed a depression about 7 or 8 mm. wide, 18 mm. long, and 2 or 3 mm. deep, behind and above the anterior valve. But the flap was made of human artery, and it is known that a heteroplastic graft always undergoes some dilatation. When transplants of dog tissue were used, no dilatation occurred and the location of the patch could hardly be detected. In Experiment 7, 6 years after the operation, the endothelial surface was smooth, glistening, and no scar could be seen. However, the upper and lower parts of the incision were marked by a slight depression of the wall. The presence of the patch was detected by a distinct thickening of the wall. Although the edges of the incision had not been sutured to the edges of the flap, the endothelial surface was quite smooth. A transverse section of the artery was made through the middle part of the flap in Experiment 4. It showed the width of the arterial opening and the way in which the transplant became adherent to the arterial wall. The examination of these four specimens demonstrated that, in spite of the unfavorable location of the graft, an excellent union had taken place. It showed that homoplastic or heteroplastic tissue can be transplanted onto the pulmonary artery as well as onto the smaller arteries. Where the arterial wall had simply been incised without interposition of a patch, a linear scar was always found. 6 years after the operation, the incision used in the course of an operation for cauterization of the sigmoid and sutured with heavy thread was transformed into a linear scar and the surface of the intima was quite smooth. 3. Condition of the Sigmoid Valves. —In three experiments, the sigmoid valves had been cauterized along their margin and their point of insertion in the artery. One of the animals was still living 7 years after the operation. There was no diastolic murmur. The other animals died 3 and 6 years after the operation. The valves were thin and transparent, and quite normal. However, one of the <b>valves</b> showed two <b>holes,</b> one near the base and the other near the margin. The animal on which the section of the right posterior valve without suture was performed, died 2 or 3 years after the operation. The edges of the incision had not united. They were thickened and the whole valve was rigid. The surface was rough and irregular. No permanent result was obtained by the union of two sigmoid valves by a stitch. There was no stenosis of the orifice, and no union of the valves 4 years after the operation. The stitch had disappeared. There was some scar tissue at the common point of insertion of the posterior valves, which were more rigid and showed thickened edges. 7 years after the section and suture of a sigmoid had been performed, the animal was still living and in good health. No diastolic murmur could be detected...|$|R
