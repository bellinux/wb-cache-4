5000|$|Circuit {{breakers}} with vacuum interrupters have minimal arcing characteristics (as {{there is}} nothing to ionize other than the contact material), so the arc quenches when it is stretched by a small amount (<2-8 mm). Near zero current the arc is not hot enough to maintain a plasma, and current ceases; the gap can then withstand the rise of voltage. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers are frequently used in modern medium-voltage switchgear to 40,500 volts. Unlike the other types, they are inherently unsuitable for interrupting DC faults. The reason <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> breakers are unsuitable for breaking high DC voltages is that with DC there is no [...] "current zero" [...] period. The plasma arc can feed itself by continuing to gasify the contact material.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first and}} most widely used {{relaxation}} oscillator circuit, the astable multivibrator, was invented in 1917 by French engineers Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch.

25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause dielectric breakdown and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older <b>vacuum</b> tube <b>circuits,</b> particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many <b>vacuum</b> tube <b>circuits,</b> interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube.

40|$|The {{vacuum tube}} {{was the first}} {{enabling}} technology {{in the development of}} data converters—starting in the 1920 s and continuing well into the late 1950 s. As discussed in Chapter 1 of this book, the vacuum tube was invented by Lee De Forest in 1906 (Reference 1). A figure from the patent is shown in Figure 4. 1. Vacuum tubes quickly found their way into a variety of electronic equipment, and the Bell Telephone system began using vacuum tube amplifiers in their telephone plants as early as 1914.

50|$|Trains {{bound for}} Moorgate {{approach}} Drayton Park on a falling gradient, drawing power via the pantograph until a trackside Automatic Power Control (APC) magnet opens the <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Circuit</b> Breaker (VCB) {{on the roof}} of the train, cutting off power. This prevents the driver from powering into the tunnel with the pantograph raised. After coasting to a stand the driver lowers the pantograph and changes over to DC. On journeys from Moorgate traction power is maintained into Drayton Park for the rising gradient, since if the driver forgets to change to AC no damage will occur to the train. Once the train is at a stand the driver selects AC traction and raises the pantograph.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Keio-Giken (Korg) {{released}} {{their first}} rhythm machine, Donca-Matic DA-20, using <b>vacuum</b> tube <b>circuits</b> for sounds and mechanical-wheel for rhythm patterns.

Its price was comparable with the average annual income of Japanese at that time. Their efforts were then focused on the improvement of reliability and performance, along with the size reduction and the cost down. Unstable <b>vacuum</b> tube <b>circuit</b> was replaced with reliable transistor circuitry on Donca-Matic DC-11 in the mid-1960s, and in 1966, bulky mechanical-wheels were also replaced with compact transistor circuitry on Donca-Matic DE-20 and DE-11. In 1967, Korg Mini Pops MP-2 was developed as an option of the Yamaha Electone (electronic organ), and Mini Pops was established as a series of compact desktop rhythm machines.|$|R

50|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the <b>vacuum</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker can force the current {{in the circuit}} to zero, before the natural zero and reversal of current in the alternating current circuit. Additionally, if the timing of interrupter operation is unfavorable {{with respect to the}} ac voltage waveform, when the arc has extinguished but the contacts are still moving and ionization has not yet dissipated in the interrupter, the applied voltage may exceed the withstand voltage of the gap. This can cause reignition of the arc and abrupt transient currents. In either of these cases, oscillations are introduced in the system, and may result in significant overvoltage. Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters address these concerns by selection of contact materials and contact designs selected to minimize current chopping. To protect apparatus from overvoltages, vacuum switchgear assemblies will usually include surge arrester components to prevent damaging over voltage.|$|E
