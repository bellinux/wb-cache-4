5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond <b>visual</b> <b>range,</b> it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E

5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known to defend itself quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b> Young sharks are reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding ecotourism dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSecchi disk depth (ZSD) is {{a measure}} of water transparency, whose {{interpretation}} has wide applications from diver visibility to studies of climate change. This transparency has been explained in the past 60 + years with the underwater visibility theory, the branch of the general visibility theory for <b>visual</b> <b>ranging</b> in water. However, through a thorough review of the physical processes involved in <b>visual</b> <b>ranging</b> in water, we show that this theory may not exactly represent the sighting of a Secchi disk by a human eye. Further, we update the Law of Contrast Reduction, a key concept in visibility theory, and develop a new theoretical model to interpret ZSD. Unlike the classical model that relies strongly on the beam attenuation coefficient, the new model relies only on the diffuse attenuation coefficient at a wavelength corresponding to the maximum transparency for such interpretations. This model is subsequently validated using a large (N= 338) dataset of independent measurements covering oceanic, coastal, and lake waters, with results showing excellent agreement (~ 18 % average absolute difference, R 2 = 0. 96) between measured and theoretically predicted ZSD ranging from 30 m without regional tuning of any model parameters. This study provides a more generalized view of <b>visual</b> <b>ranging,</b> and the mechanistic model is expected to significantly improve the current capacity in monitoring water transparency of the global aquatic environments via satellite remote sensing...|$|R

5|$|The {{objective}} in Days of Ruin {{is for the}} player to use their military force to defeat the enemy's force. Except for certain single player missions with special objectives, {{there are two ways}} to defeat an opponent: destroy all of the enemy's units or capture their headquarters. The battle system is turn-based. Two to four forces, each headed by a commanding officer (CO), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps. Every turn, units, which consist of ground, sea and air units, can move across the different types of terrain and attack enemy units or perform other actions, such as submerging a submarine or resupplying friendly units. Many factors can affect the battle, such as Fog of War, a phenomenon that prevents players from seeing enemy units other than those in the <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> of their units; various weather conditions; and CO powers.|$|E

25|$|The South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter {{aircraft}} are also equipped with PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi. This all-weather radar system {{is capable of}} locating and identifying air targets 120km away and surface targets 70km away. It is also able to automatically track multiple targets in {{the upper and lower}} spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several beyond <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously (although the Air Force still lacks modern beyond <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> missile capability). When deployed operationally on combat missions and air patrols the aircraft can link their systems to the South African National Defence Force's digital network protocol, Link ZA, to share data with other radar systems to help create a wider picture as to the situation in the air and on the ground in order to rapidly adapt to a change in short term situations.|$|E
25|$|For much {{of their}} service with the airships, the Sparrowhawks' {{effectiveness}} was greatly hampered by their poor radio equipment, and they were effectively limited to remaining {{within sight of the}} airship.

25|$|The use {{of vocal}} and visual {{communication}} {{has been shown}} to vary by location, based on elements such as noise pollution and the amount of open space. For instance, populations living in large cities generally rely more on the visual signals, due to the generally louder environment with more areas without much visual restriction. However, in heavily wooded areas, vocal signals are used more often due to the relatively lower noise levels and a dense canopy restricting <b>visual</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

40|$|In Japan, {{aging of}} infrastructures, such as roads, bridges, {{and water and}} sewer services, etc. poses a problem, and it is {{required}} to extend the life-span of such infrastructures by maintenance.

25|$|The Tornado ADV was {{designed}} {{to serve in the}} role of an interceptor against the threat of Soviet bombers, rather than as an air superiority fighter for engaging in prolonged air combat manoeuvering with various types of enemy fighters. In order to perform its anti-bomber primary mission, it was equipped with long range beyond <b>visual</b> <b>range</b> missiles such as the Skyflash, and later the AMRAAM; the aircraft also had the ability to stay aloft for long periods and remain over the North Sea and Northern Atlantic in order to maintain its airborne patrol. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged the Tornado ADV was not as significantly superior an aircraft to the Phantoms it had replaced in the air-defence role. However, the capability of its weapon systems was a dramatic improvement; in particular the radar and onboard computer facilities. Compared with the Phantom, the ADV had greater acceleration, twice the range and loiter time, and was more capable of operating from short 'austere' air strips.|$|E

To achieve the grand goal, we propose an approach that jointly tackles object-level image segmentation and semantic region labeling within a conditional random field (CRF) framework.

The learned priors, together with spatial and geometric contexts, are incorporated in CRF. With this formulation, <b>visual</b> and <b>range</b> data are fused thoroughly, and moreover, the coupled segmentation and semantic labeling problem can be inferred via Graph Cuts.
