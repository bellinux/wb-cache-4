5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a <b>viscous</b> <b>fluid</b> {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{nonlinearity}} {{is due to}} convective acceleration, {{which is}} an acceleration associated with the change in velocity over position.

25|$|When {{surfaces}} in contact move relative to each other, the {{friction between the}} two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (that is, it converts work to heat).

Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a <b>viscous</b> <b>fluid</b> is stirred.

25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{inertial}} forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities, in {{what is known as}} a boundary layer {{in the case of a}} bounding surface such as the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of higher velocity fluid, such as the hot gases from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow. Counteracting this effect is the viscosity of the fluid, which as it increases, progressively inhibits turbulence, as more kinetic energy is absorbed by a more <b>viscous</b> <b>fluid.</b> The Reynolds number quantifies the relative importance of these two types of forces for given flow conditions, and is a guide to when turbulent flow will occur in a particular situation.|$|E
25|$|Full flow penetrometers (T-bar, ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the T-bar is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a <b>viscous</b> <b>fluid.</b> The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.|$|E

500|$|The {{deduction}} {{of the boundary}} layer equations {{was one of the}} most important advances in fluid dynamics. Using an order of magnitude analysis, the well-known governing Navier–Stokes equations of <b>viscous</b> <b>fluid</b> flow can be greatly simplified within the boundary layer. Notably, the characteristic of the partial differential equations (PDE) becomes parabolic, rather than the elliptical form of the full Navier–Stokes equations. This greatly simplifies the solution of the equations. By making the boundary layer approximation, the flow is divided into an inviscid portion (which is easy to solve by a number of methods) and the boundary layer, which is governed by an easier to solve PDE. The continuity and Navier–Stokes equations for a two-dimensional steady incompressible flow in Cartesian coordinates are given by ...|$|E
500|$|Drosera anglica is a {{perennial}} herb which forms an upright, stemless rosette of generally [...] leaves.

These consist of a knot of tightly curled leaves at ground level, which unfurl in spring {{at the end of}} the dormancy period. The root system is weak and penetrates only a few centimeters, serving mainly as an anchor and for water absorption. Nitrogen is in short supply in bogs and trapping and digesting insects provides an alternate source.|$|E
