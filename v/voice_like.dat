25|$|Davros is {{from the}} planet Skaro, whose people, the Kaleds, {{were engaged in a}} bitter thousand-year war of {{attrition}} with their enemies, the Thals. He is horribly scarred and disabled, a condition that various spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He has one functioning hand and one cybernetic eye mounted on his forehead {{to take the place of}} his real eyes, which he is not able to open for long; for much of his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile life-support chair in place of his lower body. It would become an obvious inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The lower half of his body is absent and he is physically incapable of leaving the chair for more than a few minutes without dying. Davros' <b>voice,</b> <b>like</b> those of the Daleks, is electronically distorted. His manner of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the hysterical, staccatissimo speech of the Daleks.|$|E

500|$|The proverbial use of {{the corn}} crake's call to {{describe}} someone with a grating or unmelodious voice is illustrated in the quotation [...] "thanks to a wee woman with a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> a corncrake who believed she was an apprentice angel". This usage dates from {{at least the first}} half of the nineteenth century, and continues through to the present.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's voice also {{received}} critical attention. New York Times critic Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as [...] "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk's." [...] David Bowie, in his tribute, [...] "Song for Bob Dylan", described Dylan's singing as [...] "a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> sand and glue". His voice continued to develop {{as he began}} to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] as [...] "at once young and jeeringly cynical". As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition, [...] "Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs—this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in [...] "Everything is Broken" [...] (on the album Oh Mercy) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality." ...|$|E

5000|$|MacinTalk 3 {{introduced}} {{a great variety}} of voices. Apart from the standard adult voices [...] "Ralph", [...] "Fred" [...] and [...] "Kathy", and children's <b>voices</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Princess" [...] and [...] "Junior", various novelty voices were included, including [...] "Whisper", [...] "Zarvox" [...] (a robot voice with melodic background sounds, with a similar voice called [...] "Trinoids" [...] also included), [...] "Cellos" [...] (a voice that sung its text to an Edvard Grieg tune, with similarly-singing <b>voices</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Good News", [...] "Bad News", [...] "Pipe Organ"), [...] "Albert" [...] (a hoarse-sounding voice), [...] "Bells", [...] "Boing", [...] "Bubbles", and others.|$|R
500|$|Tina Hart of MSN UK {{stated that}} [...] " [...] {{maintain}} her ‘badass’ demeanour. Britney’s familiar tones greet {{you on the}} verse and Kesha sounds perfectly {{at home on the}} chorus." [...] Wesley Case of The Baltimore Sun stated that while Spears sounds processed, [...] "Minaj's larger-than-life performance matches the in-the-red party production" [...] and Kesha [...] "adds an extra layer of dirt-under-the-nails sheen." [...] He summarized his review by saying that the remix [...] "is the perfect example of pop's current love affair with Euro dance [...] and add-it-all-to-the-pot rules." [...] Jordan Zakarin of The Huffington Post commented the track [...] "has enough star power to dwarf our own sun" [...] and added that it [...] "puts enough of a spin on the original version to make it worth a spin on its own." [...] Samesame.com.au stated that Minaj's rap was [...] "fantastic", and that although Kesha's verse was [...] "a little strange", it also [...] "works, but [...] further emphasises what a poor choice for single Till The World Ends was in the first place, as the song sounds even more like a B-side to Ke$ha’s Cannibal EP." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice highlighted the breakdown and Minaj [...] "who seems particularly energized here, stretching and bending her <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> it's a Plasticman doll." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "like most remixes, we’ll stick with the original". Anderson also stated that Kesha's contribution is [...] "generally ignorable" [...] and that Minaj's rap does not flow well {{with the rest of the}} song. Pitchfork Media included the Femme Fatale Remix in their Top 100 Tracks of 2011 list, writing: ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> it was a thing of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and sets the tone of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a musical box, echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was like this <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's going to affect ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "There's no disclaimer on [...] at all, because it's two heterosexual men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality... because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] is so gay it's excluding a large part of our society. A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E

50|$|Despite its short life, it is {{considered}} one of the most important German literary magazines of early modernism. The magazine published texts from already well-known authors like Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Rainer Maria Rilke as well as from new <b>voices</b> <b>like</b> Robert Walser.|$|R

2500|$|Hudson's version {{received}} outstanding {{reviews from}} multiple movie and music critics, which highlighted her strength {{as both a}} vocalist and an actress. New York Observer described Hudson's performance as [...] "five mellifluous, molto vibrato minutes...." [...] Newsweek said that when moviegoers hear Hudson sing the song, she [...] "is going to raise goose bumps across the land." [...] Variety wrote that Hudson's performance [...] "calls to mind debuts like Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl or Bette Midler in The Rose, with a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> the young Aretha." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another source, Lift Up Your <b>Voice</b> <b>Like</b> A Trumpet: White Clergy And The Civil Rights And Antiwar Movements, 1954–1973 {{explains}} {{the story of}} the entire spectrum of the clergy and their involvement. Michael Freidland is able to completely tell the story in his chapter entitled, [...] "A Voice of Moderation: Clergy and the Anti-War Movement: 1966–1967". In basic summary, each specific clergy from each religion had their own view of the war and how they dealt with it, but as a whole, the clergy was completely against the war.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing wrong}} with Ledsam," [...] {{declared}} a gruff voice from the corner. [...] "And don't gossip, you fellows, {{at the top of}} your <b>voices</b> <b>like</b> a lot of old women. He'll be calling here for me in a moment or two." ...|$|R

2500|$|Stone {{possesses}} the vocal {{range of a}} mezzo-soprano and contralto. She's famous for performing barefoot and {{has been described as}} [...] "the white Aretha Franklin" [...] since her debut in music industry. [...] Although, Stone did receive criticism and was questioned as a singer because of her background. Her audience expected [...] soul artists to have been born in poverty and have had a rough and painful life in order to sing soul music because of how emotional it is. People also expected someone with a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> Stone's to be black.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{drawback}} of ELF is {{that the}} ELF band has very small bandwidth, and therefore can only transmit very simple messages, very slowly. ELF signals cannot carry audio (<b>voice)</b> <b>like</b> other types of radio, and can only carry short text messages consisting of a few letters. The US Navy system (above) reportedly uses three-letter code groups and requires 15 minutes to transmit one group. So current systems {{are not used to}} transmit detailed orders, but serve a [...] "bell ringer" [...] function, to order a specific vessel to surface and receive further orders by ordinary radio or satellite communication.|$|E
2500|$|In The Hollow, {{published}} {{as late as}} 1946, {{one of the more}} unsympathetic characters is [...] "a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> a corncrake... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed [...] "foreigners" [...] as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (Hallowe'en Party) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story [...] "How Does Your Garden Grow?"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in Three Act Tragedy), but they are rarely the culprits.|$|E
5000|$|Gidh {{will have}} six {{original}} songs {{and be a}} music driven film. [...] The soundtrack {{of the film is}} composed by Kamran Akhtar. According to media reports, Gidh soundtrack features heart-breaking <b>voices</b> <b>like</b> Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Shujat Ali Khan, Amanat Ali and Indian singer Sukhwinder Singh as playback singers.|$|R

2500|$|John's {{vision of}} the Son of Man is {{described}} in the scriptural Revelation [...] John sees a {{vision of the}} risen, ascended and glorified Jesus Christ, whom he describes as one [...] "like the Son of Man" [...] (verse 12). Jesus is portrayed in this vision as having a robe with a golden sash, white hair, eyes like blazing fire, feet like bronze and a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> rushing waters. He holds seven stars in his right hand and has a double-edged sword coming out of his mouth. The vision is also notable for being the only identifiable physical description of Jesus in any form in the Biblical canon.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant George Douglas Brewerton {{made one}} coast-to-coast dispatch-carrying trip to Washington, D.C. with Carson. Brewerton wrote: [...] "The Kit Carson of my {{imagination}} was {{over six feet}} high— a sort of modern Hercules in his build— with an enormous beard, and a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> a roused lion ... The real Kit Carson I {{found to be a}} plain, simple ... man; rather below the medium height, with brown, curling hair, little or no beard, and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman's. In fact, the hero of a hundred desperate encounters, whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness, where the white man is almost unknown, was one of Dame Nature's gentleman ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} parodied {{in a series}} of {{animated}} Looney Tunes shorts, in which the principal characters, Ralph and Alice Cramden and Ed and Trixie Morton, are depicted as mice and Ralph's [...] "big dream" [...] is like to get enough cheese to impress Alice. These cartoons are The Honey-Mousers (1956), Cheese It, the Cat! (1957), and Mice Follies (1960). Human caricatures of Ralph and Ed are pitted against Bugs Bunny in the 1956 Warner cartoon Half-Fare Hare. And in another cartoon, A Bird in a Bonnet (1958), when Sylvester falls into an open manhole, inside a <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> Ed Norton's says, [...] "Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hey, look at this, Ralph, a pussycat." [...] To which Sylvester simply peers out of the sewer to the audience.|$|E

5000|$|Colonial lobbies {{emerged to}} legitimize the Scramble for Africa and other {{expensive}} overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, {{the middle class}} often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market's growth. Even in lesser powers, <b>voices</b> <b>like</b> Enrico Corradini claimed a [...] "place in the sun" [...] for so-called [...] "proletarian nations", bolstering nationalism and militarism in an early prototype of fascism.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, aye," [...] said Mr. Macey, in {{the height}} of complacency; [...] "our family's been known for musicianers {{as far back as}} anybody can tell.
