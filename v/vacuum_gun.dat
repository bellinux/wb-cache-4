40|$|A new dc {{high voltage}} spin-polarized {{photoelectron}} gun has been constructed that employs a compact inverted-geometry ceramic insulator. Photogun performance at 100 kV bias voltage is summarized. I. INTRODUCTION All {{of the nuclear}} physics experiments conducted at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) receive electron beams from a dc high voltage spin-polarized GaAs photoemission gun. Since 1995, the year the first polarized electron source was installed at CEBAF [1], there have been four different photogun designs with each new gun an improvement over its predecessor. The most recent design employs a compact, tapered ceramic insulator that extends into the <b>vacuum</b> chamber. This <b>gun</b> geometry is {{commonly referred to as}} an ‘‘inverted’’ gun design, a reference to the first such implementation by Breidenbach et al., at SLAC [2]. The main reason for pursuing the inverted ceramic design at Jefferson Lab was to help overcome field emission problems of the previous gun design that used a conventional large-bore cylindrical ceramic insulator common to most dc high voltage spin-polarized GaAs photoguns worldwide [3 – 7]. The inverted insulator design helped to eliminate field emission because it provided a means to increase the distance between biased and grounded parts of the photogun. This helped reduce the field gradient at some locations not related to beam delivery. Perhaps more importantly, the design significantly reduced the amount of metal biased at high voltage, so there is less metal to generate field emission. Another appealing feature of the design is that the insulator is a common element of medical x-ray sources, and therefore relatively inexpensive compared to cylindrical insulators purchased solely for accelerator electron gun applications. This paper describes the CEBAF invertedgun design, construction, and performance...|$|R
40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringElectron {{bunching}} is {{an interesting}} issue with practical and scientific applications. In this thesis, I will present two topics of electron bunching in <b>vacuum</b> devices: electron <b>gun,</b> linear accelerator. For the electron gun, I will present a theoretical approach of bunching condition in dc-biased ac-driven vacuum devices. There are two different approaches. The one is electron bunching from a DC-biased single surface multipactor. Generation of electron bunch from a dc biased, single surface multipactor was studied theoretically and by PIC simulations. The condition for a spatially narrow bunch was obtained and verified by PIC simulations. This kind of multipactor is proposed {{to be used as}} a compact electron gun for various applications, such as linear accelerators. The other one is a theoretical correlation between the periodicity of an electron micro-bunch train and the transit phase of each electrons passing through a vacuum gap in a dc-biased ac-driven diode was derived. The upper frequency limitation by the transit time effect could be explained by abnormal exclusion of a certain range of transit phase analyzed for the first time by our theory. In a particle-in-cell simulation guided by our theory to evade the deficiency, a micro-bunch train with 1. 41 picosecond periodicity (0. 707 THz) could be obtained from a gap of 50 μm regarded as excessively large owing to severe suffering from the transit time effect. For the linear accelerator, A 9. 3 GHz 6 MeV linear accelerator (LINAC) was analyzed by using three-dimensional (3 D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations with 3 D time-domain electromagnetic simulations. In the 3 D PIC simulations, field data of a p / 2 standing wave mode extracted from the 3 D time-domain field calculations were injected into a side-coupled LINAC composed of 25 acceleration and 24 coupling cavities. Acceleration of an electron beam of 20 kV, 300 mA in the 3 D full LINAC structure was analyzed without spatial or time segmentations, which resulted in maximum energy of 6 MeV and average current of 68. 5 mA when 9. 3 GHz, 1. 6 MW radio frequency (RF) power was assumed. By virtue of in-depth data from the 3 D electromagnetic and PIC simulations aided by a one-dimensional (1 D) particle code developed by ourselves, the analysis for a full LINAC structure being reported first in this paper, may be informative and useful because experimental reports about an X-band (9. 3 GHz) 6 MeV side-coupled LINAC have been rare until now. clos...|$|R
40|$|RF {{electron}} guns with {{a strained}} superlattice GaAs cathode {{are expected to}} generate polarized electron beams of higher brightness and lower emittance than do DC guns, due to their higher field gradient at the cathode's surface and lower cathode temperature. We plan to install a bulk GaAs:Cs in a SRF gun to evaluate the performance of both the gun and the cathode in this environment. The status of this project is: In our 1. 3 GHz 1 / 2 cell SRF <b>gun,</b> the <b>vacuum</b> can be maintained at nearly 10 {sup - 12 } Torr because of cryo-pumping at 2 K. With conventional activation of bulk GaAs, we obtained a QE of 10 % at 532 nm, with lifetime of more than 3 days in the preparation chamber and have shown that it can survive in transport from the preparation chamber to the gun. The beam line has been assembled and we are exploring the best conditions for baking the cathode under vacuum. We report here the progress of our test of the GaAs cathode in the SRF gun. Future particle accelerators, such as eRHIC and the ILC require high-brightness, high-current polarized electrons. Strained superlattice GaAs:Cs {{has been shown to}} be an efficient cathode for producing polarized electrons. Activation of GaAs with Cs,O(F) lowers the electron affinity and makes it energetically possible for all the electrons, excited into the conduction band that drift or diffuse to the emission surface, to escape into the vacuum. Presently, all operating polarized electron sources, such as the CEBAF, are DC guns. In these devices, the excellent ultra-high vacuum extends the lifetime of the cathode. However, the low field gradient on the photocathode's emission surface of the DC guns limits the beam quality. The higher accelerating gradients, possible in the RF guns, generate a far better beam. Until recently, most RF guns operated at room temperature, limiting the vacuum to {approx} 10 {sup - 9 } Torr. This destroys the GaAs's NEA surface. The SRF guns combine the excellent vacuum conditions of DC guns and the high accelerating gradient of the RF guns, potentially offering a long lived cathode with very low emittance. Testing this concept requires preparation of the cathode, transportation to the SRF gun and evaluation of the performance of the cathode and the gun at cryogenic temperatures. In our work at BNL, we successfully activated the bulk GaAs in the preparation chamber. The highest quantum efficient was 10 % at 532 nm that fell to 0. 5 % after 100 hours. We explored three different ways to activate the GaAs. We verified that the GaAs photocathode remains stable for 30 hours in a 10 {sup - 11 } Torr vacuum. Passing the photocathode through the low 10 {sup - 9 } Torr transfer section in several seconds caused the QE to drop to 0. 8 %. The photocathode with 0. 8 % QE can be tested for the SRF gun. The gun and beam pipe were prepared and assembled. After baking at 200 C baking, the <b>vacuum</b> of the <b>gun</b> and beam pipe can sustain a low 10 {sup - 11 } Torr at room temperature. The final test to extract electrons from the gun is ongoing. In this paper, we discuss our progress with this SRF gun and the results of the photocathode in preparation chamber and in magnet transfer line...|$|R
