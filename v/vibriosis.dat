50|$|The {{related species}} Vibrio harveyi is {{pathogenic}} to Gorgonian corals, oysters, prawns, lobsters, the common snook, barramundi, turbot, milkfish and seahorses. In a research {{study in which}} over two hundred bacterial isolates were tested in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae as potential probiotics, V. lentus was the most efficacious, being harmless to the fish larvae and giving protection against <b>vibriosis</b> caused by V. harveyi.|$|E
50|$|Vibrio anguillarum is a Gram-negative, curved-rod {{bacterium}} {{with one}} polar flagellum. It {{is an important}} pathogen of cultured salmonid fish, and causes the disease known as <b>vibriosis</b> or red pest of eels. The disease has been observed in salmon, bream, eel, mullet, catfish, and tilapia, amongst others. The organism is most prevalent in late summer in salt or brackish water and transmission is mainly horizontal by direct contact. It is widely distributed across the world.|$|E
50|$|Like many Vibrio spp., V. tubiashii {{produces}} extracellular enzymes, specifically a zinc-metalloprotease (Delston et al 2003) and a cytolysin/hemolysin (Kothary et al 2001) {{that are}} {{nearly identical to}} those produced by other pathogenic Vibrio strains (Sussman et al 2009). This being said, only the zinc-metalloprotease elicited disease symptoms in Crassostrea gigas (Hasegawa et al 2008) consistent with <b>vibriosis.</b> In addition to shellfish disease, Vibrio derived zinc-metalloprotease could be an integral virulence factor in diseases of scleractinian corals as it was shown to cause photoinactivation of the coral endosymbiont Symbiodinium, leading to tissue color loss and eventual tissue death (Sussman et al 2009).|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{bacterial}} infections that are lethal to shrimp. The most common is <b>vibriosis,</b> caused by bacteria of the Vibrio species. The shrimp become weak and disoriented, and may have dark wounds on the cuticle. The mortality rate can exceed 70%. Another bacterial disease is necrotising hepatopancreatitis (NHP); symptoms include a soft exoskeleton and fouling. Most such bacterial infections are strongly correlated to stressful conditions, such as overcrowded ponds, high temperatures, and poor water quality, factors that positively influence the growth of bacteria. Treatment is done using antibiotics. Importing countries have repeatedly placed import bans on shrimp containing various antibiotics. One such antibiotic is chloramphenicol, which has been banned in the European Union since 1994, but continues to pose problems.|$|E
50|$|A {{characteristic}} of the family is the broad host range susceptible to infection by vibrios. Pathogens of man, other than V. cholerae, include V. parahemolyticus, a cause of gastroenteritis and V. vulnificus {{that can lead to}} acute and fatal septicaemia. Other species of Vibrionaceae are associated with disease {{in a wide variety of}} finfish, one of the most notable and commonly occurring pathogens being Vibrio anguillarum, the cause of septicaemia in farmed salmonids such as Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. Species such as V. tubiashii cause disease in larval stages of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) while V. harveyi causes luminous <b>vibriosis</b> in penaeid shrimps (prawns). The extent of the host range is seen with species such as V. mediterranei and V. coralliilyticus, which can infect zooxanthellae, the plant symbionts of coral. These species of Vibrio are thought to be a cause of coral bleaching.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Vibrio tubiashii (Vt) is a causative {{agent of}} <b>vibriosis</b> in {{molluscan}} bivalves. Recent re-emergence of <b>vibriosis</b> in economically valuable shellfish, {{such as the}} Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in Washington State, has increased the urgency to understand the ecology of this pathogen. It is currently unknown how predicted environmental changes associated with ocean acidification, such as elevated surface seawater temperature, increased partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2), and Vt abundance will impact marine organismal health and disease susceptibility. This study investigates how environmental cues predicted with ocean acidification influence physiological changes and pathogenicity in Vt. Using laboratory experiments to manipulate temperature and pCO 2, we examined how these environmental factors influenced pathogen growth. Larval susceptibility to <b>vibriosis</b> was determined by exposing C. gigas larvae {{to a combination of}} elevated pCO 2 and Vt concentrations. These experiments provide insight into the environmental parameters that may drive pathogenicity or influence proliferation of the bacterium. Investigation of single and multivariate parameters such as temperature, pCO 2, and pathogen levels will help assess how predicted shifts in ocean conditions can impact shellfish survival and disease resistance...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{monitors}} <b>vibriosis</b> through 2 surveillance systems: {{the nationwide}} Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance (COVIS) {{system and the}} 10 -state Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet). COVIS conducts passive surveillance and FoodNet conducts active surveillance for laboratory-confirmed Vibrio infections. MethodsWe summarized Vibrio infections (excluding toxigenic V. cholerae O 1 and O 139) reported to COVIS and FoodNet from 1996 through 2010. For each system, we calculated incidence rates using US Census Bureau population estimates for the surveillance area. ResultsFrom 1996 to 2010, 7700 cases of <b>vibriosis</b> were reported to COVIS and 1519 to FoodNet. Annual incidence of reported <b>vibriosis</b> per 100 000 population increased from 1996 to 2010 in both systems, from 0. 09 to 0. 28 in COVIS and from 0. 15 to 0. 42 in FoodNet. The 3 commonly reported Vibrio species were V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. alginolyticus; both surveillance systems showed {{that the incidence of}} each increased. In both systems, most hospitalizations and deaths were caused by V. vulnificus infection, and most patients were white men. The number of cases peaked in the summer months. ConclusionsSurveillance data from both COVIS and FoodNet indicate that the incidence of <b>vibriosis</b> increased from 1996 to 2010 overall and for each of the 3 most commonly reported species. Epidemiologic patterns were similar in both systems. Current prevention efforts have failed to prevent increasing rates of vibriosis; more effective efforts will be needed to decrease rates.
