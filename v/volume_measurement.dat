40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare 3 D lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> with 2 D {{biometric}} parameters in predicting pulmonary hypoplasia in pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM). Methods: In this prospective study, 18 pregnancies complicated by PPROMs at a mean 21 weeks' gestation (range 14 - 32 weeks) were examined. The 3 D lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> and the following 2 D biometric parameters were measured: thoracic circumference (TC) versus gestational age or femur length (FL), the TC/abdominal circumference (AC) ratio and the thoracic area/heart area (TA/HA) ratio. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of each measurement to diagnose pulmonary hypoplasia were compared. Pulmonary hypoplasia was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, radiological and/or pathologic criteria. Results: The incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia was 33. 3 %. The best diagnostic accuracy for predicting pulmonary hypoplasia was achieved using the 3 D lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> versus gestational age (sensitivity 83 %, specificity 100 %, positive predictive value 100 % and negative predictive value 92 %). Conclusions: Three-dimensional lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> seem to be promising in predicting pulmonary hypoplasia prenatally in pregnancies complicated by PPROM.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prognostic utility of 2 D lung area and 3 D lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> of the contralateral lung in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Methods: At 18 - 37 weeks' gestation between 1 and 5 scans of the contralateral fetal lung were obtained in 6 pregnancies complicated by congenital diaphragmatic hernia (5 left- and 1 right-sided). Lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> were compared with reference curves for gestational age and estimated fetal weight obtained from uncomplicated pregnancies. Lung area measurements were compared with reference nomograms. Results: Three infants survived and 3 died. Lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> versus gestational age were beneath the 5 th percentile for the nonsurviving infants and within the normal ranges for the surviving infants. When comparing the observed/expected lung volume and lung area ratios of the first measurements with the ratios at the last visit before birth, the ratios of the infants who subsequently died decreased whereas the ratios of the infants who survived remained unchanged or increased. Conclusions: In the case of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 3 D lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> seem to be a good predictor of outcome but longitudinal measurement also provides important additional information. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these results. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the continuous changes in three distinct response assessment methods during treatment as a marker of response for patients with mesothelioma. Linear tumor thickness <b>measurements,</b> disease <b>volume</b> <b>measurements,</b> and lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> (a physiological correlate of disease volumes) were investigated in this study. MethodsSerial computed tomography scans were obtained during the course of clinically standard chemotherapy for 61 patients. For each of the 216 computed tomography scans, the aerated lung volumes were segmented using a fully automated method, and the pleural disease volume was segmented using a semiautomated method. Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors linear-thickness measurements were acquired clinically. Diseased (ipsilateral) lung volumes were normalized by the respective contralateral lung volumes to account for the differences in inspiration between scans for each patient. Relative changes in each metric from baseline were tracked over the course of follow-up imaging. Survival modeling was performed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates. ResultsMedian survival from pretreatment baseline imaging was 12. 7 months. A negative correlation was observed between <b>measurements</b> of lung <b>volume</b> and disease volume, and a positive correlation was observed between linear-thickness <b>measurements</b> and disease <b>volume.</b> As continuous numerical parameters, all three response assessment methods were significant imaging biomarkers of patient prognosis in independent survival models. ConclusionsAnalysis of trajectories of linear-thickness <b>measurements,</b> disease <b>volume</b> <b>measurements,</b> and lung <b>volume</b> <b>measurements</b> during chemotherapy for patients with mesothelioma indicates that increasing linear thickness, increasing disease volume, and decreasing lung volume are all significantly and independently associated with poor patient prognosis...|$|R
