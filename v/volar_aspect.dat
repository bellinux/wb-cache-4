30|$|The radius was rigidly {{mounted in}} a clamp for {{digitization}} {{of the load}} transducer and bony landmarks using a rigid body stylus with an optical tracking system (Optotrak Certus, NDI, Waterloo, CAN). These landmarks were used to derive an anatomical coordinate system about the long-axis of the radius. The anatomical coordinate system was derived using the mid-point of the dorsal and <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of the distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ), and radial styloid point, {{as well as the}} center of the radial head. The proximal and distal coordinates of the load transducer within the bone were also digitized to determine its relative offset with the anatomical long-axis. This coordinate system allowed for alignment of the anatomical long-axis relative to the actuator of a servo-hydraulic testing frame (Instron® 8501, Norwood, MA, USA). Transducer offset was 3.61 ° in the anterior-posterior and 3.50 ° in the medial-lateral planes relative to the anatomical long-axis.|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To collect {{normative}} {{baseline data}} and identify any {{significant differences between}} hand and foot thermographic distribution patterns in a healthy adult population. Design. A single-centre, randomized, prospective study. Methods. Thermographic data was acquired using a FLIR camera for the data acquisition of both plantar and dorsal aspects of the feet, <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of the hands, and anterior aspects of the lower limbs under controlled climate conditions. Results. There is general symmetry in skin temperature between the same regions in contralateral limbs, {{in terms of both}} magnitude and pattern. There was also minimal intersubject temperature variation with a consistent temperature pattern in toes and fingers. The thumb is the warmest digit with the temperature falling gradually between the 2 nd and the 5 th fingers. The big toe and the 5 th toe are the warmest digits with the 2 nd to the 4 th toes being cooler. Conclusion. Measurement of skin temperature of the limbs using a thermal camera is feasible and reproducible. Temperature patterns in fingers and toes are consistent with similar temperatures in contralateral limbs in healthy subjects.

50|$|In {{the case}} of no reaction, this was {{followed}} by another 2 weeks of testing with a higher dose. The test was performed at the <b>volar</b> <b>aspect</b> of the forearm. In 16 of 18 cases (89%), a positive use test developed, 11 reacting to the low and 5 to the high concentration. None reacted to the vehicle control of ethanol applied to the contralateral arm. All controls were negative to both the test solutions of Lyral and the ethanol control. The difference between the test and the control group was statistically significant (Fisher's test, P < 0.001). It is concluded that Lyral at the current usage levels is inducing sensitization in the community. The same levels were shown to elicit allergic contact dermatitis in almost all sensitized individuals. A significant reduction in usage concentrations is recommended to prevent contact allergic reactions.|$|E
40|$|Background: While contemplating any {{difficult}} {{soft tissue}} reconstruction, patient comfort and compliance is of paramount importance. Reconstruction of the <b>volar</b> <b>aspect</b> of fingers and hand by the ipsilateral pedicled flaps (groin flap, abdominal flaps) is demanding as the flap inset {{is difficult for}} the surgeon and very uncomfortable for the patient. This often leads to flap complications. For {{the comfort of the}} patient, better compliance and ease of complete inset, we planned to manage soft tissue defects of the <b>volar</b> <b>aspect</b> of fingers and hand by a new contralateral pedicled lumbo-umbilical flap. This flap is based on the paraumbilical perforators of deep inferior epigastric artery. Materials and Methods: The contralateral pedicled lumbo-umbilical flap was used in eight patients with high-tension electrical burn injuries involving the <b>volar</b> <b>aspect</b> of fingers and hand. The patients were closely observed for first 6 weeks for any flap or donor site complications and then followed monthly to assess donor and recipient site characteristics for 6 months to 2 years. Results and Conclusion: Large flaps up to 8 cm × 16 cm were raised. All but one flaps survived completely. All patients were mobilised within 48 h and five were discharged {{in less than a week}} after initial inset. The flap is reliable, easy to harvest and easy to inset on the <b>volar</b> <b>aspect</b> of fingers. The arm is positioned in a very comfortable position.

40|$|Background : Ganglia are {{the most}} common benign cystic swellings found over both the dorsal and <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of the wrist. In spite of {{technical}} advancement, both operative and non-operative interventions achieve more or less similar results. Complete evacuation of gelatinous fluid followed with intra cystic instillation of triamcinolone has given encouraging results. Aims : To assess the efficacy and safety of drainage of cyst and instillation of triamcinolone in wrist ganglion. Materials and Methods : A prospective study was conducted on patients with simple ganglion cysts on the wrist. Total of 219 patients underwent this study. Out of this, 105 patients underwent the aspiration of the cyst fluid followed by intracystic instillation of triamcinolone, and 114 patients underwent surgical excision of wrist ganglia. Two years follow up was done for recurrence. Results : Most ganglia of wrist occurred in the extensor aspect. Complications noted among the surgically excised group were post operative pain and restricted mobility of wrist with a recurrence rate of 21. 5 %. Instillation of Triamcinolone into the ganglion yielded early resolution with a low recurrence of 8. 4 %. Conclusions : Intracystic instillation of triamcinolone after complete evacuation of cyst fluid is a simple and effective technique for treatment of ganglion...|$|R

Physical examination revealed firm abdominal wall, increased bowel sounds and multiple pigmented macules on the lips, oral mucosa, soles and <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> {{of the fingers}} and toes. Hyperventilation and tetanic rigidity of the extremities were also noted. The symptoms were successfully treated by intravenous injection of butropium bromide and diazepam. Roentgenological and fiberscopic examination revealed multiple polyps in the stomach, small intestine and colon; the small intestine was most heavily loaded with polyps. Biopsy specimen revealed only inflammatory changes. The patient had undergone a resectien of the terminal ileum with polyps 15 years previously because of ileo-ileal intussusception. Histological re-evaluation of the polyp showed an actively proliferating papillary adenoma. The characteristic history and gastrointestinal findings lead us to {{the examination of the}} family, which revealed that her father, son and grandson had similar pigmentation of the skin and polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. These characteristic findings and family history permitted us to make a diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The diagnosis had been missed supposedly because of unawareness of the skin lesions and the lack of hamartoma-like findings in the polyp. The tetanic rigidity of the extremities was probably hyperventilation syndrome induced by severe abdominal pain. The patient has been followed up for possible recurrence of symptoms and a potential malignant change...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pathogenesis}} of irritant {{contact dermatitis}} and its modulation according to skin color {{is not well}} understood. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) enables high-resolution, real-time, in-vivo imaging of human skin. OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to use RCM to determine whether susceptibility to irritant contact dermatitis differs {{between black and white}} skin. METHODS: Participants were placed in groups on the basis of skin color and the <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of their forearms exposed to 1 % and 4 % sodium lauryl sulfate using Finn Chambers (Allerderm Laboratories Inc, Petaluma, Calif). They were evaluated at 6, 24, and 48 hours by RCM, transepidermal water loss, laser Doppler velocimetry, and routine histology. RESULTS: Participants with white skin had more severe clinical reactions than those with black skin. RCM revealed microscopic changes even without clinical evidence of irritation. Confocal features included parakeratosis, spongiosis, perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, and microvesicle formation, and these features were confirmed by routine histology. Also, participants with white skin had greater mean increases in transepidermal water loss after exposure to 4 % sodium lauryl sulfate than did participants with black skin. CONCLUSION: In-vivo RCM can track early pathophysiologic events revealing differences between black and white skin during the development of irritant contact dermatitis, and may support the theory that those with black skin are more resistant to irritant...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} one of the most crucial {{environmental}} factors with regard to its capacity to induce skin cancer, premature aging of the skin, and immunosuppression. Although ultraviolet directly affects the function of epidermal cells, many of these effects are mediated by induction of cytokines, growth factors, and neuropeptides, such as α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Recently, in addition to its well-known pigmentation inducing activity, a strong anti-inflammatory as well as an immunomodulatory potential of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone has been recognized. The aim of this study was to determine, whether ultraviolet irradiation affects the expression of both α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and the melanocortin- 1 receptor in human epidermis in vivo. The <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of the forearms were exposed to twice the minimal erythema dose of solar-simulating radiation. Three, 6, and 24 h after irradiation, the proopiomelanocortin and interleukin- 10 mRNA levels in suction blister induced epidermal sheets were considerably upregulated as detected by semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and interleukin- 10 protein levels in blister fluids were significantly increased 24 h after ultraviolet irradiation, an effect that could be abolished by application of the broad-spectrum sunscreen Anthélios XL prior to ultraviolet (solar-simulating radiation) exposure. In addition, enhanced melanocortin- 1 receptor mRNA and receptor protein expression upon solar-simulating radiation was ascertained by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry of the epidermal sheets, respectively. Proopiomelanocortin-derived neuropeptides, such as α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone may therefore play an important part in modulating ultraviolet-induced inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} the interobserver reliability of ultrasonography (US) {{in the assessment}} of cartilage damage at metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint level in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods US examinations were performed on 80 MCP joints of 20 patients with RA using a MyLab 70 XVG (Esaote Biomedica, Genoa, Italy), equipped with a broadband linear probe (6 – 18 MHz). For each patient, second and third MCP joints of both hands were examined independently on the same day by two rheumatologists (an experienced musculoskeletal sonographer and an investigator with limited US training). A multiplanar scanning technique on dorsal, lateral and <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of the MCP joints was adopted. All US pathological fi ndings were documented on at least two perpendicular scanning planes. Each joint was assessed by quadrant for {{the presence or absence of}} cartilage damage. Cartilage damage was also scored per quadrant on a fi ve-grade semiquantitative scoring system on which investigators reached a consensus prior to the study. Results Exact agreement between investigators was found in 173 out of 200 quadrants (86. 5 %) with regard to presence or absence of cartilage damage. Percentages of exact agreement for cartilage damage semiquantitative assessment at dorsal, lateral and volar quadrants were 72. 5 %, 52. 5 % and 85 %, respectively, while unweighted κ values were 0. 561, 0. 366 and 0. 766, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Agricultural {{workers are}} known to have {{occupational}} skin diseases. The prevalence and pattern of skin diseases are unknown in Taiwanese fruit farmers. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the work exposure, prevalence of skin diseases, and sensitivity to common skin allergens and agricultural chemicals in fruit farmers of southern Taiwan. METHODS: 122 fruit farmers who regularly prepared and sprayed pesticides and a group of 63 printing press workers with no known exposure to pesticides were examined and patch tested with common skin allergens and agricultural chemicals. The farmers were also interviewed for their work habits, use of protective clothing, and exposure to pesticides. RESULTS: Most farmers reported regular use of hat, boots, and mask, but not gloves, raincoat, and goggles. This resulted in frequent skin contact with pesticides especially on the hands and face. About 30 % of farmers had hand dermatitis, and more than two thirds had pigmentation and thickening on the hands. Fungal infection of the skin was noted in a quarter of subjects. By patch test, farmers and the printing press workers had a similar rate of sensitivity to common skin allergens. 40 % of farmers were sensitive to agricultural chemical allergens, which was about twofold higher than that of the comparison group. Farmers were most frequently sensitive to Captofol, Folpet, and Captan which were associated with dermatitis on the <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of the hands. CONCLUSIONS: Fruit farmers in southern Taiwan had a high prevalence of skin diseases related to use of pesticides, and appropriate protective measures and work practices should be taken to prevent such problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of seawater baths and solar radiation at the Dead Sea {{is known as}} an effective treatment for patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Dead Sea water is particularly rich in magnesium ions. In this study we wished {{to determine the effects}} of magnesium ions on the capacity of human epidermal Langerhans cells to stimulate the proliferation of alloreactive T cells. Twelve subjects were exposed on four subsequent days on the <b>volar</b> <b>aspects</b> of their forearms to 5 % MgCl 2, 5 % NaCl, ultraviolet B (1 minimal erythemal dose), MgCl 2 [*]+[*]ultraviolet B, and NaCl[*]+[*]ultraviolet B. Epidermal sheets were prepared from punch biopsies and were stained for ATPase and HLA-DR. Compared with untreated skin, the number of ATPase+/HLA-DR+ Langerhans cells was significantly reduced after treatment with MgCl 2 (p[*]= 0. 0063) or ultraviolet B (p[*]= 0. 0005), but not after NaCl (p[*]= 0. 7744). We next questioned whether this reduced expression of ATPase and HLA-DR on Langerhans cells bears a functional relevance. Six subjects were treated on four subsequent days with 5 % MgCl 2, ultraviolet B (1 minimal erythemal dose), and MgCl 2 [*]+[*]ultraviolet B. Epidermal cell suspensions from treated and untreated skin were assessed for their antigen-presenting capacity in a mixed epidermal lymphocyte reaction with allogeneic naive resting T cells as responder cells. Treatment with MgCl 2, similarly to ultraviolet B, significantly reduced the capacity of epidermal cells to activate allogeneic T cells (p[*]= 0. 0356). Magnesium ions also suppressed Langerhans cells function when added to epidermal cell suspensions in vitro. The reduced antigen-presenting capacity of Langerhans cells after treatment with MgCl 2 was associated with a reduced expression by Langerhans cells of HLA-DR and costimulatory B 7 molecules, and with a suppression of the constitutive tumor necrosis factor-α production by epidermal cells in vitro. These findings demonstrate that magnesium ions specifically inhibit the antigen-presenting capacity of Langerhans cells and may thus contribute to the efficacy of Dead Sea water in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases...|$|R
