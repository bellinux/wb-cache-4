5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer <b>visual</b> fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the <b>visual</b> field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. <b>Visual</b> field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the <b>visual</b> pathways.|$|E
40|$|<b>Visuals</b> {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in second language testing and reading settings for various functions and purposes. There {{are a number of}} studies on how <b>visuals</b> could improve reading recall of L 1 learners. However, few studies to date have examined whether learners can improve their reading recall performance with the help of <b>visuals</b> in a second language. To the best knowledge, no studies so far have investigated whether storytelling storyboard <b>visuals</b> can help second language learners improve reading recall performance. ^ This dissertation addresses above question by examining the reading recall performance of 80 freshman ESL students who participated in the reading recall task in four randomly divided treatment groups: elaborate story with storyboard <b>visuals,</b> elaborate story without storyboard <b>visuals,</b> non-elaborate story with storyboard <b>visuals,</b> and non-elaborate story without storyboard <b>visuals.</b> Three separate two-way ANOVAs were used to measure and compare the students’ recall results based on three different scoring approaches. ^ The study found that the scores of subjects in the non-elaborate story group with storyboard <b>visuals</b> were significantly higher than the scores of subjects in the non-elaborate story group without storyboard <b>visuals.</b> Scores of subjects between two other groups were not significant. The author discussed the findings in association with Paivio’s Dual Code Theory (1971) and Kanfer and Ackerman’s Attentional Resources Theory (1989). He argued that storytelling storyboard <b>visuals</b> can improve reading recall performance. ...|$|R

Both Mohan and Shankar visited several <b>visual</b> effects companies, including the New Zealand-based Weta Digital and the United States-based Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Tippett Studio before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran <b>visual</b> effects budget was 700million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200million. As a result, the <b>visual</b> effects team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear sunglasses {{for most of the}} film to reduce the cost and difficultly of animating his eyes.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{birds are}} known to {{communicate}} using <b>visual</b> and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of <b>visual</b> display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that <b>visual</b> communication has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage color of Anchiornis huxleyi, suggest the importance of color in <b>visual</b> communication in non-avian dinosaurs. The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on <b>visual</b> displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx, suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.|$|E

5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the chiasm, which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the <b>visual</b> field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. <b>Visual</b> acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a <b>visual</b> field defect. The <b>visual</b> loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the chiasm is affected, <b>visual</b> loss on one side of the <b>visual</b> field occurs.|$|E

Although there is a trend towards increased use of online instruction for undergraduate instruction, online delivery lacks the student-teacher interactivity and the easy exchange of <b>visuals</b> that is available during face-to-face environments. Interactivity and visualization are valuable for mathematics instruction as a way of reducing cognitive load and maintaining student motivation to learn. This study used a quasi-experimental design to examine whether interactive <b>visuals</b> produce increased mathematics learning compared to the use of static images. The results from this research demonstrated that mathematics learning using interactive <b>visuals</b> was significantly higher than the learning that occurs using static <b>visuals.</b> There was {{a significant difference in the}} motivation from before the treatment to after the treatment between the interactive <b>visuals</b> group and the static images group. There were also significant differences between the interactive <b>visuals</b> group and the static <b>visuals</b> group in two aspects of motivation - enjoyment and ability. On the other hand, the use of interactive <b>visuals</b> was not associated with lower cognitive load than the use of static images. This study suggests that there is a positive relationship between motivation and mathematics learning. However, no significant relationship was found between cognitive load and mathematics learning or between motivation and cognitive load. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the relationship between motivation and mathematics learning changed for differing mental effort and motivation was a suppressor on the contribution that mental effort makes to the mathematics learning...|$|R

LEP has allowed for an increased use of <b>visuals</b> to enrich nutrition and health materials. Appealing <b>visuals</b> serve as tools designed to increase comprehension and memory of health topics (Frisch, Camerini, & Schultz, 2013). Information retention is higher when <b>visuals</b> are combined with text, as opposed to text-only information (Peregrin, 2010). Testing this idea, <b>visuals</b> were placed in the text-only fact sheet, “Nutrition for the Athlete” (231, 424 page views in 2014). Google Analytics data revealed that read time increased 23 % in the 15 months after <b>visuals</b> were placed compared to the 15 months prior, from an average of 5 : 32 to 6 : 50 minutes. The increased read time could suggest that readers are more engaged with information on the webpage and demonstrates the potential positive impact of <b>visuals</b> on web-based education materials. Educators should intentionally select images for fact sheets that will support, reinforce, and/or clarify messages on health topics...|$|R
40|$|The {{positive}} effects of using different types of listening texts (i. e. audio, video) in listening enhancement {{as a part of}} foreign language learning are already well known (Turel 2004 : 178 - 84, Tschirner 2001 : 310, Ridgway 2000 : 182, Borchardt 1999 : 10, Adair-Hauck et al. 1999 : 273, 289, Peter 1994 : 202, Hart 1992 : 5). As multimedia enables us to combine and present different listening texts on the same digital computer platform more effectively, the same listening texts can be presented to language learners in different forms (Turel 2004 : 129 - 38, Trinder 2002 : 79, Heron et al. 2002 : 37, Brett 1998 : 81, Chanier 1996 : 7, Ashward 1996 : 80, Brett 1996 : 204, Fox et al. 1992 : 39, Leffa 1992 : 66).

40|$|<b>Visuals</b> hold a {{prominent}} {{position in the}} communication {{of science and technology}} (S&T), helping scientists and engineers conceptualize ideas, understand the ideas of others, and present them publicly. But creating and understanding <b>visuals</b> depends on learned cultural experiences. Also, <b>visuals</b> are “constructed” objects shaped by processes of selection, idealized visions of representation, truth and objectivity, ethical values, power and gender, technology, among other factors. This constructedness questions the ability of S&T <b>visuals</b> to transcend language, disciplinary, professional, national, and other differences. We address this issue in the VISTAC – Science and Technology <b>Visuals</b> in Translation, or “VISTAC in Translation”, study and the Visualizing Science and Technology across Cultures (VISTAC) pilot study that led to it. The pilot study results showed that people visually portray S&T concepts differently for audiences from different cultures and nationalities. This brings up the question of what happens to <b>visuals</b> when S&T documentation is translated. The VISTAC in Translation study, a two-stage e-survey-based study, was developed to answer this question. Specifically, it seeks to understand how translators, translation companies, and publishers perceive the importance of translating <b>visuals</b> in S&T documentation, as well as the procedures they follow when preparing S&T documents for translation. This article describes the research methodology of the first-stage e-survey and the esurvey itself: the data collection method, e-survey questions, and dissemination strategies. It also presents and discusses a partial set of results, and succinctly relates these findings to the forthcoming second-stage e-survey. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
