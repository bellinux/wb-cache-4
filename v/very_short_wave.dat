5000|$|Once a crack occurs {{within the}} ice cover {{and begins to}} expand {{to make up a}} lead, the open water inside the lead is exposed to the cold air {{temperatures}} and will freeze. Because wind fetch inside a lead is typically <b>very</b> <b>short,</b> <b>wave</b> action is considerably reduced. Ice growth therefore takes place in a low energy regime environment. Following a stage of frazil ice formation, which sometimes results from seeding by snow crystals, the resulting thin ice skim is followed by the growth of congelation ice. In windier regions, as in the Southern Ocean, frazil ice accumulation may occur along the downwind side of leads. If the ice on that side is thin, the frazil may be driven below that ice (resulting in a complex interlayering pattern). Leads affect global water circulation. As ice begins to form inside a lead, it incorporates some of the salt in the seawater [...] but rejects most of it. This brine then sinks, inducing convective processes in the water column below.|$|E

The production of ultra-short electromagnetic waves by the retarding field method is analyzed.

The wave length of the normal oscillations differed considerably from the values calculated from the Barkhausen and Scheibe equations. For the higher order oscillations, the observed wave lengths were approximately equal to values calculated according to Potapenko’s formula: [ [...] . ].

A cor relation {{of the changes in}} radiosensitivity with the changes in develop ment showed that they become more sensitive during cleavage and blastulation, much more resistant at or near the beginning of gastrula tion, and more sensitive again as gastrulation gets under way. Having found that susceptibility to one type of radiation varies in a certain way, it is of interest to determine whether it varies in the same way when other types of radiation are used. Alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays are the three recog nized forms of radiation emitted by radioactive substances. The alpha and beta rays are corpuscular in nature while the gamma radiation is like X-rays of <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>wave</b> length. All of these forms of radiation, including X-rays, are capable of causing ionization in matter subjected to their influence. According to the Rutherford-Bohr theory {{of the structure of the}} atom, the alpha particle is identical with the helium atom stripped of its two planetary electrons. It therefore has an electric charge of two positive and a mass about 7000 times that of the beta particle or electron (Failla, 1927).

40|$|This work {{presents}} a model describing the reflectivity {{of the ocean}} surface {{as a function of}} the friction velocity contributed by three roughness scales appearing on the windroughened ocean. The solution of the reflexion problem is based on an analytical formulation, the Kirchhoff- or facet model. This assumes the ocean's surface as an overlap of inclined facets laying on the curvatured waves. However, this model includes only the contribution of those waves with wavelength longer than the electromagnetic microwaves the surface interact with. This is the first roughness scale which is described by the long and <b>short</b> gravity <b>waves.</b> The hydrodynamic <b>waves</b> <b>shorter</b> than the electromagnetic ones are postulated as the second roughness scale (<b>very</b> <b>short</b> gravity <b>waves</b> and capillary waves). Their interaction with the microwave is formulated by a scattering approach and leads to a modification of the reflection coefficients calculated by the facet model. The models of the first and the second scale require the information of the roughness of the sea surface in the form of statistical roughness parameter. These are obtained from the wave spectrum of Bjerkaas and Riedel (1979) as new parametrizations which differ partly from those found in literature by a large amount. The parametrizations depend on microwave frequency and friction velocity. These are the two relevant parameters to define the roughness of a surface in remote sensing problems. (orig.)

Such waves come in a number of forms, including those used for com-municating on the long, medium, and short “wave ” bands, very high fre-quency waves as used in the FM band, and the extremely high frequency waves used in analogue satellite transmissions. Many European readers will be familiar with the properties of these bands, such as the ability— when unwanted this will be described as interference—to receive stations from other European states on the medium and long wave band. Readers will also generally be aware that very high frequency broadcasts (VHF/ FM) can only be received in an area that is directly in sight of the transmit-ting towers, and that this results in much cursing when, on long-distance car journeys, signals are lost from one area and the wireless needs to be retuned.

40|$|Added {{resistance}} in waves {{is important for}} ship powering performance, since ships are travelling {{most of the time}} in waves, not in calm water. With increasing focus on fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, there is increasing focus on optimizing the resistance and fuel consumption of ships. Traditionally, ships have been optimized for operation in calm water, since the trial voyage is performed in calm water, and the optimization for operation in waves is much more difficult. Nowadays, it is realized that the ship needs to be optimized for the operation for which it is designed. This means that most merchant ships shall be optimized for operation in waves – typically waves that are fairly short relative to the length of the ship. In order to optimize the ship hull geometry for operation in waves, efficient and reliable methods for determination of the added resistance due to waves are required. Although significant effort has been devoted to this question over the years, there is still a lack of such methods. This thesis discusses the nature of the added resistance, and investigates several different methods for determining the added resistance: model test, strip theory methods, a boundary element method and advanced numerical methods based on Reynolds Averaged Navier- Stokes equations (RANS). A series of experiments on a segmented model of the KVLCC, with three different bow shapes, were performed in the large towing tank at the Marine Technology Centre in Trondheim, Norway. Tests were carried out in different <b>short</b> head <b>waves</b> at different forward speeds. The resistances of the whole hull, fore segment and aft segment were measured. Also the frictional resistance of the mid segment was measured. The difficulties of accurate measurement of added {{resistance in}} <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> are outlined. A novel method for eliminating low-frequency noise from the measured resistance was proposed. It was found that in <b>short</b> <b>waves,</b> the added resistance is concentrated in the bow. Thus, the optimization of bow shape could reduce the added resistance effectively, and the comparison of the added resistance from different bows show that the slender bow could reduce the added resistance. There is almost no added frictional resistance on the mid segment in <b>very</b> <b>short</b> <b>waves,</b> indicating that the currently common assumption of neglecting added frictional resistance due to waves is reasonable. Our investigation did not give results for added frictional resistance in long waves. Parts of the dataset generated from the tests with the original bow shape of KVLCC 2 have been applied as benchmark data in the workshop Gothenburg 2010 on numerical ship hydrodynamics. The added resistance from theoretical methods based on strip theory is compared with the experimental results. It is found that the ‘radiated energy method’ of Gerritsma and Beukelman predicts the added resistance in long waves quite well, but underestimate the added resistance in <b>short</b> <b>waves.</b> The ‘pressure integration method’ proposed by Faltinsen is found to be very sensitive to the ship hull discretization and doesn’t give good results for the studied cases. For <b>short</b> <b>waves,</b> when ship motions are negligible (λ<L/ 2), the asymptotic formula given by Faltinsen shows good agreement with experiments for the blunt hull shape of KVLCC 2. For the more slender bow shape of the container vessel also studied in this thesis, the asymptotic formula underestimates the experimentally obtained added resistance. A research-version of the 3 D boundary-element code Wasim was used to compute motions and added resistance of the KVLCC 2, since 3 D potential flow codes are by many authors considered to be the best choice for added resistance computations. Wasim was used courtesy of DNV. The agreement between the computation results and experiments was less good than expected. A limitation in the number of panels in the current version of Wasim might be one reason for less good results in <b>short</b> <b>waves.</b> Calm water flow and resistance, numerical wave-makers, and ship motions and added resistance in waves have been simulated by solving RANS with Volume of Fluid (VOF) method for capturing the free surface. First, Fluent was applied. Later, also the ISISCFD code was utilized. It is found that VOF-type RANS calculations can give excellent agreement for both ship motions and added resistance, at both short and long wavelengths, but the computational expense currently limits the practical use of this type of method. However, as the performance of both hardware and software is increasing, this type of method is expected to be of increasing practical interest. As a by-product of the RANS calculations of added resistance, the nominal wake field at the propeller plane of KVLCC 2 was investigated. Surprisingly large variations in the wake field, both on average and during a wave encounter period were observed. We recommend that the influence of waves and ship motions on the propeller wake field is given more focus in the future. PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|R

However, quantifying the effects of microscale wave breaking has been difficult because the phenomenon lacks the visible manifestation of whitecapping. In this brief report we present limited but promising laboratory measurements which show that microscale wave breaking associated with evolving wind waves disturbs the thermal boundary layer at the air-water interface, producing signatures that can be detected with infrared imagery. Simultaneous video and infrared observations show that the infrared signature itself may serve as a practical means of defining and characterizing the microscale breaking process. The infrared imagery is used to quantify microscale breaking waves in terms of the frequency of occurrence and the areal coverage, which is substantial under the moderate wind speed conditions investigated. The results imply that ”bursting“ phenomena observed beneath laboratory wind waves are likely produced by microscale breaking waves but that not all microscale breaking waves produce bursts. Oceanic measurements show the ability to quantify microscale wave breaking in the field. Our results demonstrate that infrared techniques can provide the information necessary to quantify the breaking process for inclusion in models of air-sea heat and gas fluxes, as well as unprecedented details on the origin and evolution of microscale wave breaking...|$|R
40|$|Schoeberl et al. (1983) {{suggested}} that convective wavebreaking of monochromatic gravity waves might be suppressed by radiative transfer processes if the vertical wavelength <b>waves</b> were sufficiently <b>short.</b> As the vertical wavelength or the gravity wave decreases, radiative transfer between adjacent vertical layers becomes increasingly important. This exchange {{can increase the}} radiative relaxation time scale so that the wave will no longer grow with altitude. Thus, <b>very</b> <b>short</b> vertical wavelength <b>waves</b> may dissipate radiatively rather than become convectively unstable. Apruzese and Strobel (1984) have revised the exchange coefficients used in Schoeberl et al. (1983). Also, Chao and Schoeberl (1984) {{pointed out that the}} computation made by LINDZEN (1981) of the convective diffusion rate may be a factor of two too low as the convective adjustment processes tends to minimize the thermal transport by the wave. The purpose here is to revise the values given in Schoeberl et al. (1983). These results also suggest that the very thin turbulent layers observed by mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) radars (e. g., WOODMAN, 1980) cannot be produced by the convective instability of monochromatic gravity waves with large horizontal scales...|$|R
40|$|We {{show the}} results {{obtained}} {{by means of a}} seabed reduction technique on the intensity of geomagnetic anomaly fields applied to a synthetic case and then to the real case of a geomagnetic survey of eastern Ligurian Sea (Italy). The eastern Ligurian Sea has <b>very</b> intense <b>short</b> <b>waves</b> anomaly fields and a sea bed that varies greatly in depth. As a result the geomagnetic space signal is characterized by a very large spectral content; in these conditions {{it is not possible to}} obtain a full sampled marine survey and vertical continuation analytic procedures and standard numerical bottom reduction based on a single vertical incremental parameter, whichever is applicable, fails to give accurate results. The present technique, which has been fine-tuned over 4 years of experimentation in environmental researchs, aims to provide a simple and efficient means to reduce the distortion of geomagnetic anomalies field caused by the variation of distance between survey plane and magnetic outcrop source position. The compensation procedure is based on evaluation, by comparison of two measurements carried out at different altitudes, of the mean vertical increment typical of each anomaly field principal frequency component bands. The component anomaly fields are then corrected by application of the corresponding vertical increments and lastly, the anomaly geomagnetic field reduced to the sea-bed is computed as Inverse Fourier Transform of a spectrum built as synthesis of the component anomaly fields' spectra. The results obtained have shown a notable increase in definition of anomaly field intensity without the production of appreciable distortions or false geomagnetic echoes...|$|R
