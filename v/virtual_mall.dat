Technology developments {{and the use of the}} Internet made users to expect more services, which help to improve the user's life. Using a 3 D virtual environment and adding a shopping idea to it is considered as very interesting, especially if it reflects the real world in a virtual reality that make its users attached to it. Furthermore, the possibility of having an avatar to represent themselves in computer-mediated virtual environment help users to explore the virtual environment. Another advantage is that users have the possibility to invite friends and to navigate inside a 3 D Virtual-shopping mall not alone but together, which gives the user the capability to socialise inside the mall. Besides, changing of the customer's profile and chatting with friends is supported, too. Moreover, the transformation process from a two-dimensional environment to a three-dimensional environment is considered to be convenient for both, customers and mall owners.   I have used phenomenology to investigate this new phenomenon.

The <b>virtual</b> <b>mall</b> has underlying possibilties to become a medium which exhbits compounded functions which never existed before, exceeding conventional printed media. The viertual mall makes use of interactive function, which is the greatest characteristic of computers and computer networks. I. e., it is a medium wherein conve rsatons are held and questions are answered in real time. And not only that, the <b>virtual</b> <b>mall</b> will become a medium which provides advides advanced information search functions and simulation functions. For supporting product selection and decision-making of consumers, this medium which realizes such compounded information functions will provide information search services and simulation services. Further, the <b>virtual</b> <b>mall</b> is also showing promises of becoming not only functions of selling goods, but of service frnctions such as communication snd information exchange to enhance communication between individuals.

40|$|Existing {{e-commerce}} applications {{on the web}} {{provide the}} users a relatively simple, browser-based interface to access available products. Customers are not provided with the same shopping experience as they would in an actual store or mall. This experience, however, {{can be achieved by}} the creation of a virtual shopping mall environment, simulating most of the actual shopping user interactions. The <b>virtual</b> <b>mall</b> brings together the services and products of various vendors. Users can navigate through the virtual shopping malls, adding items of interest into a virtual shopping cart, and perform searches assisted by 'intelligent agents'. A Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) can realize a sophisticated virtual shopping application. In such a CVE, a large number of potential users may interact with each other. In this paper, vCOM, a VRML and Java 3 D-based prototype is presented, which permits users to navigate around virtual e-commerce worlds and perform collaborative shopping and intelligent searches with the assistance of software agents, in order to find the products and services of interest to them. They can then negotiate with sales agents to bargain for the best possible price and then make a secure buying transaction. The <b>virtual</b> <b>mall</b> prototype also allows the user to communicate with an 'intelligent shopping assistant' using simple voice commands. This assistant interacts with the shopper using voice synthesis and helps him/her use the interface to efficiently navigate in the mall.

40|$|Our goal is {{to augment}} a {{panorama}} with object movies in a visually 3 D-consistent way. Notice that a panorama is recorded as one single 2 D image and an object movie (OM) is composed {{of a set of}} 2 D images taken around a 3 D object. The challenge is how to integrate the above two sources of 2 D images in a 3 D-consistent way so that the user can easily manipulate object movies in a panorama. To solve this problem, we adopt a purely image-based approach that does not have to reconstruct the geometric models of the 3 D objects to be inserted in the panorama. A critical issue of this method is how to generate the novel views required for showing an OM in different places of a panorama, and we have proposed a view morphing technique, called t-DBVM, to solve this problem. Our experiments have shown that this purely image-based approach can effectively generate visually convincing OM-augmented panoramas.
