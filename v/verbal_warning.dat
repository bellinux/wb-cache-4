25|$|Aware of the {{possible}} implications, Rosenqvist pulled away to build a steady advantage over Buemi. Evans's team forgot to change the gear in his second car, delaying his exit from his garage as he required additional time to get his vehicle into first gear. This caused Evans to emerge {{at the back of}} the field in 18th position. As the field became comfortable in the second period of the event, di Grassi began to challenge Vergne for third position. Following aggressive defensive manoeuvres which drew a <b>verbal</b> <b>warning</b> from his team, Vergne narrowly avoided hitting di Grassi at the final turn. Vergne was forced off the racing line under braking by di Grassi who overtook him for third heading into the first corner on lap 32. Abt activated FanBoost in an attempt to move ahead of Vergne on the next lap but was unable to pass him. Contact prevented Abt from overtaking Vergne, but after a short period of time, passed him for fourth place. Duval stopped on the circuit but later managed to limp his ailing car into the pit lane, prematurely ending his race. Having reviewed Rosenqvist's pit stop release, the stewards issued him with a ten-second time penalty on lap 34.|$|E
500|$|At the wedding, New Directions perform [...] "Marry You" [...] by Bruno Mars as they, {{and then}} Burt and Carole, dance down the aisle, {{after which the}} two of them marry. During the reception, Finn uses his best man speech as an {{opportunity}} to apologize to Kurt for not defending him, and promises {{to do so in the}} future; he announces that Finn and Kurt are now [...] "Furt". He and the other glee club members dedicate a performance of Mars' [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] to Kurt, and the new stepbrothers dance together. Following the wedding, Kurt and his parents learn that the school board has reversed Karofsky's expulsion and given him a <b>verbal</b> <b>warning,</b> thus allowing him to return to school. Sue resigns as principal in protest, and Burt and Carole use their honeymoon savings to enroll Kurt at Dalton Academy, which has a zero-tolerance policy against bullying and is also the school that Kurt's friend Blaine (Darren Criss) attends.|$|E
500|$|In {{the time}} of the Twelve Tables, a [...] "{{manifest}}" [...] thief and a [...] "non-manifest" [...] thief were treated differently. Manifest theft denoted some sort of being caught in the act. Being found later with the stolen thing was not manifest theft, unless it was found during a seemingly bizarre ritual (furtum lance licioque conceptum), whereby the searcher would come with a silver platter and wearing few clothes. Gaius is highly critical of the by-then obsolete ritual, imagining the platter was for removal of the goods. In practice, it may have been for an offering to the household gods. Being almost naked would have prevented the searcher bringing with him a thing he would then pretend to find. Gaius reports that manifest theft brought a penalty of a severe flogging and enslavement for freemen. Slaves found liable for manifest furtum would be thrown off to their deaths off the Tarpeian Rock. The manifest thief was at {{the time of}} the Twelve tables was not given a full trial, his case merely adjudicated by a magistrate. The extreme penalty must have acted as a deterrent. The victim could kill the thief on the spot in two situations: at night, and where the thief was using a weapon and had been verbally warned. The <b>verbal</b> <b>warning</b> was designed to make the act of killing more public, and prevent it being an underhand way of committing murder. This rule was accepted by Gaius but is questioned by Ulpian. The penalty for non-manifest theft was always double damages.|$|E
5000|$|Less-than-lethal weapons, such as {{chemical}} sprays, {{are used}} as alternatives to deadly force. These weapons also require policies on their use, along with training on proper use.

500|$|The playoff {{match was}} played at Serra Dourada Stadium, in Goiânia, a venue {{selected}} by Flamengo. Atlético elected the referee, José Roberto Wright who, until the match, {{was considered the}} best in the country. At the 33rd minute of the match, Atlético forward and star player Reinaldo received a straight red card from the referee after fouling Flamengo's Zico, in what was described by the press as a [...] "normal" [...] foul and [...] "without much violence". After the foul, Atlético player Éder was sent off for complaining, and the game was stopped. A turmoil started, and Atlético players Palhinha and Chicão were also sent off for insulting the referee. Left with seven players, Atlético's goalkeeper João Leite claimed he was injured when the match was restarted, but Wright did not stop the game. Atlético defender Osmar then held the ball with his hands, preventing the restart, and was also sent off. The match ended as a goalless draw at the 37-minute mark because Atlético had fewer than seven players on the field. The result meant qualification for Flamengo, as it had the best goal difference in the group stage.After the match, Atlético unsuccessfully appealed to a CONMEBOL court for its annulment. According to Wright, Reinaldo's foul was indeed [...] "normal", but he was sent off because of a previous <b>verbal</b> <b>warning.</b> He also stated that Éder, Palhinha and Chicão continued to be undisciplined and that he had to send Éder off to not lose control of the match. The episode and referee Wright's performance were described by Brazilian and South American media at the time as [...] "shameful", [...] "deplorable" [...] and [...] "disgraceful". Flamengo advanced to the semi-finals and {{went on to win the}} competition.|$|E
