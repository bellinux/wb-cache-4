5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; in both instances she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming {{the first woman to}} hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.|$|E

5|$|The first V-22 was {{rolled out}} with {{significant}} media attention in May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing {{a need to}} focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not {{to spend more money}} on the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 in an effort to cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of August 7, 1974, Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott and Congressman John Jacob Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain {{impeachment}} when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, it was {{reported}} that McCain had missed 42 consecutive votes (five straight weeks) in the Senate while he was conducting his presidential campaign. From March to May, McCain only attended three-floor <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> though none of McCain's missed votes altered a bill's fate. According to Washington Post statistics, McCain missed more votes than any Senator including Tim Johnson, who missed many votes after suffering a brain hemorrhage in December 2006. As of August 2008, McCain had missed 63.8% of votes in the 110th Congress during his campaign. Because of their majority status, Senate Democrats could sometimes delay votes in order to accommodate the schedules of Democratic presidential candidates.|$|E

California Republican, Senator John Miller submitted a motion to suspend Huagong and the regulations since passed 60 days after the date of 20 years shall not allow laborers to emigrate to the United States. The motion, to be discussed in the Senate, eight days. All western states members and most of the southern Democratic Party per capita support Miller proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually to 60 days to 90 days, through 29 of 15 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> in the House of Representatives by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions).|$|E

The Senate vote throughout the states was between 10 and 20 percent. The Greens won a seat in each of the six states at the election, again a first for any Australian minor party, bringing the party to a total of nine senators from July 2011, holding {{the balance of power in}} the Senate. The new senators were Lee Rhiannon in New South Wales, Richard Di Natale in Victoria, Larissa Waters in Queensland, Rachel Siewert in Western Australia, Penny Wright in South Australia and Christine Milne in Tasmania. Incumbents Scott Ludlam in Western Australia, Sarah Hanson-Young in South Australia and Bob Brown in Tasmania were not due for re-election. The Greens also won their first House of Representatives seat at a general election, the seat of Melbourne with candidate Adam Bandt, who was a crossbencher in the first hung parliament since the 1940 {{federal election}}. Almost two weeks after the election, Bandt and the Greens agreed to support a Gillard Labor minority government on confidence and supply votes. Labor was returned to government with the additional support of three independent crossbenchers.|$|E

500|$|On January 6, 1920, Governor Morrow {{signed the}} bill ratifying the Nineteenth Amendment, making Kentucky the 23rd state to ratify it, {{and the moment}} is {{captured}} in a photograph {{with members of the}} Kentucky Equal Rights Association. [...] During the 1920 legislative session, the Republicans held a majority in the state House of Representatives and were a minority by only two votes in the state Senate. During the session, Morrow was often able to convince C. W. Burton, a Democratic senator from Grant County, to support Republican proposals. Tie <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> were broken by Republican lieutenant governor S. Thruston Ballard. Consequently, Morrow was able to effect a considerable reorganization of the state government, including replacing the Board of Control with a nonpartisan Board of Charities and Corrections, centralizing highway works, and revising property taxes. He oversaw improvements to the education system, including better textbook selection and a tax on racetracks to support a minimum salary for teachers. Among Morrow's reforms that did not pass was a proposal to make the judiciary nonpartisan.|$|E
500|$|Both {{candidates}} {{started the}} campaign well-funded. Sestak {{had more than}} $3 million available from his House fund to use toward starting a Senate campaign, and raised an additional $1 million by June 30, 2009, which brought his total to about $4.2 million. Sestak called it the largest campaign war-chest of any Senate challenger. Specter, however, was ahead with $6.7 million in campaign funding as of March 31. Sestak also faced challenges arising from his low name recognition and Specter's support among high-profile members of the Democratic establishment, like Obama and Biden. Specter spent {{the early months of}} his campaign trying to reestablish and strengthen his Democratic credentials, seeking union support and making speeches highlighting his support of positions supported by the party, such as the economic stimulus package, reforming health care, increasing the minimum wage, protecting abortion rights and supporting stem cell research. In a June 2009 speech to Pennsylvania Democratic Committee members in Pittsburgh, Specter said, [...] "I'm again a Democrat and I'm pleased and proud to be a Democrat." [...] Commentators observed that Sestak's involvement in the race would test Specter's loyalty to the Democratic party and likely force him to make more liberal <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E
