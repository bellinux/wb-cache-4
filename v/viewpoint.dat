40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{analyzing}} textual data. The method deals with items of textual data, where each item is described based on various <b>viewpoints.</b> The method acquires 2 -class {{classification models of}} the <b>viewpoints</b> by applying an inductive learning method to items with multiple <b>viewpoints.</b> The method infers whether the <b>viewpoints</b> are assigned to the new items or not by using the models. The method extracts expressions from the new items classified into the <b>viewpoints</b> and extracts characteristic expressions corresponding to the <b>viewpoints</b> by comparing the frequency of expressions among the <b>viewpoints.</b> This paper also applies the method to questionnaire data given by guests at a hotel and verifies its effect through numerical experiments.

In the book, the authors outline {{the basics of}} the <b>Viewpoints</b> training they both espouse as well as specific methods for applying the <b>Viewpoints</b> to both rehearsals and production. For Bogart and Landau, the <b>Viewpoints</b> represent not only a physical technique but also a philosophical, spiritual, and aesthetic approach to many aspects of their work.

40|$|The {{epidemiologic}} {{approach to}} causal inference (i. e., Hill’s <b>viewpoints)</b> consists of evaluating potential causes {{from the following}} 2, noncumulative angles: 1) established results from comparative, observational, or experimen-tal epidemiologic studies; and 2) reviews of nonepidemiologic evidence. It does not involve statements of statisti-cal significance. The philosophical roots of Hill’s <b>viewpoints</b> are unknown. Superficially, they seem to descend from the ideas of Hume and Mill. Hill’s <b>viewpoints,</b> however, use {{a different kind of}} evidence and have different pur-poses than do Hume’s rules or Mill’s system of logic. In a nutshell, Hume ignores comparative evidence central to Hill’s <b>viewpoints.</b> Mill’s logic disqualifies as invalid nonexperimental evidence, which forms the bulk of epidemiologic findings reviewed from Hill’s <b>viewpoints.</b> The approaches by Hume and Mill cannot corroborate successful imple-mentations of Hill’s <b>viewpoints.</b> Besides Hume and Mill, the epidemiologic literature is clueless about a plausible, pre- 1965 philosophical origin of Hill’s <b>viewpoints.</b> Thus, Hill’s <b>viewpoints</b> may be philosophically novel, sui generis, still waiting to be validated and justified. causality; David Hume; evidence; inference; John Stuart Mill; lung cancer; philosophy; tobacco The epidemiologic approach to causal inference consists of evaluating potential causes from the following 2, noncumula-tive angles: 1) established results from comparative, observa...|$|R
