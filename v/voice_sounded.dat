Haig told Olivier that MacArthur's <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> like W. C. Fields, and Olivier tried to imitate this. He enjoyed working with accents, and obtained recordings of MacArthur's voice. He was interested in various inconsistencies in these recordings, {{and especially in the}} difference in vowel sounds made by MacArthur. During filming, the makeup process for Olivier took two and a half hours, but after it was complete, he thought he neither looked like himself nor like General MacArthur.|$|E

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trenyce said that the audience was initially hesitant to hear a woman interpret Jackson's music.

From this study, the method to improve clipped voice signal will be proposed. <b>Voiced</b> <b>sound</b> section is created by utilizing the fact that differentiation and clipped signal in voice signal are supposed to give small influence for the evaluation of recognition level. In here, for the signal which is obtained by stressing amplitude at <b>voiced</b> <b>sound</b> section where most of them are distributed, the method of emphasizing synthesis with original signal was used...|$|R

In this study, we examined whether FES to the paralyzed laryngeal adductor muscles improves the <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> impaired by unilateral laryngeal paralysis. We confirmed that the FES to the paralyzed thyroarytenoid muscle (TA) induced the adduction of vocal fold in decerebrate cats. Electrical stimulation delivered to periaqueductal grey (PAG) induced vocalization in the cats with unilateral laryngeal paralysis. We estimated the changes in duration of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds,</b> subglottic pressure, and quality of voice during vocalization with or without FES to the paralyzed TA muscle. The duration of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> was prolonged by delivering the FES to paralyzed laryngeal adductor TA muscle. The subglottic pressure increased during vocalization with FES. The intensity of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> increased, and the quality of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> improved with FES. These results suggested that the FES to paralyzed adductor TA muscle could be expected {{to improve the quality of}} <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> in the animals with unilateral laryngeal paralysis.

Enrique Lopetegui of the San Antonio Current wrote that diehard Selena fans [...] "will take the new pop duet of 'Amor Prohibido' with Camila's Samo over the cheesy cumbia original anytime". Lopetegui described [...] "Cobarde", [...] "Si Una Vez", and [...] "No Quiero Saber" [...] as [...] "unplugged" [...] because of their [...] "superb acoustic guitar". Furthermore, Lopetegui complimented the technology used in the album to [...] "change the tempo of Selena's original track without changing the pitch, and her duet with Christian Castro is proof of technology put to good use". He found [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] and the title track [...] "unbearable", however, and advised his readers {{to be prepared to}} skip them.|$|E

Jeff Benjamin of Fuse compared {{the production of the}} song to Carey's previous singles [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1995) and [...] "Touch My Body" [...] (2008). He also wrote that the [...] "drawn-out whistle" [...] {{at the end of the}} song was [...] "impressive". Carolyn Menyes for Music Times felt that Songz overshadowed Carey with his vocals on the urban remix.

The actors talked about the production process for the film. For instance, Toyoguchi stated that their roles were recorded around Spring 2013. Toriumi, the voice of 'Junpei Iori', explained how passage of time between the release of the Persona 3 game and the film affected his role since his present <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> more akin to an adult. However Satoki Iida had requested that he try to make himself sound younger for his character. Toyoguchi also joked that many of the 2006-era items were held true in the film, {{such as the use of}} Cathode ray tube TVs and mobile phones.

At {{the end of the}} number Boyle, sometimes [...] "reduced to tears", would assert [...] "You'll see". Reviewing the album for the New York Daily News, Jim Farber felt that Boyle's <b>voice</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "remote and idealized" [...] on the album, until [...] "You'll See", where the characteristic [...] "anger and vengeance" [...] in her vocals [...] "give her a harder character to chew on". The cover was included on the first episode of Brazilian telenovela Ti Ti Ti (2010).

[...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches.
