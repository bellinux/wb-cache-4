25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the ALT test flight program, on March 13, 1978, Enterprise was flown once again, but this time halfway across the country to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Alabama for the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Testing (MGVT). The orbiter was lifted up on a sling very similar to the one used at Kennedy Space Center and placed inside the Dynamic Test Stand building, and there mated to the Vertical Mate Ground <b>Vibration</b> <b>Test</b> tank (VMGVT-ET), which in turn was attached to a set of inert Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) to form a complete shuttle launch stack, and marked {{the first time in the}} program's history that all Space Shuttle elements, an Orbiter, an External Tank (ET), and two SRBs, were mated together. During the course of the program, Enterprise and the rest of the launch stack would be exposed to a punishing series of vibration tests simulating as closely as possible those expected during various phases of launch, some tests with and others without the SRBs in place.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{vibration}} {{testing is}} {{conducted in a}} 'single DUT axis' at a time, even though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously. [...] MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter testing. The <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> fixture used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the <b>vibration</b> <b>test</b> spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of the resonances that may {{be present in the}} future. Devices specifically designed to trace or record vibrations are called vibroscopes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Objective. To {{examine the}} {{potential}} role of <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> as a non-invasive method of diagnosing loosening of total hip replacements {{in the clinical}} setting. Design. Single blind cohort study in two hospitals. Background Diagnosing loosening of total hip replacements is heavily dependent on investigative techniques that are unreliable. Previous studies into the use of <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> have produced conflicting results. Methods. Comparison of <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> and radiographs in patients with a total hip replacement experiencing hip pain symptomatic of loosening, with patients showing evidence of a secure prosthesis. Results. <b>Vibration</b> <b>testing</b> has a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 89 %. The positive predictive value was 92 % and the negative predictive value was 73 %; it was unable to produce a definitive diagnosis in 8 % of patients. When compared with radiographs from the same patients, <b>vibration</b> <b>testing</b> was shown to be 20 % more sensitive and able to diagnose 13 % more patients. Conclusions. <b>Vibration</b> <b>testing</b> can deliver more accurate information on the stability of total hip replacements than radiographs in the clinical setting, despite being {{in the early stages}} of development...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{rationale}} for including this paper in a session on tailoring vs. standards {{is to make}} a case for developing and conducting <b>vibration</b> <b>tests</b> which are both realistic and practical, Tests are essential for finding things overlooked in the analyses. The best test is often the most realistic test which can be conducted within the cost and budget constraints. Some standards are essential, but the author believes more in the individual's ingenuity to solve a specific problem, than in the application of standards which reduce problems (and technology) to their lowest common denominator. Force limited <b>vibration</b> <b>tests</b> and base-drive modal tests are two examples of realistic, but practical testing approaches.
