The goal embodies two main areas: the design of a processing method to connect the cells during a micro-fabrication process and the creation of an array that produces enough voltage and current to power low-power applications like a hearing aid battery recharger. We have successfully designed and fabricated a device with two cells connected in series thus far to make sure the interconnections in our design were capable of connecting cells in an array.

40|$|Multilevel {{converters}} {{are finding}} increased attention in industry and academia as the preferred choice of {{electronic power conversion}} for high power applications. They have a wide application area {{in a variety of}} industries involving transportation and energy management, a significant portion of which comprises of multilevel inverter fed induction motor drives. Multilevel inverters are ideally suitable for high power drives, since the switching frequency of the devices is limited for high power applications. In low power drives, the switching frequency is often in the range of tens of kHz, so that switching frequency harmonics are pushed higher in the frequency spectrum thereby the size and cost of the filter are reduced. But higher switching frequency has its own drawbacks, in particular for high voltage, high power applications. They cause large dv/dt stress on the motor and the devices, increased EMI problems and higher switching losses. An engineering trade-o is thus needed to select the minimum switching frequency without compromising on the output voltage quality. The present work is an alternate approach in this direction. Here, new inverter topologies and PWM strategies are developed that can eliminate a set of harmonics in the phase voltage using 12 -sided polygonal space vector diagrams, also called dodecagonal space vector diagrams. A dodecagonal space vector diagram has many advantages over a hexagonal one. Switching space vectors on a dodecagon will not produce any harmonics of the order 6 n 1, (n=odd) in the phase voltage. The next set of harmonics thus reside at 12 n 1, (n=integer). By increasing the number of samples in a sector, it is also possible to suppress the lower order harmonics and a nearly sinusoidal voltage can be obtained. This is possible to achieve at a low switching frequency of the inverters. At the same time, a dodecagon is closer to a circle than a hexagon; so the linear modulation range is extended by about 6. 6 % compared to the hexagonal case. For a 50 Hz rated frequency operation, under constant V/f ratio, the linear modulation can be achieved upto a frequency of 48. 3 Hz. Also, the harmonics of the order 6 n 1, (n=odd) are absent in the over-modulation region. Maximum fundamental voltage is obtained from this inverter at the end of over-modulation region, where the phase voltage becomes a 12 -step waveform. The present work is developed on dodecagonal space vector diagrams. The entire work can be summarized and explained through Fig. 1. This figure shows the development of hexagonal and dodecagonal space vector diagrams. It is known that, 3 -level and 5 -level space vector diagrams have been developed as an improvement over 2 -level ones. They Figure 1 : Development of hexagonal and dodecagonal space vector diagrams have better harmonic performance, reduced dv/dt stress on the motor and devices, better electromagnetic compatibility and improvement of efficiency over 2 -level space vector diagrams. This happens because the instantaneous error between the reference vector and the switching vectors reduces, as the space vector density increases in the diagram. This is shown {{at the top of the}} figure. In the bottom part, the development of the dodecagonal space vector diagram is shown, which is the contribution of this thesis work. This is explained in brief in the following lines. Initially, a space vector diagram is proposed which switches on hexagonal space vectors in lower-modulation region and dodecagonal space vectors in the higher modulation region. As the reference vector length increases, voltage vectors at the vertices of the outer dodecagon and the vertices from the outer most hexagon is used for PWM control. This results in highly suppressed 5 th and 7 th order harmonics thereby improving the harmonic profile of the motor current. This leads to the 12 -step operation at rated voltage where all the 5 th and 7 th order harmonics are completely eliminated. At the same time, the linear range of modulation extends upto 96. 6 % of base speed. Because of this, and the high degree of suppression of lower order harmonics, smooth acceleration of the motor upto rated speed is possible. The presence of multilevel space vector structure also limits the switching frequency of the inverters. In the next work, the single dodecagonal space vector diagram is improved upon to form two concentric dodecagons spanning the space vector plane (Fig. 1). The radius of the outer dodecagon is double the inner one. It reduces the device rating and the dv/dt stress on the devices to half compared to existing 12 -sided schemes. The entire space vector diagram is divided into smaller sized isosceles triangles. PWM switching on these smaller triangles reduces the inverter switching frequency without compromising on the output voltage quality. The space vector diagram is further refined to accommodate six concentric dodecagons in the space vector plane (Fig. 1). Here the space vector diagram is characterized by alternately placed dodecagons which become closer to each other at higher radii. As such the harmonics in the phase voltage are reduced, in particular at higher modulation indices. At the same time, because of the dodecagonal space vector structure, all the 6 n ± 1, (n=odd) harmonics are eliminated from the phase voltage. A nearly sinusoidal phase <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>generated</b> without resorting to high frequency switching of the inverters. The above space vector diagrams are developed using different inverter circuits. The first work is developed from cascaded combination of three 2 -level inverters, while the second and third works use 3 -level NPC inverters feeding an open end induction motor drive. The circuit topologies are explained in detail in the respective chapters. Apart from this, PWM switching schemes and detailed analysis on duty cycle calculations using the concept of volt-second balance are also presented. They show that with proper switching schemes, the proposed configurations can substantially reduce the overall loss of the inverter. Other operational issues like capacitor voltage balancing of 3 -level NPC inverters and improvement of input current drawn from the grid are also covered. All the above propositions are first simulated by MATLAB and subsequently verified by an experimental laboratory prototype. Motor current waveforms both at steady state and transient conditions during motor acceleration show that the induction motor can be fed from nearly sinusoidal voltage at all operating conditions. Simplified comparative studies are also made with the proposed converters and higher level inverters in terms of output voltage quality and losses. These are some of the constituents for chapters 2, 3 and 4 in this thesis. Additionally, the first chapter also covers a brief survey on some of the recent progresses made in the field of multilevel inverter. The thesis concludes with some interesting ideas for further thought and exploration...|$|E

Voltage oscillations had a mean peak-to-peak amplitude of 23 mV and a mean oscillatory frequency of 4. 6 Hz. When compared with non-oscillatory cells, oscillatory cells had significantly greater hyperpolarization-activated and lower depolarization-activated current densities. Two components, the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih, and the K+-selective inward-rectifier current, IK 1, contributed to the hyperpolarization-activated current, as assessed {{by the use of}} the IK 1 -selective inhibitor Ba 2 + and the Ih-selective inhibitor ZD- 7288. Five depolarization-activated currents were present in these cells (transient IBK, sustained IBK, IDRK, IA, and ICa), and all were found to have significantly lower densities in oscillatory cells than in non-oscillatory cells (revealed by using TEA to block IBK, 4 -AP to block IDRK, and prepulses at different voltages to isolate IA). Bath application of either Ba 2 + or ZD- 7288 suppressed spontaneous voltage oscillations, indicating that Ih and IK 1 <b>are</b> required for <b>generating</b> this activity. On the contrary, TEA or Cd 2 + did not inhibit this activity, suggesting that IBK and ICa do not contribute. A mathematical model has been developed to test the interpretation derived from the pharmacological and biophysical data. This model indicates that spontaneous <b>voltage</b> oscillations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>generated</b> when the electrophysiological features of oscillatory cells are used. The oscillatory behaviour is principally driven by the activity of IK 1 and Ih, with IA playing a modulatory role. In addition, the model indicates that the high densities of depolarization-activated currents expressed by non-oscillatory cells help to stabilize the resting membrane potential, thus preventing the spontaneous oscillations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: SPWM or {{sinusoidal}} {{pulse width}} modulation is widely used in power electronics to digitize the power so that a sequence of <b>voltage</b> pulses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>generated</b> by the on and off of the power switches. The {{pulse width modulation}} inverter has been the main choice in power electronic for decades, because of its circuit simplicity and rugged control scheme SPWM switching technique is commonly used in industrial applications SPWM techniques are characterized by constant amplitude pulses with different duty cycle for each period. The width of this pulses are modulated to obtain inverter output voltage control and to reduce its harmonic content. Sinusoidal pulse width modulation or SPWM is the mostly used method in motor control and inverter application. In this development a unipolar and bipolar SPWM voltage modulation type is selected because this method offers the advantage of effectively doubling the switching frequency of the inverter voltage, thus making the output filter smaller, cheaper and easier to implement. Conventionally, to generate this signal, triangle wave as a carrier signal is compared with the sinusoidal wave, whose frequency is the desired frequency. In this paper single-phase inverters and their operating principles are analyzed in detail. The concept of sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for inverters is described with analyses extended to different kinds of SPWM strategies. Finally the simulation results for a single-phase inverter (Bipolar) using the SPWM strategies described are presented [1],[2],[5]. This project deals with implementing the basic theory of a Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulated Inverter (SPWM) technique for Bipolar voltage switching, its Simulink modelling, estimating various designing parameters. The project will be commenced by {{a basic understanding of}} the circuitry of the SPW...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{two types}} of DC power supply <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in the market, Switch-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) and linear power supply. However, many {{customers}} prefer to choose SMPS than linear power supply because for same power rating, SMPS is smaller, cheaper and lighter than linear power supply especially transformer. The high frequency switching transformer that is used in SMPS is smaller and lighter than the transformer that is used in linear power supply. SMPS also have better efficiency than linear power supply. This project is focusing on developing SMPS using flyback converter topology. This flyback converter topology is chosen because it affords to carry power till 150 watts and few components are used to construct the circuit. There is high frequency switching transformer at the middle of flyback circuit {{that is used to}} isolate and step-down the high DC voltage and low DC voltage. Only one switching element is used in this flyback topology, normally MOSFET is used as switch. The on and off of the switch is controlled by PWM that generated by PIC microcontroller 16 F 877 A. The on and off of the switch is important because the duty cycles of the PWM is used to regulate the DC output voltage.

In the Conventional-ELC (C-ELC), usually a chopper with a dump load {{is used in}} parallel with the consumer loads to provide regulation of voltage and control of frequency. In the C-ELC configuration {{a high degree of}} stress <b>can</b> <b>be</b> experienced by stator windings and excitation capacitors resulting from chopper operation, since in each chopping period the dump load is connected to the stator winding for a short period then disconnected. A new ELC topology is proposed to reduce this stress. Compared with the C-ELC, the main dump load has been divided into two separated parts. A part of the dump load <b>can</b> <b>be</b> connected in parallel with the consumer loads, resulting in less variation in the total load seen by the SEIG and less stress on the stator windings and excitation capacitors. This proposed topology <b>can</b> <b>be</b> utilized per-phase using bi-directional power switches, hence it can operate with unbalanced consumer loads. Simulation results demonstrate that even with unbalanced three-phase loads (assisted with bi-directional switches per-phase), the proposed topology has the capability to regulate voltage from no-load to full load.

40|$|In this paper, a {{high-frequency}} Chua’s chaotic oscillator {{based on}} unity gain cells (UGCs) is introduced. Leveraging the internal buffers of the integrated circuit AD 844, a voltage mirror (VM) {{and a positive}} current follower (CF+) are designed, {{taking into account the}} parasitic elements associated to each UGC. Afterwards, the behavior of the nonlinear resistor and of the grounded inductor are designed by using several VMs, CF+s, discrete capacitors and resistors. In this way, Chua’s circuit is built by coupling a nonlinear resistor and an active LC tank circuit by using an RC passive filter. Hspice simulations performed at the state space and in the time and frequency domains show that the proposed topology generates chaos at 1. 7 MHz. Experimental results are given, verifying that the chaotic spectrum is extended to high-frequency and showing close agreement with theoretical analysis. The proposed topology is compared with other topologies reported in the literature, showing that a number reduced of active devices and passive elements along with smaller supply <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to <b>generate</b> chaotic oscillations at high-frequency.

Hence, a new ELC topology is proposed. This topology <b>can</b> <b>be</b> split into two parts. The first part is a regular ELC of low rated power, which should be installed at the generator site and it is responsible for precise voltage {{and frequency}} regulation and dealing with unexpected failure conditions. The second one is a simplified and inexpensive ELC which is installed in each household to direct excess power to a low wattage household apparatus in addition to participation in voltage regulation by maintaining constancy of the load power. This concept is referred to here as the Distributed ELC (DELC). One significant advantage of the proposed DELC approach is that the excess power <b>can</b> <b>be</b> utilized for domestic hot water purposes, and possibly resulting in health benefits related to improved sanitation.
