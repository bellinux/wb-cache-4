40|$|To fulfill todays {{requirements}} on emissions from engines, SCANIA {{has developed an}} engine with EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) and <b>VGT</b> (<b>Variable</b> <b>Geometry</b> <b>Turbine).</b> This gives two extra control signals to take into consideration. Open loop optimal control is used to investigate how these two actuators should be controlled to minimize emissions and fuel consumption. A cost function, consisting of the errors between the most important variables and their set points, {{has been used in}} the minimization. The variables are the torque, the EGR mass fraction, the oxygen/fuel ratio and the pumping losses. From studies of the two control signals in different transients in the engine, information of how to control the VGT and EGR in the optimal way is found. The result from the optimal control has been compared with a PID simulation and has showed a better way to control the signals. The mayor reason why the optimal control is better than a PID controller is the ability to use future values from the transients. Keywords: TOMOC, MATLAB, PID-controller, fmincon ii...|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} a <b>Variable</b> <b>Geometry</b> <b>Turbine</b> at low massflow rates the vaneless space of the vanes is reduced. It is researched if this modification can reduce turbo lag. A turbine with modified vane ring is installed in the exhaust of a naturally aspirated engine and wide open throttle accelerations are performed to test the turbine performance. The new (reduced vaneless space) vane configuration induced a lower exhaust backpressure which allowed the engine to accelerate faster. The acceleration from 1500 to 3000 RPM was an average of 8 % faster for the new vane configuration. This in turn increased the massflow rate through the turbine which caused the power available to the turbine to be similar in compared vane rings. The initial turbine speeds was lower for the new vane configuration but it quickly {{caught up with the}} conventional configuration because the turbine acceleration was higher. The turbine efficiency was higher for the new vane configuration in most cases. The mean increase in turbine efficiency during the initial acceleration was 4 %. The turbine efficiency {{at the end of the}} acceleration was similar for both vane configurations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Simulation tools are intensively used in the design stage of diesel engines due to their contributions to significant savings in cost and time for the engine development. Since most of DI diesel engines are turbocharged, it is of vital importance to hold {{a good understanding of}} turbine and compressor characteristic to predict the engine performance accurately. However, this data is often not available from turbocharger manufacturers, particularly for turbines. On available turbine maps the operating range of the turbine is constrained due to limitations of conventional turbocharger test benches. Operations with a wider range of turbocharger pressure ratios can be achieved by employing complex turbocharger test benches, which will also lead to higher costs including hardware and labour. An alternative solution is to develop numerical models for the turbocharger based on thermodynamics. In this thesis numerical models has been developed for predicting the performance of both the centrifugal compressors and turbines and they have been also validated using test cases, particularly for <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> <b>turbines.</b> Following detailed parametric studies, the turbocharger model has been validated against experimental data of a turbocharger with a <b>variable</b> <b>geometry</b> <b>turbine.</b> Results showed that the model was capable of predicting the characteristics maps of the turbocharger accurately, requiring a minimal amount of turbocharger geometric properties, experimental data and calibration parameters.
