50|$|Petit calculates MHD forces, {{creating}} a partial <b>vacuum</b> <b>area</b> on front or {{on top of}} the device, would be powerful enough to evacuate incoming upstream molecules at supersonic speed before they accumulate at the stationary point, preventing the shock waves, thus controlling sound and heat barriers. MHD acceleration can indeed be very powerful, even more than chemical propulsion, because the acceleration efficiency grows like the magnetic field strength and is not limited by propellant's inertia as in chemical propulsion. For example, a pulsed small MHD accelerator can accelerate an ionized gas over 5,000 meters per second with only 10-centimeter electrodes and a moderate 2-tesla magnetic field, as shown at IMFM in 1970.|$|E
50|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted using diquarks {{in an attempt}} to study the Λ and Σ baryons that are produced in the creation of hadrons created by fast-moving quarks. In the experiment the quarks ionized the <b>vacuum</b> <b>area.</b> This produced the quark-antiquark pairs, which then converted themselves into mesons. When generating a baryon by assembling quarks, it is helpful if the quarks first form a stable two-quark state. The Λ and the Σ are created as a result of up, down and strange quarks. Scientists found that the Λ contains the ud diquark, however the Σ does not. From this experiment scientists inferred that Λ baryons are more common than Σ baryons, and indeed they are more common by a factor of 10.|$|E
50|$|Supporting {{the wire}} in the {{drainage}} table area {{are a number}} of drainage elements. In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet. On low speed machines these table elements are primarily table rolls. As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the <b>vacuum</b> <b>area</b> and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation. To prevent this drainage foils are used. The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action. Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine.|$|E

40|$|Proton beam window (PBW) is a {{boundary}} wall between a high <b>vacuum</b> <b>area</b> in the proton beam {{line and the}} helium atmosphere in a helium vessel at a high beam power target. The thermal and mechanical problems of the PBW have been studied in other spallation neutron sources; however, the scattering effect in PBW is seldom reported in literature but it may pose serious problems for the target design if not well treated. This paper will report the simulation studies of the scattering effect in PBW. Different materials and different structures of PBW are discussed. Taking CSNS as an example, a thin single-layer aluminum alloy PBW with edge cooling has been chosen for CSNS-I and CSNS-II, and a sandwiched aluminum alloy PBW has been chosen for CSNS-III. Simulations results of the scattering effect {{in the presence of}} beam uniformization at target by using non-linear magnets at the different CSNS PBWs are presented.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{automation}} in leather industry is quite low. This fact is mainly due to the particular features {{of this kind of}} material (non-rigid structure, irregular shape, delicate surface, etc.) that make the handling on the workstations very critical and difficult to be approached. This proposal concerns a system for the robotized manipulation of plies, made of natural leather, in order to perform fully automated loading and unloading operations on finishing machines (painting, stretching machines, etc.). The system is mainly formed by a 4 -axis robot, equipped with a special gripper, and an innovative spreading device used to place the grasped ply on a planar surface. The gripper has been designed in order to securely grasp different sizes of plies and different leathers. The grasping elements, formed by properly designed vacuum cups, have been developed according to a theoretical approach aimed at determining the optimal dimension of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>area,</b> in function of the porosity of the leather. The gripper moves the ply grasping it on a central area of its upper surface, determining the falling down of its borders due to the gravity.

40|$|A 1 -MW {{spallation}} neutron source aiming at materials and life science researches will be constructed under the JAERI-KEK High-intensity Proton Accelerator Project (J-PARC). A proton beam {{passes through a}} proton beam window, and be injected into a target of the neutron source. The proton beam window functions as a boundary wall between a high <b>vacuum</b> <b>area</b> in the proton beam line and a helium atmosphere at about atmospheric pressure in a helium vessel which contains the target and moderators. The proton beam window is cooled by light water because high heat-density is generated in the window material by interactions with the proton beam. Then, uniformity of the water flow is requested at the window to suppress a hot-spot that causes excessive thermal stress and cooling water boiling. Also, the window has to be strong enough in its structure for inner stress due to water pressure and thermal stress due to heat generation. In this report, we propose two types of proton beam windows; one flat-type that is easy to manufacture, and the other, curved-type that has high stress resistivity. As a part of design study for the windows, evaluation of strength of structure and thermal hydraulic analysis were conducted. As a result, {{it was found that}} sufficient heat removal was assured with uniform water flow at the window, and stress caused by internal water pressure and thermal stress could be maintained below allowable stress values. Accordingly, it was confirmed that the proton beam window designs were feasible...|$|E

40|$|A {{system was}} {{designed}} to automate cryogenically cooled low-noise amplifier systems used in the NASA Deep Space Network. It automates the entire operation of the system including cool-down, warm-up, and performance monitoring. The system {{is based on a}} single-board computer with custom software and hardware to monitor and control the cryogenic operation of the system. The system provides local display and control, and can be operated remotely via a Web interface. The system controller is based on a commercial single-board computer with onboard data acquisition capability. The commercial hardware includes a microprocessor, an LCD (liquid crystal display), seven LED (light emitting diode) displays, a seven-key keypad, an Ethernet interface, 40 digital I/O (input/output) ports, 11 A/D (analog to digital) inputs, four D/A (digital to analog) outputs, and an external relay board to control the high-current devices. The temperature sensors used are commercial silicon diode devices that provide a non-linear voltage output proportional to temperature. The devices are excited with a 10 -microamp bias current. The system is capable of monitoring and displaying three temperatures. The vacuum sensors are commercial thermistor devices. The output of the sensors is a non-linear voltage proportional to vacuum pressure in the 1 -Torr to 1 -millitorr range. Two sensors are used. One measures the vacuum pressure in the cryocooler and the other the pressure at the input to the vacuum pump. The helium pressure sensor is a commercial device that provides a linear voltage output from 1 to 5 volts, corresponding to a gas pressure from 0 to 3. 5 MPa (approx. = 500 psig). Control of the vacuum process is accomplished with a commercial electrically operated solenoid valve. A commercial motor starter is used to control the input power of the compressor. The warm-up heaters are commercial power resistors sized to provide the appropriate power for the thermal mass of the particular system, and typically provide 50 watts of heat. There are four basic operating modes. "Cool " mode commands the system to cool to normal operating temperature. "Heat " mode is used to warm the device to a set temperature near room temperature.
