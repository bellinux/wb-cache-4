25|$|Tlingit {{word order}} is SOV when non-pronominal agent and object phrases both {{exist in the}} sentence. However, {{there is a strong}} urge to {{restrict}} the argument of the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> to a single non-pronominal noun phrase, with any other phrases being extraposed from the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase.</b> If a noun phrase occurs outside of the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> then it is typically represented in the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> by an appropriate pronoun.|$|E
25|$|Tense phrase (TP) and aspect phrase (AspP). These are phrases {{in which}} the head is an {{abstract}} category representing tense or aspect; the complement is a <b>verb</b> <b>phrase.</b> In more traditional analysis the entire phrase (including any elements denoting tense or aspect) {{is considered to be}} simply a <b>verb</b> <b>phrase.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Most {{if not all}} {{theories}} of syntax acknowledge <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> (VPs), but they can diverge greatly {{in the types of}} <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> that they posit. Phrase structure grammars acknowledge both finite <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> and non-finite <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> as constituents. Dependency grammars, in contrast, acknowledge just non-finite <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> as constituents. The distinction is illustrated with the following examples: ...|$|R

25|$|Grammatical words marking {{tense and}} aspect {{generally}} precede the semantic verb. This indicates that, if finite verb phrases are analyzed as tense phrases or aspect phrases, these are again head-initial in English. In the example above, did {{is considered a}} (past) tense marker, and precedes its complement, the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> not swim. In the following, has is a (perfect) aspect marker; again it appears before the <b>verb</b> (<b>phrase)</b> which is its complement.|$|E

25|$|Generative {{linguists}} of the 1960s, including Noam Chomsky and Ernst von Glasersfeld, believed semantic {{relations between}} transitive verbs and intransitive verbs {{were tied to}} their independent syntactic organization.

25|$|Japanese is {{an example}} of a {{strongly}} head-final language. This can be seen in verb phrases and tense phrases: the verb (tabe in the example) comes after its complement, while the tense marker (ru) comes after the whole <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> which is its complement.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} example shows {{a sequence}} of nested phrases in which each head precedes its complement. In the complementizer phrase (CP) in (a), the complementizer (C) precedes its tense phrase (TP) complement. In the tense phrase in (b), the tense-marking element (T) precedes its <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> (VP) complement. (The subject of the tense phrase, the girl, is a specifier, which {{does not need to}} be considered when analyzing the ordering of head and complement.) In the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> in (c), the verb (V) precedes its two complements, namely the determiner phrase (DP) the book and the prepositional phrase (PP) on the table. In (d), where a picture is analyzed as a determiner phrase, the determiner (D) a precedes its noun phrase (NP) complement, while in (e), the preposition (P) on precedes its DP complement your desk.|$|E

The corpus is then used to develop a hybrid ap proach using HMM based statistical chunking and correction rules. The technique is en hanced by changing chunking direction and merging chunk and POS tags. The automati cally chunked data is compared with manually tagged held out data to identify and analyze the errors. Based on the analysis, correction rules are extracted to address the errors. By applying these rules after statistical tagging, further improvement is achieved in chunking accuracy. The results of all experiments are reported with maximum overall accuracy of 98. 44 % achieved using hybrid approach with extended tagset...|$|R

25|$|In the mid 90's, {{linguists}} Heidi Harley, Samuel Jay Keyser, and Kenneth Hale addressed some of {{the implications}} posed by complex verbs and a lexically-derived syntax. Their proposals indicated that the predicates CAUSE and BECOME, referred to as subunits within a <b>Verb</b> <b>Phrase,</b> acted as a lexical semantic template. Predicates are verbs and state or affirm something about {{the subject of the}} sentence or the argument of the sentence. For example, the predicates went and is here below affirm the argument of the subject and the state of the subject respectively.|$|E
25|$|In her 2008 book, Verb Meaning and The Lexicon: A First-Phase Syntax, {{linguist}} Gillian Ramchand {{acknowledges the}} roles of lexical entries {{in the selection of}} complex verbs and their arguments. 'First-Phase' syntax proposes that event structure and event participants are directly represented in the syntax by means of binary branching. This branching ensures that the Specifier is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> must co-describe the verb's event.|$|E
25|$|Araki allows two verb {{roots to}} appear in one single <b>verb</b> <b>phrase,</b> thus forming a sort of complex verb {V1, V2}; usually {{no more than two}} verbs can appear at a time. This series of two verbs share one mood-subject clitic and the same aspect markers. This does not imply that they semantically have the same subject. No object or other {{complement}} can insert between these two verbs. The transitivity suffix -i, as well as the object suffix, appear on the right of the second verb, provided this is authorized by the morphology of V2 and by the syntactic context.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Chinese <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> {{classification}} is {{to determine}} boundaries of <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> and divide them exactly, using brackets, by automatically analyzing and processing by computer after the sentences have been decollated and marked the characteristic or property of a certain word. SVM classification model is a common and powerful for classification tasks. In this paper, the SVM classification model is built by extracting static features and dynamic features of Chinese <b>verb</b> <b>phrases,</b> and an algorithm to perform Chinese <b>verb</b> <b>phrases</b> classification using support vector machine is proposed. Using 3500 sentences to train and test, experiment {{results show that the}} SVM model dramatically reduces the training time and steps.

25|$|The {{grammatical}} category {{associated with}} affirmative and negative is called polarity. This {{means that a}} sentence, <b>verb</b> <b>phrase,</b> etc. {{may be said to}} have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as English not, an affix such as Japanese -nai, or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the predicate. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called negation – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.|$|E
25|$|This {{sentence}} is semantically ambiguous. Specifically, {{it contains a}} scope ambiguity. This ambiguity cannot be resolved at surface structure, since someone, being within the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase,</b> must be lower in the structure than everyone. This case exemplifies the general fact that natural language is insufficiently specified for strict logical meaning. Robert May argued for the postulation of LF partly in order to account for such ambiguities (among other motivations). At LF, the sentence above would have two possible structural representations, one for each possible scope-reading, in order {{to account for the}} ambiguity by structural differentiation. In this way it is similar in purpose to, but not the same as, logical form in logic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have provided}} evidence {{which may be}} taken to support Kayne's scheme, such as Lin, who considered Standard Chinese sentences with the sentence-final particle le. Certain restrictions on movement from within verb phrases preceding such a particle are found (if various other assumptions from the literature are accepted) {{to be consistent with}} the idea that the <b>verb</b> <b>phrase</b> has moved from its underlying position after its head (the particle le here being taken as the head of an aspect phrase). However, Takita (2009) observes that similar restrictions do not apply in Japanese, in spite of its surface head-final character, concluding that if Lin's assumptions are correct, then Japanese must be considered to be a true head-final language, contrary to the main tenet of Antisymmetry. More details about these arguments {{can be found in the}} Antisymmetry article.|$|E
