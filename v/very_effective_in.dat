5|$|In 1940, a young Davis had {{appeared}} as a National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis volunteer in a memorable short subject shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against polio. The Crippler featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms, laughing over its victims, until finally dispelled by the volunteer. It was <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> raising contributions.|$|E
5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum.|$|E
5|$|Fatigue {{from the}} South African tour {{affected}} Hobbs in 1910. He scored 1,982 runs {{at an average}} of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season. More effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter, Hobbs was consistently successful in a hot, dry summer which produced good batting pitches. He played few large innings, but was <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> high-pressure games, and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets. Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.|$|E

5|$|Nautical units often play a {{secondary}} role, {{but can be}} essential to victory. Fishing boats are similar to villagers in that they can gather fish. Merchant ships trade resources from the stockpile and exchange it for gold at another player's dock, {{with the amount of}} gold earned being relative to the distance between both docks. Transport ships carry land units from one area of land to another. As well as attacking enemy ships, warships can be <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> attacking land-based units close to the shoreline (because melee units cannot fight back). Warships come either as galleys which fire arrows or triremes which launch bolts or boulders (very effective against buildings near the shoreline).|$|E
5|$|The UK Anime Network had Andy Hanley {{review the}} first four episodes and he {{expressed}} a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers. Hanley wrote about how fast the series was in setting up its premise and described it as an in at the deep end experience. Hanley cited the ruination of Tokyo {{at the end of}} the first episode and the countless deaths that occur by episode four to support this. Hanley argued that while this pace leaves the series open to being labelled as shallow, it's actually <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> keeping the viewer engaged.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{played a}} full season of cricket in 1931. In June, he was {{appointed}} as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932–33 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia's strong batting line up foremost in their minds. Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a dependable, proven batsman. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, The Times correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine's appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth {{their place in the}} side, too old or had controversy attached to them. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated that he was <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players; it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine's appointment.|$|E

5|$|Major interplanetary {{corporations}} {{known as}} Hammond Robotics—a major manufacturing, aerospace and defense contractor—used {{resources of the}} Frontier to make builds of mecha-combatants such as Titans and Spectres. Titans are descendants of present-day fledgling military exoskeletons. In addition to the obvious combat applications, unarmed forms of Titans are used in heavy industries like cargo transport and deep space ship salvage. They are also used in special applications such as deep space search and rescue, and are <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> inhospitable environments. The use of Titans is widespread throughout the Frontier in both combat and civilian life. As with Titans, the Frontier contains Pilots of many different styles and experiences. Titan Pilots are rated by 'certifications', most of which apply to civilian applications, such as construction, shipping, and heavy salvage industries. The most prestigious {{of these is the}} Full Combat Certification - a widely published series of tests that grade a Titan Pilot's abilities. Because of the extreme physical and mental challenges of mastering both Titan combat & dismounted parkour movement, a fully combat certified Titan pilot is a rare find, and the combat skills of active Pilots in the field varies widely throughout the Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Silver is {{a rather}} unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> {{shielding}} the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is {{near the bottom of}} the electrochemical series (E0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799V). In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize. Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, silver is large enough that this factor has a much smaller effect, and furthermore the second ionisation energy of silver is greater than that for copper. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidizes water.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundations}} of the Pax Mongolica lie in the Mongol Empire beginning with Genghis Khan in the early 13th century. In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region, Genghis Khan revolutionised the way Mongolian tribal society was structured. After each new victory, {{more and more people}} were incorporated under Genghis Khan's rule, thus diversifying the societal balance of the tribe. In 1203, Genghis Khan, in an effort to strengthen his army, ordered a reform that reorganised his army's structure while breaking down the traditional clan- and kindred-based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military. He arranged his army into arbans (inter-ethnic groups of ten), and the members of an arban were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin. Ten arbans made a zuun, or a company; ten zuuns made a myangan, or a battalion; and ten myangans formed a tumen, or an army of 10,000. This decimal system organisation of Genghis Khan's strong military would prove <b>very</b> <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> conquering, by persuasion or force, the many tribes of the central Asian steppe, but it would also strengthen Mongol society as a whole. By 1206 Genghis Khan's military expansion had unified the tribes of Mongolia, and in the same year he was elected and acclaimed as the leader of Mongolia.|$|E
