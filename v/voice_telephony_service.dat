40|$|The {{examination}} of communications infrastructure and service take-up undertaken {{in this report}} is intended to {{provide an overview of}} infrastructure and service availability across Australia in residential and small business retail markets. The Communications Infrastructure and Services Availability Report 2006 - 07 is a joint report issued by ACMA and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The {{examination of}} infrastructure and service take-up undertaken in this report is intended to provide an overview of infrastructure and service availability across Australia in residential and small business retail markets. As the ACCC?s reporting series: Telecommunications Competitive Safeguards and the Changes in the Prices Paid for Telecommunications Services considers the issue of pricing, this is not analysed in this report. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report provides an overview of the state of communications infrastructure and service availability in Australia. The report identifies 19 internet service providers (ISPs) with their own network Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) providing services to end-users, up from nine ISPs identified in 2004 ? 05. These deployments are primarily driven by ISPs seeking to differentiate their services from the resale of Telstra Wholesale services. The scope and scale of these deployments is creating infrastructure competition and new wholesale opportunities outside of Telstra Wholesale?s provision of internet services. Many of the ISPs identified in ACMA?s Communications Services Availability in Australia 2005 ? 06 report continue to expand the coverage of their networks. There has been {{growth in the number of}} ADSL-enabled exchanges across Australia, with 323 additional exchanges enabled between 30 June 2006 and 31 January 2007. Increased availability of ADSL 2 + services has emerged in non-metropolitan areas, with 88 non-metropolitan exchanges identified in January 2007 compared with 22 in June 2006. Network deployments are helping to provide greater bandwidth to Australian broadband users, with many ISPs deploying ADSL 2 + broadband services technically capable of delivering up to 24 megabits per second (Mbit/s) to end users. Wireless broadband services continue to play an important role in providing broadband services to Australian consumers, with 204 companies providing wireless services in Australia, and more than half of these companies providing services to regional areas. There are 6. 6 million internet subscribers in Australia? 3. 9 million using broadband and 2. 7 million dial-up subscribers. The report notes the actions of third generation (3 G) mobile carriers to upgrade the bandwidth capabilities of their networks, with each mobile carrier now having implemented the high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) protocol to provide improved mobile data services. In the fixed voice market, this report identifies 369 <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> <b>service</b> providers operating in Australia, with 166 companies offering services over the public switched telecommunications network (PSTN), 242 companies offering voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services, and 74 companies providing both PSTN and VoIP services. Around 18 per cent of ISPs are offering VoIP services as part of bundled broadband service offers. Appendix A contains a description of telecommunications local access networks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} {{barriers}} to the commercial success of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services beyond a single domain (e. g., a company intranet, a single operator’s domain) as {{a viable alternative to}} the classical <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> <b>services</b> is Quality-of-Service (QoS). The ability to deliver QoS is particularly challenging in next-generation networks, where VoIP services will be accessible via a variety of end-device types and over sequences of heterogeneous network domains, each with their specific QoS-mechanisms and owned by different competing network operators that will negotiate Service Level Agreements (SLAs) amongst each other. In this paper, we provide a method to effectively realize end-to-end QoS for VoIP as perceived by the end user in an environment in which multiple business domains are involved. To this end, we first present a quantitative model for the relation between (1) the end-to-end QoS at the end-user perception level, (2) the QoS requirements to network infrastructure given the specifics of the end user terminal, and (3) the SLAs negotiated at the network level between the different domain owners. Second, we show how the concept of a per-domain QoS certificate can help to guarantee predictable QoS for VoIP traffic over their network domains. This enables VoIP service providers to realize the desired perceived QoS levels for both intra and inter-domain VoIP sessions. This paper provides a simple and practically feasible approach for VoIP service providers to identify which network level SLAs need to be negotiated with other parties to realize the desired QoS level to their customers...|$|R

40|$|Voice Over IP (VoIP) is {{increasingly}} displacing traditional <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> <b>services,</b> but the IP networks that carry the traffic are inherently prone to delays and losses that impact the voice quality. This thesis addresses those quality degradations with {{particular emphasis on}} wireless networks. The scenarios considered in the thesis focus on the two most recent wireless access technologies, namely Long Term Evolution (LTE) andWireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). These scenarios have in common the undesired effects of call quality degradation when the increased traffic volume across the network causes congestion. This thesis points out {{the causes of the}} congestion and proposes solutions tailored specially for each wireless access technology. The solutions share a common concept, proposed and developed in this thesis, namely the Intermediate Mean Opinion Score (iMOS). The MOS is basically a call quality assessment methodology typically performed at the end-points. The novelty of iMOS resides in the fact that accurate call quality measurements are performed at intermediate points in the network rather than in the end-nodes. The iMOS proposed in this thesis uses the E-Model to estimate the quality of VoIP calls, based on network performance indicators. Measuring the call quality at intermediate points is driven by the operators’ intent to guarantee high levels of VoIP quality of service. The users’ increased need for wireless access generates an unpredicted growth of traffic volume, which is directly reflected in the perceived VoIP call quality. The second part of this thesis addresses this problem and focuses on developing Call Admission Control (CAC) solutions designed to support the quality of service for VoIP while maximizing the amount of traffic allowed to pass through the network. The iMOS concept and iMOS-based CAC solutions are validated through extensive simulations of realistic deployment scenarios of LTE femtocells and WMNs. The results highlight the existence of the call degradation problems and the proposed solutions are shown to have the capability of increasing the call quality and call capacity, and protecting against congestion which causes the undesired call quality degradation...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the concept}} of <b>Voice</b> and <b>Telephony</b> Over ATM (VTOA) has been widely studied. Although ATM {{benefits}} voice communications in many aspects, its packet-switched nature impairs the speech quality. In this paper, we evaluate the speech quality {{with a focus on}} the impact of Cell Delay Variation (CDV). We build an experimental system to do the evaluations. We also define a new parameter, named Cell Delay Variation Accumulation Length (CDVAL), to measure the impact of CDV on speech quality. Ne observe that the speech quality mainly depends on the value of CDVAL, but does not strongly depend on the other items, including the distribution of cell end-to-end delay, the position and even the number of the intermittence caused by CDV. We find that there exists an acceptable threshold of CDVAL. According to our experiments, to keep the speech in "good" quality (MOS congruent to 3. 5), the CDVAL value must be less than 3 ms without any speech cell loss; such a threshold drops to 2 ms if 5 % speech cells are lost. The results indicate that buffer is necessary for doing CDV compensation at the far end devices in VTOA. The results are also very helpful for the proper design of the network architecture and control algorithms, especially be important for the designing of the CDV compensation schemes, when ATM networks are used to provide <b>voice</b> and <b>telephony</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} widespread adoption of mobile devices. Whereas initial popularity {{was driven by}} <b>voice</b> <b>telephony</b> <b>services,</b> capabilities are now broadening to allow an increasing range of data orientated services. Such services serve to extend the range of sensitive data accessible through such devices and will in turn increase the requirement for reliable authentication of users. This thesis considers the authentication requirements of mobile devices and proposes novel mechanisms to improve upon {{the current state of}} the art. The investigation begins with an examination of existing authentication techniques, and illustrates a wide range of drawbacks. A survey of end-users reveals that current methods are frequently misused and considered inconvenient, and that enhanced methods of security are consequently required. To this end, biometric approaches are identified as a potential means of overcoming the perceived constraints, offering an opportunity for security to be maintained beyond pointof- entry, in a continuous and transparent fashion. The research considers the applicability of different biometric approaches for mobile device implementation, and identifies keystroke analysis as a technique that can offer significant potential within mobile telephony. Experimental evaluations reveal the potential of the technique when applied to a Personal Identification Number (PIN), telephone number and text message, with best case equal error rates (EER) of 9 %, 8 % and 18 % respectively. In spite of the success of keystroke analysis for many users, the results demonstrate the technique is not uniformly successful across the whole of a given population. Further investigation suggests that the same will be true for other biometrics, and therefore that no single authentication technique could be relied upon to account for all the users in all interaction scenarios. As such, a novel authentication architecture is specified, which is capable of utilising the particular hardware configurations and computational capabilities of devices to provide a robust, modular and composite authentication mechanism. The approach, known as IAMS (Intelligent Authentication Management System), is capable of utilising a broad range of biometric and secret knowledge based approaches to provide a continuous confidence measure in the identity of the user. With a high confidence, users are given immediate access to sensitive services and information, whereas with lower levels of confidence, restrictions can be placed upon access to sensitive services, until subsequent reassurance of a user's identity. The novel architecture is validated through a proof-of-concept prototype. A series of test scenarios are used to illustrate how IAMS would behave, given authorised and impostor authentication attempts. The results support the use of a composite authentication approach to enable the non-intrusive authentication of users on mobile devices.
