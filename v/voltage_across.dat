5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in lightning arresters in electric power systems. These devices must exhibit high resistance until the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> them reaches a certain threshold VT {{at which point}} their resistance must drop to a lower level and maintain this level until the applied voltage drops below VT.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{time-frame}} of {{the capacitance}} change (as much as 50ms at 20Hz audio signal), {{the charge is}} practically constant and the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the capacitor varies {{above and below the}} bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute no voltage gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.|$|E

25|$|For {{components}} {{connected in}} parallel, the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> each circuit element is the same; {{the ratio of}} currents through any two elements is the inverse ratio of their impedances.|$|E
25|$|Current {{limiting}} for Q20 {{is performed}} in the voltage gain stage: Q22 senses the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> Q19's emitter resistor (50); as it turns on, it diminishes the drive current to Q15 base.|$|E

30|$|Under {{the same}} input voltages, when using delta-connected autotransformer, the <b>voltages</b> <b>across</b> the ZSBT and IPR {{are greater than}} that of using wye-connected autotransformer, respectively.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the kVA rating of the autotransformer, it is necessary {{to calculate the}} <b>voltages</b> <b>across</b> and currents through the windings of the autotransformer.|$|R
25|$|Before {{an action}} {{potential}} occurs, the axonal membrane {{is at its}} normal resting potential, and Na+ channels are in their deactivated state, blocked on the extracellular side by their activation gates. In response to an electric current (in this case, an action potential), the activation gates open, allowing positively charged Na+ ions to flow into the neuron through the channels, and causing the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the neuronal membrane to increase. Because the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the membrane is initially negative, as its voltage increases to and past zero, {{it is said to}} depolarize. This increase in voltage constitutes the rising phase of an action potential.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E
25|$|A purely {{reactive}} {{component is}} distinguished by the sinusoidal <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the component being in quadrature with the sinusoidal current through the component. This {{implies that the}} component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit. A pure reactance will not dissipate any power.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{estimation}} filtering for battery management systems of lead-acid cells in hybrid electric vehicles. The well known finite impulse response (FIR) filter is adopted for the estimation filtering. The proposed method provides the filtered {{estimates for the}} output voltage as well as <b>voltages</b> <b>across</b> the bulk and surface capacitors. These filtered estimates have good inherent properties. It is shown that the filtered estimate for the output voltage is not affected by <b>voltages</b> <b>across</b> capacitors when their initial values are constant on the window. It is also shown that the filtered estimate for <b>voltages</b> <b>across</b> capacitors is separated from the output voltage term. From discussions about the choice of window length and normalized noise covariance, it is shown {{that they can make}} the estimation performance of the proposed FIR filtering based method as good as possible. Numerical simulations show the performance of the proposed method is superior to the existing Kalman filtering based method. Key words...|$|R

25|$|As for {{ordinary}} resistors, {{the noise of}} photoresistors consists of thermal, shot and flicker noise; the thermal component dominates at frequencies above 10kHz and brings a minor contribution at low frequencies. In practice, the noise of a photoresistor is neglected, if the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> its terminals is lower than 80 V.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the tube}} strikes, the {{impinging}} main discharge keeps the cathodes hot, permitting continued electron emission {{without the need}} for the filaments to continue to be heated. The starter switch does not close again because the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the lit tube is insufficient to start a glow discharge in the starter.|$|E
25|$|Knowing the above, if a {{capacitor}} is charged until its voltage equals the sampled voltage of an incoming weak signal, {{and if the}} capacitor's capacitance is then reduced (say, by manually moving the plates further apart), then the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the capacitor will increase. In this way, the voltage of the weak signal is amplified.|$|E

25|$|Nanofuidic triode is a {{three-terminal}} {{double junction}} nanofluidic device composed of positive-charged alumina and negative-charged silica nanochannels. The device {{is essentially a}} three-terminal bipolar junction transistor. By controlling the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> emitter and collector terminals, one can regulate the ion current from base terminal {{to one of the}} other two terminals, functioning as an ionic single-pole, double-throw switch.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} {{resistor}} {{is exactly the}} same in the time domain and the -domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the -domain account for that.|$|E

The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> an inductor.

25|$|The {{impedance}} of {{a device}} {{can be calculated}} by complex division of the voltage and current. The impedance of the device can be calculated by applying a sinusoidal voltage to the device in series with a resistor, and measuring the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the resistor and across the device. Performing this measurement by sweeping the frequencies of the applied signal provides the impedance phase and magnitude.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the {{capacitor}} {{reaches the}} breakdown voltage of the spark gap (SG) a spark starts, reducing the spark gap resistance {{to a very}} low value. This completes the primary circuit and current from the capacitor flows through the primary coil (L1). The current flows rapidly {{back and forth between}} the plates of the capacitor through the coil, generating radio frequency oscillating current in the primary circuit at the circuit's resonant frequency.|$|E
25|$|The {{voltage drop}} VF across the forward biased diode {{in the circuit}} of a passive {{rectifier}} is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output <b>voltage</b> <b>across</b> the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of VF. As a result, the voltage drop VF is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (super) diode with VF = 0 V.|$|E
