In either case, the distorted electric ankt magnetic fields can be best visualized as a vectorial sum of {{primary and secondary}} fields. Secondary electric fields due to electric harge build-up in the galvanic ase persist to the longest periods. In contrast, he secondary electric and magnetic fields due to inductive, vortex currents disappear t long periods. The static shift of magnetotelhiric (MT) apparent resistivity sounding curves {{is a classic example}} of the galvanic effect. Methods to correct for unwanted istortions uch as the static shift can be classified into six categories: use of invariant response parameters, curve shifting, statistical <b>veraging,</b> spatial filtering, use of distortion tensors, and computer modeling. Although invariant impedance alculations are simple to make, they cannot, in general, recover the undistorted impedance. Short period curve shifting is best done with auxiliary soundings such as time domain EM; however, this requires multiple surveys. The shifting of long period MT sounding branches i useful if a standard curve is known and can be matched. Statistical <b>veraging</b> of neighboring MT soundings that are conformal but static shifted has proven very effective at removing random distortions if adaquate data are available.

Regulatory agencies agreed that relocation of the nest burrows would allow construction to proceed and {{provide an opportunity to}} determine the efficacy of moving occupied Burrowing Owl nests as a mitigation technique. Relocated nests contained one to five nestlings, ranging in age from 27 - 45 d. ABS (plastic chamber and tunnel), wooden perches, and dependent young were relocated (active relocation) to adjacent areas that contained natural vegetation; adults were not moved but were expected to travel the short distances to new burrow locations on their own (passive relocation). Access to natural burrows near original nest locations was restricted where possible. Relocation distancesa <b>veraged</b> 1 53 m and ranged from 72 - 258 m.

40|$|Summary. Background. Systolic blood pressure, total {{cholesterol}} and smoking are known predictors {{of cardiovascular disease}} (CVD) mortality. Less {{is known about the}} effect of lifetime accumulation and changes of risk factors over time as predictors of CVD mortality, especially in very long follow-up studies. Methods. Data from the Finnish cohorts of the Seven Countries Study were used. The baseline examination was in 1959 and seven re-examinations were carried out approximately in five-year intervals. Cohorts were followed up for mortality until the end of 2011. Time-dependent Cox models with regular time-updated risk factors, time-dependent averages of risk factors and latest changes in risk factors, using smoothing splines to discover nonlinear effects were used to analyse the predictive effect of risk factors for CVD mortality. Results. A model using cumulative risk factors, modelled as the individual-level <b>verages</b> of several risk factor measurements over time, predicted CVD mortality better than a model using the most recent measurement information. This difference seemed to be most prominent for systolic blood pressure. U-shaped effects of the original predictors can be explained by partitioning a risk factor effect between the recent level and the change trajectory. The change in body mass index predicted the risk although body mass index itself did not. Conclusions. The lifetime accumulation of risk factors and the observed changes in risk factor levels over time are strong predictors of CVD mortality. It is important to investigate different ways of using the longitudinal risk factor measurements {{to take full advantage of}} them...|$|R

The purpose of this research to study the effects of agricultural land management systems in conventional and organic semi against NPS abundance, and to study the effectiveness of NPS in killing insect pests Spodoptera litura, NPS from agricultural ecosystems with conventional management systems and semi-organic. The results showed that agricultural land managed organically semi NPS has a higher abundance compared with farms managed conventionally. Semi-organic farmland has an a <b>verage</b> abundance of NPS 2 times higher than that of conventional land JI 43. 66 g- 1, whereas abundance of land NPS conventional JI 15. 33 g- 1. In testing the effectiveness of Steinernema obtained from semi-organic farms and conventional equally effective in shutting down the test insect Spodoptera litura but tend to be more effective coming from semi-organic land. Therefore, the use of external inputs such as fertilizers and high-energy chemical insecticides should be reduced...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION : Whether to ream the {{compound}} tibia fr actures witle intramedullary interlocking nailing or not {{has been an}} eternal debate. So we have conducted a study to compare the functional outcomes, rate of infection and time needed for union in reamed and unreamed interlocking nailing on open tibia frac tures. METHODOLOGY: This study was carried out as a prospective, comparative study. 100 patients with open fractures of tibial shaft admitted in our hospital between J une 2011 and January 2013 {{were enrolled in the}} study. Patients outside the age group of 20 - 50 years of age, severely ommuniated fractures and fractures classified under Gustilo Anderson type III b and IIIc were excluded. 100 fractures were divided into two groups (reamed nailing and unreamed nailing) n= 50 in each with simple randomization techn ique. Evaluation in the form of radiological union was done with serial x - rays and functional grading according to Klemm & Borner’s criteria for tibial shaft fractures was done at the end of 6 months. RESULTS: A <b>verage</b> fracture healing time was 16 - 20 weeks in both in undreamed nailing radiologically. Also, differences in rates of clinical union, clinical outcome, time for weight bearing and complication in both groups were not significant. Post - operative infection was found in 5 cases in reamed group and 3 c ases in unreamed group. CONCLUSION: There are no clear indications or contraindications or advantage/disadvantage to favour either reamed or unreamed nailing over each other. Fracture union, functional outcome and rate of complications are similar in both group...|$|E
40|$|Purposes: The {{importance}} of the femoral sagittal bowing on total knee arthroplasty is under-recognized. The bowing could lead to potential errors in positioning of the femoral component if it is ignored. We aimed to document the femoral sagittal bowing at different segments of the Chinese femur and to discuss {{the implications of this}} sagittal bowing on total knee arthroplasty. Methods: One hundred lateral radiogr aphs of the entire lower limbs of 85 Chinese patients admitted for total knee arthroplasty were digitized. The radii of curvature of the intramedullary canal of the proximal, middle and distal one-third of the femora were measured. Results: The a <b>verage</b> age of the patients was 67. 3 years. The radii of curvature of the proximal, middle and distal one-third of the femora were 1081. 6, 926. 2 and 715. 1 mm, respectively. The distal one-third of the femora was signi. cantly more bowed than the other parts of the femora (p < 0. 001). The distal femoral bowing was more profound in rheumatoid patients and in those with a short femur. Conclusions: The lateral contour of the Chinese femur is like a hockey stick. This exaggerated sagittal bowing in the Chinese femur can affect the final sagittal position of the femoral component and has implications for the choice of implant design. In revision setting, a long and straight press-fit stem might either endanger the anterior cortex or deflect the femoral component to an extended position. © 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.
