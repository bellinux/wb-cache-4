After the oil spill that occurred near Cape Cod in West Falmouth, Massachusetts in 1969, researchers collected sediment and found an abundance of what they believed to be C. capitata. However, subsequent research showed that while the individuals collected from that region had <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>gross</b> morphology, their life histories, methods of reproduction and genetics indicated {{there were at least}} six distinct species.

40|$|Description and {{modelisation}} {{of growth}} and development of appletree (Malus x domestica Borkh.). I. Most probable structure of young tree. Based on the observation of all or, at least, {{a large number of}} shoots growing on unpruned apple trees, cv. Cox's Orange Pippin and Jonagold grafted on EM 9, an original codification system has been conceived. It allows to locate and identify quickly and unequivocally any shoot or growth. From a comprehensive collection of such codified observations, the most probable structure of young one to five year old trees has been established, with the amount and characters of the different observed shoot types. Both varieties display <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>gross</b> structures, despite minor differences in form, flowering mode and productivity. The development of the trees occurs in two phases. The first one builds up a frame composed by the trunk and several storied sets of branches. Flowering is rather strictly alternate during this phase. The second one consists in the reinforcement of the branches by axillary growth, but even more by sympodial branching due to increasing and repeated terminal flowering. This basic structure provides a reference to appreciate changes in tree development brought about by rootstock, fruit load or training practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The genus Halimeda (Lamouroux) was {{examined}} {{on the basis}} of collection made from nine locations during 1999 - 2008 along the Egyptian Red Sea coral reefs with emphasis on the effect of illumination at different biotopes on the morphology of the species. Five species were identified: Halimeda monile (Ellis and Solander) Lamouroux, H. macroloba Decaisne, H. opuntia (L) Lamouroux, H. discoidea Decaisne and H. tuna (Ellis and Solander) Lamouroux. These species are described in detail with original illustrations and an identification key. As for Halimeda monile and H. macroloba showed no marked changes in relation to light conditions; H. opuntia showed marked difference in branching pattern and segment shape; whereas H. discoidea and H. tuna exhibited <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>gross</b> morphology that makes difficulties in distinguishing some specimens. Nodal structure seems to vary less at different biotopes and, therefore, is more useful in species identification. Southern area of the Egyptian Red Sea coast favored the growth of all species while, only H. opuntia and H. tuna were found in the northern area and this may point out for conservation of the reef communities.

Aims were (1) to clarify activity for voiceless consonants, (2) to determine whether lax vowels have higher activity than tense vowels, and (3) to compare anterior and posterior insertions in the muscle. Results: (1) Clearly higher CT activity for voiceless than voiced consonants, but often extending more into the neighbouring vowel than might be necessary to just support consonant devoicing; (2) a tendency for higher CT on lax vowels. Lax vowels often appear to have higher F 0 than a tongue-pull model of intrinsic pitch would predict.

Four- and 20 -week-old chickens of lines 15 × 7 and CM (commercial source) had substantial resistance to mortality and <b>gross</b> <b>lesions.</b> In contrast, in line 7, which was tested at 1 -day, 2 -, 4 -, 8 -, 12 - and 16 -week age levels, 4 -week-old chickens were fully susceptible to clinical Marek's disease (MD), although resistance was demonstrated at 8 -week and older age levels. Genetically resistant chickens of line 6 maintained their resistance at all age levels tested. Pathogenesis of MD was compared in 12 -week-old and 1 -day-old chickens of line 15 × 7.

40|$|The {{mutation}} {{of viruses}} to form new strains (1, 2) is aphenomenon {{which has been}} recognized {{for many years in}} the form of its various biological manifestations, but only recently has it become possible to attempt a correlation of this knowledge with the fundamental chemistry of the Viruses themselves. Thus, amino acid analyses made on strains of tobacco mosaic virus have revealed differences in the composition of the virus proteins which presumably can explain their different biological properties and which also conceivably illustrate the nature of the chemical changes which accompany the mutation of a Virus to form a new strain (3 - 7). In view of these findings, it was naturally of interest {{to determine whether or not}} similar chemical differences exist between strains or types of an animal virus.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of disease}} caused by Serpulina hyodysenteriae was examined by (1) determining the susceptibilities of inbred murine strains to lesion development, (2) examining {{the ability of}} S. hyodysenteriae endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations to induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and (3) investigating the contributions of secondary bacteria to S. hyodysenteriae-induced pathogenesis in gnotobiotic mice. Of all inbred murine strains tested, C 3 H strains of mice appeared most susceptible to lesion development after S. hyodysenteriae challenge. C 3 H/HeJ mice, being LPS-hyporesponsive, were less susceptible to lesion development than LPS-responsive C 3 H/HeN. S. hyodysenteriae endotoxin preparations were active in increasing serum TNF activity in vivo in mice. Sera from pigs treated with S. hyodysenteriae endotoxin or LPS preparations exhibited much less TNF activity than sera from pigs treated with LPS from Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium;Secondary bacteria appear to contribute a dynamic role to the pathogenesis of the disease; treating conventional mice with oral antibiotics prevented lesion formation even {{with high levels of}} colonizing S. hyodysenteriae. Additionally, a defined diet is described which, through presumed changes in gut microflora, increases susceptibility of mice to development of lesions after S. hyodysenteriae challenge. Gnotobiotic mice were monoassociated with S. hyodysenteriae or with S. innocens for protracted incubation times. A difference noted histologically between the two groups was that pathogenesis S. hyodysenteriae invaded the lamina propria of the cecum, whereas the non-pathogenic S. innocens did not. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were experimentally challenged with S. hyodysenteriae; SCID mice developed <b>similar</b> <b>gross</b> cecal <b>lesions,</b> but, histologically, the lamina propria cellular infiltrate was characterized by high numbers of neutrophils.

40|$|Mesobanded lithotypes (band rhythmites) of banded iron-formation (BIF) {{from the}} Griquatown and Kuruman Iron Formations of the Asbestos Hills Subgroup (Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa) have been sampled. 142 major and trace element {{analyses}} from diamond drill cores, an underground mine {{and an open}} pit mine were carried out. Out of these 19 open pit mine samples {{were excluded from the}} interpretation of the analytical results because of a different behaviour of the alkali elements. It is shown that other published data seem to suffer from the same effect. The results show that the chemical composition of the iron-formations is virtually independent of their stratigraphic and geographic localities over hundreds of kilometres across Griqualand West, if averaged element distribution patterns are compared. The major element composition of mesobanded iron-formation samples (magnetite chert and magnetite-carbonate chert, riebeckite-carbonate chert and ironsilicate chert) varies between 30 and 51 wt. % SiO 2, 23 and 66 wt. % Fe 2 O 3 T, < 0. 02 and 0. 14 wt. % TiO 2, < 0. 04 and 1. 9 wt. % Al 2 O 3, < 0. 02 and 1. 05 wt. % MnO, 1. 48 and 7. 5 wt. % MgO, 0. 14 and 12. 09 wt. % CaO, 0. 11 and 4. 26 wt. % Na 2 O, < 0. 007 and 2. 39 wt. % K 2 O and < 0. 01 and 1. 57 wt. % P 2 O 5. The trace element contents are generally low and range from < 1 to 2 ppm Nb (detected in only one sample), < 2 to 23 ppm Zr, < 3 to 31 ppm Y, < 2 to 152 ppm Sr, < 4 to 5 ppm U (detected in only one sample), < 2 to 240 ppm Rb, < 4 to 4 ppm Th, < 4 to 19 ppm Pb, < 3 to 4 ppm Ga, < 4 to 33 ppm Zn, < 6 to 69 ppm Cu, < 7 to 17 ppm Ni (detected in only one sample), < 5 to 59 ppm Cr, < 4 to 16 ppm V and < 10 to 177 ppm Ba. The intercalated stilpnomelane lutites have a <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> <b>gross</b> composition but regularly display higher concentrations of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, K 2 O, and Zr. They have a different origin but certainly bear the imprint of the BIF environment and must be considered a clastic contaminant of the otherwise chemically or biochemically precipitated iron-formations. Clastic contamination and subsequent hydrothermal alteration are the most plausible agents which effected the element distribution pattern of the BIF, because they are best to reconcile with a model which assumes hydrothermal fluids as major sources of BIF. It can be concluded, from the general geochemical uniformity of BIF throughout the depository and from the absence of clear-cut relations of elemental distributions and ratios to crustal components (documented by low K/Rb, high Rb/Sr ratios, no relevant correlation between TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3), that a basinward hydrothermal system acted as a source for the Fe and Si in the BIF. The geochemical similarity between the microbanded Kuruman Iron Formation and the interbedded granular and microbanded Griquatown Iron Formation suggests deposition of the iron-formations in the same chemical environment over the entire basin from the inception of these conditions until their termination by clastic input. The somewhat lower trace element concentrations in the Griquatown Iron Formation as compared to the Kuruman Iron Formation probably do not mean an environmental change, but may reflect the diagenetic and tectonic evolution of the iron-formations. Regular but short-lived interruptions by distal volcanic ash had no influence on the bulk BIF composition. On the contrary, the volcanics reveal a strong overprint by the regional major element BIF chemistry. Therefore, the relationship between volcanogenic rocks and banded iron-formation seems to be coincidental and related to basin development. The general geochemical similarity of the Griquatown and Kuruman Iron Formations with other Proterozoic and Archaean iron-formations in the world and especially with those of the Hamersley Basin, leads us {{to the conclusion that the}} BIF of the Griqualand West Sequence are representatives of typical, large-scale iron-formations of the Precambrian, which all formed in chemically <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> environments. © 1995.

For the remainder of the <b>gross</b> <b>lesions,</b> no single microscopic finding constituted> 50 % of the total. Host response varied with the agent present on histology. Fragmentation of tissues was most often associated with algae (60 %), whereas necrosis dominated (53 %) for fungi. Two newly documented potentially symbiotic tissue-associated metazoans were seen in Porites and Montipora. Findings of multiple potential etiologies for a given <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> highlight the importance of incorporating histopathology in coral disease surveys. This study also expands the range of corals infected with cell-associated microbial aggregates...|$|R
40|$|Stocking {{density is}} a {{management}} factor which has critical {{implications for the}} poultry industry. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of high stocking density as a predisposing factor in an experimental model of necrotic enteritis in broiler chicks. The experimental challenge model included an oral inoculation with 10 -fold dose of attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and multiple oral inoculations with a specific strain of Clostridium perfringens. Two hundred and forty as hatched day-old broiler chicks were randomly allocated to four treatment groups according to the following experimental design: group N, with normal stocking density (15 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group D, with high stocking density (30 birds/m(2)) and no challenge; group P, with normal stocking density and positive challenge; and group DP, with high stocking density and positive challenge. From each bird, the intestine, gizzard and liver were collected and scored for <b>gross</b> <b>lesions.</b> The intestinal digesta was collected for pH and viscosity determination. One caecum from each bird was taken for microbiological analysis. The statistical analysis and evaluation of the experimental data revealed significant interaction effects between "stocking density" and "challenge", regarding <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> scores in intestine and liver, pH values in jejunum, ileum and caeca as well as C. perfringens counts in the caeca (P <= 0. 05). High stocking density in challenged birds increased the <b>gross</b> <b>lesion</b> score in the intestine (P <= 0. 05), contrary to unchallenged birds. It can be concluded that high stocking density affects unfavourably the welfare and gut health of broiler chicks, predisposes to necrotic enteritis in a subclinical experimental model and increases further its importance as a management factor for the poultry industry...|$|R
40|$|Pasteurella multocida (serotype 3 :A) was {{isolated}} from a rabbit with clinical signs of suppurative rhinitis. This P. multocida strain was mutagenized with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine {{to obtain a}} genetically stable streptomycin-dependent mutant, from which a life vaccine was prepared. Pasteurella-free rabbits were inoculated intranasally three times at weekly intervals and challenged intranasally with a virulent serotype 3 :A rabbit P. multocida isolate 2 weeks after the third vaccination. The rabbits were killed 2 to 3 weeks later. The vaccine did not cause clinical disease, death, or <b>gross</b> or microscopic <b>lesions.</b> Furthermore, the vaccine protected the challenge rabbits from developing clinical disease, death, and <b>gross</b> <b>lesions.</b> However, mild focal lung lesions were noted {{in several of the}} vaccinated-challenged animals. In contrast, nonvaccinated-challenged rabbits developed pyrexia and anorexia. Furthermore, three of four of these rabbits died with severe <b>gross</b> <b>lesions</b> including pyothorax, suppurative pericarditis, and fibrinopurulent pneumonia. Microscopically, the four nonvaccinated rabbits had moderate to severe suppurative pneumonia and mild to moderate suppurative rhinitis, and two had mild tympanitis. The mutant vaccine did not appear to colonize the nasal cavities. The vaccine prevented the colonization of the virulent challenge organism in lungs, liver, spleen, genital tracts, and blood, but not the nasal cavities...|$|R
