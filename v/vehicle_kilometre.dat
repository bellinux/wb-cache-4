50|$|Tourists to Milford Sound arrive mainly via coach {{over the}} length of SH 94 from Mossburn, a {{predominantly}} high mountain road which is prone to avalanches in winter. The road was only opened in 1953, after the Homer Tunnel was finished, after almost 20 years of intermittent work.

Stopping is prohibited on long stretches due to rock or snow avalanche dangers, and the road is often closed in winter, with the carrying of snow chains mandatory during snow conditions. Helicopters are used during winter to drop explosives onto snow buildup zones above the road in order to cause controlled avalanches. However this does not eliminate the danger that road traffic may be hit by an uncontrolled event, especially in the area of the Homer Tunnel portals.|$|E
30|$|For Finland, {{having the}} same {{population}} risk as Sweden would mean 74 fewer car and goods vehicle fatalities per year.

The index numbers were determined by dividing the number of accidents in the numerator by the vehicle kilometres in the denominator. In the study, only {{the distribution of the}} numbers of accidents in the numerator was determined. On motorways with two traffic lanes in each direction, the risk levels for lorries and light vehicles (passenger cars and vans) are not substantially different. On motorways with three and four traffic lanes in each direction, however, the risk level for lorries is higher than that for light vehicles. The risk level for both vehicle types and for injury accidents and accidents involving material damage only is higher on motorways with three and four traffic lanes in each direction than on motorways with two traffic lanes in each direction.

In contrast to results reported from previous TravelSmart applications, the Melbourne program did not induce a statistically {{significant change in the}} average daily VKT when measured 1 year after the intervention. Multiple regressions revealed that the variability in change in VKT was better explained by socio-demographic variables than by the TravelSmart treatment. The change in VKT was also found to be strongly negatively correlated with the average daily <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> recorded in the before survey [...] indicating the possibility of the 'regression-to-the-mean' effect well known in the road safety literature. The conditions under which the regression-to-the-mean effect may create the illusion of a positive TravelSmart program impact on the reduction in daily average VKT are examined. It is concluded that, in the context of voluntary travel behaviour change evaluations, greater attention should be paid to instrument reactivity arising from the impact of the before travel survey on TravelSmart uptake and/or on change in VKT, and to regression-to-the-mean effects.

30|$|Comparison of {{the number}} of {{fatalities}} per population in 2009 – 2013 between Finland and Sweden showed that for Finland there is a safety potential of 99 yearly fatalities out of 248. The number of fatalities per <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> in Finland is 30 % higher than in Sweden and the number of motor vehicle kilometres per person 23 % higher. The highest potential for fatality reduction is for cars, related mainly to head-on fatalities. Age groups 15 – 17 and 18 – 20  years were identified as having the greatest relative population risk in Finland: the safety potential among 15 – 17 -year-olds is seven moped and motorcycle fatalities and among 18 – 20 -year-olds 12 car fatalities annually. Finland having the Swedish fatality risk per person kilometre would prevent six bicycle and six pedestrian fatalities per year.|$|E

40|$|In this, and {{previous}} related papers, developments of traffic volumes and traffic safety are studied from a system-theoretic point of view. It was proved already {{that such an}} approach is effective andleads to new and interesting theoretical facts. Models for the description of long-term developments of traffic volumes and safety wereestablished, and particular relations between both developments were found. One of these findings was, {{that the number of}} fatalities {{turned out to be a}} function of the derivative of the logistic functiondescribing the development of the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> overthe years. It was noted that the model deviations for the number offatalities and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres</b> were not merely random, but also had systematic components. In the present paper these deviationswere further investigated. For the Netherlands, it is clearly shownthat the number of fatalities is a function of the derivative of the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres,</b> but with a shift in time. The short-term deviations from this long-term development are also related to the derivative of the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometres,</b> but without a shift in time. Similar relations were found for five other countries, (United States, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Israel), although the description of the short-term fluctuations seems to be a bit more complicated. In general, it can be concluded that the system-theoretic approach turned out to be highly effective for the description of long-term and short-term developments in traffic volumes and safety. For the Netherlands up to 95 % of the variance in fatalities can be 'explained' by developments in traffic volumes alone. It is clearly demonstrated that, although it will be very difficult to single out effects of specific safety measures, the combined safety actions taken by a society are very effective in getting the safety factor under control. The most valuable fact that can be learned from this analysis is that, if increased developments in traffic volume occur or are predicted, the immediate safety effects can also be estimated. Therefore, anticipatory safety measures can be taken to cope with these effects before (or immediately after) the moment they appear, improving safety management at a more rational and preventive basis.

30|$|The results {{based on}} {{comparison}} of numbers of motor vehicle kilometres {{suggest that the}} number of fatalities per <b>vehicle</b> <b>kilometre</b> is 30 % higher in Finland than in Sweden. In addition, the number of motor vehicle kilometres per person was 23 % higher in Finland than in Sweden (10, 460  km/year vs. 8480  km/year). We can conclude that Finland has a safety potential in reducing the number of vehicle kilometres, as well as reducing their fatality risk. In Finland, more effective safety measures are therefore recommended to reduce the fatality risk. Good Swedish urban planning has probably led to a more limited need to use cars, contributing to a lower exposure to road accidents. However, advanced urban planning is a structural factor that is hard to achieve quickly [11]. Nonetheless, long-term development is recommended, and other related means are available as well, such as developing public transport and encouraging people to use it, alongside telecommuting, etc.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Traffic {{accidents}} impose large costs, with 1, 291 road {{deaths in}} Australia in 2011.

The proposal is being implemented across Australia, NSW has adopted it this year. Contrary to the PC’s assertions, the evidence is that no fault insurance would increase traffic fatalities by 10 - 30 per cent and accidents by even more. This has implications for the safety design of road infrastructure.
