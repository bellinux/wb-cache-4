2500|$|... "Arcade game" [...] {{generally}} {{refers to}} a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated cabinet which has one built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a CRT screen, and audio amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating {{to the theme of}} the game. While most arcade games are housed in a <b>vertical</b> <b>cabinet,</b> which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s, video arcades were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them.|$|E

5000|$|Although not {{generally}} {{classified as a}} [...] "sawing" [...] illusion, Modern Art is sometimes billed as an [...] "upright dividing the lady in two". The prop is a <b>vertical</b> <b>cabinet</b> which stands alongside a table-like structure that is half its height. The assistant enters the cabinet through a door in the side {{away from the table}} structure. The assistant's face can be seen peering from an opening {{at the top of the}} cabinet and a panel at the bottom of the front of the cabinet is opened to show the assistant's legs. A sword or blade is then placed into a slot at the point where the top of the half-height table meets the cabinet. The top of the cabinet then slides across onto the table, giving the impression that the top half of the assistant has been moved sideways and in the process been severed from the legs by the blade. Panels in the front of the cabinet are opened to show the top and bottom halves of the assistant apparently separate. The top of the cabinet is then slid back into its original position and the assistant emerges unharmed. The effect and method are credited to designer Jim Steinmeyer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{invention}} of the vertical file remains an unsolved mystery. The <b>Vertical</b> Filing <b>Cabinet</b> section in the Early Office Museum website begins {{with a discussion of}} the erroneous conclusions by highly credentialed “secondary sources,” concerning the origin of vertical filing.

However, the information presented in the Early Office Museum’s discussion of <b>vertical</b> filing <b>cabinets</b> suggests that the commercial introduction of vertical filing may have occurred in 1900 when a company named the Library Bureau (founded in 1876, later a division of Remington Rand) published a catalog that included a <b>vertical</b> filing <b>cabinet.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The product {{temperature}} in the refrigerated display cabinets is very variable and it influences directly the safety {{and quality of the}} food products. This variability is due to the type of display <b>cabinet</b> (<b>vertical,</b> horizontal), the position of the product inside the equipment, the fluctuation of the ambient air {{temperature in the}} supermarkets (day/night, opening hours, seasons, air conditioning etc.) and the surrounding condition of the display cabinet (in front of another refrigerated display cabinet or in front of grocery products) etc. This study proposes a thermal model to predict the load temperature in an open <b>vertical</b> display <b>cabinet</b> in function of two random parameters: ambient temperature in the supermarket and radiation temperature of the surrounding walls. The knowledge of the probability density of these parameters, from field measurements or expert knowledge, allows predicting the variability of the {{product temperature}}s inside the display cabinet...|$|R

40|$|The product {{temperature}} in refrigerated display cabinets is very variable and directly influences {{the safety and}} quality of food products. This variability {{is due to the}} type of display <b>cabinet</b> (<b>vertical,</b> horizontal), the position of the product inside the cabinet, fluctuations in the ambient temperature in supermarkets (day/night, opening hours, seasons, air conditioning, etc.) and the surrounding conditions of the display cabinet (in front of another refrigerated display cabinet or in front of grocery products. etc.). This study proposes a heat transfer model to predict the load temperature in an open <b>vertical</b> display <b>cabinet.</b> Heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation was taken into account in the model.

40|$|Due to {{the great}} {{awareness}} of global warming, energy savings {{should be on the}} mind of all design engineers. Saving energy in refrigerated <b>vertical</b> display <b>cabinets,</b> which is a major supermarket appliance, is of great importance to users and manufacturers. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate how to minimize energy usage of refrigerated <b>vertical</b> display <b>cabinets</b> by optimizing the design of its double glazed door. Choosing the gap width can be crucial for optimizing the refrigerator efficiency. The computational fluid dynamics software ‘Fluent’ is used to predict the heat gain through the double glazed door by solving a steady 2 -D model for the natural convection in the air gap including heat transfer due to radiation. The air gap investigated is 1. 5 m high and assumed to have different width 5, 10, 15, 17, 20, 25, 30 & 35 mm which gives aspect ratios in the range 300 – 43. Results show that as the gap size increases (i. e. aspect ratio decreases) the heat gain due to natural convection decreases up to a limit and then reaches almost a constant value while the radiation heat transfer shows an opposite trend. However, the total heat transfer gain decreases until it reaches a constant value. These results suggest that increasing the gap width improves the door’s efficiency; but only up to a certain limit after which the increase in the gap width does not affect the heat transfer anymore. Results also show that at the small gap width (i. e. high aspect ratio), heat transfer due to convection and radiation is almost equal and as the gap width increases, the radiation component starts to have more dominance. This suggests that the use of a type of glass with lower emittance properties may enhance the thermal effectiveness of the door. ...|$|R

The results show that, in short cabinets, 3 D secondary vortices at the side walls provide the most important mechanism for hot air entrainment. Comparison with experimental results shows that a 2 D simulation is totally inadequate for such configurations, while 3 D computations predict refrigeration power within engineering accuracy. Furthermore, the computed refrigerating power shows that even low room air velocity, due to its interaction with the end-wall vortices, has a significant impact on cabinet performance.

40|$|<b>Vertical</b> display <b>cabinets</b> are {{widespread}} in food stores, {{because they have}} a large display area and an ease access for customers. Recently, open cabinets has been replaced with closed ones in order to reduce energy consumptions for refrigeration. However, the presence of the glass doors can have an effect on product visibility because of mist formation on the glass, particularly for low temperature display cabinets. This effect appears when the temperature at the external surface of the glass falls below the ambient dew temperature, which is a quite common situation in humid climate in the mid-season, when neither indoor air heating nor cooling is performed. Today the mist formation is prevented increasing the surface temperature at external side of the glass doors by means of electrical resistances embedded in the doors frame. The glass door surface temperature can be raised enhancing the heat transfer coefficient driving the supply air towards the display cabinet doors. This paper investigates the behaviour of different air ceiling diffusers (vortex diffusers and linear diffusers) {{in order to reduce the}} risk of mist formation and the energy consumption of electrical resistances. Initially, 3 D numerical simulations of isothermal airflow field has been performed and, later, summer and winter conditions were considered.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{investigations of}} the performance of <b>vertical</b> refrigerated display <b>cabinets.</b> Such cabinets are in widespread use and account for a considerable proportion of the energy used in shops. The open front is important for the shop-owner, who wants the chilled items in the cabinet to be well exposed and easily accessible. The purpose of the work has been to analyse the energy flows in display cabinets and subsequently analysing the possibilities to reducing the cabinets' energy requirements while retaining or improving their performance. The work has involved controlled investigations in a climate chamber in order to determine how the ambient climatic conditions and other factors affect energy use. The results show that the energy requirement of a display cabinet is linearly proportional to the difference in specific enthalpy between that of the ambient air and that of the cold air in the cabinet. This means that the cooling power requirement for any arbitrary climate can be determined from measurements of the energy requirements of two different ambient climates. An analysis of energy flows shows that infiltration provides the greatest inward heat leakage in a display cabinet. Radiation and illumination also have a relatively substantial effect in comparison with other possible heat inputs, as they act on the most poorly cooled products in the cabinet. The overall energy requirement of a display cabinet is determined by the ambient climate and the temperature of the warmest item in the cabinet, which therefore in turn determines the mean temperature level in the entire cabinet. Results from experimental measurements and CFD calculations show that the performance of an open <b>vertical</b> display <b>cabinet</b> with cold air blown in through the back is affected by how it is loaded and by how the perforations in the back-plate are arranged. The conclusion is that cold air input through the back-plate is not the best method of cooling the foodstuff packages, as the cold air is supplied where the need for cooling is least. The air curtain is required to provide good enclosure, and also to cool the foodstuffs {{at the front of the}} shelves, all with the least input of energy. The results from the modelling show that it is not possible to achieve the same efficiency and function with air curtains having the same height/width ratio but with different heights. If the air curtain is to cool items at the front of shelves, while at the same time being stable, a shorter air curtain is more efficient than a longer air curtain for the same height/width ratio. The overall conclusion is therefore that a single long air curtain should be replaced by a number of shorter air curtains, and that a thick air curtain is more efficient than a thin air curtain...|$|R

40|$|Storage of {{cold and}} frozen food {{accounts}} for approximately 40 - 50 % {{of the electricity}} used in supermarkets. Open <b>vertical</b> display <b>cabinets</b> are common and are also large users of electrical energy. Many refrigerating machines, for both air conditioning and refrigerating applications, use thermostatic expansion valve (TEV). TEVs {{are by far the}} most widespread expansion device, but they reveal some characteristics that can limit versatility and performance of the machines. For example this valve requires a minimum pressure drop between condensation and evaporation. This prevents possible advantages of low condenser pressure for air cooled condensers. Moreover a minimum superheating must be provided to avoid possible hunting of the valve. Some kinds of plants are more sensitive to negative aspects of TEV regulation, because of plant specifics, kind of duty or distribution of cooling load during the year. Refrigerating machinery in supermarkets is just a characteristic example. One solution to the defects of TEV is the electronic expansion valve (EEV). This electrically driven control device has been studied experimentally and theoretically in recent years and it is now widely available on the market; it controls the refrigerant flow at the evaporator by means of a pressure and a temperature sensor, both at the outlet of evaporator. The two signals are elaborated by a regulator that control, in real time mode, the opening of the valve. To evaluate the possibilities of using EEV against TEV a large supermarket located in the Tirrenic coast of Italy, not far from Pisa, in the North Italy, was retrofitted with the EEVs installed in parallel to the TEVs, in order to operate alternatively the plant with the two technologies. A simulation model was developed to compare the two technologies on an annual basis from the energetic and economic point of view under different conditions. The comparison was made for three different climates, Milano, Roma and Trapani (for which hourly Test Reference Year data are available), to investigate the behaviour of the innovative system varying the condensation conditions...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} thirty years, several {{countries}} have seen to develop the agriculture in a form fast and substantial, with a significant contraction of the traditional systems of production and a marked differentiation of productive activities. The competition pushed towards the specialization and the technological development, particularly {{in the area of}} higher agricultural productivity. The development of agricultural sector increased the demand of technical-scientific knowledge leading to an agricultural statistic system that focused on issues relating to production and productivity. In this context, then, it is necessary that statisticians and industrial users have to meet, exchange experiences, keep in touch with the state-of-art of statistical methods in the food industry and evaluate their impact upon food quality and industrial competitiveness. AGROSTAT 2010 Conference (February, 24 - 26, Benevento, Italy) aimed at drawing an overview of the use of statistical methods in the food industry and at evaluating practical benefits given by new techniques. The conference focused strongly on applications. The aim was to highlight the power of statistical analysis as a decision tool and as help for defining locally optimal competitive industrial strategies. Due to the complexity of the agricultural statistic system, privileged conference themes were: Sensometrics, Chemometrics, Process Control and Risk Analysis. In this special issue much attention has been given to specific industrial problems as well as to highlight new statistical approaches in this methodological context. Several interesting researches have been then selected: the prediction of the product temperature at various positions in a <b>vertical</b> refrigerated display <b>cabinet</b> as well as the quantification of the influence of random parameters such as ambient temperature of supermarket and radiative conditions (Laguerre, Derens and Flick); a new method for the statistical analysis of suitable multi-block matrices (Bougeard, Qannari, Lupo and Chauvin); a non parametric approach {{for the study of the}} controls in the production of agribusiness products (Alibrandi and Giacalone); the investigation of the consumer’s knowledge of specific quality of olive oil as well as the consumer preference and the perceived quality (Scarpato and Pagliuca); the proposal of using differential geometric LARS algorithm in order to study the expression profile of a sample of patients with latex-fruit syndrome (Augugliaro and Mineo);  the use of genetic algorithm on mid-infrared spectrometric data to estimate fatty acid profile of goat milk (Ferrand, Huquet, Barbery, Barillet, Brochard, Larroque and Leray); a proposal to apply the global sensitivity analysis to food safety risk assessment  (Augustin); the impact of chemical and sensorial characteristics on the market price of Italian red wines (Brentari and Zuccolotto) and the use of the Bipolar Mean in Sensory Analysis (Brentari, Dancelli and Maffenini). A number of new ideas based on classical or new methods have been then put forward and tested.
