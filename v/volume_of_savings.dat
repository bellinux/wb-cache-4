40|$|Posing the topic: “Financial actors {{serving the}} common good” today, is {{directly}} related to the lessons we draw from the recent financial crisis. To review the case I understand two points need to be addressed briefly: on one hand, a diagnosis of the crisis, and on the other, the proposal for an efficient and resilient financial sector that follows from that view. Concerning the diagnosis, I agree with those who affirm that the crisis was originated by an excess of savings formed in financial markets for various reasons. This excessive <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> caused mal-investment, and evolved in accordance to the pattern of what we can call a “speculative bubble”, which is not such an infrequent phenomenon in the functioning logic of capital markets. I think that the world economy during the 90 s and 2000 s has been characterized by an immoderate optimism regarding the potential self-regulation of capital markets. This situation was based on two elements: on one hand by the technological revolution that provided powerful new tools, and on the other, by a consensus in economic theory and policy which led to financial deregulation and gave excessive operating margins without adequate supervision [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Credit unions {{differ from}} {{commercial}} {{banks and other}} financial institutions since their members are {{the owners of the}} credit union and they elect board of directors in a democratic one-person-one vote system regardless of the amount of money invested in the credit union. Credit unions contribute to economic development through the wider community, mobilizing significant <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings.</b> They continue to be a major source of growth within the financial sector and therefore their macroeconomic significance has increased considerably. Credit unions have transformed the social and economic status of several members, enabling them to advance from the underprivileged class to the home owner class, by providing affordable terms and conditions for access to loans to finance a wide range of programs. This paper seeks to determine the contribution of credit unions to national development. The DOLS econometrics methodology suggests that the variables of interest that affect economic growth are government capital expenditure, real capital stock and cash of the credit union, the latter indicating that credit unions have a significantly positive effect on national development in Barbados. This conclusion is also complemented by an analysis of five PEARLS ratios which show the significant growth and viability of credit unions. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} certain links between unemployment, savings and growth. Using a standard overlapping generations framework modified to incorporate matching frictions in the labour market and a technology capable of yielding unbounded endogenous growth, {{we show that}} the cross-country bivariate correlation between unemployment and growth can be either positive or negative depending on {{the source of the}} differences in economic structures across countries. Amongst other results we note an ''anti-Kaldorian'' property whereby an increase in the relative bargaining strength of workers which tends to reduce employment (and hence also the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings),</b> may nevertheless increase growth because the associated redistribution towards those who save (the young) produces an increase in the total volume of saving overall. We also present a two-sector variant of the model in which there is imperfect (Cournot) competition in consumption goods markets. A reduction in the propensity to save leads to an expansion in the market size for consumption goods, an increase in competition as new firms enter, and a fall in the relative price of consumption goods. This tends to expand employment. If entry costs into consumption goods production are sufficiently large this expansion in employment can be big enough to produce an increase in the total volume of saving even though the propensity to save has itself decreased. This ''Keynesian'' result is in marked contrast to more ''Classical'' results that are obtained when the same experiment is conducted in our earlier model...|$|E
40|$|The task {{to ensure}} {{effective}} functioning of all {{systems in the}} society and sustainable economic growth requires significant amounts of investment resources, which include savings of the population. This involves identification {{of the amount of}} funds accumulated by the population and studies of the characteristics of its saving behavior. The article reveals advantages and disadvantages of the main methodological approaches to the research in saving behavior and gives a comparative analysis of methods on the basis of official statistical information. As for Russia income is a key factor in saving behavior, the article also addresses the problem of assessing the degree of income differentiation of saving behavior. For this purpose we have used a method of household budgets sample surveys on the basis of which we have calculated and analyzed key performance indicators of savings behavior of households, including in the context of groups with different income levels. Unlike previous works on the topic, our study uses available resources (not money income) as a basis for the calculation of saving behavior indicators, as they more fully characterize funds of low-income households, which are mostly represented in the budget surveys sample. The performed analysis has helped identify that the degree of the population’s savings differentiation does not yield to the incomes differentiation, and the highest levels of savings and used financial assets belong to the well-to-do group. What is more, the growth in per capita income has not encouraged the poor to save. Thus, in contrast to the well-to-do, increasing the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> in the cost structure, poorer groups direct the major part of funds for consumer needs and different payments. Thus, the share of savings in the overall structure of their income remains practically unchanged. The conclusion emphasizes that sociological methods can be used to study qualitative changes in saving behavior and analyze the impact of subjective factors...|$|E

A importância de tais fatores é fundamentada na revisão da {{literatura}} e sua análise, através do uso de regressões simples e múltiplas do tipo cross-section envolvendo 207 países, confirmou em todas as especificações a hipótese de que quanto mais eficiente for o sistema jurídico de um país, maior será o volume de crédito nele disponível. O grau de instabilidade econômica e o nível de poupança se mostraram também fatores condicionantes do volume de crédito, mas não em todas as especificações e com um impacto menor ao verificado para o sistema jurídico. Estimativas mostraram que o volume de crédito ao setor privado no Brasil seria 43 % superior ao observado caso houvesse uma melhoria de apenas meio desvio padrão nas medidas referentes às três variáveis independentes acima citadas. Fatores adicionais foram brevemente avaliados como o nível da taxa de juros real, o grau de participação nos fluxos internacionais de comércio e o nível de desenvolvimento. Esses fatores se mostraram também importantes e merecem estudos que os tenham como foco. Espera-se com este estudo contribuir para a compreensão do funcionamento do mercado de crédito e para a discussão a respeito de medidas e posturas que possam ser adotadas no Brasil e no mundo visando seu desenvolvimento, que se reflete no desenvolvimento das empresas e da sociedade.

Those factors importance are based on the literature review and its analysis, by the use of simple and multiple cross-section regressions involving (two hundred and seven) 207 countries, have confirmed in all of the specifications that as more efficient is its legal system, higher will be the volume of credit available in such country.

Additional factors were also briefly evaluated, like the real interest rate level, the participation on the international trade flow and the development level.

40|$|For {{the greater}} part of 2010, {{short-term}} and long-term interest rates in Belgium were at exceptionally low levels. Nominal interest rates reached historic lows; in real terms, only the low point of 1974 remained unequalled. The yield curve was in turn relatively steep. In the first place, the question of whether these low interest rates {{have an impact on the}} overall financial transactions of households is examined. During the recent period, interest rates in real terms have only had a limited influence on the overall <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings</b> of Belgian households. It seems that the increased savings behaviour of households and the associated accumulation of net financial assets during the period 2009 - 2010 can largely be attributed to economic uncertainty due to the financial crisis. But it can certainly be assumed that interest rates play some part in the selection of savings and investment vehicles by households. This is the case when they have to choose between short-term and long-term vehicles : long-term investments benefit from a clear preference in periods of high long-term interest rates or when the interest rate cycle has moved into a downward phase. During the few periods with a flat or inverted yield curve, private individuals reduce their short-term deposits since they then possibly expect a fall in long-term yields. It is primarily in the choices between short-term savings vehicles that interest rates have the greatest influence, as witnessed by the persistent switching between term and regulated savings deposits, where the recent fall in short-term interest rates worked strongly in favour of the latter vehicle. The build-up of claims on technical reserves of life insurance companies and pension funds is being stimulated by the current level of interest rates, since certain existing contracts offer a guaranteed return that is higher than the current market rates. Lastly, interest rates have some influence on the commitments entered into by households, and in the first place mortgage loans. It is primarily the number of mortgages that strongly grows in the case of low interest rates. Alongside this, low interest rates may prompt price rises on the housing market with a resulting higher level of recourse to mortgage lending. But lending does not entirely follow the trend in housing prices, partly due to a more restrictive lending policy on the part of the banks. saving, interest rates, credit, portfolio choice...|$|E
40|$|The 1990 s {{have seen}} renewed {{interest}} in themes of economic growth and development. This is a welcome change after {{a decade and a}} half during which macroeconomics was dominated by a concern with short-term adjustment and stabilization issues [...] and basic problems of growth, capital accumulation, and the generation of savings were largely ignored. The authors draw three general lessons from recent literature on saving, investment, and growth: 1) Despite empirical evidence about virtuous circles of heavy saving and investment and rapid growth, the relationship between the three is complex, with causality running in several different directions; 2) Still, saving often seems to follow, rather than precede, investment and growth, contrary to the Mill-Marshall-Solow interpretation; and 3) investment and innovation are the centerpieces of growth. In this regard, the new literature on growth represents a decided (if unintended) return to tradition initiated by Marx, Schumpeter, and Keynes. Saving may not be the chief driving force behind growth, but ensuring an adequate savings level must remain a central policy concern [...] to ensure enough financing for capital accumulation and to prevent inflationary pressures or balance of payments disequilibria or both. And encouraging private saving may be essential to expand investment, considering capital market imperfections and liquidity constraints on firms and households in many developing economies. Four policy conclusions emerge: 1) Public savings does notcrowd out private savings one-to-one, so increasing public saving is an effective direct way to raise national saving; 2) foreign saving should be allowed and encouraged to support domestic investment [...] even if it also helps finance consumption [...] as long as the macroeconomic and regulatory framework is adequate; 3) higher private saving should not be expected in response to the liberalization of interest rates. Market-determined interest rates will improve financial intermediation, the quality of portfolio choices, and the quality of investment [...] but not necessarily the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>savings.</b> Pension reform may be a better way to mobilize domestic resources; and 4) potentially large externalities associated with investment would seem to suggest the need for an"activist"investment policy. But a better way to promote investment and growth is a supportive policy and institutional environment, ensuring macroeconomic stability, social consensus, and a low cost of doing business.

China’s persistent trade surplus is fundamentally linked to the deflation phenomenon because a chronic trade surplus means that national savings is larger than domestic investments, the result of inadequate financial intermediation. China should now expand its investment program to incorporate large import-intensive infrastructure projects as the alternative to the appreciation the RMB, or as an important complement to limited RMB appreciation. The additional construction would create jobs, relieve production bottlenecks, and preserve employment in China's export-oriented sectors. The long-run solution to eradicating the deflation bias and the tendency toward current account surplus lies in establishing an efficient financial intermediation mechanism. Frequent bank recapitalization is the biggest threat to China’s fiscal solvency and macroeconomic stability. Our calculations conclude that the forthcoming second recapitalization since 1997 is the last one that China can afford. Even then, fiscal solvency and macroeconomic management requires that the state continues keeping interest rates artificially low in order to avoid reducing the present fiscal stimulus to accommodate the servicing of the bonds issued for the bank bailout. In short, China faces a difficult tradeoff between the maintenance of fiscal stimulus to keep growth on track and the promotion of financial market development via recapitalizing the state banks, splitting them up and privatising some of them, liberalising the establishment of private financial institutions, improving prudential monitoring and enforcement, and deregulating interest rates. The entry of Western banks into China’s financial markets {{is not the same thing}} as the opening of the capital account. China would not be well served by a rapid opening of the capital account because foreign banks could suddenly become conduits for large-scale capital flight, or for rapid swings in short-term lending and repayments, or facilitators of bank runs (in which depositors do not merely switch banks, or switch from domestic banks to domestic currency, but actually switch from domestic deposits to foreign assets). Just as in financial market liberalization, capital account opening should also proceed in stages, because it must be accompanied by sophisticated financial market regulation, something that is clearly not in place at this time. The state-owned sector and state-controlled companies are still a serious threat to sustained high growth, banking sector solvency, and price stability. Worse, yet, the corruption within state enterprises undermine social stability. The transformation to a private market economy should be accelerated by faster privatization of state enterprises, and the reduction in legal discrimination against private sector activities.

The parametric test has the disadvantage that in some cases {{it is not possible to}} distinguish between rejections of the functional form from a rejection of weak separability. We establish that data on financial savings in India are consistent with the existence of a utility function for a representative individual with a sub-preference where contractual savings (insurance and provident funds) can be separated out. This would facilitate construction of a suitable financial aggregate using these assets. Non-parametric estimation, financial assets, India...|$|R

The {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with its high efficiency, high power factor, small <b>volume</b> and advantage <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> electricity in many areas, {{has been widely}} used. The paper mainly analyses PMSM direct torque control (DTC) system, and estimates the speed based on speed sensorless control system, which based on the angle of speed estimation method of the motor rotor flux vector. Use Simulink tool in MATLAB to design and realize the control system simulation, and the simulation results are analyzed. Simulation results show the correctness and feasibility of the speed observation algorithm...|$|R

Under the assumption that …rms and workers face imperfect capital markets, I show that labor market ‡exibility has three types of e¤ects. It …rst contributes to relax …rms credit constraints. Second it can prompt …rms to make more productive investments but the more likely so if capital market imperfections are low. Finally it positively in‡uences workers precautionary savings and thereby raises the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> global <b>savings.</b> Based on these three e¤ect, the model brings two results. First the economy can exhibit multiple equilibria when capital market imperfections are large, the high ‡exibility equilibrium being always Pareto dominated. Second the model predicts that productivity growth should be positively associated with labor market ‡exibility for relatively low levels of capital market imperfections...|$|R

40|$|We present Dragon TF Association Miner (DTFAM), {{a system}} for text-mining of PubMed {{documents}} for potential functional association of transcription factors (TFs) with terms from Gene Ontology (GO) and with diseases. DTFAM has been trained and tested {{in the selection of}} relevant documents on a manually curated dataset containing > 3000 PubMed abstracts relevant to transcription control. On our test data the system achieves sensitivity of 80 % with specificity of 82 %. DTFAM provides comprehensive tabular and graphical reports linking terms to relevant sets of documents. These documents are color-coded for easier inspection. DTFAM complements the existing biological resources by collecting, assessing, extracting and presenting associations that can reveal some of the not so easily observable connections among the entities found which could explain the functions of TFs and help decipher parts of gene transcriptional regulatory networks. DTFAM summarizes information from a large <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> documents <b>saving</b> time and making analysis simpler for individual users.

40|$|Pension reforms {{all across}} Europe {{have a common}} theme: to reduce the {{generosity}} of the pay-as-you-go public pension pillar threatened by population aging, and to build up new pillars by private saving through occupational and individual pension plans. The extent <b>of</b> such retirement <b>saving</b> varies a great deal across Europe. This variation reflects, among other factors, the differences in public pension systems, taxation and capital market regulations. The {{first part of this}} paper looks at this variation in an attempt to learn about the effectiveness of the various incentives to boost retirement saving. While we find a strong correlation between the generosity of pay-as-you-go pensions and retirement saving, there is no straight correlation between the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> retirement <b>saving</b> {{and the extent to which}} it is tax-favored. The second part of the paper uses the recent reforms in Germany as "experiments" that may shed light on which incentives might work and which might fail. We describe the introduction of the tax-favored "Riester pension plans" in 2001 and the 2004 tax reform, which changes the tax treatment <b>of</b> retirement <b>savings</b> in Germany from a conventional to a deferred taxation scheme. In spite of a deep subsidy and a generous tax treatment, "Riester pensions" have not found much attraction, while the originally heavily tax-favored whole life insurance is still wide spread. We conclude that boosting retirement saving requires more than simply tax relief. ...|$|R

This system is based on a hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) /water/fuel monopropellant blend which is extremely dense, environmentally benign, and promises good performance and simplicity. State-of-art (SOA) small spacecraft typically employ either hydrazine or high pressure stored gas. Herein, a 'typical' small satellite bus is used to illustrate how a HAN-based monopropellant propulsion system fulfills small satellite propulsion requirements by providing mass and/or <b>volume</b> <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> SOA hydrazine monopropellants with the cost benefits of a stored nitrogen gas...|$|R

With the purpose of measuring the impact of microfinance, randomly 208 people having minimum three-year attachment with BRAC microfinance operations were selected from a village. Primary data were collected by a semi-structured questionnaire, and both qualitative and quantitative data {{were used to assess}} the efficacy of microfinance operations. Findings of the study suggest that the overall impact of microfinance operations is positive. Borrower’s income and their contribution to the family expenditures increased significantly after joining BRAC. However, the income increased shows that the borrowers have been able to intersect only the extreme poverty line while the moderate poverty line is yet to be exceeded. On the other hand, there is a moderate impact observed in the creation of employment opportunity. In addition, the sample clients have been able fairly to employ themselves into self-employment activities which generate higher income. However, impact on <b>savings</b> and improvement <b>of</b> borrowers’ dwelling house’s condition is less significant. The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> monthly <b>savings</b> is not significant, but the attitude of the borrowers towards savings is noticeable...|$|R
