The traditional asynchronous machine third-order transient model excludes not only the stator transient but also the <b>frequency</b> <b>characteristics,</b> thus decreasing the application sphere of the model and resulting in a large error under some special conditions. Based on the physical equivalent circuit and Park model for asynchronous machines, this study proposes a novel asynchronous third-order transient machine model with consideration of the <b>frequency</b> <b>characteristic.</b> In the new definitions of variables, the voltages behind the reactance are redefined as the linear equation of flux linkage. In this way, the rotor voltage equation is not associated with the derivative terms of frequency.
