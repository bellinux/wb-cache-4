2500|$|Biotin is {{also called}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>H</b> (the H {{represents}} Haar und Haut, German words for [...] "hair and skin") or vitamin B7. Studies on its bioavailability {{have been conducted}} in rats and in chicks. Based on these studies, biotin bioavailability may be low or variable, {{depending on the type}} of food being consumed. In general, biotin exists in food as protein-bound form or biocytin. Proteolysis by protease is required prior to absorption. This process assists free biotin release from biocytin and protein-bound biotin. The biotin present in corn is readily available; however, most grains have about a 20-40% bioavailability of biotin.|$|E
40|$|Background The pre-analytical stabilities of {{vitamins}} A, E, K, B 1, B 2, B 6, B 12, C, carotenoids and folates in whole blood were studied. The {{aim of this}} work was to provide clear and workable pre-analytical procedures specifying optimal delay before freezing for laboratories which perform themselves such analyses or which receive and transfer such specimens to referral laboratories. Methods The stability {{of vitamins}} was studied in whole blood at room temperature after light exposure up to 24 <b>h</b> (<b>vitamin</b> C), 48 <b>h</b> (<b>vitamins</b> A, E, B 1, B 2, B 6 and carotenoids) and 72 <b>h</b> (<b>vitamins</b> K, B 12, red blood cell (RBC) and serum folates). Vitamin C stability after baseline acidification was analysed up to 48 h. Changes observed were compared to a clinical cut-off defined as total change limit based {{on a combination of}} analytical performance and within-subject variation. Results Clinically and statistically significant changes occurred only in vitamins C (- 22. 5 %), B 6 (+ 9. 9 %) and serum folates (- 16. 8 %) concentrations after 6, 24 and 48 <b>h,</b> respectively. <b>Vitamins</b> A, E, K, B 1, B 2, B 12, RBC folates and carotenoids showed good stability up to 48 or 72 <b>h.</b> <b>Vitamin</b> C in acidified serum conserved at room temperature appeared unstable. The optimal condition for acidified vitamin C conservation was at less than - 20 ?. Conclusion The majority of vitamins remain stable for up to 48 <b>h.</b> <b>Vitamin</b> C quantification requires serum acidification followed by freezing as soon as possible. Freezing, respectively, within 12 h and 24 h for determination of plasma vitamin B 6 and serum folates concentrations is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Biotin (<b>vitamins</b> <b>H</b> and B 7) is an {{important}} micronutrient as defects in its availability, metabolism or adsorption can cause serious illnesses, especially in the young. A key molecule in the biotin cycle is holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS), which attaches biotin onto the biotin-dependent enzymes. Patients with congenital HLCS deficiency are prescribed oral biotin supplements that, in most cases, reverse the clinical symptoms. However, some patients respond poorly to biotin therapy and have an extremely poor long-term prognosis. Whilst {{a small number of}} mutations in the HLCS gene have been implicated, the molecular mechanisms that lead to the biotin-unresponsive phenotype are not understood. To improve our understanding of HLCS, limited proteolysis was performed together with yeast two-hybrid analysis. A structured domain within the N-terminal region that contained two missense mutations was identified in patients who were refractory to biotin therapy, namely p. L 216 R and p. L 237 P. Genetic studies demonstrated that the interaction between the enzyme and the protein substrate was disrupted by mutation. Further dissection of the binding mechanism using surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that the mutations reduced affinity for the substrate through a > 15 -fold increase in dissociation rate. Together, these data provide the first molecular explanation for HLCS-deficient patients that do not respond to biotin therapy. Lungisa Mayende, Rachel D. Swift, Lisa M. Bailey, Tatiana P.

40|$|To {{study the}} effects of acute and chronic {{cholestasis}} on vitamin D metabolism we investigated six cases of acute extrahepatic obstructive jaundice and eight cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (three supplemented with vitamin D). Plasma 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) was low in the patients with PBC unsupplemented with vitamin D but normal in obstructive jaundice. None of the patients with PBC showed radiological or histological evidence of osteomalacia. In PBC, dietary intake of vitamin D was low but response to ultra-violet irradiation of the skin was normal even in those with a considerably raised serum bilirubin. Patients with PBC or obstructive jaundice had low levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D binding protein which correlated with the serum albumin. The half-life of intravenously injected 3 <b>H</b> <b>vitamin</b> D 3 (3 HD 3) and the subsequent production of 3 H 25 OHD were normal in all the patients with obstructive jaundice and in most with PBC. The two patients with PBC who produced less 3 H 25 OHD than expected were receiving vitamin D supplements. The urinary tritium (3 H) excretion after the injection of 3 HD 3 correlated with the serum bilirubin. After the injection of 3 H 25 OHD 3 the urinary excretion of 3 H was minimal and did not correlate with the serum bilirubin, suggesting that the radioactivity appearing in the urine after the 3 <b>H</b> <b>vitamin</b> D 3 injection was associated with vitamin D metabolites other than 25 OHD.

Ligation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>H,</b> by engineered Escherichia coli biotin ligase (BirA), to a synthetic biotinylation signal fused to the tetracycline-dependent transactivator (tTA), enables heterodimerization of tTA to a streptavidin-linked transrepressor domain (KRAB), thereby abolishing tTA-mediated transactivation of specific target promoters. As heterodimerization of tTA to KRAB is ultimately conditional upon the presence of <b>vitamin</b> <b>H,</b> the system is <b>vitamin</b> <b>H</b> responsive. Transgenic Chinese hamster ovary cells, engineered for vitamin H-responsive gene expression, showed high-level, adjustable and reversible production of a human model glycoprotein in bench-scale culture systems, bioreactor-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing scenarios, and after implantation into mice. The vitamin H-responsive expression systems showed unique band pass filter-like regulation features characterized by high-level expression at low (0 - 2 nM biotin), maximum repression at intermediate (100 - 1000 nM biotin), and high-level expression at increased (> 100 000 nM biotin) biotin concentrations.

The available evidence suggests that maintenance of sufficient plasma vitamin C is needed to prevent oxidative damage in the lens. More research will be needed in order to confirm the relative importance of of the different roles of vitamin C in the eye lens...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) {{is among}} the most {{commonly}} used analgesic and antipyretic drugs worldwide, it’s often, but anomalously, classified as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in textbooks of pharmacology [1, 2]. This study aims to evaluate if paracetamol has an antioxidant effect, relative to its analgesic antipyretic and weak anti-inflammatory activities, or it possesses a cytotoxic potential. Oxidative stress was induced by intraperetoneal injection of peroxide hydrogen (H 2 O 2), and then a comparative study is made concerning the activities of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GR as well as lipid peroxidation levels in liver. An increase in SOD, CAT, GR activity and lipid peroxidation in mice treated with H 2 O 2 accompanied by paracetamol; compared to the group treated by <b>vitamin</b> C + <b>H</b> 2 O 2 showed that acetaminophen doesn’t show any antioxidant effect. Moreover this study has suggested that acetaminophen induced cytotoxicity in liver mediated by increased oxidative stress and altered redox metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these studies was to further {{research}} on bone density in children with cystic fibrosis, particularly {{as it pertains to}} nutritional parameters and care. The first paper presented a comparison of a group of 50 children with cystic fibrosis to a group of 32 control children. There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in any of the pertinent bone density measurements. Serum 25 (0 <b>H)</b> <b>vitamin</b> D was positively correlated with spine density z score in the cystic fibrosis group. The second paper, incorporating all of the information obtained from the first paper, describes an intervention study with the implementation of a fortified milk to determine the effects of additional calcium and vitamin D on bone density in the cystic fibrosis group. A follow-up bone scan was done. The fortified milk did not significantly improve bone density, but the fortified milk group did have significantly higher lung function scores on follow-up...|$|R
