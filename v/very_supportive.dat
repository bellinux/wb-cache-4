5|$|Since the {{favourite}} {{sport for}} the people of Calcutta was the game of football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team.

Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time.|$|E

Many of these cells are tanycytes because they {{are present in the}} subependymal layer and also in grey matter and are restricted to dorsolateral and ventrolateral parts of the canal.

5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election. Although leading in the opinion polls for several years, it started to see some loss of support after the rise of the True Finns. Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, an analysis on the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party's political ideology. At the party conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> of market economy, nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E

25|$|Fools and Worthless Liars is {{the second}} album from English band Deaf Havana and the first since the {{departure}} of founding member Ryan Mellor. The album marks {{a departure from the}} band's earlier post-hardcore style of music in favour of a song orientated power pop approach heavily influenced by bands such as Jimmy Eat World as well as the modern British wave of pop punk, largely due to the band's decision not to replace Mellor, who was a screamer.

Medusa is monarchy; She-Hulk is democracy. Medusa is the right of queens and She-Hulk is the rule of law. She-Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa. It's the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil.|$|E
