The evolution of planted surfaces and production is followed for the period 2007 – 2016, based on the data recorded in the digital database called National Register for Vine Plantations. The study presents the evolution of the surfaces covered with the most widely spread autochthonous and international varieties, for both white and red wines, which are, in decreasing order, Fetească regală, Fetească albă, Merlot, Riesling, Aligote, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Muscat Ottonel, Fetească neagră, Pinot noir and Chardonnay. The largest newly planted surfaces were recorded in 2011 for most of these varieties, but a high impact of the support received from the EU was visible throughout the period 2008 – 2012.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to lay out a series of issues of current concern to {{researchers}} in the social sciences, regarding the impact of climate change on the <b>vine</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> <b>sector.</b> The challenge lies in evaluating the cost of transition from one system to another through an integration of the direct and indirect effects of climate change. This adaptation, whether reactive or anticipatory, combines technical and organisational innovations with localisation strategies and institutional changes. Such actions could either try to maintain the existing situation as much as possible or could try to bifurcate towards deep changes, entailing very different costs. Given the multitude of uncertainties at play, not to mention the necessity for continuous adaptation to an ever-changing climate, these costs are hard to quantify. This article will illustrate two sets of measures for wine cultivation adaptation: 'no regrets' measures, which offer immediate benefits, and 'reversible and flexible' measures, which limit the inertia of wine-cultivating systems. In spite of the challenges, what stands out is the evident re-enforcement resulting from the collaboration between researchers and political and economic actors. In the field of wine cultivation, these collaborations can follow two paths: the study of the diversity of existing wine-growing systems and genetic resources or the possibility of more radical technological and social experimentation...|$|E
40|$|The current {{challenges}} of the agronomic research {{and in particular the}} adaptation of agriculture to climate change, require a very broad disciplinary mobilization. To meet these challenges, which go beyond its disciplinary and territorial organization, the INRA initiated a new system of interdisciplinary piloting of research. Thus, the métaprogramme ACCAF is trying to understand the joint effects of the various modifications caused by climate change on terrestrial farming and natural environments, and to define adaptation strategies of adaptation as well as their environmental and socio-economic consequences. Within this framework, twenty-three research laboratories have been collaborating in the project LACCAVE and united their efforts in the project LACCAVE in order {{to examine the effects of}} climate change on the <b>vine</b> <b>and</b> <b>wine</b> <b>sector.</b> In addition to six disciplinary working groups, this project is made up of an interdisciplinary group including researchers and experts of public institution working with the sector, which has carried out a foresight exercise. By directing the reflection towards a medium-long term future (2030 – 2050), this prospective exercise authorizes us to leave the temporal horizon of the negotiation and the dictatorship of emergency. As the long-term future is neither known nor recognizable, the evolutions are considered as combinations of assumptions expressed in one potential form and its opposite. For the prospective in the LACCAVE program, four strategies of adaptation of viticulture for 2030 – 2050 were predefined and a collective and pluridisciplinary work made possible the writing of a plausible way of events leading to each strategy. These results will then be used to debate with the actors of the wine sector at various geographical levels, in order to contribute to the development and the consolidation of choices of strategies of adaptation of the vineyards to climate change. The presentation will focus on this original methodology and its specific implementation. Stories are detailed in another article "Work of prospective on the adaptation of the viticulture to climate change: which series of events could support various adaptation strategies?...|$|E
