5|$|The hollow {{crest of}} Hypacrosaurus most likely had social functions, {{such as a}} <b>visual</b> <b>signal</b> {{allowing}} individuals to identify sex or species, and providing a resonating chamber for making noises. The crest and its associated nasal passages have also figured in the debate about dinosaur endothermy, specifically in discussions about nasal turbinates.|$|E
5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a <b>visual</b> <b>signal</b> between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} signal {{modality}} on duration classification in college students were studied with the duration bisection task. When auditory and <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> {{were presented in}} the same test session and shared common anchor durations, <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> were classified as shorter than equivalent duration auditory signals. This occurred when auditory and <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> were presented sequentially in the same test session and when presented simultaneously but asynchronously. Presentation of a single modality signal within a test session, or both modalities but with different anchor durations {{did not result in}} classification differences. The authors posit a model in which auditory and <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> drive an internal clock at different rates. The clock rate difference is due to an attentional effect on the mode switch and is revealed only when the memories for the short and long anchor durations consist of a mix of contributions from accumulations generated by both the fast auditory and slower visual clock rates. When this occurs auditory signals seem longer than <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> relative to the composite memory representation...|$|R

5|$|The {{distinctive}} spike-like {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{has been interpreted}} in multiple ways, and could have had multiple functions. Brown compared it to {{the crest of a}} chameleon, and suggested it could provide an area for muscle attachment and a connection point for a nonbody back frill like that seen in the basilisk lizard. Peter Dodson interpreted similar features in other duckbills as having use in sexual identification. Maryańska and Osmólska, noting the hollow base, suggested that the crest increased the surface area of the respiratory cavity, and helped in thermoregulation. James Hopson supported a function as a <b>visual</b> <b>signal,</b> and further mentioned the possibility that the inflatable skin flaps over the nostrils could have acted as resonators and additional visual signals. This idea has been picked up by authors of popular dinosaur works, such as David B. Norman, who discussed hadrosaurid display at length and included a life restoration of such an adaptation in action.|$|E
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful <b>visual</b> <b>signal,</b> allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a <b>visual</b> <b>signal,</b> and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E

40|$|Nonverbal {{communication}} {{plays an}} important role in social interactions. However, most nonverbal communication relies on <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> such as eye contact, head nods, facial expressions and body gestures. <b>Visual</b> nonverbal <b>signals</b> are inaccessible for the blind and hardly accessible for low vision individuals. In this paper, we present a qualitative study on nonverbal signals for the blind in face-to-face communication and problems they met due to the lack of <b>visual</b> <b>signals.</b> We interviewed 20 blind and low vision participants and collected qualitative data for the further analysis. Our results show that auditory and tactile signals are two major nonverbal signals that blind participants sense in face-to-face communication. They seldom sense positive feelings from <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> in a conversation and they tend to have an indirect and fuzzy understanding of eyes and eye gestures. Furthermore, we discuss how our findings can be relevant for design: the sighted conversation partner’s <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> with positive meanings need to be detected to help the blind perceive the signal and feel more confident and engaged in face-to-face communication. 1...|$|R

In Western culture, breasts have a [...] "...hallowed sexual status, arguably more fetishized than either sex’s genitalia". Breasts and {{especially}} the nipples are among the various human erogenous zones. They are sensitive to the touch as they have many nerve endings; and it is common to press or massage them with hands or orally before or during sexual activity. During sexual arousal, breast size increases, venous patterns across the breasts become more visible, and nipples harden. Compared to other primates, human breasts are proportionately large throughout adult females' lives. Some writers have suggested that they may have evolved as a <b>visual</b> <b>signal</b> of sexual maturity and fertility.|$|E
2500|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{are produced}} {{to express a}} reaction to a situation or event or to evoke a response from another individual or individuals. They are signals of emotion and social intent. People make faces in response to [...] "direct audience effects" [...] when they are watching sports, discussing politics, eating or smelling, in pain, and see or hear something humorous. While one may have the same emotional reaction to a particular situation, {{he or she is}} more likely to express this emotion via a facial expression if they are in a social situation. Smiles, in particular, are [...] "evolved signaling displays [...] are the result of selective pressures for conspicuous, stereotyped, and redundant communication". Smiling is a <b>visual</b> <b>signal</b> that requires eye contact from the recipient to the one smiling and is intended to communicate a feeling of happiness and joy. In an experiment by Alan Fridlund, smiling occurred least when one was watching a video alone, then more often when a person was alone watching the video but believed a friend was performing another task, even more often when that person believed a friend was simultaneously watching the video somewhere else, and most often when one was watching a movie with a friend physically present. This evidence shows that even if someone has the same internal reaction to a stimulus (like a movie), {{they are more likely to}} externalize these feelings when surrounded by peers or under the assumption that peers are engaged in the same activity.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 June 1894, at {{a meeting}} of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford University, Lodge gave a {{memorial}} lecture on the work of Hertz (recently deceased) and the German physicist's proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves 6 years earlier. Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of [...] "Hertzian waves" [...] (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission. Later in June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of transmission up to 55 meters. Lodge used a detector called a coherer (invented by Edouard Branly), a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "" [...] causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the coherer were picked up by a mirror galvanometer which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a <b>visual</b> <b>signal</b> that the impulse was received. After receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer were broken apart or [...] "decohered" [...] by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received. Since this was one year before Marconi's 1895 demonstration of a system for radio wireless telegraphy and contained many of the basic elements that would be used in Marconi's later wireless systems, Lodge's lecture became the focus of priority disputes with the Marconi Company a little over a decade later over invention of wireless telegraphy (radio). At the time of the dispute some, including the physicist John Ambrose Fleming, pointed out that Lodge's lecture was a physics experiment, not a demonstration of telegraphic signaling. Lodge would later work with Alexander Muirhead on the development of devices specifically for wireless telegraphy.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} animal {{communication}} systems {{is an important}} step towards gaining greater understanding of the processes influencing diversification because signals often {{play an important role in}} mate choice and can lead to reproductive isolation. Signal evolution can be influenced by a diversity of factors such as biophysical constraints on the emitter, the signalling environment, or selection to avoid heterospecific matings. Furthermore, because signals can be costly to produce, trade-offs may exist between different types of signals. Here, we apply phylogenetic comparative analyses to study the evolution of acoustic and <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> in Asian barbets, a clade of non-Passerine, forest-dependent birds. Our results suggest that evolution of acoustic and <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> in barbets is influenced by diverse factors, such as morphology and signalling environment, suggesting a potential effect of sensory drive. We found no trade-offs between <b>visual</b> and acoustic <b>signals.</b> Quite to the contrary, more colourful species sing significantly longer songs. Song characteristics presented distinct patterns of evolution. Song frequency diverged early on and the rate of evolution of this trait appears to be constrained by body size. On the other hand, characteristics associated with length of the song presented evidence for more recent divergence. Finally, our results indicate that there is a spatial component to the evolution of <b>visual</b> <b>signals,</b> and that <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> are more divergent between closely related taxa than acoustic <b>signals.</b> Hence, <b>visual</b> <b>signals</b> in these species could play a role in speciation or reinforcement of reproductive isolation following secondary contacts. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.
