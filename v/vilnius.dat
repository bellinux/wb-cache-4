5|$|A {{few days}} after the ultimatum, both Lithuania and Poland named their ambassadors. Kazys Škirpa was sent to Warsaw, and Franciszek Charwat was sent to Kaunas before March 31, the {{deadline}} indicated in the ultimatum. Negotiations over practical matters began on March 25, in Augustów, and by June three agreements covering rail transit, mail service, and river navigation had been concluded. The railroad, torn apart for several kilometers at the border, was repaired. A customs post was established in Vievis, and consulates were opened in Klaipėda and <b>Vilnius.</b> Lithuania closed the League for the Liberation of <b>Vilnius</b> and the <b>Vilnius</b> Foundation; the latter organization had given financial support to Lithuanian activities in the <b>Vilnius</b> Region. Nevertheless, Lithuania continued to claim <b>Vilnius</b> as its de jure capital. In May 1938 a new constitution was adopted, which echoed the previous constitution's statement that <b>Vilnius</b> was the permanent capital of Lithuania and that Kaunas was merely a temporary capital. Poland continued to suppress Lithuanian organizations in <b>Vilnius.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{elementary}} schools located in Žirmūnai: Antoni Wiwulski, Emilia Plater, and St. Christopher. Šarūnas Marčiulionis Basketball School and <b>Vilnius</b> Sports School offer physical education. The <b>Vilnius</b> School of Radioelectronics and Precision Mechanics (Lithuanian: Vilniaus radioelektronikos ir tiksliosios mechanikos mokykla) {{was established in}} 1965 to prepare workers for Vilma, a manufacturer of electrical products still operating in Žirmūnai. The <b>Vilnius</b> School of Tourism and Commerce (Lithuanian: Vilniaus turizmo ir prekybos verslo mokykla) offers certificates in retailing, basic bookkeeping, hotel and restaurant services, and other business areas. <b>Vilnius</b> Gija Youth School serves those students who have special needs and do not succeed in traditional classroom settings. Žirmūnai also {{has one of the}} three Children's Foster Homes in <b>Vilnius.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and divert attention from the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. The Lithuanians sought to achieve as much protection for <b>Vilnius</b> as possible. The agreement resulted in a ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to <b>Vilnius.</b> Although neither <b>Vilnius</b> or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians have described the agreement as allotting <b>Vilnius</b> to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the negotiations, the {{military}} situation on the ground was threatening Lithuania not only in the Suwałki Region, but also in <b>Vilnius.</b> The Polish leader, Józef Piłsudski, feared that the Entente and the League might accept the fait accompli that had been created by the Soviet transfer of <b>Vilnius</b> to Lithuania on August 26, 1920. Already on September 22, Sapieha asked Paderewski to gauge the possible reaction of the League in case military units in the Kresy decided to attack <b>Vilnius,</b> following the example of the Italian Gabriele D'Annunzio, who in 1919 staged a mutiny and took over the city of Fiume. By agreeing to the negotiations, the Poles sought to buy time and distract attention from the <b>Vilnius</b> Region. The Lithuanians hoped to avoid new Polish attacks and, with help of the League, to settle the disputes.|$|E
5|$|Chodkiewicz {{was born}} around 1560 (exact date {{of his birth}} is unknown) {{as the son of}} Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz, Grand Marshal of Lithuania, castellan of <b>Vilnius</b> and Krystyna Zborowska, {{daughter}} of a Polish magnate family of Zborowscy. From 1573 he was a student at the <b>Vilnius</b> Jesuit College and the <b>Vilnius</b> University, and from 1586 to 1589, together with his brother Aleksander, he continued his studies abroad at the University of Ingolstadt. He visited Padua before returning to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1590.|$|E
5|$|Emilia Plater {{was born}} in <b>Vilnius</b> into a noble Polish–Lithuanian Plater family. Her family, of the Plater coat of arms, traced its roots to Westphalia, but was {{thoroughly}} Polonized. Much of the family relocated to Livonia during the 15th century and later to Lithuania, of which <b>Vilnius</b> is the capital. She is described as either Polish, Polish-Lithuanian or Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the <b>Vilnius</b> region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from <b>Vilnius</b> {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the <b>Vilnius</b> ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the <b>Vilnius</b> Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} <b>Vilnius</b> Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through <b>Vilnius</b> on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through <b>Vilnius,</b> and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the <b>Vilnius</b> ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E
5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of <b>Vilnius,</b> whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of <b>Vilnius</b> since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of <b>Vilnius</b> before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied <b>Vilnius</b> and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski {{arrived at}} the front near Lida on 15 April, {{bringing}} reinforcements from Warsaw. His plan called for exploitation of {{the gap in the}} Soviet lines between <b>Vilnius</b> and Lida by an advance towards <b>Vilnius</b> using the road and railway. Amidst diversionary attacks, designed to draw Russian attention away from the main Polish thrust towards <b>Vilnius,</b> the main Polish attack began at dawn on 16 April. The forces moving on <b>Vilnius</b> included the cavalry group of Colonel Wladyslaw Belina-Prazmowski, composed of 800 men in nine cavalry squadrons and a battery of horse artillery; and infantry under General Edward Rydz-Śmigły, composed of 2,500 men in three battalions of the Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division and two batteries of heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{forces in}} the area were {{composed}} of the Western Rifle Division, a unit which had many pro-communist Polish volunteers, and other units of the Western Army. The Soviet garrison of <b>Vilnius</b> numbered about 2,000 newly trained troops. Soviet {{forces in the}} area around <b>Vilnius</b> are estimated at 7,000 infantry, a few hundred cavalry, and 10 artillery pieces. These forces were to be engaged and thus prevented from coming to the aid of the <b>Vilnius</b> garrison.|$|E
5|$|The Lithuanian {{government}} in Kaunas, which viewed {{the city as}} the historic capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, saw the Polish incursion as an occupation. The Lithuanian government demanded <b>Vilnius</b> back. Relations between the Polish and Lithuanian governments, unable to reach a compromise over <b>Vilnius,</b> continued to worsen, destroying the prospects for Piłsudski's plan of the Międzymorze federation and leading to open hostilities in the ensuing Polish–Lithuanian War. In 1920, the Soviets recaptured <b>Vilnius,</b> followed by the Poles' establishment of the short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vilnius,</b> the {{historical}} {{capital of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania, {{became part of the}} Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and was soon proclaimed capital of the Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Lit-Bel) on February 27, 1919. The Lit-Bel became the 8th government to control <b>Vilnius</b> in two years. During the month and a half that the Lit-Bel controlled the city, the new communist government turned <b>Vilnius</b> into a social experiment, testing various applications of left-leaning governmental systems on the city's inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|While the Lithuanian side {{considered}} {{the agreement to}} be an enforceable political treaty, the Polish side considered {{it to be a}} minor military agreement, later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between Lithuania and Żeligowski reached on November 29. American historian Alfred Erich Senn has argued {{that it was not a}} regular political treaty, as it did not require ratification, but the presence of political representatives of both sides indicated that it was not a mere military agreement. Poland and Lithuania also disagreed about the agreement's relation to the <b>Vilnius</b> question, which was not explicitly addressed in the treaty. The Lithuanian side considered that the agreement assigned <b>Vilnius</b> to Lithuania, while the Polish side argued that it did not concern <b>Vilnius</b> or other territorial claims. Senn has described the agreement as tacitly leaving <b>Vilnius</b> to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|As the Polish troops {{entered the}} city, the first pogrom in modern <b>Vilnius</b> started, {{as noted by}} the Timothy D. Snyder, citing Michał Pius Römer. Dozens of people {{connected}} with the Lit-Bel were arrested, and some were executed; Norman Davies cites a death toll for all – Jews and non-Jews, under Polish rule – as 65. Jews constituted close to one-half of Vilnius's population, according to the German census of 1916, and many victims of fighting and subsequent repression in <b>Vilnius</b> were Jews. Henry Morgenthau, Sr. counted 65, Joseph W. Bendersky counted over a hundred.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{successful}} surprise attack, the Polish army in <b>Vilnius</b> managed to appropriate sizable stocks of supplies and take hundreds of prisoners. When Piłsudski entered the city, a victory parade was held in his honour. The city's Polish citizens on the whole were delighted; their politicians envisaged a separate Lithuanian state closely allied with Poland. Representatives from the city were immediately sent to the Paris Peace Conference, and the Stefan Batory University in <b>Vilnius,</b> which had been closed in 1832 following the November 1830 Uprising, was reopened.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, Polotsk {{resident}} Francysk Skaryna {{translated the}} Bible into Belarusian. It {{was published in}} Prague and <b>Vilnius</b> sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe. The modern era of Belarusian literature {{began in the late}} 19th century; one prominent writer was Yanka Kupala. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as Uładzimir Žyłka, Kazimir Svayak, Yakub Kolas, Źmitrok Biadula, and Maksim Haretski, wrote for Nasha Niva, a Belarusian-language paper published that was previously published in <b>Vilnius</b> but now is published in Minsk.|$|E
5|$|From 26 to 28 June 1944, Shanina {{participated in}} the {{elimination}} of the encircled German troops near Vitebsk during the Vitebsk–Orsha Offensive. As the Soviet army advanced further westward, from 8 to 13 July of the same year, Shanina and her sisters-in-arms took part in the struggle for <b>Vilnius,</b> which had been under German occupation since 24 June 1941. The Germans were finally driven out from <b>Vilnius</b> on 13 July 1944. During the Soviet summer offensives of that year Shanina managed to capture three Germans.|$|E
5|$|His {{heart and}} viscera were interred in the Chapel of St. Casimir of <b>Vilnius</b> Cathedral. He had no {{legitimate}} male heirs. He was succeeded by his half brother John II Casimir Vasa.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila {{had sent}} Klemens Moskarzewski to {{establish}} a Polish garrison in <b>Vilnius</b> and stabilize the situation, but this move only angered the opposition. In May 1389 Jogaila tried to mediate the conflict between Skirgaila and Vytautas in Lublin. Vytautas was pressured into signing a formal document declaring that he was loyal to Skirgaila and supported him, but his position as Duke of Lutsk was not formally acknowledged. Vytautas secured his position in Lutsk, and turned his sights on <b>Vilnius.</b> According to Teutonic testimony at the Council of Constance, Vytautas planned {{to take advantage of}} his sister's wedding by sending wagons filled with meat, hay, and other goods to <b>Vilnius.</b> The wagons would be escorted by armed men, who would capture the castle once inside the city. This plan was uncovered by a German spy and the conspirators were executed. In another setback, two of Vytautas' strongest allies, his brother Tautvilas and his brother-in-law Ivan Olshanski, lost their territories in Navahrudak and Halshany.|$|E
5|$|Poland and Lithuania formed one state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{from the}} Union of Lublin in 1569 to the Third Partition in 1795. Both Poland and Lithuania regained their {{independence}} {{in the aftermath of}} World War I, but both soon became engaged in territorial disputes over the Suwałki and <b>Vilnius</b> Regions. During the Polish–Soviet War, Poland launched an offensive against the Soviet Union and captured <b>Vilnius</b> (Wilno) during the Vilna offensive in April 1919. Lithuanians described <b>Vilnius</b> as their historical capital and {{an integral part of the}} ethnographic Lithuania, while to the Poles, because of its large Polish population, it was a Polish city. Poland's Chief of State Józef Piłsudski sought a union with Lithuania in hopes of reviving the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Międzymorze federation). The Lithuanians believed they would lose their sovereignty under the proposed federation and wanted their own national state. Although Polish–Lithuanian relations were not immediately hostile, they grew worse as each side refused to compromise.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{agreement}} was signed, the clauses calling for territorial negotiation {{and an end to}} military actions were unilaterally broken by Poland. Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski, acting under secret orders from Piłsudski, pretended to disobey stand-down orders from the Polish military command and marched on <b>Vilnius.</b> The city was occupied on October 9. The Suwałki Agreement was to take effect at noon on October 10. Żeligowski established the Republic of Central Lithuania which, despite intense protests by Lithuania, was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic in 1923. The <b>Vilnius</b> Region remained under Polish administration until 1939.|$|E
5|$|The German Army entered <b>Vilnius</b> on 24 June 1941, as part {{of their}} {{invasion}} of Russia in World War II. After their arrival, Gens was put in charge of the Jewish hospital. The occupying authorities ordered the creation of the Judenrat, or Jewish Council, with community-selected members. In early September 1941, the Germans murdered most of the Judenrat, which left the Jewish community leaderless before and during the relocation of the Jews into two ghettos in <b>Vilnius.</b> During this period, the hospital sheltered several prominent Jews from <b>Vilnius.</b> When the ghettos were formed, the Jewish hospital was included {{within the confines of the}} larger ghetto, an unusual arrangement for a Nazi-period ghetto. Most ghettos were organized to exclude any Jewish hospitals, forcing the inhabitants to either do without a hospital or set up a makeshift one.|$|E
5|$|Von Wallenrode {{called for}} new volunteers from France, England, and Scotland. Among those who responded was William Douglas of Nithsdale. During {{the autumn of}} 1391 the Teutonic Knights {{organized}} another campaign against <b>Vilnius.</b> In Kaunas they organized a lavish feast, which was prominently featured in Konrad Wallenrod, an 1828 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. They devastated the nearby towns of Ukmergė and Maišiagala, but lacked the resources for a second siege on <b>Vilnius.</b> In November 1391 Vytautas attacked the areas near Merkinė and Hrodna, cutting off the easiest communication route between Jogaila and Skirgaila.|$|E
5|$|After {{a request}} for {{assistance}} from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide {{that the future of}} <b>Vilnius</b> should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, <b>Vilnius</b> and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving <b>Vilnius</b> within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in <b>Vilnius,</b> and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the <b>Vilnius</b> health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Goštautas (Olbracht Gasztołd), Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of <b>Vilnius,</b> {{is barely}} {{visible in the}} top right of the painting. His {{presence}} in the painting is intended to symbolize {{the wisdom of the}} king as a legislator.|$|E
5|$|As a {{primarily}} residential area, Žirmūnai hosted only 7.4% of Vilnius' public {{offices in}} 2003. Žirmūnai is {{the location of}} the Personal Identity Documents Centre of Lithuania's Ministry of the Interior which produces all of Lithuania's identity cards, passports, and driver's licenses, as well as residency permits. Issuance of residence permits is controlled by <b>Vilnius</b> City Migration Service, which is housed in Žirmūnai too. The State Tax Inspectorate has an office in Šiaurės Miestelis, providing services to private as well as legal persons. There are also several medicine-related institutions, such as the Ministry of Health's State Public Health Service, the <b>Vilnius</b> city morgue. The Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Mykolas Romeris University was headquartered in Šiaurės Miestelis as well. The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the <b>Vilnius</b> Department of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice-Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|Gens' {{mother and}} brother, Solomon, were both imprisoned in the <b>Vilnius</b> Ghetto. Another brother, Ephraim, {{was head of}} the ghetto police in the Šiauliai Ghetto, and was the only Gens brother to survive the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|However, by 1783 Forster {{saw that}} his {{involvement}} with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt (it is {{said he was not}} good at money); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish Komisja Edukacji Narodowej (Commission of National Education) and became Chair of Natural History at <b>Vilnius</b> University in 1784. Initially, he was accepted well in <b>Vilnius,</b> but he felt more and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with Immanuel Kant about the definition of race. In 1785, Forster traveled to Halle where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine. Back in <b>Vilnius,</b> Forster's ambitions to build a real natural history scientific center could not get appropriate financial support from the Polish authorities. Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community. Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as Catherine II of Russia had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the Mulovsky expedition) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in Saint Petersburg. This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist Jędrzej Śniadecki. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left <b>Vilnius.</b> He then settled in Mainz, where he became head librarian of the University of Mainz, a position held previously by his friend Johannes von Müller, who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of Elector Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal.|$|E
5|$|In September 1815, Mickiewicz {{enrolled}} at the Imperial University of <b>Vilnius,</b> {{studying to be a}} teacher. After graduating, under the terms of his government scholarship, he taught secondary school at Kaunas from 1819 to 1823.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} historians tend to {{summarise}} {{the issue by}} saying that the agreement assigned <b>Vilnius</b> to Lithuania and Polish attack violated it. However, Piotr Łossowski argued that such summaries are inadequate and misleading.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I both Poland and Lithuania gained independence, but borders in the region were not established. The most contentious issue was <b>Vilnius</b> (Wilno), historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with a population, according to the 1916 German census, divided about evenly between Jews and Poles, but with only a 2–3% Lithuanian minority. The Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty, signed in July 1920 between Lithuania and the Russian SFSR, drew the eastern border of Lithuania. Russia recognized large territories, including the <b>Vilnius</b> and Suwałki Regions, as belonging to Lithuania. That month, during the Polish–Soviet War, the Red Army pushed Polish forces from the contested territories, including <b>Vilnius.</b> In the meantime, Lithuanians secured some other areas abandoned by the Polish army, such as the town of Suwałki. On August 6, Lithuania and Soviet Russia signed a convention regarding withdrawal of Russian troops from the recognized Lithuanian territory. However, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes of re-establishing the Lithuanian SSR. The Soviet troops began to retreat only after the Red Army suffered a heavy defeat in Poland at the Battle of Warsaw in mid-August.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} weeks of 1919, {{following}} the retreat of the German Ober-Ost forces under Max Hoffmann, <b>Vilnius</b> found itself in a power vacuum. It promptly became the scene of struggles among competing political groups and experienced several internal revolutions.|$|E
5|$|Józef, when he {{attended}} the Russian gymnasium in Wilno (now <b>Vilnius,</b> Lithuania), was not an especially diligent student. One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader Feliks Dzierżyński, who later would become Piłsudski's arch-enemy.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania severed its {{diplomatic}} ties with Poland after the Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski staged a mutiny in October 1920 {{by order of}} Józef Piłsudski. He invaded Lithuanian-held territory, captured the disputed city of <b>Vilnius</b> (known to Poles as Wilno), and established the short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania. This entity was incorporated into Poland in 1922. In demographic terms <b>Vilnius</b> was the least Lithuanian of Lithuanian cities, divided almost evenly between the Polish-speaking population and Jews, with Lithuanian-speaking inhabitants constituting about 2–3% of the population, according to Russian (1897) and German (1916) censuses. Lithuania demanded that Polish troops withdraw behind the line drawn in the Suwałki Agreement, while Poland falsely maintained {{that it had not}} authorized Żeligowski's actions. The League attempted to mediate the dispute and Paul Hymans presented concrete proposals to form a federation. However, both sides were unwilling to make compromises and negotiations collapsed in January 1922. In January 1923, Lithuanian troops crossed over to the Allied-held Memelland and staged the Klaipėda revolt. It {{was one of the main}} factors that led to the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors to award <b>Vilnius</b> to Poland in March 1923.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1926, five {{military}} officers, led by Captain Antanas Mačiuika, {{organized a}} committee. Generals Vladas Nagevičius and Jonas Bulota were among its members. About a month later, another group, the so-called Revolutionary General Headquarters (Lithuanian: revoliucinis generalinis štabas), was formed. The two groups closely coordinated their efforts. By 12 December, {{the military had}} already planned detailed actions, investigated the areas where the action was to take place, and informed {{the leaders of the}} Lithuanian National Union and Christian Democratic parties. Rumors of the plan reached the Social Democrats, but they took no action. Just before the coup, disinformation about movements of the Polish army in the <b>Vilnius</b> Region was disseminated; its purpose was to induce troops in Kaunas that would potentially have opposed the coup to move towards <b>Vilnius.</b>|$|E
