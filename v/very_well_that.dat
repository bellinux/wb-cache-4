25|$|Vainio {{succeeded in}} his {{preparation}} for his home championships excellently. The 10,000 metres final {{was held on}} the third day of the Championships. Despite the slow race which culminated in the last lap, Vainio finished fourth with the time 28:01.37, missing the gold medal by only 0.33 seconds and bronze by 0.11 seconds. The home audience was very impressed with his achievement, since they knew <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> he was not at his best in the slow races. The gold medal was won again by Alberto Cova.|$|E
25|$|His last {{project on}} the ground, Government of Ukraine {{building}} in Kiev, was approved for construction in 1934. This 10-story building, the earliest example of true Stalin's Empire Style, was hailed as the way to build and spawned numerous imitations. A peculiar feature is the quilt-like ornament on the columns. Fomin knew <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> a 25-meter bare column will look unnatural; the quilt warms up an otherwise dull shape. Column capitals also differ from their Corynthian prototypes: at this height, he reasoned, fine Greek details would be lost, so he simplified and enlarged leaves of his ornament.|$|E
25|$|In a {{remarkable}} mistake, Muller left Laroche's division at Mannheim {{on the east}} bank. Laroche understood <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> his division was badly exposed. He {{would have liked to}} defend the position of Neckerau but it had no bridge, while Mannheim had a bridge. He finally turned to Ney for advice, who suggested moving the bridge to Neckerau. On 18 September, Charles with 22,000 troops assaulted Laroche who had only 5,200 soldiers. Even so, the French resisted stoutly. Ney brought some of his troops to help, but the Austrians overran Neckerau on Laroche's right and drove for the bridge. In the end, the Austrians almost managed to cross to the west bank by the bridge, but were finally stopped.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset), with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters know <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> {{they live in a}} world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E
500|$|I know <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> <b>that</b> the Church hath {{been often}} censured for keeping holy {{this day of}} humiliation, in memory of that {{excellent}} king and blessed martyr, Charles I, who rather chose to die on a scaffold, than betray the religion and liberties of his people, wherewith God and the laws had entrusted him." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{represented}} a Mafia that controlled power {{and did not}} let power control them, according to German sociologist Henner Hess. To make a good impression, or fare figura, is important: [...] "they enjoy the respect shown them, they enjoy power, {{but they do not}} wish to give rise to its discussion. They know <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> behind the veil of modesty power is felt to be all the more uncanny."

500|$|Trần Văn Hương, a {{civilian}} opposition politician who was jailed in 1960 for signing the Caravelle Manifesto that criticised Diệm, and later briefly served as Prime Minister, gave a scathing {{analysis of the}} generals' action. He stated that [...] "The top generals who decided to murder Diệm and his brother were scared to death. The generals knew <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> having no talent, no moral virtues, no political support whatsoever, they could not prevent a spectacular comeback {{of the president and}} Mr. Nhu if they were alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Owing to Rhodesia's UDI {{not being}} {{recognised}} officially internationally, whenever Rhodesia {{appeared on the}} international stage, the new flag was not used. In 1972, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) invited Rhodesia to compete at the 1972 Summer Olympics. This invitation came {{with the provision that}} they used the flag of Southern Rhodesia as they had in 1964 instead of the new flag and used [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] as their anthem instead of [...] "Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia". The Rhodesian Olympic Committee agreed to this however the manager Ossie Plaskitt stated [...] "We are ready to participate under any flag, be it the flag of the Boy Scouts or the Moscow flag. But everyone knows <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> we are Rhodesians and will always remain Rhodesians." [...] Eventually the IOC voted in favour of rescinding the invitation to Rhodesia as African nations threatened a boycott of the Olympics and because the United Kingdom would not issue Southern Rhodesian passports to the athletes.|$|E
500|$|Lê Duẩn {{departed}} from Marxist/Leninist orthodoxy {{when it came}} to practical policy and stated that the country had to [...] "carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry." [...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we know <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E

2500|$|He {{often said}} that even within the narrow {{boundaries}} of the concentration camps he found only two races of Men to exist: decent ones and unprincipled ones. These were {{to be found in}} all classes, ethnicities, and groups. [...] "Under such conditions, who could blame them for trying to dope themselves?" [...] "These were the men who were employed in the gas chambers and crematoriums, and who knew <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> one day they would have to leave their enforced role of executioner and become victims themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even medieval Jews {{understood}} <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> Christianity is avodah zarah of {{a special}} type. The tosafists assert that although a Christian pronouncing the name of Jesus in an oath would be taking the name of [...] "another god," [...] it is nonetheless the case that when Christians say the word [...] "God," [...] they have in mind the Creator of heaven and earth. Some later authorities took the continuation of that Tosafot to mean that this special type of avodah zarah is forbidden to Jews but permissible to gentiles, so that a non-Jew who engages in Christian worship commits no sin.|$|E

2500|$|William Langewiesche, an {{aviation}} journalist, said: [...] "n {{the case of}} the Egyptians, they were following a completely different line of thinking. It seemed to me that they knew <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> their man, Batouti, had done this. They were pursuing a political agenda that was driven by the need to answer to their higher-ups in a very pyramidal, autocratic political structure. The word had been passed down from on high, probably from Mubarak himself, {{that there was no way}} that Batouti, the co-pilot, could have done this. For the accident investigators in Egypt, the game then became not pursuing the truth but backing the official line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{religious}} she discovered {{the ups and}} downs related to differences in temperament, character, problems of sensitivities or infirmities. After nine years she wrote plainly, [...] "the lack of judgment, education, the touchiness of some characters, all these things do not make life very pleasant. I know <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> these moral weaknesses are chronic, that there is no hope of cure". But the greatest suffering came from outside Carmel. On 23 June 1888, Louis Martin disappeared from his home and was found days later, in the post office in Le Havre. The incident marked the onset of her father's decline. He died on July 29, 1894.|$|E
2500|$|Marx knew <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> {{a uniform}} profit rate (a [...] "general profit rate") did not truly {{exist in the}} real world, except as a {{tendency}} in the competitive process, as a norm for acceptable returns, or as a statistical average. But he wanted to examine the share-out of newly produced surplus value in its simplest and purest forms, abstracting {{from all kinds of}} variability of circumstances that would make his own calculation extraordinarily complex (see further prices of production). The formation of a normal rate of profit, common to most producers, defined the basic parameters of competition, and thereby it defined the main developmental dynamic of the capitalist production system.|$|E
