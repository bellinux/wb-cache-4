40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides. In these diseases {{a shift from}} immune tolerance to autoimmunity has occurred. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> an immunomodulatory secosteroid hormone, {{may play a role}} in this shift to autoimmune response. This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> level to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles were found for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews were used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells are affected in such a way that infections and auto-immunity may be prevented. Based on current literature, multiple changes in the immune system of the illnesses occur that can be explained by <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency. Studies on <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> in SLE and SSc indicate that deficiency may be more prevalent than in healthy controls. Increased <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> may possibly be correlated to increased disease activity in both diseases, but evidence is mixed. For WG, a positive correlation of disease incidence with latitude has been found, which may indicate <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> as a cause.

The main {{concern of the}} renal diets is its feasibility with regards to daily clinical practice especially in the elderly and co-morbid patients. This study aimed to evaluate {{the effects of a}} pragmatic, step-wise, personalized nutritional support in the management of CKD patients on tertiary care. Methods: This is a case-control study. It included 823 prevalent out-patients affected by CKD stage 3 b to 5 not-in-dialysis, followed by tertiary care in nephrology clinics; 305 patients (190 males, aged 70 ± 12 years) received nutritional support (nutritional treatment Group, NTG); 518 patients (281 males, aged 73 ± 13 years) who did not receive any dietary therapy, formed the control group (CG). In the NTG patients the dietary interventions were assigned in order to prevent or correct abnormalities and to maintain a good nutritional status. They included manipulation of sodium, phosphate, energy and protein dietary intakes while paying special attention to each patient's dietary habits. Results: Phosphate and BUN levels were lower in the NTG than in the CG, especially in stage 4 and 5. The prevalence of hyperphosphatemia was lower in the NTG than in CG in stage 5 (13. 3 % vs 53. 3 %, p < 001, respectively), in stage 4 (4. 1 % vs 18. 3 % vs, p < 0. 001) and stage 3 b (2. 8 % vs 9. 5 % p < 0. 05). Serum albumin was higher in NTG than in CG especially in stage 5. The use of calcium-free intestinal phosphate binders was significantly lower in NTG than in CG (11 % vs 19 % p < 0. 01), {{as well as that of}} Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (11 % vs 19 %, p < 0. 01), and active <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>preparations</b> (13 % vs 21 %, p < 0. 01).

Methods: We reviewed 13 adult hemodialysis patients treated with oral paricalcitol. The dosage of paricalcitol was adjusted according to the clinical response. Results: Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level decreased by 47. 3  ±  34. 3 % at 3 months and 74. 7  ±  36. 8 % by 3 years. Eight patients (62 %) responded and had reduction in PTH levels by at least 30 %; seven of them (87. 5 %) responded within the first 3 months.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{connection}} between vitamin D-insufficiency, sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome has been examined. Vitamin D-insufficiency is common in germany regardless of age but has an even higher prevalence in the elderly. Sarcopenia describes the age-associated and functional relevant loss of muscle mass -following some definitions also muscle strength- whereas the frailty-syndrome is a multidimensional syndrome leading to negative outcomes such as heightened mortality. The hypothesis was that vitamin D-insufficiency favors the incidence of sarcopenia as well as frailty and that sarcopenia is {{a key factor in}} the development of the frailty-syndrome. Vice versa it could be imagined that frailty with limited mobility could lead to vitamin d-insuffiency due to reduced time spent outside and limited sun exposure. 360 community-dwelling participants of BASE-II aged 61 to 84 took part in the examinations. Serum level of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> was determined via direct chemoluminescence immunoassay and muscle mass for diagnosing sarcopenia was measured using a DEXA-scan. Frailty was assessed with the frailty-index after Fried et al. and the five frailty criteria weight loss, exhaustion, physical activity, gait speed and weakness were determined via anamnesis, questionnaires, geriatric assessment and grip strength measurement. The expected high prevalence of vitamin d-insufficiency was confirmed in the BASE-II-sample (69, 7 %). The prevalence of sarcopenia (19, 5 % women, 15, 5 % men) lies in the middle compared to other studies whereas the prevalence of frailty (1, 1 %) was considerably lower compared to other studies presumably due to a lower mean age. The further analyses showed no correlation between vitamin d-level, sarcopenia and frailty. The variance of values of the skeletal mucle mass-index used for measuring sarcopenia could only very little be explained by age and physical activity as possible factors of influence. Furthermore the influence of skeletal muscle mass and age on frailty showed to be less than ten percent. These findings diminish the hope that a single factor like <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> will serve as a predictor for sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome which may offer options for prevention and treatment. Beyond that sarcopenia may not be the key factor in the pathogenesis of frailty as commonly considered. It can be assumed that sarcopenia and notably frailty are highly multifactorial conditioned and therefore the identification and emphasis of separate pathophysiological relevant factors may be a difficult task...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{overview}} on the utilisation of solid wastes with focus on blast furnace slag, red mud and fly ash generated {{in large quantities}} from iron and steel industry; primary aluminium production and coal fired power plants, respectively. Innovative methodologies, based on the recent research by the authors, are highlighted and these include: (a) smelting reduction of red mud to produce pig iron and titania rich slag, (b) mechanical activation of the slag and fly ash to prepare improved blended cements in terms of higher usage of waste and enhanced cement properties, (c) synergistic usage of fly ash, blast furnace slag and iron ore tailings {{in the preparation of}} floor and wall tiles and (<b>d)</b> <b>preparation</b> of synthetic granite from fly ash as a value added product. © 2006 Elsevier B.
