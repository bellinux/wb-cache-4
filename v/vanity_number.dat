50|$|A <b>vanity</b> <b>number</b> is a {{local or}} {{toll-free}} telephone number for which a subscriber requests an easily remembered sequence of numbers for marketing purposes.|$|E
50|$|A {{toll-free}} <b>vanity</b> <b>number,</b> custom toll-free number, or mnemonic {{is easy to}} remember; it spells {{and means}} something or it contains an easily recognized numeric pattern. An easily remembered number is valued as a branding and direct response tool in business advertising.|$|E
50|$|Phonewords are {{the most}} common <b>vanity</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{although}} a few all-numeric <b>vanity</b> phone <b>numbers</b> are used. Toll-free telephone numbers are often branded using phonewords; some firms use easily memorable <b>vanity</b> telephone <b>numbers</b> like 1-800 Contacts, 1-800-Flowers, 1-800-FREE-411 or 1-800-GOT-JUNK? or 1-800-BATTERY? as brands for flagship products or names for entire companies.|$|R

50|$|In {{toll-free}} telephony, a shared-use {{number is}} a <b>vanity</b> <b>number</b> (usually a valuable generic phone word), which is rented to multiple local {{companies in the}} same line of business in different cities. These appear in Australia (1300 and 1800) and North America (1-800- and its overlays); in the U.S., the RespOrg infrastructure is used to direct calls for the same number to different vendors based on the area code of the calling number.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, Federal Communications Commission {{regulations}} {{mandate that}} numbers be allocated {{on a first}} come, first served basis; this gives <b>vanity</b> <b>number</b> operators who register as RespOrgs a strong advantage in obtaining the most valuable phonewords, as they have first access to newly disconnected numbers and to newly introduced toll-free area codes. In Australia, premium numbers, such as the 13-series or the vanity phone words, are distributed by auction separately from the administrative procedure to assign random, generic numbers from the available pool.|$|E
5000|$|Miller {{would discuss}} {{the topic of}} the day with one guest per show. During the first season, some guests were interviewed by satellite. During the guest segment, the show would also take phone calls. The call-in number was {{originally}} given as 1-800-LACTOSE. Reportedly, Miller chose the word [...] "lactose" [...] {{because it was the only}} word he could make with seven digits to make it a <b>vanity</b> <b>number.</b> But starting in the 1997 season, he stopped using the word and simply gave the corresponding numbers.|$|E
50|$|The term smart number {{may also}} apply to non-geographic {{telephone}} numbers, such as Australia's 13, 1300 and 1800 <b>vanity</b> <b>numbers</b> and freephone numbers. See Intelligent Network.|$|R

50|$|When the {{telephone}} appeared in Russia {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, telephone numbers mixed letters and numbers. In 1968, the letters were replaced by numbers, but recently phonewords have returned to popularity in Russia. Many ISPs offer customers <b>vanity</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Bell Labs {{received}} a patent for what became AT&T's [...] "Advanced 800 Service", a computer-controlled system where any toll-free number {{could point to}} any destination number, such as to a small business local number instead of a special InWATS line, and an itemized bill generated only for the calls the business actually received. By breaking {{the link between the}} number's exchange prefix and geographic location, this system opened opportunities for <b>vanity</b> <b>number</b> advertising - an advantage in media like commercial radio where numbers need to be memorable.|$|E
50|$|Shared use {{can be used}} as a {{means to}} {{circumvent}} restrictions on warehousing, hoarding and brokering toll-free numbers as technically the number is not being sold, only rented one city or region at a time. The practice is nonetheless potentially problematic as it leaves local businesses advertising numbers which they do not own and for which they therefore have no number portability. The cost per minute and per month is typically far higher for a shared-use number than for a standard toll-free <b>vanity</b> <b>number</b> which a local business controls outright and there is little protection if the shared use company fails to meet its obligations or ceases operation.|$|E
5000|$|As a fullback at the University of Maryland, Plank {{got tired}} of having to change out of the sweat-soaked T-shirts worn under his jersey; however, he noticed that his {{compression}} shorts worn during practice stayed dry. This inspired {{him to make a}} T-shirt using moisture-wicking synthetic fabric. After graduating from the University of Maryland, Plank developed his first prototype of the shirt, which he gave to his Maryland teammates and friends who had gone on to play in the NFL. Plank soon perfected the design creating a new T-shirt built from microfibers that wicked moisture and kept athletes cool, dry, and light. [...] Major competing brands including Nike, Adidas and Reebok would soon follow in Plank's footsteps with their own moisture-wicking apparel. Plank opted to use the British spelling [...] "armour" [...] in the company name because the toll-free <b>vanity</b> <b>number</b> was still available for that version.|$|E
50|$|While many {{of these}} are phonewords (such as 1-800-Flowers or 1-800-Taxicab or 1-800-Battery), {{occasionally}} all-numeric <b>vanity</b> phone <b>numbers</b> are used.|$|R
50|$|As {{toll-free}} telephone <b>numbers,</b> <b>vanity</b> 800 <b>numbers</b> {{support flexible}} call tracking which allows businesses {{to determine where}} their incoming call traffic is coming from, build a database of leads, access demographic information on callers, allocate personnel based on calling patterns, analyze ad campaign results and export data to other programs. The reports help to fine-tune advertising plans and media budgets by providing detailed information on specific media buys (such as radio, television or outdoor media).|$|R

50|$|In Hungary, {{telephone}} numbers {{are in the}} format 06 + area code + subscriber number, where the area code is a single digit 1 for Budapest, the capital, followed by a seven digit subscriber number, and two digits followed by either seven (for cell phone numbers) or six digits (others). for other areas, cell phone numbers or non-geographic numbers like toll-free or premium-rate numbers. Two digit area codes which consist of digits between 2 and 9 are geographic areas, while area codes ending with a 0 or a 1 denote other services. The area code 55, which, according to its first digit, would be normally assigned to a geographic area in Eastern Hungary, is reserved as a test code with no subscriber numbers assigned. There are certain closed networks redefining area code 55 and assigning such numbers for subscribers or machines inside the network, but these are non-standard and non-dialable from outside the network.Telephone numbers starting with the digits 555 are assigned to subscribers as ordinary numbers. Hungarian taxi company Tele5 Taxi uses 555-5555 as a <b>vanity</b> <b>number,</b> while at least one company specializing in vanity numbers sells cell phone numbers starting with the digits 555 for a premium rate, capitalizing on their fame in American movies.|$|E

5000|$|Local {{telephone}} numbers {{have always been}} subject to the constraint that the first digits must identify a geographic location, leaving less flexibility to select digits which spell specific phonewords. Toll-free numbering, as originally introduced by AT&T in 1967, was initially even more limited, as each geographic area code was hardwired {{to one or two}} specific exchanges in the +1-800 toll-free area code. This changed after Roy P. Weber of Bell Labs patented a [...] "Data base communication call processing method" [...] which laid the initial blueprint for construction of the SMS/800 database in 1982 and the portable RespOrg structure in 1993. A toll-free number, instead of indicating a geographic location, was merely a pointer to a database record; any number could geographically be reassigned anywhere and ported to any carrier. All seven digits were available to construct <b>vanity</b> <b>numbers</b> or phonewords.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} InWATS {{system was}} supplanted by [...] "Advanced 800 Service" [...] in the 1980s. Modern systems eliminated requirements tying toll-free numbers to dedicated flat-rate inbound WATS lines. Direct inward dial, introduced in 1983, allowed one trunk to carry calls for multiple numbers. AT&T's monopoly on U.S. toll-free number routing ended in 1986, encouraging flexibility {{in order to}} match rivals Sprint and MCI. By 1989, fixed [...] "bands" [...] of coverage area had been largely replaced by distance-based billing, {{a growing number of}} 1-800 numbers were being terminated at standard local business or residence lines and one number could be sent to multiple locations based on call origin, least-cost routing or time of day routing. RespOrgs were established in the U.S. in 1993 and Canada in 1994 to provide toll free number portability using the Service Management System (SMS/800) database. Calls from Canada and the U.S., intrastate and interstate, could terminate at the same 1-800 number, even via different carriers. <b>Vanity</b> <b>numbers</b> became easier to obtain as a toll-free exchange prefix was no longer tied to a geographic location. By the 21st century, Voice over IP placed toll-free and foreign exchange numbers into the hands of even the smallest users, to whom dedicated inbound lines under the original InWATS model would have been prohibitively expensive.|$|R
50|$|In many {{countries}} however, {{the influence of}} mobile telecom operators through 8294 premium short code or alikes, which direct millions of mobile calls to the TAXI companies contracted (as 8.2.9.4 shortcode means T.A.X.I on any mobile phone worldwide), do influence the business trends when hailing for a TAXI, already impacted initially {{by the emergence of}} large radio dispatching private or virtual networks. Also independent taxi owners, as well as TAXI companies started in response to advertise long <b>vanity</b> phone <b>numbers</b> including 8294 <b>number</b> as <b>vanity</b> code for TAXI, for customer easy remembering of their commercial line when in need for a TAXI.Because of the overwhelming possession and use of mobile phone, the battle has moved to smartphone related marketing and mobile services CRM for taxi, through mobile universal directories of TAXI details, available worldwide on any mobile phone downtown or at the airport, as mobile directories such as www.8294.tel alternatively to yellow pages paper book edition, and also in competition with the launch of multiple mobile apps offering location services, taxis fare calculation, as well as direct call to TAXIs contracted by app editor.The ongoing trend of mobile usage is reshaping progressively the taxi business initially born as a nearly fixed infrastructure business regulated and ruled by City Halls.|$|R
5000|$|With the new trio finalized, Prince {{renamed the}} group <b>Vanity</b> 6 (the <b>number</b> {{representing}} the group's breast count [...] ). He provided the group, now dressed in lingerie and high heels, with provocative songs (although within the album credits, group members were sometimes given sole writing credits). Their first single, [...] "He's So Dull", {{was a minor}} hit in Australia and the Netherlands, and appeared in the film National Lampoon's Vacation. The second single, [...] "Nasty Girl", was a hit on both the U.S. R&B chart peaking at number 7, and U.S. Dance chart (where it hit number one), and it also made an appearance on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] was a top 10 hit in the Netherlands, and a top 20 hit in the Flanders region of Belgium. [...] The song was featured in the film Beverly Hills Cop, {{although it was not}} included on the soundtrack. [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] was also featured in the 1983 sex-comedy Private School. During the group's existence, members sometimes provided backing vocals on Prince's albums.|$|R
