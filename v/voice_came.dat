The <b>voice</b> <b>came</b> naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in shows such as My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform, saying, [...] "Some characters take a little bit more effort, upper respiratory control, whatever it is technically. But Bart is easy to do. I can just slip into that without difficulty." [...] She usually does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. In flashforward episodes, Cartwright still provides the voice of Bart. For [...] "Lisa's Wedding", (season six, 1995) Bart's voice was electronically lowered.|$|E

[...] On the contrary, Irons revealed to Connect Savannah that the similarities between the voices of Scar and von Bülow were largely unintentional, explaining, [...] "Whatever <b>voice</b> <b>came</b> was arrived at by looking at the initial sketches, and from the freedom the directors gave me to try anything."

The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E

At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower, but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied [...] "Make it a little less [...] annoying...and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours".

500|$|Cartwright is {{best known}} for her role as Bart Simpson on the long-running {{animated}} television show The Simpsons. On March 13, 1987, she auditioned for a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show, a sketch comedy program. Cartwright originally intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the elder daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, described as [...] "devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [...] clever". Creator Matt Groening let her try out for Bart and gave her the job on the spot. Bart's <b>voice</b> <b>came</b> naturally to Cartwright, as she had previously used elements of it in My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared with other characters. The recording of the shorts was often primitive; the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio above the bleachers on the set of The Tracey Ullman Show. Cartwright, the only cast member to have been professionally trained in voice acting, described the sessions as [...] "great fun". However, she wanted to appear in the live-action sketches and occasionally showed up for recording sessions early, hoping to be noticed by a producer.|$|E
500|$|Maggie's {{first word}} was {{provided}} by the Academy Award-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor, who would also voice herself in the season four finale, [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". While promoting the episode, the producers initially did not reveal who the voice of Maggie would be, prompting speculation as to the identity of the actress. Although it was only one word, the <b>voice</b> <b>came</b> out [...] "too sexy" [...] and Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied and thought it sounded like a baby. Several sources, including John Ortved's The Simpsons history article [...] "Simpsons Family Values" [...] in Vanity Fair, have reported that after Taylor had been made to repeatedly record the line, she said [...] "fuck you" [...] to series creator Matt Groening and stormed out of the studio. Groening recounted this event on a 1994 appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and was also quoted by the New York Daily News in 2007 as saying [...] "We did 24 takes, but they were always too sexual. Finally Liz said, 'F— you,' and walked out." [...] However, Groening later denied the story in the DVD commentary for the episode [...] "Gump Roast", while Jean stated in a piece after Taylor's death in 2011 that Taylor had said [...] "fuck you" [...] in jest and in Maggie's voice and did not storm out.|$|E

In particular, we analyze the multiple voices that are present in the statements of members of Roma communities when they talk about and express their culture. Roma communities are displayed in a process of profound cultural shift and where different voices have a dialog, some <b>voices</b> <b>come</b> from cultural tradition, other <b>voices</b> <b>come</b> from models of the dominant social group, and other <b>voices</b> <b>come</b> from the attempt to compromise between them. This multivoicedness is the playing field between minority and majority groups, movements of dialogue happen, assimilations, resistances, creating new cultural differences and hybridization. So, a scene is developed in a constant process of change in which daily practices often must respond to different and even contradictory goals, and in which different voices are intertwined in the process of constructing new identities. </p...|$|R

From that point on, Brown's career has taken on a freelance aspect that has allowed him to work on an eclectic list of films and with some of the top actors in the business including Michael Douglas, Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, and Kevin Bacon. During the filming of a scene with Barbra Streisand on All Night Long in which Streisand was playing a character who could not sing, Brown remembered, [...] "...when we started to film that scene, she opened her mouth and this incredible <b>voice</b> <b>came</b> out.

Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution {{that was about to}} happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, {{and the end of the}} age. When Saint Macarius visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew near of the departure of Saint Paul the First Hermit in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from St Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th Patriarch of Alexandria.|$|E
