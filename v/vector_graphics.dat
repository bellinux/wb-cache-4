5|$|Asteroids was {{included}} on Atari Greatest Hits Volume 1 for the Nintendo DS. Craig Harris, writing for IGN, {{noted that the}} Nintendo DS's small screen can not properly display details of games with <b>vector</b> <b>graphics.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Infogrames {{released}} Atari Anniversary Edition for the Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation, and PC compatibles. Developed by Digital Eclipse, {{it included}} emulated versions of Asteroids and other old Atari games. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot criticized the Dreamcast version for its limitations, {{such as the}} presentation of <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> on a low resolution television set, which obscures the copyright text in Asteroids. The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of Asteroids, along with Asteroids Deluxe, were included in Atari Anthology for both Xbox and PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, Atari {{produced}} an arcade game {{version of the}} concept called Lunar Lander. This version featured monochrome <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> and allowed the player to rotate the ship right or left and fire thrusters controlled with a proportional throttle control system using a joystick with a spring. Like Moonlander, both a graphical display of a repeating mountainous surface {{as well as a}} text readout of the ship's speed, altitude, and remaining fuel are displayed. Once a game begins, it only ends when a player runs out of fuel, rather than due to a time limit; players can insert quarters to add fuel to their current game. Bonus points are awarded for landing on difficult parts of the map. The game features four levels of difficulty in controlling the ship. Lunar Lander was Atari's first <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> game and the first multiple-perspective video game; when the lander got close to the surface, the view changed to a close-up view of the lander. The vector engine was inspired by Space Wars (1978) and created by Rick Moncrief and Howard Delman, who developed Lunar Lander alongside Rich Moore. The idea for the game came from Delman, who had seen a graphical version of the game, likely Moonlander, a few years prior. At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, Lunar Rescue by Taito.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> {{computers}} {{had many}} innovations, {{such as the}} Flashwriter integrated video and keyboard controller. <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> was known for their Memorite word processing application. When combined with the Flashwriter, the <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> Memorite software gave low-cost word processing capability, which had previously only been available with dedicated word processors.|$|R
50|$|The {{first product}} was a memory card for the S-100 bus. A full {{microcomputer}} using the Z80 microprocessor, the Vector 1, {{was introduced in}} 1977. There were several <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> models produced. The Vector 1+ had a floppy disk drive. The <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> 3 had a fixed keyboard housed anchoring a combined screen terminal and CPU case. The <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> 4 was a transitional 8-bit and 16-bit hybrid model.|$|R

5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|Space was {{a popular}} setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the {{abstract}} setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism. Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4months developing color variations of Taito's Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids. First inspired by Space Invaders, he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it lacked enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari's Asteroids, but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defenders proposed specifications were problematic. Asteroids displays <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use pixel graphics on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel graphics, but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module {{on the surface of the}} moon using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a light pen, and the output display was a <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> system; the light pen allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar lander specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed the lander. The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E

5|$|NanaOn-Sha, {{the creators}} of PaRappa the Rapper, {{released}} Vib-Ribbon in 1999. It eschews instrument-shaped controllers; instead, players maneuver the protagonist through an obstacle course by pressing buttons at correct times. The game's levels are generated by the background music, which players may change by inserting audio CDs. While it was praised for its unique style and artistry, Vib-Ribbons simple <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> proved difficult to market, and the game was never released in North America. Sega's Samba de Amigo, released in arcades in 1999 and on the Dreamcast in 2000, features maraca-shaped, motion sensitive controllers. The game allows for two-player gameplay, provides a spectacle for onlookers and allows players to socialise while gaming. In 2000, Taiko no Tatsujin combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music, and became highly successful in Japanese arcades. The game was later released on consoles in the West as Taiko Drum Master, and the franchise continues to receive new installments in Japan. Gitaroo Man featured a guitar-playing protagonist four years before the release of Guitar Hero, though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar-shaped controller. Gitaroo Mans creator, Keiichi Yano, later created Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS that utilizes the handheld's touchscreen features. It became a highly demanded import title, {{which led to the}} release of an altered version of the game in the West—Elite Beat Agents—and a sequel in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} two documented first-person shooter {{video games}} are Maze War and Spasim. Maze War features on-foot gameplay that evokes modern first-person shooter games. Development {{of the game}} began in 1973 and its exact date of completion is unknown. Spasim had a documented debut at the University of Illinois in 1974. The game was a rudimentary space flight simulator, which featured a first-person perspective. They were distinct from modern first-person shooters, involving simple tile-based movement where the player could only move from square to square and turn in 90-degree increments. Spasim led to more detailed combat flight simulators and eventually to a tank simulator, developed for the U.S. Army, in the later 1970s. These games were not available to consumers, however, {{and it was not}} until 1980 that a tank video game, Battlezone, was released in arcades. A version of the game was released in 1983 for home computers and became the first successful mass-market game featuring a first-person viewpoint and wireframe 3D graphics, presented using a <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> display.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany e-book {{applications}} {{have been}} available on the mobile devices in the recent decade. People read the electronic contents on their mobile devices. Meanwhile, a variety of mobile device platforms have emerged in the market. To make the e-book content compatible on different mobile device platforms, the layout or e-book application design needs to be adjusted based on the display resolution. However, different resolution settings {{are available in the}} mobile devices. For example, Android can runs on a variety of devices that offer different screen sizes. Android also can support different resolutions from 320 * 240 to 1280 * 720. Hence, the resolution becomes a critical problem for e-book content provider. Besides, image scaling is another problem for e-book applications. If the e-book application load bitmap images as its contents, the bitmap contents may be distorted when user scales up the size of contents or images. Therefore, the different resolutions and image scaling are two important issues in the design of e-book application. <b>Vector</b> <b>graphic</b> library can solve the above problems. However, <b>vector</b> <b>graphic</b> has bad performance in mobile devices and just few e-book contents are available in <b>vector</b> <b>graphic</b> format. Hence, file format conversion is another high-cost task in e-book with <b>vector</b> <b>graphic.</b> This paper proposes a cloud system integrating an e-book reader with <b>vector</b> <b>graphic</b> technology, called CloudVG. CloudVG optimizes the <b>vector</b> <b>graphic</b> library through a Renderscript method and offloads the conversion of bitmap to vector format on cloud platform. The experiment results show CloudVG can achieve 250 % performance improvement over the original library and the procedure of file format conversion can achieve a near-linear speedup on cloud computing platforms...|$|R

25|$|<b>Vector</b> <b>graphics</b> formats are {{complementary}} to raster graphics. Raster graphics is {{the representation}} of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for {{the representation of}} photographic images. <b>Vector</b> <b>graphics</b> consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice.
