The purpose was to investigate procedures related to breakout maneuvers on final approach during off-nominal conditions. Fifty percent of the simulation runs had an off-nominal situation. The off-nominal situation was either {{the wake of the}} lead aircraft drifting too close to the trailing aircraft or the lead aircraft deviating from its course and blundering towards the trailing aircraft. The location of the off-nominal situation was also a variable. Results showed that the workload and situational demands experienced by pilots were higher in the off-nominal as compared to the normal scenario. Pilots executed a breakout maneuver earlier for wake intrusion than for aircraft deviation.

40|$|Days of {{operations}} in the National Airspace System {{can be described in}} term of traffic demand, runway conditions, equipment outages, and surface and enroute weather conditions. These causes manifest themselves in terms of departure delays, arrival delays, enroute delays and traffic flow management delays, Traffic flow management initiatives such as, ground stops, ground delay programs, miles-in-trail restrictions, rerouting and airborne holding are imposed to balance the air traffic demand with respect to the available capacity, In order to maintain operational efficiency of the National Airspace System, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) maintains delay sad other statistics in the Air Traffic Operations Network (OPSNET) and the Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) databases. OPSNET data includes reportable delays of fifteen minutes ox more experienced by Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) flights. Numbers of aircraft affected by departure delays, enroute delays, arrival delays and traffic flow delays are recorded in the OPSNET data. ASPM data consist of number of actual departures, number of canceled departures, percentage of on time departures, percentage of on time gate arrivals, taxi-out delays. taxi-in delays, gate delays, arrival delays and block delays. Surface conditions at the major U.

The main objective of this paper is to use OPSNET and ASPM data to classify the days in the datasets into few distinct groups, where each group is separated from the other groups in terms of a distance metric. The motivations for classifying the days are two-fold, 1) to enable selection of days of traffic with particular operational characteristics for concept evaluation using system-wide simulation systems such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Airspace Concepts Evaluation Tool (ACES) and 2) to enable evaluation of a given day with respect to the characteristics of the classified groups. The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of major trends seen in the OPSNET and ASPM data. The second part of the paper is devoted to describing features or measures derived from the OPSNET and ASPM data that are suitable for characterizing days, and the classification algorithm used for grouping the days.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. In the {{precision}} instrument {{approach and landing}} of an airplane where the uncertainty is very frequent due to the high sensitivity of the activity to many factors that influence {{the behavior of the}} pilots, Fuzzy logic can be used to produce estimates which take into account the vagueness of the flight environment. In this situation, an important decision about the approach and landing of the airplane under Instrument <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> is based on these <b>conditions.</b> Instrument <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> (IMC) describes weather conditions that require pilots to fly primarily by reference to instruments, and therefore under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), rather than by outside <b>visual.</b> Typically, instrument <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> are defined as bad visibility and low ceiling. In this thesis an analysis of the inputs under fuzzy logic approach is considered for a landing of airplane in Instrument <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> The success rate of landing is investigated, when the visibility, pilot experience and air speed are given by a fuzzy function. The main advantages of this approach are then discussed. Precision instrument approach and landing simulations are used and the performance of the fuzzy based system is evaluated with fuzzy logic toolbox under MATLAB???s Simulation Block Set which provides a complete set of tools for evaluating the success rate of landing under the given inputs. Around 100 approach and landings are simulated using Microsoft Flight Simulator. All these flight simulation cases were applied to train the proposed fuzzy logic engine to calculate the success rate of landing. After the proposed fuzzy logic engine has been fully developed, it has been evaluated and then the evaluated results from the proposed fuzzy logic engine compared with flight simulation data collected for evaluation. Comparison of the results from the developed fuzzy based system and flight simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy engine can successfully predict the success rate of landing under the given inputs.

40|$|Airline {{transport}} operations {{are carried out}} {{in a wide range}} of <b>visual</b> and instrument <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> For all but the most limiting of degraded visibility situations, however, the pilot can choose to land the aircraft manually, using the visual cues available through the cockpit windshield. The answer to the question- how is this achieved, which gives the paper its title, tau flare or not tau flare? – may seem rather obvious but has actually challenged researchers for some time. The optical flow theory of visual perception offers solutions in terms of the way pilots pick up motion from the surfaces over which they move. In a relatively recent incarnation, flow theory transforms motion into the temporal, time-to-contact parameter tau, defined as the time to close on a surface at current closure rate. Research conducted at Liverpool has applied this theory to low-level helicopter flight. The present paper builds upon this work and reports on the application of the theory to fixed wing aircraft during approach and landing. Using data from piloted flight simulation experiments, the results show how tau-guidance strategies exist for the flare and touchdown manoeuvre in terms of the rate of change of the tau of height above the runway surface and in terms of coupling the tau of height above the runway surface with a general intrinsic tau...|$|R

40|$|To control severe air {{pollution}} in China, comprehensive pollution control strategies have been implemented throughout the country in recent years. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} these strategies, the influence of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> on levels of {{air pollution}} needs to be determined. Using the intensive air pollution control strategies implemented during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in 2014 (APEC 2014) and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade (Victory Parade 2015) as examples, we estimated the role of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and pollution control strategies in reducing air pollution levels in Beijing. Atmospheric particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter [*]≤[*] 2. 5  µm (PM 2. 5) samples were collected and gaseous pollutants (SO 2, NO, NO x, and O 3) were measured online at a site in Peking University (PKU). To determine the influence of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> on the levels of air pollution, we first compared the air pollutant concentrations during days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, there were few days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> during the Victory Parade. As such, we were unable to estimate the level of emission reduction efforts during this period. Finally, a generalized linear regression model (GLM) based only on meteorological parameters was built to predict air pollutant concentrations, which could explain more than 70  % of the variation in air pollutant concentration levels, after incorporating the nonlinear relationships between certain meteorological parameters and the concentrations of air pollutants. Evaluation of the GLM performance revealed that the GLM, even based only on meteorological parameters, could be satisfactory to estimate the contribution of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> in reducing air pollution and, hence, the contribution of control strategies in reducing air pollution. Using the GLM, we found that the <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and pollution control strategies contributed 30 and 28  % to the reduction of the PM 2. 5 concentration during APEC and 38 and 25  % during the Victory Parade, respectively, {{based on the assumption that}} the concentrations of air pollutants are only determined by <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> and emission intensities.
