40|$|International audienceCoupled to {{increasing}} consumer demand, food manufacturers have moved towards increased usage of approved natural colours. There {{is a legal}} requirement for governments to monitor the consumption of all food additives in the EU to ensure the ADIs are not exceeded, especially by young children. Validated analytical methods are needed to fulfil this requirement. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the available literature on methods of extraction for approved natural colours in food and drink. Available analytical methods for the determination of EU-permitted natural food colour additives in foods and beverages have been critically assessed for their fitness for purpose in terms of their the key extraction and analysis procedures, selectivity (range) and sensitivity, especially with regard to maximum permitted levels, and their applicability for use in surveillance and in an enforcement role. The advantages and disadvantages of available analytical methods for each of nine designated chemical classes (groups) of natural colours in different food and beverage matrices are given. Other important factors such as technical requirements, cost, transferability and applicability are given due consideration. Gaps in the knowledge and levels of validation are identified and recommendations made on further research to develop suitable methods. The nine designated natural colour classes covered are: 1. Curcumin (E 100), 2. Riboflavins (E 101 i-ii), 3. Cochineal (E 120), 4. Chlorophylls - including chlorophyllins and copper analogues (E 140 - 141), 5. Caramel Classes I - IV (E 150 a-d), 6.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a critical {{commentary on the}} conception of food miles followed by an empirical application of food miles to two contrasting food distribution systems based on carbon emissions accounting within these systems. The comparison is between the carbon emissions resultant from operating a large-scale vegetable box system and those from a supply system where the customer travels to a local farm shop. The study is based on fuel and energy use data collected {{from one of the}} UK’s largest suppliers of organic produce. The findings suggest that if a customer drives a round-trip distance of more than 6. 7 km in order to purchase their organic <b>vegetables,</b> their <b>carbon</b> emissions are likely to be greater than the emissions from the system of cold storage, packing, transport to a regional hub and final transport to customer’s doorstep used by large-scale vegetable box suppliers. Consequently some of the ideas behind localism in the food sector may need to be revisited...|$|R

40|$|Extraction of {{peroxidase}} from raw <b>vegetables</b> using supercritical <b>carbon</b> dioxide (scCO 2) and its simultaneous {{application for}} oxidation of organics in wastewater {{in the presence}} of hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated. Ethanol and phenol were used as the model organic contaminants and potato and cabbage were employed as the sources of peroxidase. The extractions were carried out at 10 MPa for 2 h over a temperature range of 25 °C to 60 °C. Oxidation of ethanol increased by 330 % when the treatment was carried out in the scCO 2 medium compared to conventional aqueous medium when cabbage was employed, while use of potato as the enzyme source resulted in an increase of 85 %. In the case of phenol, scCO 2 exhibited a huge increase of 400 % in presence of cabbage and 140 % in presence of potato. Comparison of vegetable extracts with commercial horseradish peroxidase indicated the feasibility, importance and advantage of employing vegetables as a peroxidase source. This work presents the simultaneous extraction of enzymes and its application for oxidation of organics and opens up new opportunities for recovery of resources from unwanted/discarded plant materials and their use for environmental remediation in a single step...|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) and carbon monoxide {{are considered the}} main greenhouse gas pollutants from either automotive engines or stationary sources. The increased concentration of these pollutants in air severely affects human health and causes changes in earth climate and vegetation growth rates. Ethylene {{is one of the}} VOCs closely related with photocatalytic pollution when it reacts with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sun light to form ground-level ozone. It is also responsible for quick repining of fruits and <b>vegetables.</b> <b>Carbon</b> monoxide, on the other hand, is a poisonous gas mainly released by vehicle emissions, and when inhaled in high concentrations, it causes severe health problems related to the respiratory system leading to significant rates of deaths annually in Europe and North America. Globally, The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that seven million people die yearly due to poor air quality-related reasons which urges current and future stringent regulations to control air pollution emissions. In the past four decades, several equipment modifications and processes have been studied for reducing these emissions. Among them is the phenomenon of Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis (EPOC) which was first reported in the early 1980 s. EPOC has been successfully shown to convert automotive, indoor and industrial air pollutants such as VOCs, CO and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to harmless gases. It involves reversible changes in the catalytic properties of catalysts deposited on solid electrolytes when a small electric current or potential is applied. More recently, it was demonstrated that EPOC can be thermally induced without any electrical polarization, in analogy to the well-known phenomenon of metal-support interaction, by using noble metal nanocatalysts supported on ionically conducting materials such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). The objective of this research is to gain deeper understanding of the factors affecting metal-support interaction between the active metal and the support to enhance their catalytic activity for environmentally-important reaction systems; specifically, ethylene and carbon monoxide oxidation as well as hydrogen fuel purification by carbon monoxide methanation. First, the activity of platinum nanoparticles deposited on carbon black, which is a conventional support used in catalysis, is studied. The effect of particle size of four Pt/C nanoparticles synthesized using a modified reduction method for ethylene (C 2 H 4) complete catalytic oxidation is investigated. These catalysts show high activity towards C 2 H 4 oxidation which is found to be a strongly size-dependent reaction. Full conversion of  1000 ppm C 2 H 4 is achieved over the smallest nanoparticles (1. 5 nm) at 100 oC while higher temperature  170 oC is required to completely oxidize ethylene over the largest nanoparticle (6. 3 nm). The second stage of this research compares the catalytic activity of platinum and ruthenium nanoparticles when deposited on ionic or mixed ionic conductive vs. non ionic conductive supports for CO and VOCs oxidation. The Pt and Ru nanoparticles are deposited on yttria-stabilized zirconia (8 % Y 2 O 3 -stabilised ZrO 2), cerium (IV) oxide (CeO 2), samarium-doped ceria (SDC), gamma-alumina (γ-Al 2 O 3), carbon black and on novel perovskite group Sm 1 -xCexFeO 3 (x = 0, 1, 5) resulting in ≤ 1 wt. (weight) % of Pt and Ru on each support. It is found that the nanocatalysts deposited on ionic conductive or mixed ionic conductive supports outperformed the catalysts deposited on non ionic conductors due to strong metal-support interaction that greatly affects the electronic and catalytic properties of the catalysts. The enhanced catalytic activity towards CO and C 2 H 4 oxidation reactions is shown by earlier catalytic activity and complete conversion, lower activation energies, greater turnover frequencies and higher intrinsic rates per active surface area. To further investigate the effect of ionic conductivity of the supports and the exchange of O 2 - (oxygen vacancy) between the support and the catalyst surface, complete oxidation of pollutants is studied in the absence of oxygen in the gas phase. For the first time, complete oxidation of CO and C 2 H 4 in an oxygen-free environment at low temperatures (< 250 oC) is achieved, which represents the main novel finding in this research. The idea of pollutant removal in the absence of oxygen is extended to a practical reaction for fuel cells application which is hydrogen fuel purification from CO impurities at temperatures < 100 oC. Moreover, the effect of particle size, pollutant concentration, operating conditions and support nature in the absence of oxygen in the gas feed is studied. It is proposed that the metal nanoparticles and the solid electrolyte form local nano-galvanic cells at the vicinity of the three-phase boundary where the anodic reaction is CO or C 2 H 4 oxidation and the cathodic reaction is the surface partial reduction of the support. A systematic catalyst reactivation process is suggested and the catalytic activity of these nano-catalysts is studied which can be further investigated for air pollution control applications such as in vehicle catalytic converters, indoor air quality units and power plant emissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertain}} cost {{of petroleum}} and its expected depletion {{in the near}} future prompted the scientific community to search for new sources of carbon just inexpensive, abundant and easily exploitable. Combining the use of renewable resources such as <b>vegetable</b> oils and <b>carbon</b> dioxide as a carbon source {{for the development of a}} sustainable chemistry is very promising. Thus, this research project fits within the framework of the chemical fixation of CO 2 and the utilization of vegetable oils as a substitute for basic petroleum derivatives for the production of new monomers and new bio-based organic polymers. As a first step, the catalytic synthesis of cyclic carbonate monomers from CO 2 and epoxidized vegetable oils (and/or the corresponding fatty esters) will be considered. The synthesis of non-isocyanates polyurethanes (NIPUS) will then be performed by reacting in bulk these new monomers with diamines under mild heating. In this talk, we will present the results that we have obtained on the first step of the process. Namely, we have investigated various catalytic platforms enabling the cycloaddition of CO 2 on epoxidized oils in the most efficient way under mild conditions. For such task, in situ kinetic follow-up of this reaction has been performed by FT-IR or Raman spectroscopy in order to identify the best catalytic systems and to evaluate the influence of various parameters (pressure, temperature catalyst concentration, nature of epoxidized oil) on the yields and the reaction kinetics. Then, the most efficient catalytic systems have been investigated by molecular modeling in order to identify the key structural parameters of the catalyst that govern its efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Making {{plastics}} {{more sustainable}} by valorizing waste CO 2 as a cheap, inexhaustible and renewable feedstock {{is an early}} stage technology with strong innovation potential that imposes itself as a strategic driver for developing future low carbon footprint materials and technologies. With a global production estimated to 18 million tons for 2016, polyurethane (PU) {{is one of the}} most important polymers in our everyday life applications (automotive, building and construction, coatings, etc.). Industrially, PU is produced by step-growth polymerization between di- or polyisocyanates and di- or polyols. However, isocyanates are toxic and drastic changes in the REACH regulations limiting/banning the use of isocyanates are expected. There is a need today to develop new greener and safer alternatives to produce PU. Valorizing CO 2 as C 1 feedstock for producing precursors entering in the synthesis of polyurethanes by a non-isocyanate route (NIPU) is a promising strategy to solve this challenge. In this talk, we will focus on the synthesis and characterization of novel NIPUs foams for thermal insulation, and NIPUs coatings for metal protection. Our research highlights benefit of merging bio-resources (such as <b>vegetable</b> oils) with <b>carbon</b> dioxide transformation. In the first part of this talk, we will report on the fast synthesis of bio- and CO 2 -sourced cyclic carbonates by coupling CO 2 with epoxides using a new highly efficient bicomponent homogeneous organocatalyst under solvent-free and mild experimental conditions. The mechanism of the activation of the reaction will be discussed, and scaling up of the technology will be demonstrated (15 kg scale). In the second part, we will illustrate the use of these bio- and CO 2 -sourced cyclic carbonates for the production of microcellular NIPU foams with closed cells morphology for thermal insulating applications, but also for preparing hybrid NIPUs coatings for metal protection...|$|R
