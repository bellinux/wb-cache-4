40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C in combating oxidative stress (OS) caused by intermittent cold exposure (ICE) in the frontoparietal cortex (FPC) of adult (3 months), late-adult (12 months), middle-aged (18 months) and old (24 months) male Wistar rats. Each age group was divided into sub-groups, control (CON), cold-exposed at 5 Â°C (C 5), control supplementees (CON + S) and cold-exposed supplementees (C 5 + S). The supplement was a daily dose of 400. mg vitamin C and 50. I. U. of. vitamin. E/kg body weight. Cold exposure lasted 2. h/day for 4 weeks. All age groups except the old showed {{an increase in the}} final body mass in the cold-exposed. The feeding efficiency was higher in the cold-exposed irrespective of age. OS as reflected in age-related increased levels of hydrogen peroxide, protein carbonyl, advanced oxidation protein products and malondialdehyde showed further increase with ICE in the FPC. However, <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C supplementation attenuated the ICE-induced OS. ICE depleted the levels of tissue <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C while supplementation resulted in increased levels. Further age emerged as a significant factor in ICE-induced stress and also the response to <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C supplementation. Behavioral studies are underway to examine the findings on ICE-induced oxidative injury in the FPC, and the prospects for using <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C in cold exposures in the aged.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} potential role of <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C in protecting against acute swimming induced reproductive function damage at different altitudes. Methods: The study was carried between October and November 2010. A total of 36 adult male Wistar rats weighing 250 ± 5 g, and aged 8 weeks were used in this study, which was carried at the Physiology laboratory of King Khalid University in Abha City (high altitude area [HA]), and at the College of Science, King Saud University in Riyadh city (low altitude area [LA]), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The rats of each area were divided into 3 groups (n= 6 each) : control, acute exercise stress, and <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C pretreated stress. At {{the end of the}} study, oxidative stress, reproductive function, histopathology, and expression of stem cell factor (CSF) were examined in all rats. Results: Living under HA conditions decreased expression of SCF, sperm count, and serum levels of reproductive hormones, and significantly increased testicle tissue oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Exhaustive exercise-induced stress at both altitudes resulted in similar results with more deteriorating effects in rats of HA compared with LA. Supplementation of <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C prior to stress induction at both altitudes prevented all these structural and functional aberrations from happening. Conclusion: High altitude or strenuous exercise, or both, may impair male reproductive function, while <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C in combination potentially mitigate these adverse effects.  </p...|$|R

Atherosclerosis and IR constitute major risk factors for cardiovascular mortality in elderly with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the impact of catechin, <b>vitamins</b> <b>E</b> and C supplementation on insulin sensitivity, redox state, ADMA, nitrate and nitrite (NO 2 / NO 3) levels and histological picture of heart and large blood vessels of aged rats with CRF. Findings {{of the present study}} revealed that aging in rats is associated with hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, IR indicated by higher homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) -index, increased lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), ADMA, and blood pressure (BP), but decreased antioxidant capacity and NO 2 /NO 3 levels.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to determine the optimal terms of the accumulation of vitamins by the organs of Geum depending on the rhythms of their seasonal development. Methods. The method for determining the vitamin C is based on the ability of ascorbic acid to change the color to blue in the acidic medium - 2, 6 - dichlorophenolindophenol - to the leucoform, while ascorbic acid is oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid. Determination of <b>vitamins</b> A and <b>E</b> was carried out by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Results. It was found that the highest indices of <b>vitamin</b> A and <b>E</b> in the leaves of G. urbanum and G. rivale are observed in July.
