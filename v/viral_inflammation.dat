Zamora visited his family in Miami before {{returning}} to San Francisco to live with Sasser. On a speaking tour, he complained of constant headaches. When Winick, Zamora, Murphy, and Ling met again that August for a reunion party, Zamora's health and appearance had worsened and, having previously been talkative, he was often silent for long periods, finding it difficult to follow conversations or remember locations of places he had known for years. When Zamora was in New York for an ultimately canceled interview with CBS's CBS This Morning, his contacts at MTV convinced him to see a doctor, but {{when he arrived at the}} MTV offices, he did not know where he was. On August 17, Zamora checked into St. Vincent's Hospital and was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, a condition which causes brain lesions, fatigue, headaches and confusion. While medication alleviated the toxoplasmosis, further tests, including a biopsy, revealed he had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and usually fatal <b>viral</b> <b>inflammation</b> of the brain that breaks down the electrical impulses of the nervous system. More serious symptoms of the illness can include paralysis or aphasia. Although only 1% of AIDS patients contract PML, it usually dissipates on its own in patients with T-cell counts higher than 300-400. At the time, Zamora's T-cell count was 32. The inflammation was attacking the frontal lobe of his brain, causing him short-term memory loss. Zamora was given three to four months to live.|$|E

Quercetin also has known anti‐inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide‐induced macrophages. However, the effects of quercetin on virus‐induced macrophages have not been fully reported. In this study, the anti‐inflammatory effect of quercetin on double‐stranded RNA (dsRNA) ‐induced macrophages was examined. Quercetin at concentrations up to 50 μM significantly inhibited the production of NO, IL‐ 6, MCP‐ 1, IP‐ 10, RANTES, GM‐CSF, G‐CSF, TNF‐α, LIF, LIX, and VEGF as well as calcium release in dsRNA (50 μg/mL of polyinosinic‐polycytidylic acid) ‐induced RAW 264. 7 mouse macrophages (p < 0. 05). Quercetin at concentrations up to 50 μM also significantly inhibited mRNA expression of signal transducer and activated transcription 1 (STAT 1) and STAT 3 in dsRNA‐induced RAW 264. 7 cells (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, quercetin had alleviating effects on <b>viral</b> <b>inflammation</b> based on inhibition of NO, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in dsRNA‐induced macrophages via the calcium‐STAT pathway...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an {{important}} cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants. A {{small percentage of the}} infected infants develops a severe infection, while most of these severely ill patients were previously healthy. It remains unclear why these children develop severe RSV infections. In this study, we investigate whether pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage patterns correlate with mucosal inflammation and severity of disease. METHODS: In total, 105 infants hospitalized with RSV infection were included and recovery samples were taken from 42 patients. The presence and density of Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined by RT qPCR to study its relation to <b>viral</b> load, <b>inflammation</b> (MMP- 9 and IL- 6) and severity of RSV disease. RESULTS: We show that pneumococcal presence or absence in the nasopharynx does not correlate with <b>viral</b> load, <b>inflammation</b> or severity of disease. However, when pneumococcus is present in patients, a higher nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density was correlated with a higher RSV load, higher MMP- 9 levels and a less severe course of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show correlations between S. pneumoniae density and <b>viral</b> load, <b>inflammation</b> and disease severity, suggesting that pneumococcal density may be an indicator for severity in paediatric RSV disease...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} {{hyaluronidase}} has been examined on the intensity of inflammations caused by various inflammatory agents, especially such as vaccinia viruses and pyogenic bacteria. It is already a well known fact that hyaluronidase has an enlarging action on the sites of bacterial inflammations, thus suppressing apparently the intensity of inflammation, while, on the contrary, it has an enhancing effect on <b>viral</b> <b>inflammations.</b> The {{results of the study}} showed one that this difference between bacterial and <b>viral</b> <b>inflammations</b> under the influence of hyaluronidase is possibly due to the difference of modes of infection between viruses and bacteria, and that hyaluronidase markedly increases the difference. To state the matter with more detail, hyaluronic acid contained in the stroma of the connective tissue is hydrolyzed by the enzymatic action of hyaluronidase, thus increasing the tissue permeability. This would cause the pathogenes in situ to be spread widely into the tissue. As, in the case of viral infection, viruses can be considered rapidly to reach the affined cells, then invasion into the cells and intracellular multiplication would probably be promoted, while in the case of bacterial infection, widely spread bacteria would easily be affected by phagocytes and antibodies. Thus, hyaluronidase seems to be more favourable to the existence of viruses in the tissue than to that of bacteria. As shown by this study with hyaluronidase, the stroma of the connective tissue {{plays an important role in}} various inflammations. Therefore, for the study of inflammation, not only cellular reactions and phagocytosis, but also the conditions of the connective tissue, especially of the stroma should be taken into consideration...|$|R

Cigarette smoking is the predominant risk factor for the development of COPD and also aggravates asthma symptoms. We examined if cigarette smoke extract (CSE) may modulate <b>viral</b> <b>inflammation</b> by altering the profile of HRV-induced epithelial chemokine production. Purified HRV- 16, and CSE were used to examine the effects on CXCL 8 and CXCL 10 production from both primary human bronchial epithelial cells and the BEAS- 2 B epithelial cell line. Both CSE and HRV- 16 induced CXCL 8 production and, when used in combination, induced at least an additive production of CXCL 8 compared to either stimulus alone. By contrast, CSE did not induce CXCL 10 and markedly inhibited HRV- 16 -induced CXCL 10 production. Inhibition of HRV- 16 -induced CXCL 10 by CSE was mediated, at least in part, via transcriptional regulation. In contrast, the increased CXCL 8 production seen with th...|$|E
40|$|This {{review is}} to {{evaluate}} the usefulness of acute phase proteins in monitoring transplant patients. Acute phase reaction is a non-specific immune response evoked by many different stimuli. Acute phase proteins (APPs) that {{play an important role}} in this reaction help to restore homeostasis. APPs concentration and glycosylation changes during acute and chronic inflammation are commonly known and they became a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish these two stages. They are very sensitive markers of inflammation though the reaction is not specific. The main problem in transplantology is to distinguish between the graft rejection and bacterial or <b>viral</b> <b>inflammation.</b> The best and non-invasive markers of rejection in contrast to bacterial inflammation that in many cases accompanies transplantation are still being searched. APPs that may be regarded as markers of alteration in the cytokine network allow to control the survival of transplants under the immunosuppressive therapy. They are also useful markers of early acute and chronic rejection and also of different posttransplant complications. The changes of APPs in serum of transplant patients are not organ specific, but their specificity becomes much better when correlated with other biochemical markers...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} etiological {{factors and}} special issues of diagnostics of inflammatory {{diseases of the}} pharynx associated with pain in children. According to etiological factors tonsillopharyngitis {{can be divided into}} two main forms: bacterial and viral. The prevalence of viral tonsillopharyngitis is respectively high and, in contrast to bacterial form, this one does not demand systemic antibacterial treatment. The article contains information on the main medicines used for topical treatment of <b>viral</b> <b>inflammation</b> of the pharynx: saline solutions and antiseptic agents. The most appropriate topical antiseptic drug for children with tonsillopharyngitis is combined ones with amylmetacresol and dichlorobenzyl alcohol, not lidocain-containing or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ones. The high analgesic effect of such combination is shown in various studies. Moreover, it was found, that hexylresorcinol and amylmetacresol inhibit sodium channels 10 - 20 times more intensely than lidocain. Significant analgesic effect of amylmetacresol/dichlorobenzyl alcohol is observed in 5 minutes after administration and its duration is 2 hours. Decrease of virulence of influenza A, respiratory syncytial and coronaviruses under exposure to amylmetacresol and dichlorobenzyl alcohol was also proved. Availability of several medicinal forms and its high pharmacological safety make this drug the most optimal for treatment of pain syndrome in tonsillopharyngitis in children. </p...|$|E

40|$|Context: Hospital-acquired {{infections are}} {{frequently}} encountered by the physicians for ailments demanding prolonged hospitalization, especially {{in intensive care}} units, where patients are often mechanically ventilated. The organisms most often implicated are bacteria; viral etiology is infrequent. Aims: The study aims at reviewing lung pathology at autopsy in mechanically ventilated children admitted in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to assess the incidence of viral ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP). Setting and Design: Retrospective analysis. Materials and Methods: Among the 275 {{children who had been}} autopsied, 13 who had been admitted in the PICU satisfied the criteria for VAP. These cases were analyzed on the basis of clinical data and pulmonary pathology. Depending on the overall histology, the cases were classified as being viral or bacterial in etiology. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of viral antigens was also performed. Results: Of the 13 children, nine (five males and four females) had shown the histomorphologic features, suggesting <b>viral</b> <b>inflammation.</b> The mean age was 33 months. Falling oxygen saturation and increasing respiratory distress had necessitated ventilator support. Acute lymphocytic bronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, and necrotizing pneumonia were the histological features. The viruses identified in five patients were adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and cytomegalovirus. Conclusion: This communication, though not representing the true incidence, emphasizes that a proportion of nosocomial infections is due to viral infections.

The authors conducted anatomopathological and histopathological studies {{of the most commonly}} encountered spontaneous lung inflammations in lambs slaughtered in the Abruzzo region of Italy, with special attention to 'atypical pneumonia'. Microbiological isolations and a histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to reveal any possible correlations between causal agents and lesion patterns. Positive results for M. ovipneumoniae were compared to those for Mycoplasma isolation to evaluate the sensitivity of the two techniques. Of a total of 156 samples, 31 (19. 8 %) demonstrated involvement of M. ovipneumoniae, 15 (9. 6 %) were positive on microbiological isolation confirmed by typing with biomolecular methods and, finally, histological lesions (atypical pneumonia) were observed in the remaining 16 cases (10. 2 %). Of these 31 samples, 23 (14. 7 % of the total) demonstrated postive antigen in alveolar macrophages and giant cells on immunohistochemical testing. These data revealed the presence of chronic enzootic pneumonia in the Abruzzo area and the importance of immunohistochemistry (in combination with isolation and anatomopathological and histopathological examination) for the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by M. ovipneumoniae, as well as the high sensitivity shown by antigen marker expression, even in samples where bacterial load was limited.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} cidofovir 1 % eyedrops with and without cyclosporin A 1 % eyedrops as a treatment of acute adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four patients with acute adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis of recent onset. METHODS: Patients were divided into 4 treatment groups: 1) cidofovir four times daily, 2) cidofovir 10 times daily, 3) cidofovir four times daily and cyclosporin A four times daily, and 4) sodium chloride four times daily (control). The diagnosis was confirmed by adenoviral polymerase chain reaction from conjunctival swabs. Duration of treatment was 21 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severity of conjunctival injection, conjunctival chemosis, punctate epithelial keratitis {{during the course of}} treatment, and presence and severity of corneal subepithelial infiltrates were evaluated by a clinical score. Duration until subjective improvement of symptoms was recorded. RESULTS: The frequency of severe corneal opacities was lower with cidofovir (P = 0. 048). Cidofovir was toxic locally to the skin of the eyelids and the conjunctiva in a dose-dependent manner. Symptoms of local toxicity were clinically similar to the signs of the initial <b>viral</b> <b>inflammation.</b> They first appeared 8 to 12 days after beginning of treatment and completely subsided 7 to 28 days after discontinuation of cidofovir. The outcome measures of local inflammation did not differ between the four treatment groups. Cyclosporin A did not alter the course of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: Cidofovir lowers the frequency of severe corneal opacities, but its clinical use 4 to 10 times daily at a 1 % concentration is limited by local toxicity. Further clinical studies to find an efficacious yet tolerable dosage regimen of cidofovir, possibly using an improved pharmaceutical preparation, are required. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: Viral {{myocarditis}} (VM) is {{an important}} cause of heart failure and sudden cardiac death in young healthy adults; {{it is also an}} aetiological precursor of dilated cardiomyopathy. We explored the role of the miR- 221 /- 222 family that is up-regulated in VM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we show that microRNA- 221 (miR- 221) and miR- 222 levels are significantly elevated during acute VM caused by Coxsackievirus B 3 (CVB 3). Both miRs are expressed by different cardiac cells and by infiltrating inflammatory cells, but their up-regulation upon myocarditis is mostly exclusive for the cardiomyocyte. Systemic inhibition of miR- 221 /- 222 in mice increased cardiac viral load, prolonged the viraemic state, and strongly aggravated cardiac injury and inflammation. Similarly, in vitro, overexpression of miR- 221 and miR- 222 inhibited enteroviral replication, whereas knockdown of this miR-cluster augmented viral replication. We identified and confirmed a number of miR- 221 /- 222 targets that co-orchestrate the increased <b>viral</b> replication and <b>inflammation,</b> including ETS 1 / 2, IRF 2, BCL 2 L 11, TOX, BMF, and CXCL 12. In vitro inhibition of IRF 2, TOX, or CXCL 12 in cardiomyocytes significantly dampened their inflammatory response to CVB 3 infection, confirming the functionality of these targets in VM and highlighting the importance of miR- 221 /- 222 as regulators of the cardiac response to VM.

The present study was aimed to show that protective therapy using inhalation corticosteroid fluticasonepropionate (ICS-FP) improves the health status of children with asthma and that low doses of ICS-FP have no clinically significant side effects, even in a long term use. Methods. Sixty-five children with predominantly moderate asthma treated with protective anti-inflammatory drug ICSFP for more than six months were monitored in an ambulatory setting. The study included children and adolescents aged 5 – 18 years. The efficacy of the protective treatment with ICSFP was investigated by measurements of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in serum and spirometric parameters at the beginning and after six months of the treatment. The safety of protective treatment was assessed with measurements of body mass and height of the children and morning serum cortisol levels. Results. During the protective treatment the number of asthma exacerbation diminished. The triggers of nonallergic exacerbations were physical activity, changes of weather and <b>viral</b> <b>inflammations</b> and the triggers of allergic asthma exacerbations were allergens (hous-dust mite, pollens and animal dander) and infections.   ECP values similarly showed a statistically significant decrease from 43. 1 ± 27. 8 nmol/L at the beginning to 20. 3 ± 13. 0 nmol/L after six months. Values of spirometric parameters, expressed as percentage of normal values for the population under study, exhibited 7 – 14 % improvement in the six months observation period. All their changes were statistically significant, e. g. in FEV 1 from 82. 8 ± 12. 4 % to 96. 3 ± 16. 0 %.   Despite regular and appropriate treatment with ICS-FP, no decrease in morning serum cortisol levels exceeding normal values were observed. From 417. 1 ± 138. 4 nmol/L {{at the beginning of the}} study, cortisol levels fell to 357. 1 ± 12. 3 nmol/L, a statistically significant difference. However, these changes were small relative to the normal range of cortisol diurnal variability.   Measurements of body mass and height upon regular six months periods did not show significantly lower values from those in healthy populations of same ages. On the contrary, the observed sample even had a significantly higher body height (relative body height increase of 1. 9 %) and body mass (relative body mass increase of 7. 3 %) when compared to healthy population. Conclusions. Present study indicates that ICS-FP protective antiinflammatory treatment of children and adolescents is safe and effective related to the age of the patient and severity of exacerbations.   </em...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A virus pandemics and {{emerging}} anti-viral resistance highlight {{the urgent need}} for novel generic pharmacological strategies that reduce both viral replication and lung inflammation. We investigated whether the primary enzymatic source of inflammatory cell ROS (reactive oxygen species), Nox 2 -containing NADPH oxidase, is a novel pharmacological target against the lung inflammation caused by influenza A viruses. Male WT (C 57 BL/ 6) and Nox 2 (-/y) mice were infected intranasally with low pathogenicity (X- 31, H 3 N 2) or higher pathogenicity (PR 8, H 1 N 1) influenza A virus. <b>Viral</b> titer, airways <b>inflammation,</b> superoxide and peroxynitrite production, lung histopathology, pro-inflammatory (MCP- 1) and antiviral (IL- 1 β) cytokines/chemokines, CD 8 (+) T cell effector function and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis were assessed. Infection of Nox 2 (-/y) mice with X- 31 virus resulted in a significant reduction in viral titers, BALF macrophages, peri-bronchial inflammation, BALF inflammatory cell superoxide and lung tissue peroxynitrite production, MCP- 1 levels and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis when compared to WT control mice. Lung levels of IL- 1 β were ∼ 3 -fold higher in Nox 2 (-/y) mice. The numbers of influenza-specific CD 8 +D(b) NP(366) + and D(b) PA(224) + T cells in the BALF and spleen were comparable in WT and Nox 2 (-/y) mice. In vivo administration of the Nox 2 inhibitor apocynin significantly suppressed <b>viral</b> titer, airways <b>inflammation</b> and inflammatory cell superoxide production following infection with X- 31 or PR 8. In conclusion, these findings indicate that Nox 2 inhibitors have therapeutic potential for control of lung inflammation and damage in an influenza strain-independent manner...|$|R
