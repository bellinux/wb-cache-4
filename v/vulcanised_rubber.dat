40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The use of cellular polyurethanes either as microporous foams in shoe upper materials (poromerics) or in closed cell form as soling materials has increased rapidly {{during the last few}} years in the footwear industry. Compared with <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers,</b> these materials have high strength over an extended temperature range, high set and good resistance to cut growth. The research now presented. has been concerned with determining the reasons for these mechanical properties of polyurethane as compared with compounded conventional <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers.</b> The supplementary contribution to the thesis presents a review of earlier work on the strength and reinforcement of crystalline, amorphous and filled <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers</b> and includes a short section on the effect of crosslinking on ultimate failure properties of natural rubber. This study has been extended by the author into the effect of chain branching in polyurethane elastomers on the failure properties. The viscoelastic properties of natural and artificial leathers are also discussed in order to demonstrate similarities between the different materials and show how a cellular polyurethane sheet has hysteresial properties similar to those of a natural material of fibrous structure. It is shown that a cubical lattice model can be applied to explain the differences between such mechanical properties as modulus, tensile and tear strength of a cellular polyurethane and the corresponding solid material of the same polymer. This model, which has previously been applied to the mechanical properties of a natural rubber latex foam, indicates that the strength of cellular polyurethanes is due to the very high strength of the solid material. An extensive investigation into the effect of time and temperature on the tensile properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes is presented in order to show that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics have a very broad relaxation spectrum extending over 18 decades of time. Because of this response to deformation, the failure properties remain fairly constant over the temperature range from 21 – 160 °c. Above 160 °c, the tensile properties fall quite markedly. Stress softening in these polyurethanes is very high and can only be reversed by heating to temperatures above 160 °c. The cut growth and fatigue properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes are considered. Following a brief review of the investigation on cut growth and fatigue of <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers</b> involving the use of tearing energy theory, it is shown that cut growth and hysteresis properties of <b>vulcanised.</b> <b>rubbers</b> can be correlated. The lower limit of tearing energy (To) below which no cut growth takes place in the absence of chemical effects is found to be higher for polyurethanes than for <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubbers.</b> Fatigue failure of cellular polyurethanes is found to be due to cut growth from the largest pore in the sample. These data are also compared with measurements on other two phase elastomer systems such as styrene butadiene copolymer vulcanisates with high styrene content and polystyrene-polybutadiene thermoplastic rubbers. From an extensive review of the literature on the structure of polyurethane elastomers, it is deduced that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics consist of a segmented structure of long polyester chains connected to very minute (25 Å) hard urethane segments. The cohesion of the hard segments is primarily due to hydrogen bonding and other physical forces. It is concluded that the high strength, good cut growth resistance and broad relaxation spectrum of polyurethanes are due to the reinforcement given by the hard urethane segments which act as well dispersed minute filler particles in the polyester rubber matrix. The hydrogen bonding between the hard segments dissociates at approximately 170 °c so giving a degree of thermoplasticity which produces a very high permanent set.

5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and <b>vulcanised</b> caoutchouc (natural <b>rubber).</b> The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Modelling – Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of {{the damage}} {{initiation}} mechanisms in thin rubber sheet composites were carried out under static solicitation at room temperature. Natural <b>rubber</b> <b>vulcanised</b> and reinforced by carbon, NR is used in this study. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental results were {{compared with that of}} the Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Damage mechanism has been described with a threshold criterion to identify the tearing resistance, characteristic energy for tearing (T) and damage in the specimens was evaluated just {{at the beginning of the}} tearing by assuming large strain. A typical type of specimen geometry of thin sheet rubber composite materials was considered under static tensile tests conducted on the smooth and notched specimens with variable depths. In this way, the effects of the plane stress on the damage mechanism are characterized depending on the rubber materials. Findings: In this stage of this research, a finite element analysis (FEA) has been applied under the same conditions of this part in order to obtain the agreement between experimental and FEA results. The numerical modelling is a representation of a previous experimental study. The specimen is stretched more than once its initial size, so that large strains occur. A hyper elastic Mooney-Rivlin law and a Griffith criterion are chosen. The finite elements analysis was performed with ABAQUS code (V. 6. 4. 4). The tearing energy is evaluated with contour integrals. The Griffith criterion states that a notch with an initial length will elongate of a differential length for a given strain state only if the variation of elastic energy is higher than the variation of the surface energy related to the newly created surface. Practical implications: A tearing criterion was suggested in the case of simple tension conditions by assuming large strain. In the next step of this study, a finite element analysis (FEA) will be applied under the same conditions of this part in order to obtain the agreement between experimental and FEA results. Originality/value: This study proposes a threshold criterion for the damage just at the beginning of the tearing for thin sheet rubber composites and gives a detail discussion for explaining the damage mechanisms. Comparison of FEA results with those of experimental studies gives many facilities for the sake of simplicity in industrial application...|$|R

40|$|Outdoor {{electrical}} insulator {{is one of}} the important components of a power system which directly influences the system reliability. Traditionally ceramic insulators have been used for close to a century in both transmission and distribution lines. In the last few decades, polymer based outdoor insulators are being increasingly used in the above application. Polymeric insulators offer attractive advantages such as light weight, resistance to vandalism and they also outperform conventional ceramic insulators under contaminated wet conditions at least in the initial stages of their usage. However, there are certain disadvantages with polymeric insulators which have made the utilities hesitant to replace readily the ceramic insulators with polymeric insulators. One of the major concerns with the polymeric insulators is the aging w. r. t time due to the presence of multiple environmental stresses (fog, humidity, temperature, rain as well as contamination due to industrial, sea and agricultural pollution) along with electrical stress. The manifestations of the aging of insulators include tracking or/and erosion of the weathersheds. Polymers in pure form (unfilled) can not perform satisfactorily all the required functions (electrical, mechanical, thermal etc.) of an insulator used in such high voltage transmission lines. Polymers have inherently poor thermal stability. Thermal stability directly influences the tracking and erosion resistance of the weathershed. Without adequate tracking and erosion resistance, polymeric insulators can not perform satisfactorily under contaminated wet conditions. Hence the common practice to improve the tracking and erosion resistance (and other properties such as mechanical, thermal) is by filling the base polymer with large loadings (> 30 wt %) of micron sized fillers. This makes the processing of the polymer composite difficult as the viscosity of the material rises substantially at such large loadings. Due to the large filler loadings beyond a certain limit, the flexibility of the end product also suffers. Though tracking and erosion resistance of the polymer has been improved substantially at these large filler loadings, the recent failures in the field suggest the need for an alternate material with higher tracking and erosion resistance than what is achieved at these large loadings of micron sized fillers. Of late nanocomposites are emerging as promising alternatives which can offer the above mentioned functionalities at low filler loadings itself without sacrificing the flexibility in the end product as well as ease of processing. There are even indications suggesting that the tracking and erosion resistance performance is better than what is obtained using micronsized fillers. As the development of nanocomposite dielectrics/insulation is still at its infancy, it is required to investigate their specific properties needed for outdoor applications and to understand the various mechanisms responsible for the interesting behaviour of the nanocomposites. Also, it is known that dc pollution performance of ceramic insulators is much inferior to the performance under ac stress. With the introduction of higher ac/dc transmission voltages in many countries including India, it is required to design insulators with better performing materials so as to get a reliable performance under polluted wet conditions. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the polymers, it is believed that polymers especially silicone rubber insulators can perform better as compared to the ceramic insulators under polluted conditions under ac and dc. As the dc tracking and erosion (T&E) resistance of polymer is poor compared to the ac tracking and erosion resistance, it is required to investigate the T&E resistance characteristics of the nanocomposites under dc stress. In addition, due to the enhanced electric fields at the line end of the insulators in extra and ultra high voltage transmission lines, there is always a possibility of corona generation on the hardware at the metal-sheath junction and at the water droplet tips on the weathersheds of the polymeric insulators especially under foul weather conditions. It is reported that the long-term exposure to such corona has the potential to degrade the polymeric material. The effects include reduction of the hydrophobicity, surface oxidation of the weathersheds and development of microcracks {{on the surface of the}} polymeric material. These cracks (corona cutting) can worsen the wet pollution performance of the insulator. If the cracks grow deeper, then FRP rod would get exposed to the atmospheric conditions leading to brittle fracture of the FRP rod and finally resulting in the line drop. Hence, the corona aging resistance of nanocomposites has also been studied especially at low filler concentrations to see its performance under the above mentioned adverse conditions. Therefore, the research work presented here deals with three aspects of the aging (1) Study the ac and dc tracking and erosion resistance performance of silicone rubber nanocomposites with low concentrations of fillers and their suitability for outdoor applications (2) Study the corona aging performance of silicone rubber nanocomposites with low concentrations of fillers and (3) To develop a model to explain the unusual behaviour of nanocomposites observed in the above studies. The thesis also reports results of the accelerated multistress weathering studies conducted on normal polymeric outdoor insulators under prolonged dry conditions. The major challenge in case of the polymer nanocomposite processing is getting uniform distribution of the fillers. A protocol has been standardised for the processing which comprises high shear mechanical mixing followed by sonication to get good dispersion of the fillers. Room Temperature <b>Vulcanised</b> (RTV) silicone <b>rubber</b> was successfully processed with different micron and nanosized fillers and with different weight (wt.) percentages in the present work. For carrying out the T & E resistance, corona aging and multistress aging studies, facilities (such as Inclined Plane T & E Resistance Test Apparatus in line with IEC/ASTM standards and aging chambers) have been designed and developed in house as a part of the thesis work. The ac tracking and erosion resistance performance of the unfilled, microcomposite (filled with alumina trihydrate filler of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 % by wt) and nanocomposite (filled with alumina, silica and magnesium hydroxide fillers of 2. 5 and 4 % by wt) have been compared in inclined plane (IP) tracking and erosion resistance test facility specifically developed for the work. It was very interesting to observe that nanocomposites at 4 % performed on par with the microcomposites at 30 % filler loadings. Leakage current was also measured during the IP test and it was found that the form factor (ratio of r. m. s to average leakage current) was in good agreement with the variation in the erosion resistance of the silicone rubber composites and hence it can be used as a diagnostic tool for assessing the aging state of the polymeric materials. It was also observed that the performance under positive dc stress was much inferior to the performance under ac stress. The dissipation of power under dc stress was estimated by measuring the leakage current through the sample and is found to be about four times (towards the end of the test) higher as compared to the power dissipation under ac stress. Intense electrolytic corrosion has been observed (under positive dc) on the grounded electrode and on the sample and chemical studies of the same have been carried out. The poor performance under dc is due to the absence of the voltage zero crossing, more accumulation of the contaminant (scaling) and electrolytic corrosion. It was also observed that to get the same tracking and erosion resistance under dc as in the case of ac during IP test, dc stress levels have to be reduced to about 60 % of the ac stress. This information would be helpful to the design engineer of the outdoor insulators for the HVDC transmission lines. To understand the different mechanisms responsible in improving the tracking and erosion resistance of the micro and nanocomposites, thermal, SEM and FTIR studies have been carried out. Thermal stability of the samples was measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermo gravimetric (DTG) studies. It was observed that thermal stability of nanocomposites even at low filler loadings (4 wt %) was comparable with the microcomposites at higher filler loadings (30 wt %). SEM studies indicate that the barrier resistance (against discharges) offered by the fillers in the nanocomposites even at low filler loadings (4 %) could be comparable with the microcomposites at higher filler loadings (30 %). The interaction between the fillers and the host matrix has been studied using various techniques. SEM studies done on the eroded regions of the composites revealed that a honey comb type formation had taken place on the nanocomposites during the IP test which was believed to be due to the interaction of the filler and the polymer. This honey comb structure formation at the eroded site in the nanocomposites greatly helps to protect the sample from further damage due to the discharges. The interaction at the interface between the polymer and fillers could also lead to further improvement in the thermal stability of the nanocomposite. A model was proposed which considers barrier resistance and a single-layer interaction around the fillers to explain the improvements offered by the nanocomposites. Corona aging studies have been carried out on unfilled silicone rubber, micro and nanocomposites for 25 h and 50 h of aging using a needle-plane electrode arrangement. Different parameters such as hydrophobicity, surface roughness, microcracks width on the aged surface, FTIR and SEM studies were carried out to study the corona aging resistance of the new and aged samples. The studies indicate that silicone rubber samples containing nanofillers at 3 wt % are able to impart significantly enough corona resistance compared to the unfilled and microcomposite samples. It is known that the discharge resistance offered by the fillers and the interaction/bonding between the fillers and polymers directly influences the corona aging resistance. Hence, the model proposed (discussed above) is valid for understanding the corona aging performance of the nanocomposites which is better than the unfilled and ATH filled silicone rubber. In addition to the tracking and erosion resistance and corona aging studies, multistress aging of commercially available polymeric insulators containing micron sized fillers has been carried out. The aging behaviour of the polymeric insulators under tropical and subtropical conditions (in the absence of discharges under wet conditions) has not been explored. Further, the long-term influence of the UV radiation on silicone rubber in the presence of temperature and electric stress is also not explored. Hence, to understand the aging phenomena (weathering characteristics) under multistress (electric, thermal and UV), distribution class composite polymeric insulators were aged for 30, 000 h in a multistress aging chamber developed specifically for the studies. Insulators were continuously subjected to the accelerated electric and thermal stresses as well as UV radiation. Different studies like leakage current, SEM, hydrophobicity, surface roughness and low molecular weight (LMW) molecules content in the samples before and after the aging have been investigated. It is interesting to observe that even in the absence of electrical discharges on the surface of the material, significant monotonous reduction in LMW molecules has been observed w. r. t weathering time. Appreciable increase in the surface roughness (at least 200 % as that of the new material) as well as increased oxygen levels on the surface has also been observed. The results indicate that surface hydrophobicity is dynamic in nature and may not reflect the slow and permanent changes taking place in the bulk of the material. The results obtained for the nanocomposites enable us to design a better material with improved tracking, erosion and corona resistance without sacrificing the flexibility in the end product as well as ease of processing. The silicone rubber nanocomposites also open up the possibility for economically designing a smart material possibly with a higher reliability for outdoor insulator application...|$|R

[...] narrow gauge track was cast inside the tube. Wheeled capsules were fitted with <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber</b> flaps to make an air seal. Power was provided by a 30 horse-power steam engine with a 21 ft diameter fan. Single capsules weighed up to 3 tonnes, and achieved speeds up to 40 mph (60 km/h).|$|E
5000|$|Most modern helmet {{designs are}} sealed {{at the neck}} using a {{neoprene}} [...] "neck dam" [...] which is independent of the suit, allowing the diver his choice of suits depending on the dive conditions. When a neck dam is installed into a drysuit, however, the entire body is isolated from the surrounding liquid, giving an additional degree of warmth and protection. When divers must work in hazardous environments such as sewage or dangerous chemicals, a helmet (usually of the free-flow type or using a series exhaust valve system) is sealed to a special drysuit (commonly made of a fabric with a smooth <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber</b> outer surface) to completely isolate and protect the diver. This equipment is the modern equivalent of the historic Mark V [...] "Standard Diving Dress".|$|E
50|$|Nixon's {{innovations}} {{can be seen}} as {{a response}} to the increase in fast-bowling in Cricket from the 1840s. He experimented with cork batting pads before introducing Malayan malacca and cane rattan open pads in 1853. He also utilised the strength and flexibility of cane in bat design. His cane-handled bat helped to absorb the shock imparted to the batsman by the fast round-arm bowlers of the day. Nixon also took out on a patent on his 'Balista' bowling machine in 1862. This contraption was designed as an improvement on the 'Catapult' machine in being able to replicate round-arm bowling. The ball was propelled by a <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber</b> sling which could be modified to provide variations in the speed and length of delivery. By 1864 the Balista was being demonstrated in Australia where local reporters attested to the ingenuity of the machine.|$|E
50|$|Development of space-suits in the 1960s {{led to the}} pressure-tight zipper, first {{manufactured}} by B.F. Goodrich, and first used on a dry suit by Bev Morgan in 1956. The suit was in expanded neoprene and had an oral inflator and latex seals. This {{was followed by the}} Unisuit, by Poseidon Industri AB of Sweden, also in neoprene, and which included a low pressure inflator valve and exhaust valves. The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread. Overpressure valves were installed in the ankles, wrists and neck of dry suits to remove excessive air introduced through the face mask to prevent discomfort created by squeeze, which also increased the insulation capacity of the undergarments. These were called constant volume dry suits. Also in Sweden, Stig Insulán and Jorn Stubdal developed a <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber</b> drysuit, and Insulán patented the semi-automatic variable volume drysuit exhaust valve in 1971 which combined with the low pressure inflator valve gave the diver precise and trouble-free buoyancy control, in the variable volume dry suit.|$|E
50|$|The red Mondo 400-metre {{athletics}} track {{used for}} the London 2012 games was laid in August 2011, possessed nine lanes, and was 13.5 mm thick. It used two <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber</b> layers, {{one of which was}} a cushioning underside with elongated diamond-shaped cells, which allowed them to flex in any direction. During the four London 2012 ceremonies, the track was protected via synthetic covering. For the stadium's transformation, the track was protected from construction work for the 2015 events by covering it with a plastic sheet layer and burying it under 75 cm of soil. The Mondotrack surface was removed in early 2016 and a new surface, using 17,000 sqm of the improved Mondotrack/WS, was laid that May. Some of the original running track from (mainly) the home straight was kept so that it could be sold and auctioned to the public, thereby raising money to reinvest into operating the stadium and its neighbouring community track. The grass playing field was lengthened by several metres at either end for the 2015 rugby matches to fit a suitably-sized rugby/football pitch, and was reseeded with a Desso GrassMaster artificial-natural hybrid pitch approved for Premier league matches of 105 by 68 m, ready for West Ham United, complete with undersoil heating. In football/pitch mode, the pitch is surrounded by artificial turf and carpeting that covers the exposed sections of the running track.|$|E
50|$|The 100 series, 'candlestick' two-piece {{telephone}} {{is now a}} collectible item. This one is a Tele. 150L circa 1929 and is a poor example {{since the}} original black finish has been stripped to reveal the brass. The bell receiver was originally coated in a black <b>vulcanised</b> <b>rubber</b> (Vulcanite) and the remaining brass work had a black oxide finish. The dial is also later, the original number 10 dial would also have been finished in black oxide on copper. The L denotes an alphanumeric (rather than number only) dial plate. The dial uses a slipping cam Rotary dial, as distinct from the CB (central battery) version, which was without any dial and relied entirely upon connection via the operator. The transmitter (microphone) was of a very poor, carbon granule construction, which absorbed moisture and required regular replacement. The low cost, however, ensured that this transmitter {{would continue to be}} used for many years to come. In contrast, the twin coil and diaphragm receiver was of very good quality, indeed.The Tele. 150, like its successor the Tele. 162, was actually only the 'front end' of the telephone. Containing only the transmitter, receiver and switch hook assembly; the entire electrical telephone circuitry was contained within an accompanying magneto bell set. This was initially the wooden cased version shown or the later, compact, Bakelite, Bell set 25.|$|E
