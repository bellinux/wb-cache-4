40|$|Occurrence of fungi {{associated}} with {{two species of}} Basella and their pathogenic potentiality is reported. A total of 12 species of fungi representing 8 genera of the class deuteromycetes {{were found to be}} {{associated with}} Basella alba L. and B. rubra L [...] The genus Basella belongs to the Basellaceae family and has two chief cultivars, Basella alba, which bears thick, fleshy, broad, oval to heart-shaped leaves all along its vine length and Basella rubra features pink or purplish stems and pink colour veins in the leaves. In either case, leaves and terminal, tender, 8 - 12 inches stems are ready for harvesting about 35 to 45 days after seeding. Most authors agree, however, that the two color forms of Basella are not separate species. Perhaps both would best be treated as forms of Basella rubra. Basella is native to tropical Asia, probably originating in India or Indonesia. Today, it is grown widely in the tropics. <b>Vine</b> <b>spinach</b> is noted by regional names in different regions in Asia. Some of the common names for this herb are Ceylon spinach, Malabar spinach, saan choy (Chinese), mong toi (Vietnamese), alugbati (Philippines), pui saag (Bengali). remayong (Malay), Indian spinach (English), Poi, Safed bachla (Hindi), etc. Young Basella leaves and stems is popular vegetables in Asian countries. Basella alba is popular for its ethanobotanical properties. Various parts of the plant are used for treatment of the diseases as wel...|$|E
40|$|During two years, four samples {{per year}} were {{collected}} in Vietnam from rice bran, cassava residue, brewer’s grain, tofu residue, soybean meal, coconut cake, sweet potato <b>vines</b> and water <b>spinach</b> for chemical analysis and assessment of water holding capacity (WHC). The selected feedstuffs represent fibre-rich plant sources and agro-industry co-products commonly used in pig feeding in Vietnam. The content (g/kg DM) of crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE) and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) varied between feedstuffs and ranged from 21 to 506 for CP, from 14 to 118 for EE and from 197 to 572 for NSP. Cassava residue had a high starch content of 563 g/kg DM, while sweet potato <b>vines,</b> water <b>spinach,</b> coconut cake and soybean meal had a high content of sugars (63 – 71 g/kg DM). The content of individual neutral sugars varied between feed ingredients, with the highest content of arabinose, galactose and glucose in tofu residue, the highest content of xylose in brewer’s grain and the highest content of mannose in coconut cake. The content of uronic acid was high for cassava residue, tofu residue, sweet potato <b>vines</b> and water <b>spinach</b> (57 – 88 g/kg DM). The content of soluble non-cellulosic polysaccharides (S-NCP) was positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 82) to the WHC. The content (g/kg DM) of CP, NDF, neutral sugars, total NSP, total NCP, S-NCP and total dietary fibre in tofu residue, water spinach and coconut cake varied (p< 0. 05) between years. In conclusion, diet formulation to pigs can be improved if the variation in chemical composition of the fibre fraction and in WHC between potential feed ingredients is taken into account...|$|R
