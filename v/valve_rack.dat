50|$|Many more engine {{parameters}} are actively monitored and controlled in real-time. There are about 20 to 50 that measure pressure, temperature, flow, engine speed, oxygen level and NOx level plus other parameters {{at different points}} within the engine. All these sensor signals are sent to the ECU, which has the logic circuits to do the actual controlling. The ECU output is connected to different actuators for the throttle valve, EGR <b>valve,</b> <b>rack</b> (in VGTs), fuel injector (using a pulse-width modulated signal), dosing injector and more. There are about 20 to 30 actuators in all.|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 66 To {{compete in}} today?s {{economic}} climate, petrochemical plants are strategizing on continuous long-term operation to reduce maintenance costs and increase productivity. This strategy {{has led some}} plants to go from eight years between turnarounds to 10 years. For rotating machinery such as mechanical-drive steam turbines, one factor that affects this strategy is heavy deposition on steam turbine internals, caused by impurities in the steam. These impurities results in fouling on the blade and nozzle path surfaces due to contaminated materials such as silica and sodium in the steam. As a result, turbine performance tends to deteriorate gradually. This paper introduces an innovative online washing technique to minimize the impact cause by fouling of the steam path for large multistage condensing steam turbines. This technique, although applied here to extracting-condensing turbines, is also applicable to large condensing turbines. The new technology has water injection nozzles location in the steam chest of the extraction <b>valve</b> <b>rack.</b> The injection nozzles are manifold to a water supply source, which controls a set point temperature, by controlling the water injection rate. The objective is to directly wash off deposits adhering to the blades and nozzles on the low-pressure side with minimal power turndown, and without impacting the turbine?s long-term performance. Erosion damage and thermal stress of internal parts such as chest valves and blades due to the injected water {{had to be taken}} into consideration. To properly achieve this objective, and considering the potential for damage during the online wash, a new extraction valve box had to be designed. The new design had to consider the effects of optimizing the mixing zone of the steam and water injection to generate a specific particle size, moisture propagation through condensing section, mechanical deflection of stationary components, and the overall thermodynamic analysis of each stage during the online wash. A prototype model was built and several experiments carried out based on the practical operating condition of actual steam turbines. This paper discusses the evaluations made from the model, by presenting the thermodynamic analysis results, and the finite element analysis (FEA) that was used to evaluate the strength of the internal parts during actual online washing. The final design was a compact extraction box that could replace existing models without any machining of the casing. To date there are two such installations worldwide. These are operating effectively without incident. This paper also discusses online washing test results, which were obtained using an actual steam chest with the special injected nozzle and a risk assessment of online washing in general...|$|E

50|$|There {{are other}} ways of {{controlling}} fuel flow for example with the dash-pot throttle lever. The throttle has a gear which meshes with the control <b>valve</b> (like a <b>rack</b> and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions. Moving the throttle and hence sliding the valve along the cylinder, opens and closes these ports as designed. There are actually 2 valves viz. the throttle and the control valve. The control valve is used to control pressure {{on one side of}} the throttle valve such that it gives the right opposition to the throttle control pressure. It does this by controlling the fuel outlet from within the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{hydropower}} {{development in}} Norway {{is more or}} less restricted to small scale installations without reservoirs as they are regarded as an environmentally solution. This thesis provides an overview of the hydropower potential of nine rivers in Sør-Trøndelag, a county in Norway. This feasibility study includes technical, economical and environmental considerations. There is a combination of theoretical, experimental and programming work. First of all, the hydropower plants locations were positioned on a map. The rivers considered are not gauged so the runoff data was scaled from a metering station in an adjacent watershed. Once the head and the runoff were determined, the hydropower was calculated. The main objective of this thesis is to build a user friendly program that estimates the costs of small hydropower plants, that consists of the cost of its components. The main components of a small hydropower plant are technically described: intake dam, intake gate or <b>valve,</b> trash <b>rack,</b> pipes, powerhouse, turbine, generator, crane, transformer, controller, switchgear and power cable. The program was developed with Microsoft Office Excel 2003. There are three different versions of the program: one that provides a general overview of the costs, another one that provides the costs for each component separately and finally one that optimizes the hydropower plant design. The profitability of the small hydropower plants projects was discussed in the economic analysis. Environmental aspects were, as they always should, considered when planning the hydropower plants. To take this investigation a step further one river was selected to undergo verification of the data. A field survey was made to check the location of the hydropower plant in its natural surroundings and to measure the flow of the river. The dimensions of the pipe and of the Pelton turbine were calculated. This thesis {{can be used as a}} guide for the landowners eager to developing hydropower on their property...|$|R
40|$|The Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS) {{has been}} {{developed}} jointly by Boeing Corporation, Huntsville, Alabama and Honeywell Engines & Systems, Torrance, California to meet the internal thermal control needs for the International Space Station (ISS). The ITCS provides heat removal for the critical life support systems and thermal conditioning for numerous experiment racks. The ITCS will be fitted {{on a number of}} modules on the ISS. The first US Element containing the ITCS, Node 1, was launched in December 1998. Since Node 1 does not contain a pump to circulate the fluid it was not filled with ITCS fluid until after the US Laboratory Module was installed. The second US Element module, US Laboratory Module, which contains the pumps and all the major ITCS control hardware, was launched in February 2001. The third US Element containing the ITCS, the US Airlock, was launched in July 2001. The dual loop system of the ITCS is comprised of a lowtemperature loop (LTL) and a moderate-temperature loop (MTL). Each loop has a pump package assembly (PPA), a system flow control assembly (SFCA), a threeway mixing <b>valve</b> (TWMV), several <b>rack</b> flow control assemblies (RFCA), cold plates, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, pump bypass assembly (PBA) and a heat exchanger. In addition, the MTL has an additional TWMV, a payload regeneration heat exchanger (P/RHE) and a manual flow control valve (MFCV). The LTL has a service performance and checkout unit (SPCU) heat exchanger. The two loops are linked via one loop crossover assembly (LCA) providing cross loop capabilities and a single PPA, two-loop functionality. One important parameter monitored by the ground stations and on-orbit is the amount of fluid leakage from the ITCS. ISS fluid leakage is of importance since ITCS fluid is costly to re-supply, may be difficult to clean up in zero-g, and if uncontained could lead to equipment failures and potential hazards. This paper examines the nominal leakage observed over period of a year of on-orbit operation and compares this with analysis predictions. This paper also addresses the off-nominal leakage and a fluid transfer event causing significant changes in accumulator quantity...|$|R
