5|$|In Greece, despite British aid, little air {{opposition}} was encountered. As the Allies withdrew and resistance collapsed, the Allies began evacuating to Crete. The Stukas inflicted severe damage on Allied shipping. On 22 April, the 1,389ton destroyers Psara and Ydra were sunk. In {{the next two}} days, the Greek naval base at Piraeus lost 23 <b>vessels</b> <b>to</b> Stuka attack.|$|E

Fire from cannons on the fort's southwest bastion's sank two of the barges, spurring the remaining <b>vessels</b> <b>to</b> retreat.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small <b>vessels</b> <b>to</b> clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|Despite never being {{forecast}} {{to strike}} Bangladesh, officials there warned residents that the storm could strike {{the nation and}} cause loss of life. Cautionary signals were raised at ports in Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, and Mongla, advising seafaring <b>vessels</b> <b>to</b> remain docked until the storm's passage. Roughly 34,000members of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society were placed on standby for possible relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Britain and France {{declared}} the South to be belligerents by international law, and their ships {{were entitled to}} {{the same rights as}} U.S.-flagged <b>vessels</b> <b>to</b> remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, and so he turned to less {{expensive}} <b>vessels</b> <b>to</b> modernize the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to the same basic design.|$|E
5|$|In {{the life}} cycle of Plasmodium, a female Anopheles {{mosquito}} (the definitive host) transmits a motile infective form (called the sporozoite) to a vertebrate host such as a human (the secondary host), thus acting as a transmission vector. A sporozoite travels through the blood <b>vessels</b> <b>to</b> liver cells (hepatocytes), where it reproduces asexually (tissue schizogony), producing thousands of merozoites. These infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles (blood schizogony) that produce 8 to 24 new infective merozoites, at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Lady Washington, or more commonly, Washington, was a 90-ton brig. Her {{early history}} {{is still in}} question. As part of the Columbia Expedition, she left Boston Harbor on October 1, 1787. She sailed around Cape Horn and participated in the maritime fur trade with the coastal Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest and in tea and porcelain across the Pacific in China. She was the first American-flagged <b>vessel</b> <b>to</b> round Cape Horn. She was the first recorded <b>vessel</b> <b>to</b> make landfall on the Oregon coast near Tillamook, Oregon.

Including offshore, Helen killed 85 people in Japan. Along the east coast of South Korea, these swells resulted in two fatalities.|$|E

By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging up to and including the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E
