5|$|Initially {{tuition at}} the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents {{obtained}} from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts, and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school. School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2013/2014 they are £14,670 (approximately €17,900 or US$24,500 as of March 2014) per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted now take the schools own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, mathematics and <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can de deferred for two years so that boys who are at prep school may enter at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.|$|E

McMaster requires that the MCAT be written, though they only look for particular scores (6 or better) on the <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> portion of the test.|$|E

25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E
25|$|In {{the state}} sector, {{children}} start {{school in the}} school year in which they turn five. They stay at primary school for seven years (although this varies even within the county, as some people have previously gone {{for four years and}} then spent another four years at a 'middle school') until they are eleven. Warwickshire {{is one of the few}} local authorities in England to still maintain the grammar school system in two districts: Stratford-on-Avon and Rugby, although Southam claims to have a comprehensive school. In the final year of primary school, children are given the opportunity of sitting the 11-plus exam to compete for a place at one of the grammar schools, with two in Stratford and Rugby and one in Alcester; these are: Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls; King Edward VI School, a boys' school; Lawrence Sheriff Grammar School for Boys, in Rugby, as well as, Rugby High School for Girls and Alcester Grammar School (mixed). The exam is sat on three different days and consists of two <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> and mathematics papers and one extended writing paper. To maintain standards, there is a bank of papers that are used in rotation. In 2006, it was revealed in a local newspaper, the Stratford Herald, that some private 11-plus tutors had copies of the exam papers and that they were using them as practice papers for their pupils. This meant that, in some cases, pupils sitting the exam had seen the paper in advance.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 {{the test}} changed again.

Passage-based questions were implemented to evaluate [...] "text comprehension, data analysis, ability to evaluate an argument, or apply knowledge from the passage to other contexts." [...] A new scoring scale was also implemented. The total composite score, which ranges from 3–45, is based on the individual scores of the <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> biological sciences, and physical sciences, which each have a score range of 1–15. The writing sample, which consists of two essays to be written within 30 minutes for each, is graded on a letter scale from J-T with T being the highest attainable score.|$|E

60|$|Mathematical logic, even in {{its most}} modern form, is not {{directly}} of philosophical importance except in its beginnings. After the beginnings, it belongs rather to mathematics than to philosophy. Of its beginnings, which are {{the only part of}} it that can properly be called philosophical logic, I shall speak shortly. But even the later developments, though not directly philosophical, will be found of great indirect use in philosophising. They enable us to deal easily with more abstract conceptions than merely <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> can enumerate; they suggest fruitful hypotheses which otherwise could hardly be thought of; and they enable us to see quickly what is the smallest store of materials with which a given logical or scientific edifice can be constructed. Not only Frege's theory of number, which we shall deal with in Lecture VII., but the whole theory of physical concepts which will be outlined in our next two lectures, is inspired by mathematical logic, and could never have been imagined without it.|$|E

40|$|This article informs {{about the}} impact of {{attention}} deficit disorder and hyperactivity (ADHD) on the level of analogical reasoning and metapragmatic knowledge. Both abilities ``cognitive and linguistic'' are essential to comprehend certain figurative meanings in speech. The participants are 94 high-class elementary school students. Forty-seven of them present ADHD; the remaining participants do not. A quantitative method was used: both abilities were evaluated individually with the aid of interactive software. The <b>verbal</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> instrument measured proportional analogies. The metapragmatic knowledge instrument evaluated ambiguous referents, observed dialogue, and unclear instructions. The ADHD participants show a level of development of some cognitive and linguistic abilities, e. g., the <b>verbal</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> and metapragmatic knowledge, significantly more reduced than that of their peer group, who do not present such disorder. The above probably accounts for the more gradual development of oral language among children who do not suffer from TDAH as compared to that in TDAH children...|$|R

The initial aim was to develop the proverbs task, requiring the formation of novel proverbs unfamiliar to participants but containing universal themes. The novel proverbs task and existing measures of abstract <b>reasoning</b> and <b>verbal</b> ability were completed by participants who spoke English as either a first or second language and who originated from a variety of cultures. The scores on the measures were subjected to multivariate analysis. Analysis determined that within language and cultural analyses the proverb task was related to scores on other culturally bound <b>verbal</b> abstract <b>reasoning</b> tests. In addition, both the established 'culture-fair' abstract reasoning task and the proverb task did not differentiate between language or cultural groups. These and further analyses are placed within the literature of 'culture-fair' assessments with reference to clinical practice...|$|R
