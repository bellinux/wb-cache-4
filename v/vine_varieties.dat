25|$|The {{mid-19th century}} ushered {{an end to}} the industry's prosperity. First came the 1851 {{discovery}} of powdery mildew, which severely reduced production over the next three years. Just as the industry was recovering through the use of the copper-based Bordeaux mixture fungicide, the phylloxera epidemic that had plagued France and other European wine regions reached the island. By the end of the 19th century, most of the island's vineyards had been uprooted, and many were converted to sugar cane production. The majority of the vineyards that did replant chose to use American <b>vine</b> <b>varieties,</b> such as Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris or hybrid grape varieties rather than replant with the Vitis vinifera varieties that were previously grown.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{anthocyanins}} (as the glycoside) found in wine grapes which {{are responsible for the}} vast range of coloring from ruby red through to dark black found in wine grapes. Ampelographers can use this observation to assist in the identification of different grape varieties. The European vine family Vitis vinifera is characterized by anthocyanins that are composed of only one molecule of glucose while non-vinifera vines such as hybrids and the American Vitis labrusca will have anthocyanins with two molecules. This phenomenon is due to a double mutation in the anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase gene of V. vinifera. In the mid-20th century, French ampelographers used this knowledge to test the various <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> throughout France to identify which vineyards still contained non-vinifera plantings.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{situation}} occurred in Italy when, in 1990, the Ca' del Bosco Winery acquired {{what they thought}} was Cabernet Franc vines from a French nursery. The growers noticed that the grapes were different from the traditional Cabernet Franc both in color and taste. They also noticed that the vines ripened earlier than Cabernet Franc would have. Other Italian wine regions also started to doubt the origin of these vines and it was finally established to be Carménère. Although, in Italy, the variety is grown mainly in the northeast part of the country from Brescia to Friuli, it has only recently been entered into Italy's national catalog of <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> and thus [...] "no district has yet requested the authorization to use it". Therefore, the wine [...] "cannot be cultivated with its original name or specific vintage and the name cannot be used to identify the wine on the label with an IGT, DOC or a DOCG status assignment." [...] Ca' del Bosco Winery names the wine it produces Carmenero. In 2007 the grape was authorised to be used in Italian DOC wines from Veneto (Arcole, Bagnoli di Sopra, Cori Benedettine del Padovano, Garda, Merlara, Monti Lessini, Riviera del Brenta and Vicenza), Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Collio, or Collio Goriziano) and Sardinia (Alghero). Since a ministerial decree of 2009, producers of Piave DOC wines in 50 communes of the Province of Treviso, and 12 in the Province of Venice have been permitted where appropriate to specify the variety Carmenère on the wine label.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after Riley {{confirmed}} the theory proposed by Planchon, Laliman and Bazille, {{up until then}} two unknown winegrowers, proposed that the European vines, of the vinifera variety, may form a resistance to the destructive phylloxera if they were grafted with the American <b>vine</b> <b>variety,</b> which had formed a natural resistance.|$|R

50|$|The {{organoleptic}} {{characteristics of the}} monovarietal Nerello Mascalese generally are a ruby red color, with subtle grenade tones; a strong fruity scent of red berry fruits, with slight floral shades, a spicy hint, and a feeble effusion of vanilla and tobacco, with a persistent trace of licorice; and a dry, tannic, persistent and harmonic taste, with a strong body. At sight, the wine seems surely more mature than it appears when smelled or tasted.

25|$|Hermann Müller {{was born}} in Tägerwilen on Lake Constance. He studied natural {{sciences}} at ETH Zurich. In 1874 he was awarded a PhD in Würzburg, Germany, and later became director of the Institute for Plant Physiology at the Geisenheim Research Station, Germany. In 1890 {{he became the first}} director of Wädenswil, the present-day Agroscope Changins-Wädenswil Research Station (ACW), and was a pioneer in the field of vine cultivation. He is considered the father of the Müller-Thurgau vine, which was crossed in 1882 and is the world's first scientifically-based new vine breed. With its success it displaced the old varieties, such as Elbling and Räuschling, and up until today has remained the most successful specifically cultivated vine variety: More than 41,000 ha are cultivated worldwide, which corresponds to almost three times the total vine area of Switzerland. It is most widespread in Germany; in German-speaking Switzerland it is still the most important white wine variety today. For a long time this <b>vine</b> <b>variety</b> was thought to be a crossing between Riesling and Silvaner. In 1998 an Austrian research team discovered, on the basis of molecular-genetic tests, that the crossing partners were not Riesling x Silvaner, but Riesling x Madeleine Royal. How this «mix-up» could have occurred has never been discovered. However, this fact has given new impetus to the <b>vine</b> <b>variety's</b> second name, Müller-Thurgau.|$|R

In Dão, it was evaluated the influence of shoot density (23, 17 and 11 for linear meter of canopy) and qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In Bairrada, the traditional vine trellising has been compared with the Lys system. In both conduction systems has been evaluated the influence of qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In Vinhos Verdes, in the system LYS 2 / 3, has been studied the effect of shoot density (29 and 20 for linear meter of canopy) and leaf removal associated to qualitative cluster thinning at veraison. In these three regions, two of them that are not traditional places for this variety, the ‘Touriga Nacional’ reached high levels of yield and quality, in adjusted technological itineraries. Cluster thinning reduced yield in all cases, as it was expectable, with gains of PAC only in Bairrada. In a general way, different levels of canopy management (leaf removal and shoot suppression) didn’t play an important role.

50|$|Although {{red wine}} and white <b>vine</b> <b>varieties</b> produce similar amounts of resveratrol, red wine {{contains}} more than white, since red wines are produced by maceration (soaking the grape skins in the mash).

Similarly the use of certain fining agents during the clarification and stabilization of wine can strip the wine of some resveratrol molecules.|$|E
