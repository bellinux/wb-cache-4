40|$|Ethylene {{evolution}} from plants inhibits Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, but the mechanism is little understood. In this study, the possible role of ethylene in Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation was clarified. •It was tested {{whether or not}} plant ethylene sensitivity affected genetic transformation; the sensitivity might regulate bacterial growth during co-cultivation and <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. For these experiments, melon (Cucumis melo) was used, in which ethylene sensitivity was controlled by chemicals, and Arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutants. •Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation was inhibited in ethylene-sensing melon, whereas, in Arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutant, it was enhanced. However, the ethylene sensitivity did not affect bacterial growth. <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression was inhibited by application of plant exudate from ethylene-sensitive plants. The inhibitory effect of the ethylene sensitivity on genetic transformation relieved the activation of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in A. tumefaciens with <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> inducer molecule (acetosyringone, AS) or A. tumefaciens mutant strain which has constitutive <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. •These results indicate that ethylene {{evolution from}} a plant inoculated with A. tumefaciens inhibited <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in A. tumefaciens through the ethylene signal transduction in the plant, and, as a result, Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation was inhibited...|$|E
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens induces crown gall tumors by {{transferring}} a {{piece of}} its tumor-inducing plasmid into plant cells. This transferred DNA encodes the synthesis of indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin, and their overproduction results in tumor formation. The transfer is initiated by a two-component regulatory system, VirA/G recognizing plant signal molecules in the plant rhizosphere and activating a regulon on the tumor-inducing plasmid, which {{is required for the}} processing and transfer of DNA and protein. Although a great deal is known about <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> activation, nothing is known about whether or how the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> regulon is inactivated after plant cell transformation. Presumably, just as a mechanism exists for activating the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> regulon only when a plant is in the immediate environment, a mechanism should exist for inactivating the same regulon once it has fulfilled its mission to transferred DNA into plant cells. We now show that IAA inactivates <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression by competing with the inducing phenolic compound acetosyringone for interaction with VirA. IAA does not inhibit the vir genes in cells containing a constitutive sensor virA locus, which does not require any signal molecules to become phosphorylated. At higher concentrations, IAA inhibits the growth of Agrobacterium and many other plant-associated bacteria but not the growth of bacteria that occupy other ecological niches. These observations provide the missing link in the cycle of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> activation and inactivation...|$|E
30|$|Another vital {{factor that}} may {{contribute}} high transient transformation efficiencies might be full induction of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expressions in Agrobacterium. Transient transformation efficiencies of ice plant seedlings were 1.3 - to 1.7 -fold higher when root tips were removed {{in comparison to}} intact seedlings (Table  1). These data further support {{that the existence of}} wounded sites in plants may help with Agrobacterium infection by producing a phenolic compound to induce <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression and making plant cells vigorously divide to be competent for transformation. In addition, we have added 200  μM acetosyringone (AS) in our bacteria culture to fully induce <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expressions in Agrobacterium. In previous studies (Andolfatto et al. 1994; Ishimaru 1999; Konieczny et al. 2011), Agrobacterium strains were only cultured in rich media without additions of AS. In this study, Agrobacterium was specifically cultured in acidic minimal medium (AB-MES media), which contained glucose and low phosphate, and 200  μM AS to maximize <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in bacteria and may therefore result in successful and more effective transformation in ice plant callus and seedlings.|$|E

40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens initiates the {{expression}} of pathogenic genes (vir genes) in response to host-derived phenolic signals through a two-component regulatory system consisting of VirA and VirG. alpha-Bromoacetosyringone (ASBr) was developed as an inhibitor of this induction process and {{found to be a}} specific and irreversible inhibitor of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction in this pathogen. Formal replacement of one of the methoxy groups of ASBr with iodine gave an equally effective inhibitor that could carry an 125 I label. We report here that the resulting radiolabeled inhibitor does not react with the sensory component of this system, VirA, either in vivo or in vitro. Rather, two small proteins, p 10 and p 21, bind labeled inhibitor in vivo in a time period that is consistent with the exposure time required for the inhibition of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Labeling to these proteins was protected by preexposure to ASBr but not by alpha-bromo- 3, 5 -dimethoxyacetophenone, a compound of comparable chemical reactivity but previously shown not to inhibit <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression.

40|$|The plant {{pathogen}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens expresses virulence (vir) genes {{in response to}} chemical signals found {{at the site of}} a plant wound. VirA, a hybrid histidine kinase, and its cognate response regulator, VirG, regulate <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. The receiver domain at the carboxyl end of VirA has been described as an inhibitory element because its removal increased <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression relative to that of full-length VirA. However, experiments that characterized the receiver region as an inhibitory element were performed in the presence of constitutively expressed virG. We show here that VirA's receiver domain is an activating factor if virG is expressed from its native promoter on the Ti plasmid. When virAΔR was expressed from a multicopy plasmid, both sugar and the phenolic inducer were essential for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Replacement of wild-type virA on pTi with virAΔR precluded <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction, and the cells did not accumulate VirG or induce transcription of a virG-lacZ fusion in response to acetosyringone.

40|$|The <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> {{products}} of Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{carry out the}} transfer of T-DNA to the plant genome. Effective transcriptional induction of the vir genes by plant signal molecules is controlled by two <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> products, VirA and VirG. In this study we have identified and cloned a chromosomal region which is also required for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction. Transposon insertions within this region reduce induction significantly and strongly attenuate virulence, resulting in a restricted host range for infection. The reduction in <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> transcription can be partially overcome by high concentrations of the inducer molecule acetosyringone. Expression of virG at low pH and low phosphate concentrations, which is independent of plant signals, is not affected by these mutations. Sequence analysis of the region revealed two divergent open reading frames, which we have designated chvE and ORF 1. Several transposon insertions mapped in chvE; this resulted in attenuated virulence. chvE codes for a putative protein which is homologous to two periplasmic receptor proteins involved in chemotaxis and uptake of sugars.

The published genome sequence of Plasmodium vivax revealed the largest subtelomeric multigene family of human malaria parasites, the vir super-family, presently composed of 346 <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> subdivided into 12 different subfamilies based on sequence homologies detected by BLAST. Results A novel computational approach {{was used to}} redefine <b>vir</b> <b>genes.</b> First, a protein-weighted graph was built based on BLAST alignments. This graph was processed to ensure that edge weights are not exclusively based on the BLAST score between the two corresponding proteins, but strongly dependant on their graph neighbours and their associations. Then the Markov Clustering Algorithm {{was applied to the}} protein graph. Next, the Homology Block concept was used to further validate this clustering approach. Finally, proteome-wide analysis was carried out to predict new VIR members. Results showed that (i) three previous subfamilies cannot longer be classified as vir genes; (ii) most previously unclustered <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> were clustered into vir subfamilies; (iii) 39 hypothetical proteins were predicted as VIR proteins; (iv) many of these findings are supported by a number of structural and functional evidences, sub-cellular localization studies, gene expression analysis and chromosome localization (v) this approach can be used to study other multigene families in malaria. Conclusions This methodology, resource and new classification of <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> will contribute to a new structural framing of this multigene family and other multigene {{families of}} malaria parasites, facilitating the design of experiments to understand their role in pathology, which in turn may help furthering vaccine development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Most {{virulence}} (<b>vir)</b> <b>genes</b> of Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{that are}} required {{for the formation of}} crown gall tumors are expressed in response to such plant signal molecules as acetosyringone and lignin precursors. The phenolic signals are transduced through a receptor VirA protein in the inner membrane of the bacterial cell. The expression of these genes triggers the transfer of a specific DNA segment, called transferred DNA (T-DNA), from the Ti plasmid to plant cells, and its integration into their nuclear DNA. We show here that a group of aldoses (L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-lyxose, D-glucose, D-mannose, D-idose, D-galactose, and D-talose) can markedly enhance acetosyringone-dependent expression of <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> when the concentration of acetosyringone is limited (10 microM) but does not enhance the expression of noninducible genes. Likewise, a 2 -deoxy-D-glucose, a nonmetabolized sugar, is also effective. When a deletion was introduced into the virA gene in the region encoding the periplasmic portion of the VirA protein, enhancement by glucose disappeared, but vir expression was induced by acetosyringone in this mutant. These results suggest that these sugars directly enhance a signaling process initiated by phenolic inducers that results in an increase in expression of the <b>vir</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The transconjugant CB 100, {{harboring}} the Ti plasmid {{from the}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens biovar 2 strain D 10 B/ 87 in the chromosomal {{background of the}} biovar 1 strain C 58, was defective in <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction. This defect was corrected {{in the presence of}} virA from pTiA 6. Based on this complementation result and an analysis of the induction requirements of the transconjugant CB 100 and its parent strains, it was hypothesized that the defective <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction in CB 100 was related to a dysfunctional interaction between the pTi-encoded D 10 B/ 87 VirA and the chromosome-encoded C 58 ChvE. To verify this hypothesis, D 10 B/ 87 and C 58 virA were compared, and conclusions from this first set of analyses were then corroborated by comparing D 10 B/ 87 and C 58 chvE. Whereas only a few nucleotide differences were identified in the promoters and 5 ' ends of the coding regions of D 10 B/ 87 and C 58 virA, analysis of hybrid virA genes showed that these differences collectively accounted for the poor <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction of strain CB 100. In contrast with the sequence similarity of the VirA proteins, extensive divergence was seen between the chromosome-encoded D 10 B/ 87 and C 58 ChvE. Although D 10 B/ 87 chvE introduced in trans had little effect on <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction of CB 100, it enhanced the induction response of a strain CB 100 derivative in which the chromosomal C 58 chvE had been inactivated by marker exchange. These results suggest that chromosomal backgrounds provided by different strains of A. tumefaciens are not equivalent for VirA function. Following conjugative transfer of certain Ti plasmids to a new agrobacterial host, evolution of the newly introduced virA, or coevolution of chvE and virA, may lead to optimization of ChvE-VirA interaction and <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction levels...|$|E
40|$|ChvE is a chromosomally encoded {{protein in}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens that mediates a sugar-related {{increase}} in virulence (<b>vir)</b> <b>gene</b> expression through {{the activities of}} the VirA/VirG two-component system, and has been proposed to be involved in both sugar utilization and chemotaxis towards sugars. The ChvE protein has homology to several bacterial periplasmic sugar binding proteins such as ribose-binding protein (RBP) and galactose/glucose-binding protein (GGBP) of Escherichia coli. In this study, we characterized the role of the chvE operon in sugar-related processes other than virulence and examined the biophysical properties of the ChvE protein. Further, ChvE mutants with altered <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression phenotypes have been isolated and characterized. Three distinct categories of mutants have been identified: those that cannot bind sugar, those that can bind sugar but have effects on both sugar utilization and <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression and, finally, those that can bind and utilize sugar in a wild type fashion but affect <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Examination of a homology model of ChvE shows the mutated residues associated with the latter two phenotypes lie in two overlapping solvent-exposed sites adjacent to the sugar-binding cleft where conformational changes associated with the binding of sugar might have a maximal affect on ChvE 2 ̆ 7 s interactions with VirA and other proteins. We propose that the third category of mutants define a surface of ChvE that interacts with the periplasmic domain of the sensor kinase, VirA. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes tumors on plants only at {{temperatures}} below 32 °C, and virulence gene expression is specifically inhibited at temperatures above 32 °C. We show here that this effect persists even when the virA and virG loci are expressed under the control of a lac promoter whose activity is temperature independent. This finding suggests that one or more steps in the signal transduction process mediated by the VirA and VirG proteins are temperature sensitive. Both the autophosphorylation of VirA and the subsequent transfer of phosphate to VirG are shown to be sensitive to high temperatures (> 32 °C), and this correlates with the reduced <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression observed at these temperatures. At temperatures of 32 °C and higher, the VirA molecule undergoes a reversible inactivation while the VirG molecule is not affected. <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction is temperature sensitive in an acetosyringone-independent virA mutant background but not in a virG constitutive mutant which is virA and acetosyringone independent. These observations all support the notion that the VirA protein is responsible for the thermosensitivity of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression. However, an Agrobacterium strain containing a constitutive virG locus still cannot cause tumors on Kalanchoe plants at 32 °C. This strain induces normal-size tumors at temperatures up to 30 °C, whereas the wild-type Agrobacterium strain produces almost no tumors at 30 °C. These results suggest that at temperatures above 32 °C, the plant becomes more resistant to infection by A. tumefaciens and/or functions of some other <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> products are lost in spit...|$|E

Two fo the <b>vir</b> <b>genes,</b> virA and virG, belonging to the bacterial two-component regulatory system family, control the induction of <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> by plant signals. virA encodes a membrane-bound sensor kinase protein and virG encodes a cytoplasmic regulator protein.

In this communication, we describe an in vivo crosslinking approach which provides physical evidence that VirA exists as a homodimer in its native configuration. The dimerization of VirA neither requires nor is stimulated by the plant signal molecule acetosyringone. We also present genetic data which support the hypothesis that VirA exists as a homodimer which is the functional state transducing the plant signal in an intersubunit mechanism.

40|$|The {{formation}} of crown gall tumors by Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{requires that the}} virulence (<b>vir)</b> <b>genes</b> be induced by chemical signals which consist of specific phenolic compounds and monosaccharides, synthesized at plant wound sites. Signal transduction in the activation of these genes is mediated by the VirA-VirG two-component regulatory system, together with ChvE, a glucose-galactose binding protein which interacts with VirA. We have previously presented genetic evidence that virA senses phenolic compounds directly (Y. -W. Lee, S. Jin, W. -S. Sim, and E. W. Nester, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92 : 12245 – 12249, 1995). The <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> of strain KU 12 can be induced by 4 -hydroxyacetophenone, p-coumaric acid, and phenol, whereas these same phenolic compounds are weak inducers of the <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> of strain A 6. In this report, we show that a specific inducing sugar can broaden the specificity of the phenolic compound which VirA senses. 4 -Hydroxyacetophenone and other related phenolic compounds function as inducing phenolic compounds with the virA gene of A 6 if arabinose replaces glucose as the inducing sugar. We further demonstrate that this broadened specificity for phenolic inducers results from the increased level of ChvE through induction by arabinose via the regulatory protein GbpR. If high levels of ChvE are present, then poorly inducing phenolic compounds can induce the <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> to high levels in combination with glucose. Comparing the induction response of the wild type and that of a VirA mutant with a mutation in its receiver domain revealed that {{the activity of the}} receiver domain is controlled by the periplasmic domain.

We report here that certain sugars induce the vir genes synergistically with phenolic inducers {{by way of}} a distinct regulatory pathway that includes VirA and a chromosomally encoded virulence protein, ChvE. Sequence comparison showed that ChvE is a periplasmic galactose-binding protein corresponding to the GBP 1 protein isolated from Agrobacterium radiobacter. Like homologous sugar-binding proteins in Escherichia coli, ChvE was required for chemotaxis toward galactose and several other sugars. These sugars strongly induced <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression in wild-type cells when acetosyringone was absent or present in low concentrations. Mutations in chvE abolished <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction by sugars and resulted in a limited host range for infection but did not affect <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction by acetosyringone. A mutant lacking the periplasmic domain of VirA exhibited the same regulatory phenotype and limited host range as chvE mutants. These data show that the vir genes are regulated by two separate classes of plant-derived inducers by way of distinct regulatory pathways that can be separated by mutation.

40|$|The VirA/VirG two-component {{regulatory}} system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens regulates {{expression of the}} virulence (vir) genes that control the infection process leading to crown gall tumor disease on susceptible plants.

Inducing signals include phenols, monosaccharides, and acidic pH. While sugars are not essential for gene induction, their presence greatly increases <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression when levels of the essential phenolic signal are low. Reception of the sugar signal depends on a direct interaction between ChvE, a sugar-binding protein, and VirA. Here we show that the sugar signal received in the periplasmic region of one subunit within a VirA heterodimer can enhance the kinase function of the second subunit. However, sugar enhancement of <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression was vector dependent. virA alleles expressed from pSa-derived vectors inhibited signal transduction by endogenous VirA.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of virA loci from limited (pTiAg 162) and wide (pTiA 6) host range tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmids, each of which encodes a single protein of 92, 000 daltons. Using antibody directed against the virA gene product, we have localized the VirA protein to the bacterial inner membrane. VirA is homologous to at least four bacterial proteins which {{play a role in}} the transcriptional regulation of diverse families of genes.

For both tobacco and cotton, we observed an enhancement of transformation efficiency when the inciting Agrobacterium strain carries the virGN 54 D mutation. We also tested whether supplying Agrobacterium with a similar plasmid containing wild-type virG affects the efficiency of T-DNA transfer. An intermediate efficiency was observed when this plasmid was employed. Using a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene to assess transient expression of T-DNA after transfer to tobacco and maize tissues, we observed a higher frequency of GUS-expressing foci after inoculation with Agrobacterium strains carrying virGN 54 D than with Agrobacterium carrying the wild-type virG. Gene-transfer efficiency to maize by an octopine strain was greatly improved upon introduction of virGN 54 D.

In all, 245 H. pylori strains were examined using PCR to evaluate the status of dupA and the adjacent <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> predicted to form T 4 SS, {{in addition to the}} status of cag pathogenicity island (PAI). The associations between dupA cluster status and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and IL- 12 production were also examined. The presence of dupA and all adjacent <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> were defined as a complete dupA cluster. Many variations related to the status of dupA and dupA cluster genes were identified. Concurrent H. pylori infection and the presence of a complete dupA cluster increases duodenal ulcer risk compared to H. pylori infection with incomplete dupA cluster or without the dupA gene independent on the cag PAI status (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 13; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 13 to 4. 03). Gastric mucosal IL- 8 levels were also significantly higher in the complete dupA cluster group than in other groups (P = 0. 01). In conclusion, although the causal relationship between the dupA cluster and duodenal ulcer development is not proved, the presence of a complete dupA cluster but not dupA alone, is associated with duodenal ulcer development...|$|R
50|$|The {{transfer}} DNA (abbreviated T-DNA) is the transferred DNA of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of {{some species}} of bacteria such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The T-DNA {{is transferred from}} bacterium into the host plant's nuclear DNA genome. The T-DNA is bordered by 25-base-pair repeats on each end. Transfer is initiated at the right border and terminated at the left border and requires the <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> of the Ti plasmid.|$|R
40|$|Expression of {{virulence}} factors by Bordetella pertussis is {{altered by}} environmental signals (antigenic modulation) and {{is dependent on}} an activator encoded by a gene called vir. We have used TnphoA (Tn 5 IS 50 L::phoA) gene fusions to define two sets of genes whose expression is either activated (vag loci) or repressed (vrg loci) by modulation signals. Both groups of genes appear to be regulated by the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> product in that, {{in the absence of}} modulators, null mutations in vir lead to the repression of vag gene fusions and derepression of vrg gene fusions. Mutants of B. pertussis were isolated that constitutively express virulence factors {{in the presence of the}} modulator MgSO 4, nicotinic acid, or low incubation temperature. We designate the gene that carries such mutations mod (modulation) and have characterized one (mod- 1) of these mod constitutive mutations. A method was developed for the insertional inactivation of the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> by using the integration of a suicide replicon. Inactivation of the <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> in the mod- 1 mutant, followed by transcomplementation with the cloned wild-type <b>vir</b> <b>gene,</b> gives the Mod- 1 constitutive phenotype, showing that the mod- 1 mutation defines a gene distinct from vir. The gene carrying the mod- 1 mutation is linked to vir and was cloned on a recombinant cosmid (pLAF-C 1) which transcomplements the vir- 1 ::Tn 5 mutation in B. pertussis 347. Introduction of pLAF-C 1 into vir mutant and vir+ B. pertussis strains also gives the Mod- 1 constitutive phenotype, indicating that mod- 1 is a dominant allele. These data suggest that the mod gene product could have sensory functions for the environmental signals that affect the expression of vir-regulated genes of B. pertussis. The mod constitutive strains and plasmids described here also have applications in pertussis vaccine development...|$|E
40|$|The {{virulence}} (vir) {{region of}} pTiC 58 was screened for promoter activities by using gene fusions to a promoterless lux operon in the broad-host-range vector pUCD 615. Active vir fragments contained the strongly acetosyringone-inducible promoters of virB, virC, virD, and virE and the weakly inducible promoters of virA and virG. Identical induction patterns were obtained with freshly sliced carrot disks, suggesting that an inducer is released after plant tissue is wounded. Optimal conditions for <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> induction were pH 5. 7 for 50 microM acetosyringone or sinapic acid. The induction of virB and virE by acetosyringone was strictly dependent on intact virA and virG loci. An {{increase in the}} copy number of virG resulted in a proportional, acetosyringone-independent increase in <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> expression, and a further increase occurred only if an inducing compound and virA were present...|$|E
40|$|We sequenced the virD-virE, virE-virF, and virF–T-DNA {{intergenic regions}} of an octopine Ti plasmid. Four newly {{described}} genes were {{induced by the}} <b>vir</b> <b>gene</b> inducer acetosyringone, {{two of which are}} conserved in the nopaline-type Ti plasmid pTiC 58. One gene resembles a family of phosphatase genes. Each of these genes is dispensible for tumorigenesis...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic yersiniae secrete {{a set of}} 11 anti-host {{proteins}} called Yops. The yop genes, {{scattered around}} the pYV plasmid, constitute a thermoinduced regulon controlled by the product of virF gene. The secretion of the Yops also requires {{the presence of the}} products of the other <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> and operons, namely virA, virB and virC. The large virC operon and presumably some genes of the virA region encode a new secretion system. Mutations in any of these <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> impair the production of all the Yops. In contrast, mutations in the yerA locus, located close to yopE, specifically abolish the expression of the cytotoxin YopE. We describe here the counterpart of yerA in Yersinia enterocolitica W 22703. We demonstrate that the gene product of yerA regulates the production of YopE at a post-transcriptional level. It specifically binds the YopE protein. We consider that it acts as a specific chaperone and we call it SycE (for specific YopE chaperone). We hypothesize that SycE is a link between translation and the specific Yop export machinery. It is the first representative of a new family of pYV-encoded proteins...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{transformation}} of wheat, using biolistics or Agrobacterium, underpins {{a range of}} specific research methods for identifying genes and studying their function in planta. Transgenic approaches to study and modify traits in durum wheat have lagged behind those for bread wheat. Here we report the use of Agrobacterium strain AGL 1, with additional <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> housed in a helper plasmid, to transform and regenerate the durum wheat variety Ofanto. The use of the basic pSoup helper plasmid with no additional <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> failed to generate transformants, whereas the presence of either virG 542 or the 15 kb Komari fragment containing virB, virC and virG 542 produced transformation efficiencies of between 0. 6 and 9. 7 %. Of the 42 transgenic plants made, all but one (which set very few seeds) appeared morphologically normal and produced between 100 and 300 viable seeds. The transgene copy number and the segregation ratios {{were found to be}} very similar to those previously reported for bread wheat. We believe {{that this is the first}} report describing successful genetic {{transformation of}} tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens using immature embryos as the explant.

40|$|Acetosyringone, a {{phenolic}} inducer of the virulence (<b>vir)</b> <b>genes</b> of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, inhibited {{the growth}} of the nopaline-type strains T 37 and C 58 incubated under acidic conditions. In the course of a 6 -day incubation with acetosyringone, avirulent clones were produced in different proportions by strains T 37 and C 58 and also by a spontaneous variant of strain C 58, denominated C 58 F. The proportion of avirulent clones in acetosyringone-treated cultures often exceeded 50 % for strains T 37 and C 58 F and was of the order of 1 % for strain C 58. Control cultures not exposed to acetosyringone did not yield avirulent clones. Two other vir inducers, sinapinic acid and syringaldehyde, also inhibited growth and promoted accumulation of avirulent clones in cultures of strains C 58 F and T 37. On the other hand, various acetosyringone analogs reported not to induce the <b>vir</b> <b>genes</b> did not act as growth inhibitors. All of the T 37 and most of the C 58 F avirulent clones examined still carried a Ti plasmid. In all instances examined, avirulent clones still carrying a Ti plasmid were mutated in this plasmid. Mutants of strain C 58 F lacked the capacity to induce a virB::lacZ fusion in the presence of acetosyringone...|$|R
