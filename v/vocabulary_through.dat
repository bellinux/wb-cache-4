500|$|English forms {{new words}} from {{existing}} words or roots in its <b>vocabulary</b> <b>through</b> {{a variety of}} processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion, using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding, producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick. A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, {{is the use of}} derivational suffixes (-hood, -ness, -ing, -ility) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin).|$|E
2500|$|James Chadwick {{discovered}} {{a much more}} massive nuclear particle in 1932 and also named it a neutron, leaving two kinds of particles with the same name. Pauli earlier (in 1930) had used the term [...] "neutron" [...] for both the neutral particle that conserved energy in beta decay, and a presumed neutral particle in the nucleus, and initially did not consider these two neutral particles as distinct from each other. The word [...] "neutrino" [...] entered the scientific <b>vocabulary</b> <b>through</b> Enrico Fermi, who used it during a conference in Paris in July 1932 and at the Solvay Conference in October 1933, where Pauli also employed it. The name (the Italian equivalent of [...] "little neutral one") was jokingly coined by Edoardo Amaldi during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick's neutron.|$|E

Rajagopalachari found this [...] "stigma" [...] difficult to erase despite his vehement protests against the [...] "imposition" [...] of Hindi during the Madras Anti-Hindi agitations of 1965.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} factors that affect {{vocabulary}} acquisition during reading. Two purposes guide this article: reviewing the literature that investigated the incidental <b>vocabulary</b> acquisition <b>through</b> reading and exploring what factors affects vocabulary acquisition. With these purposes, the literature and three themes were identified: 1) nature of vocabulary development, 2) definition of incidental vocabulary acquisition, and 3) factors in <b>vocabulary</b> acquisition <b>through</b> reading. This literature review revealed that several factors in reading significantly contribute to vocabulary acquisition. Specifically, repetition, explanation, and L 1 translation support more effective vocabulary acquisition. Dictionary use and marginal glosses help a learner better grasp word meaning. Additional visual input and oral input presented with the target words positively affect gain and retention of words. A learner can differently learn and acquire words due to personal variables such {{as the level of}} text comprehension, motivation, and L 2 proficiency. Finally, a model of <b>vocabulary</b> acquisition <b>through</b> reading, which the author develops based on the factors above, is suggested.

40|$|Considering {{previous}} studies {{of the impact of}} vocabulary preparation before listening comprehension, this research investigated the impact of oral and written pushed output as two types of vocabulary preparation on listening comprehension, active and passive vocabulary learning, and vocabulary learning strategy use. Forty-one female adult Iranian EFL students at intermediate level participated in this study. As a treatment, they received two lists of new words which were learned separately through oral and written pushed output. This was followed by tests of active and passive vocabulary and listening comprehension. They also completed a vocabulary learning questionnaire before and after the treatment to detect any changes due to the treatment. We reached three pairs of scores for each participant including two active and two passive vocabulary test scores and two listening test scores for words treated through oral and written pushed output, separately. Statistical analyses indicated that <b>vocabulary</b> learning <b>through</b> oral pushed output was more effective in promoting listening comprehension and active vocabulary learning than <b>vocabulary</b> learning <b>through</b> written pushed output. Generally, <b>vocabulary</b> leaning <b>through</b> pushed output had a positive significant effect on vocabulary leaning strategy use.

40|$|Nowadays, {{learning}} English is a {{need for}} it is an International language spoken in almost all over the world. In Indonesia, English has been taught as one of the school subjects to endue the students with the foreign language competence. Unfortunately, in acquiring a second language, English, the learners may have some problems. Without leaving the other components of language aside, the learners find that memorizing the vocabulary is the main problem while they are learning the language. The traditional method of presenting lists of unrelated words cannot be denied as an excessively tedious, wasteful, and generally ineffective method. Conversely, Cross has stated that whatever the mode of presentation try to link all the new words in some ways and fitting new words in a network based on the Semantic ground or by the topic is very useful as well. To conflate Cross' statement and the traditional method, the writer conducts one-case study experiment to the students of Eddy's English Course Jember by teaching <b>vocabulary</b> meaningfully <b>through</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> Network. She has an assumption that it can enlarge the students' vocabulary as represented by their final scores in the post-test. The students scores in the post-test (79. 66) are higher than the scores in the pre-test (65. 33). It means that teaching vocabulary to the students of Eddy's English Course Jember <b>through</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> Network significantly enlarges their vocabulary. The writer comes to conclusion that teaching <b>vocabulary</b> meaningfully <b>through</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> Network can help the students to enlarge their vocabulary. This study, hopefully, should be continued by other researchers. It is suggested that the researchers use two different classes to compare this technique with other techniques of teaching vocabulary to get more conclusive results...|$|R
