It supported important elements of the hypothesised structure, although four of the proposed paths failed to reach significance and the fit was enhanced by adding a path. The final model indicated that casual workers reported more <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> which were relatively weakly associated with greater dissatisfaction with hours. The interaction of schedule control and variability of hours also predicted dissatisfaction with hours.

40|$|AbstractAlong {{with the}} amount of time spent {{learning}} (or time-on-task), the quality of learning time has a real influence on learning performance. Quality of time in online learning depends on students’ time availability and their willingness to devote quality cognitive time to learning activities. However, the quantity and quality of the time spent by adult e-learners on learning activities can be reduced by professional, family, and social commitments. Considering that the main time pattern followed by most adult e-learners is a professional one, it may be beneficial for online education programs to offer a certain degree of flexibility in instructional time that might allow adult learners to adjust their learning times to their professional constraints. However, using the time left over once professional and family requirements have been fulfilled could lead to a reduction in quality time for learning. This paper starts by introducing the concept of quality of learning time from an online student-centred perspective.

But the expected win-win-situation, often conjured by the employers, does not appear automatically. The ability for employees to vary their start and finish times does not lead per se to working-time sovereignty. In this thesis the operational use of self-controlled <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> distribution and their effect - from the employees' perspective - is analysed {{on the basis of the}} data of a representative questioning of German employees (in 2003). It turned out that enterprises permit a self controlled variable distribution of working time, when the employees themselves are able to adjust their effort more efficiently than a hierarchical or technical control would do. Concerning the effect of the self-control from the employees' perspective the following questions are analysed empirically:- Under which work-organisational and activity-specific conditions thepromise of working-time sovereignty is made good for the employees?- What is the effect of the self-control on the factual duration anddistribution of working hours?- Can the self-control of the working hours help to reduce the stressresulting from the work demands?- What is the effect of the self-control on work-life balance...|$|E

The aim of the programmes was to initiate and motivate a process of change within the driver, which {{in the long term}} should lead to permanent and sound health habits. One programme was based on health profile assessment and the other was a health examination. METHODS: Altogether, 102 subjects were investigated (51 allocated to an intervention group and 51 to a reference group). The programme in the intervention group (health profile assessment) was based on revelatory communication, adjusted to the driver and contained individual and group activities. The reference group went through a health examination. In both groups blood pressure, serum lipid concentrations, body mass index, and estimated maximal oxygen uptake were measured and the lifestyle habits were surveyed by questionnaires at the start and at follow ups of 6 and 18 months. RESULTS: The results showed that in the intervention group the maximal oxygen uptake increased, as did exercise habits and the intention to practice good dietary habits. <b>Variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> was the most common obstacle to change a health habit.

Today s workplaces are marked by high flexibility, great job instability and <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> A dual-earner family has replaced the traditional male-breadwinner family and the norm is two working adults. However, the pattern of women s involvement in employment differs in all labour markets depending on the gendered division of paid work, unpaid work and care obligations. These differences {{can be seen as}} the combined effect of the individual household strategies and the shape of family and labour market policies in the European welfare regimes. The article analyses household strategies in combining paid work, unpaid work and care in four European countries Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The main conclusion is that the division of paid work, unpaid work as well as caring obligations is gendered in all four countries. Compared with women, men tend to be more flexible, have more secure positions in the labour market and seem to be more involved in unpaid voluntary activities and seem thus more integrated in the society and have a higher level of civic participation. On the other hand, today, an increasing number of women are fully active in the labour market and their level of participation in civic activities becomes more and more similar to men s. However, the burdens of caring for children and other members of the household are still very unevenly divided between men and women, which makes the conflicts between obligations at work and in the households significantly more troublesome for women than for men. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{in most of}} the OECD {{countries}} employment relations have been changing and atypical forms of employment have been spreading rapidly. The “standard contract”, permanent and full-time, has lost importance, replaced by “flexible jobs”, such as fixed-term contracts, temporary work agency employment, <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> jobs, on call employment. A debate has been rising on whether atypical jobs, especially short-term contracts, might spur the development of a secondary labour market, in which the unemployed might get trapped in a cycle between dead-end jobs and unemployment. On the other hand, disadvantaged groups excluded from employment by too strict regulations might benefit most from the enhanced flexibility. Chapter 1 introduces this debate, Chapters 2 and 3 shed light on it. I analyse the labour market performance of workers who left unemployment through short-term jobs. I infer what counterfactual labour market performance would have been undertaken if the unemployed had rejected these jobs. In this way, it can be established whether short-term jobs may increase or decrease the chances of having a more stable career later in life, i. e. whether they are “stepping stones” or “dead ends”. I find evidence supporting the stepping stone hypothesis both in Italy and in Belgium. In terms of future job stability, even precarious and unsuccessful jobs are to be preferred to longer searches for directly finding better jobs. Chapter 4 is an identification analysis of the econometric models for duration data that encompass competing risks of exits, consecutive spells, and lagged duration dependence. Finally, Chapter 5 provides a new estimation strategy to look at the effect of past labour market experiences on two aspects of the subsequent job quality: wage and tenure on the job. The methodological novelty consists in jointly modelling labour market durations, transitions, and wages by way of a hazard-function based approach. (ECON 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E

Reports of these risks assessments were available and coded for subsequent statistical analyses. The prevalence of requirements met stated in the risk assessment reports were analyzed by use of percentage calculations and use of a generalized linear model. Of the eleven variables stated in the risks assessment only one showed a significant (P< 0, 01) improvement over time: radiation. Many variables, biological agents and hygiene in particular, showed a trend towards improvement, but non-significant.

It also examines whether the Belgian regulations on this subject are stricter than those in the other EU- 15 countries. For the Belgian working population, the usual working time averaged 37 hours per week in 2004, whereas in 1983 it was a little over 40 hours. There are wide variations within the EU- 15. Belgian working time is somewhat shorter than the average for the EU- 15, and that also applies to employees. The average working time ascertained for the various countries is influenced by the employment structure. After adjustments for that factor, the differences are definitely smaller, and working time in Belgium is roughly the same as the EU- 15 average. The decline in average working time and the increased dispersion which have emerged over the years are inevitably connected with the growing use of part-time working and other alternative forms of employment such as temporary work, employment during non-standard hours, overtime working, <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and home working. In many cases this satisfies a genuine preference on the part of the persons concerned, e. g. those seeking a better balance between work and family life. However, since these forms of employment are more common among risk groups such as women, older workers, the young and the low-skilled, there is a danger of further segmentation of the labour market.

We discuss a time series comparison of local concentrations and fluxes of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) from winter 2009 compared to spring 2013. Median concentrations over the four-year period fell between 20 to 34 percent, comparable to long-term VOC reduction trends observed in other major metropolitan areas. Emissions of these species fell accordingly with median flux reductions of 25 to 54 percent. For emissions inventory validation purposes, traffic counts were taken along major commuter roads surrounding the tower. We observed a strong correlation between selected vehicle exhaust VOC fluxes and traffic counts except during <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> To assign measured fluxes to local sources, we tested a bulk flux footprint model (Kormann and Meixner model) designed for uniform emission surface areas in this urban, heterogeneous landscape.

Four out of six tracer releases matched the fluxes measured at the GC within the given levels of uncertainty for the footprint model and the REA GC-FID system. There were reasonable causes of error for the two releases that did not match. The footprint model was also tested using a known n-pentane emissions source approximately one mile SSE of the tower.

40|$|Objetivo Identificar la prevalencia de síntomas osteomusculares, por segmentos y los factores de riesgo asociados, en los trabajadores de una empresa de Geomática, en Colombia en el año 2014. Metodología Se llevó a cabo un estudio descriptivo de corte {{transversal}} con una población de 169 trabajadores, distribuidos en 2 grupos, el grupo de campo que desarrolla actividades de topografía y el grupo de oficina donde se realizan procesamiento de datos en Geomática y actividades administrativas. A cada trabajador se le aplicó el cuestionario ERGOPAR que interroga la exposición o factores de riesgo y la presencia de síntomas osteomusculares. Resultados: El personal de oficina presenta mayor frecuencia de síntomas osteomusculares en el cuello 72 %, la región lumbar 55 %, los codos 17, 7 %, las manos y muñecas 57. 3 %. Presentándose con mayor frecuencia en las mujeres los síntomas en cuello 80 % y manos 64 %, mientras que los mayores porcentajes en personal de campo se presentan en las piernas 21 %, las rodillas 26 % y pies 11, 5 %. Se encontró asociación significativa entre la sedestación durante más de cuatro horas, con dolor en cuello (p= 0. 02) y dolor en región lumbar (p= 0. 03); inclinar el cuello hacia delante durante más de cuatro horas, con dolor en el cuello (p= 0. 006); repetir cada pocos segundos la flexión de muñecas (p= 001) y utilizar los dedos de manera intensiva por más de 4 horas (p= 0. 01) con dolor en manos y las variables jornada laboral y puesto de trabajo con dolor en pies. Conclusiones La prevalencia de síntomas osteomusculares en los trabajadores de la empresa estudiada es alta. Dado que se encontró asociación significativa con las variables sociodemográficas y laborales. La alta prevalencia de sintomatología {{puede ser}} explicada por la exposición a carga física laboral, por posturas de trabajo, por movimientos repetitivos y características propias de género. Target: To identify {{the prevalence of}} muskuloskeletal symptoms by segments and the associate risk factors, into the workers of a Geomatics company, in Colombia in the year 2014. Methodology: A descriptivwe cross-sectional study took place, {{with a population of}} 169 workers, divided into two groups. The field group wich carries out tophography activities, and the office group where data processing is performed in Geomatics and administrative activities. To each one of the workers it was applied the “Ergopar Questionnaire”, which asks about the exposure to risk factors and also about the presence of musculoskeletal symptoms. Results: The “office staff” has higher frequency of symptoms of musculoskeletal symptoms in the neck, with 72 %, in the lumbar region 55 %, in the elbows 17. 7 %, the hands and the wrists 57. 3 %. Appearing more often the symptoms in women with an 80 % in the neck, and in the hands with 64 %. While the highest percentages in “field staff”, are presented in the legs in 21 %, in the knees 26 %, and feet 11. 5 %. A significant association was found among the sitting position for more than four hours, with neck pain (p= 0. 02) and lumbar region pain(p= 003). Tilt your neck forward for more than four hours with neck pain (p= 0. 006), repeat every few seconds the bending of wrists (p= 001) and use the fingers intensively for more than four hours (p= 0, 01) with pain in your hands and <b>variable</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and job station with feet pain. Conclusions: The prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the staff of the workers in the company tested is high, since significant association with socio demographic and labor variables was found.

40|$|Purpose To {{examine the}} {{determinants}} of church attendance {{and the formation of}} ‘religious human capital’ using a Becker-inspired allocation-of-time framework. Design/methodology/approach Data derived from three waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey were used to estimate a reduced form two-equation system where the endogenous variables were frequency of attendance at religious services and intensity of faith. Findings Our results indicate that while the hourly wage rate accounts for some of the variation in our attendance and faith regressions (i. e., higher wages lead to lower levels of attendance and faith), ‘allocation of time’ <b>variables</b> like <b>working</b> long <b>hours</b> also influence these dimensions. Our findings also suggest that the decision to attend or not or to have any faith at all is generally independent from economic factors. However, once the decision to attend or to have faith is made, an individual’s wage influences the degree of attendance or faith to a significant level. Originality/value Our study contributes to this embryonic body of empirical literature by providing – {{to the best of our}} knowledge – the first results for Australia...|$|R

40|$|When {{they are}} asked about their {{satisfaction}} with respect to various domains (job, financial situation, and so on) individuals give responses which may be misinterpreted because they both report their situation and their judgment about it. Although satisfaction is generally correlated with objective characteristics of the individuals situation the correlation may be spurious due to personality traits {{that are likely to}} influence expressed satisfaction. We argue that despite their hybrid nature, satisfaction variables may be informative. When they are used jointly with objective data, these variables allow to infer or estimate distributions of other variables, which are unobserved or cannot be easily measured. But this is valid on the condition that we are able to control for personality traits. To show that we take the example of satisfaction with respect to <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> We rely on a very simple model to prove that preferences about working time may theoretically be inferred from expressed satisfaction provided that we observe the employees actual <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> The model allows us to identify the problems posed by the specific nature of satisfaction variables {{in order to deal with}} them adequately when empirically estimating the model. We use the 8 waves of the French part of the European Household Panel and estimate the mean value of the employees preferred <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> We show that empirical models that ignore the specificity of satisfaction variables, generate strongly biased estimates. satisfaction <b>variables,</b> <b>working</b> time...|$|R

Empirical analysis based on a sample of employed women in the Dutch Socio- Economic Panel (1987 - 1989) shows, however, that the flexibility of <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> within jobs is low.
