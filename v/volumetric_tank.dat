40|$|Background: The {{empirical}} {{evidence for the}} use of RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) has been questioned regarding its   clinical effectiveness. The component of RICE that has the least literature regarding its effectiveness is elevation. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if various positions of elevation result in volumetric changes of the lower extremity. Methodology: A randomized crossover design was used to determine the effects of the four following conditions on volumetric changes of the lower extremity: seated at the end of a table (seated), lying supine (flat), lying supine with the foot elevated 12 inches off the table (elevated), and lying prone with the knees bent to 90 degrees (prone). The conditions were randomized using a Latin Square. Each subject completed all conditions with at least 24 hours between each session. Pre and post volumetric measurements were taken using a <b>volumetric</b> <b>tank.</b> The subject was placed in one of the four described testing positions for 30 minutes. The change in weight of the displaced water was the main outcome measure. The data was analyzed using an ANOVA of the pre and post measurements with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis. The level of significance was set at P<. 05 for all analyses. Results: The only statistically significant difference was between the gravity dependent position (seated) and all other positions (p <. 001). There was no significant difference between lying supine (flat), on a bolster (elevated), or prone with the knees flexed to 90 degrees (prone). Conclusions: From these results, the extent of elevation does not appear to have an effect on changes in low leg volume. Elevation above the heart did not significantly improve reduction in limb volume, but removing the limb from a gravity dependent position might be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Inadequate venous {{drainage}} during {{minimally invasive}} cardiac surgery becomes most evident when the blood {{trapped in the}} pulmonary circulation floods the surgical field. The present {{study was designed to}} assess the in vivo performance of new, thinner, virtually wall-less, venous cannulas designed for augmented venous drainage in comparison to traditional thin-wall cannulas. METHODS: Remote cannulation was realized in 5 bovine experiments (74. 0 ± 2. 4 kg) with percutaneous venous access over the wire, serial dilation up to 18 F and insertion of either traditional 19 F thin wall, wire-wound cannulas, or through the same access channel, new, thinner, virtually wall-less, braided cannulas designed for augmented venous drainage. A standard minimal extracorporeal circuit set with a centrifugal pump and a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator, but no in-line reservoir was used. One hundred fifty pairs of pump-flow and required pump inlet pressure values were recorded with calibrated pressure transducers and a flowmeter calibrated by a <b>volumetric</b> <b>tank</b> and timer at increasing pump speed from 1500 RPM to 3500 RPM (500 -RPM increments). RESULTS: Pump flow accounted for 1. 73 ± 0. 85 l/min for wall-less versus 1. 17 ± 0. 45 l/min for thin wall at 1500 RPM, 3. 91 ± 0. 86 versus 3. 23 ± 0. 66 at 2500 RPM, 5. 82 ± 1. 05 versus 4. 96 ± 0. 81 at 3500 RPM. Pump inlet pressure accounted for 9. 6 ± 9. 7 mm Hg versus 4. 2 ± 18. 8 mm Hg for 1500 RPM, - 42. 4 ± 26. 7 versus - 123 ± 51. 1 at 2500 RPM, and - 126. 7 ± 55. 3 versus - 313 ± 116. 7 for 3500 RPM. CONCLUSIONS: At the well-accepted pump inlet pressure of - 80 mm Hg, the new, thinner, virtually wall-less, braided cannulas provide unmatched venous drainage in vivo. Early clinical analyses have confirmed these findings...|$|E
40|$|Cet article présente un débitmètre à {{ultrasons}} conçu en tant que capteur intelligent pour la mesure des écoulements en surface libre ou en conduites fermées. Ce type de débitmètre peut être utilisé pour des applications industrielles ou de gestion de l’eau. Il répond à la forte demande des autorités de supervision des ressources en eau dans les régions semi-arides d’agriculture irriguée. Un état de l’art et les principes généraux des mesures de débits de liquide par ultrasons sont donnés. Le débitmètre original proposé utilise le principe de la mesure des délais entre les impulsions envoyées vers l’amont et vers l’aval dans le fluide. L’approche repose sur la mesure de la différence du temps de transit des ondes acoustiques sur une ou plusieurs cordes de mesure, réparties sur un intervalle suffisant, de manière à assurer la précision requise. Cette méthode permet une véritable intégration du profil des vitesses, ce qui assure une meilleure précision. La vitesse du son dans le fluide est éliminée des calculs grâce à l’utilisation des temps de transmission réciproques. Les calculs de débit sont assurés par un micro-contrôleur. Les calculs théoriques et les technologies proposées ont donné lieu à la réalisation d’un prototype expérimental. Une première application de ce débitmètre à ultrason est réalisée en laboratoire en conduite fermée dans une installation d’essai comportant une seule paire de transducteurs à ultrason. Une seconde application expérimentale est menée sur un banc d’essai comprenant un canal artificiel de forme trapézoïdale de dimensions géométriques bien déterminées avec une pente variable. Ces tests ont permis de vérifier la précision de l’appareil et de valider les techniques et les principes {{mis en oeuvre}} dans la conception du débitmètre. Measuring {{fluid flow}} {{is one of the}} most important measurements in the industrial fields of process control and water management. In fact, it may well be the most frequently measured process variable. Other measurements are water temperature, pressure and level. There are two types of ultrasonic flow meters used for discharge measurement: the Transit Time and Doppler flow meters. The first type is widely applied to fluid flows in pipes and open channels and is sensitive to suspended solids or air bubbles in the fluid. The second type is more popular and less expensive, but is not considered as accurate as the transit time flow meter. In this work, the Transit Time flow meter is discussed and applied, for the first time, to discharge measurements in pressurized conduits in a laboratory setting, and to open channel irrigation. We used the Transit Time method, which is based on the dependence of the velocity of an ultrasonic signal in a given medium on the velocity at which this medium is itself flowing. Therefore, pressure disturbances of small magnitude are propagated through a fluid at velocity that is the sound velocity relative to the fluid. If the fluid also has a velocity, the absolute velocity of the pressure disturbance propagation is the algebraic sum of the two. This ultrasonic method uses measurements of the transit time of high frequency energy pulses between one or more pairs of transducers to determine the flow rate of the liquid. The relationship between the measured transit time of an ultrasonic pulse and the average velocity along the pulse path is well described in this paper. This paper presents the state of the art of the general principle of liquid flow measurements by ultrasonic methods and the problems associated with such measurements. Using the ultrasonic transit time approach, we designed an ultrasonic flow meter according to a smart sensors concept, for the measurement of irrigation water flowing through pipelines or open channels. The new flow meter works on the principle of measuring time delay differences between sound pulses transmitted upstream and downstream in the flowing liquid. The speed of sound in the flowing medium is eliminated as a variable because the flow rate calculations are based on the reciprocals of the transmission times. The transit time difference is digitally measured by means of suitable microprocessor controlled logic. We initially carried out experimental tests in closed conduits. The installation consisted of three tanks (storage tank, <b>volumetric</b> <b>tank</b> or etalon tank, and supply tank), a pipeline with the primary intelligent flow meter devices being tested, an ultrasonic level-meter and a volumetric flow meter for calibration. The secondary devices included a pump, valves for controlling the apparatus and a level gauge. This apparatus enabled the calibration of flow meters for various volumetric flows. The data can be gathered with a fixed sampling time and are stored and/or transmitted to the computer system, which enables not only data storage, but also the calculation of the time of measurement at a specified level of accuracy and volumetric flow rate. The laboratory experiment was carried out to facilitate hydraulic studies with a flow rate ranging from 1. 25  L/s to 50  L/s. The steel pipeline had a diameter of 100  mm. The flow rate is calculated and the characteristics of calibrated flow meter are plotted. The report from each measurement is shown on the monitor and may be printed. The flow meter is connected to a straight section of pipe that is run at least 15  pipe diameters upstream of the sensor without obstructions, and a minimum of 10  pipes diameters downstream without obstructions (locating a flow meter too close to a flow disturbance may cause a systematic error). In addition to laboratory tests, the flow meter has also been evaluated in open channels. Open channel flow is defined as flow in any channel where the liquid flows on a free surface, is not under pressure, gravity is the only force causing the flow and a continuous and progressive decline in water surface elevation occurs as the flow moves downstream. Examples of open channel flows are rivers, streams, creeks, and other uncovered conduits. Open channel flow measurement is used in many applications: water supply networks, allocation of water for irrigation and agriculture, sewage treatment plants, etc. The discharge measurements in open channels may be computed by means of a rating curve, which is used to convert records of water level readings into flow rates. Because many phenomena can cause the rating curve to change, it must be checked periodically. In this context, the ultrasonic transit time technique is extremely useful in water management. By means of this technique, the flow rate is determined using single and multipath configurations. However, special attention must be paid to define the vertical velocity distribution and the suitable integration method. The experiment was conducted in liquid (water) using a single path with two transducers (i. e., the velocity profile is sampled along a single line only), and a double path with four transducers; the liquid velocity was varied from 0. 075  m/s to 2. 4  m/s. The channel has a trapezoidal form (length: 4. 2  m, width: 0. 45  m, depth varying from 0. 05 to 0. 38  m) with channel slopes manually adjusted from 0. 001 to 0. 02, so as to produce variable flows. In conclusion, the ultrasonic flow meters have the potential to significantly reduce the installation and operating costs of meter stations while providing accuracy levels consistent with, or better than, other traditional metering methods (vortex shedding, differential pressure, orifices, nozzles and venturi meters, Pitot-static-flow meters, magnetic flux, etc.). There may also be a substantial reduction in maintenance cost as the device utilizes digital measurement techniques and provides a wealth of diagnostic information on the status of the electronic measurement system. The suggested ultrasonic flow meter designed according to a smart sensor concept constitutes a necessary link for the optimal water resources management of an irrigation system. It can be used with confidence and offers an economical and accurate means of measuring the flow of water in open channels. Typical uncertainties are of the order of 2 % for single path and 1 % for two paths and are attainable with careful application. In closed conduits, the results of the experiments demonstrate the validity and the performance of the laboratory ultrasonic flow meters. The application of the flow meters under favourable conditions produces a relative error that does not exceed 1 %. This preliminary result shows the usefulness of these ultrasonic flow meters. Further investigations, however, are still needed in order to determine the overall performances of this instrument in terms of repeatability, linearity, reliability, and response time...|$|E
30|$|Material balance {{analysis}} {{is considered a}} powerful engineering tool when dealing with oil and gas reservoirs. In gas reservoirs which can be represented by simple <b>volumetric</b> <b>tanks,</b> a straight line relationship between (P/Z) and cumulative gas production exists. However, many gas reservoirs do not follow these simple assumptions. Therefore, several modifications have been presented to handle commingled gas reservoirs (Fetkovich et al. 1990; El-Banbi and Wattenbarger 1996, 1997; Juell and Whitson 2011) and compartmentalized gas reservoirs (Hower and Collins 1989; Lord and Collins 1989, 1992; Payne 1996; Hagoort and Hoogstra 1997; Sallam 2016). Although the complications related to either commingled gas reservoirs or compartmentalized gas reservoirs have been addressed, either model alone cannot be applied when both conditions coexist.|$|R
40|$|Within the CLASH project, wave {{overtopping}} at {{the vertical}} seawall at Samphire Hoe {{was measured by}} HR Wallingford (HRW). and compared laboratory tests in 2 & 3 dimensions carried out at the University of Edinburgh and HRW. At Samphire Hoe, overtopping volumes were captured in three <b>volumetric</b> <b>tanks</b> capable of measuring wave-by-wave and total overtopping volumes. The three tanks were placed progressively farther back from the seawall edge so that the spatial distribution of the overtopping discharges could be determined. The field measurement equipment was successfully deployed on three occasions, and measured overtopping discharges ranged from that barely considered to be hazardous to the public to over q= 3. 0 1 /s/m. The 2 d testing at Edinburgh was modelled at a scale of 1 : 40, and the 3 d model at HRW was modelled at 1 : 20. For both sets of laboratory tests, a range of conditions, representative of the storm wave conditions and water levels, was reproduced {{in addition to a}} set of parametric conditions. The storm conditions allowed a direct comparison between the field and laboratory measurements, and the parametric conditions were used to test the generic overtopping behaviour of the structure. For both sets of laboratory tests, mean overtopping discharges and the spatial distribution were measured separately. Analysis of the distribution data relates the proportion of the discharge that has landed as a function of (x/L-o) : where x is the distance behind the crest, and L-o is the offshore wavelength. Analysis of the field, 2 d & 3 d laboratory data, and empirical prediction methods have not identified any scale effects for overtopping discharges at vertical and near-vertical seawalls.

40|$|A new four-chamber {{piston pump}} design has been {{fabricated}} and tested. The small-scale propellant pump {{is intended to}} be powered by gas at elevated temperatures, e. g. in a gas-generator cycle rocket propulsion system. Two key features are combined for the first time: leak-tight liquid-cooled seals, and a high throughput per unit hardware mass. Measured performance curves quantify flows, pressures, leakage, <b>volumetric</b> efficiency, and <b>tank</b> pressure requirements. A pair of 300 -gram pumps operating with significant margin could deliver fuel and oxidizer at 5 MPa to a compact lightweight 1000 -N engine, while tank pressure remains at 0. 35 MPa. Pump weight is well below one percent of thrust, as is typical for launch vehicle engines. Applications include small upper stages, aggressive maneuvers in space, and miniature launch vehicles for Mars ascent...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} a {{solar thermal heating}} system consisting of evacuated tube collectors used for combined space heating and heating of domestic hot water. The investigated system belongs {{to one of the}} passive house dwellings of Løvåshagen housing cooperative, located in Bergen, Norway. Since the beginning of its operation in 2008, preliminary measurements suggest that the solar collectors are not performing as well as initially intended. The objective of this thesis was to determine potential faults and weaknesses, concerning both the design and the operation of the system, and to contribute to increased solar utilization. For this purpose, the functioning and performance of the investigated system was studied. This was achieved by collecting and processing measured data that was available in relation to an ongoing study. In addition, a simulation model of the investigated system was created in Polysun. By comparing simulated results with measured results, an outline of the present system performance was established. Furthermore, a parametric study was performed on the simulation model, in which the influence of various design- and operation parameters on system performance was examined. The investigated parameters included collector area, inclination angle and orientation angle of the collector, tank size, insulation of pipes and <b>tank,</b> <b>volumetric</b> flow rate, as well as parameters related to the control of the system and the extent of shading. This examination provided a basis for suggesting several improved scenarios that each targeted different components. By combining these scenarios in different ways, the best possible system configuration could be obtained. It was found that the examined system is far from achieving its initial design goals of an annual solar fraction of 47 %. In 2014, the measured solar fraction was only 10, 8 %, whereas the corresponding simulated solar fraction was 14, 3 %. With the current design and operation, the monthly energy savings are minimal - even during the high-radiation periods -, thus the benefit of having solar collectors installed on the roof seems questionable. However, the results from the parametric study revealed that by correcting and improving certain design and operation parameters of the investigated system, a simulated solar fraction of almost 43 % could be achieved. Even by making just a few alterations assumed to be easy and relatively inexpensive to implement, a simulated annual solar fraction of approximately 29 % was obtained. Other than shading caused by nearby collectors, the most essential parameters appear to be the those related to the control of the system, as well as tank design and switch-on temperature of the auxiliary heating element. It can be concluded that though the potential for increasing the solar utilization is considerable, any alterations must be evaluated according to additional costs. Moreover, the results demonstrate the importance of thorough research and mapping of the potential performance-reducing factors, already during the design phase. Shading by means of nearby collectors is an especially important aspect to consider. This can be achieved with the help of proper simulation tools that include a shading simulator. Lastly, once the system is installed, it is equally important to ensure proper monitoring and control of the functioning of the system...|$|R
