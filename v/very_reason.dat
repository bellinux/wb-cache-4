5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this <b>very</b> <b>reason.</b> The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E
5|$|The other iodine radioisotopes {{have much}} shorter half-lives, {{no longer than}} days. Some of them have medical {{applications}} involving the thyroid gland, where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated. Iodine-123 has a half-life of thirteen hours and decays by electron capture to tellurium-123, emitting gamma radiation; it is used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and X-ray computed tomography (X-Ray CT) scans. Iodine-125 has a half-life of fifty-nine days, decaying by electron capture to tellurium-125 and emitting low-energy gamma radiation; the second-longest-lived iodine radioisotope, it has uses in biological assays, nuclear medicine imaging and in radiation therapy as brachytherapy to treat a number of conditions, including prostate cancer, uveal melanomas, and brain tumours. Finally, iodine-131, with a half-life of eight days, beta decays to an excited state of stable xenon-131 that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation. It is a common fission product and thus is present in high levels in radioactive fallout. It may then be absorbed through contaminated food, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure {{to high levels of}} iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and thyroiditis. The usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine-131 is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine-127 in the form of potassium iodide tablets, taken daily for optimal prophylaxis. However, iodine-131 may also be used for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy for this <b>very</b> <b>reason,</b> when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue. Iodine-131 is also used as a radioactive tracer.|$|E

25|$|The next vassal {{kingdom of}} Mali {{to break away}} was the {{province}} of Jolof. The Wolof inhabitants of this kingdom united under their own emperor and formed the Jolof Empire around 1360 during a succession crisis that followed the death of Mansa Suleyman.

25|$|In 230 BC, {{the state}} of Qin had {{defeated}} {{the state of}} Han. A Han aristocrat named Zhang Liang swore revenge on the Qin emperor. He sold all his valuables and in 218 BC, he hired a strongman assassin and built him a heavy metal cone weighing 120 jin (roughly 160lb or 97kg). The two men hid among the bushes along the emperor's route over a mountain. At a signal, the muscular assassin hurled the cone at the first carriage and shattered it. However, the emperor was actually in the second carriage, as he was travelling with two identical carriages for this <b>very</b> <b>reason.</b> Thus the attempt failed.

25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> that He is omnipotent.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{their success}} {{over the past}} two seasons, the Oilers were in trouble off the ice. Owner Peter Pocklington had {{explored}} moving the Oilers to Minnesota during the 1990s. In 1998, Pocklington almost made a deal to sell the team to Leslie Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) who would have moved the team to Houston, Texas. On March 14, 1998, hours before the deadline to keep the team in Edmonton, the Edmonton Investors Group agreed to pay $70 million to buy the club. The EIG were spearheaded by Cal Nichols, who had a commitment to retain NHL hockey in Edmonton. The deal was finalized, on May 5. and thus prevented them from being the third Canadian team to move in the 1990s and the fourth former WHA team to move in successive years (Quebec had moved in 1995, Winnipeg in 1996, and Hartford in 1997). The Oilers received support from the NHL for this <b>very</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E

The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it.

500|$|Reviews for Blue Dragon were {{somewhat}} mixed, though generally favorable. On the review aggregator GameRankings, the game {{had an average}} score of 77% based on 62 reviews. While many reviewers praised the game for its traditional approach, a few reviewers criticized it for that <b>very</b> <b>reason,</b> with one reviewer remarking, [...] "In fact, {{there is very little}} you can point to in Blue Dragon that hasn't been done multiple times over before". The story also came under scrutiny from some reviewers for being too generic and too similar to existing Japanese RPGs, with slow pacing during the beginning of the game. Eurogamer stated that the apparent lack of effort put into the facial animations for each character resulted in a limited ability to express emotion. They also noted that the mouth movements are well timed, but {{that the rest of the}} characters' facial movements are [...] "static".|$|E

500|$|For the cutscenes, the {{localization}} team {{took into}} account that the animation {{had been done to}} the Japanese lines, so they made sure that the English script matched the already set lip flaps and timing. Because the Japanese voice acting was not yet recorded when Hsu worked on the English dub script, she used her imagination to guess what the Japanese voice acting would be like based on the script; this was made easier due to her familiarity with [...] "standard anime conventions" [...] from frequently watching anime. For some dialogue, she wrote alternative lines, as the footage had not yet been finished, and the script could be interpreted in different ways: in one scene, where Phoenix speaks on the phone, Hsu had him follow the line [...] "It's for this <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> I returned" [...] with either [...] "Time to bring it to an end" [...] or [...] "To put an end to it all"; she used the former because of how there was a dramatic pause between the two lines.|$|E
500|$|Some notable American Christian thrash metal groups include Deliverance, Believer, Vengeance (frontman, vocalist {{and last}} {{remaining}} member Roger Martinez currently against Christianity) and Tourniquet. Allmusic states that Vengeance Rising's first two albums [...] "were huge successes {{in the world}} of Christian music, making them one of the few bands in the genre to cross over into the secular music scene." [...] Tourniquet was called [...] "arguably the greatest Christian metal band in history" [...] by Cross Rhythms in 1996. Tourniquet's Psycho Surgery was ranked as the second most influential Christian metal album of all time by HM Magazine. Deliverance's 1990 music video for the title track of Weapons of Our Warfare album received some airplay on MTV. Allmusic wrote about Believer's Sanity Obscure album: [...] "Before 1990, the Christian heavy metal genre rarely strayed from generic riffing and poor lyrics. Bands like Petra and Sacred Warrior never broke through to the mainstream for this <b>very</b> <b>reason.</b> With low expectations, Believer released this massive slab of molten metal. Although it never really became popular, several mainstream magazines praised the album." ...|$|E

I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all.

500|$|From October 1455, Devon and {{his sons}} were {{committing}} acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the administrative machinery of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local justices of the peace from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at Tiverton {{under the leadership of}} Devon's eldest son, Thomas Courtenay. It was this force that was to be guilty of what R. L. Storey has called [...] "the most notorious private crime of the century," [...] due not only to the violence involved but {{the fact that it was}} [...] "so obviously premeditated." [...] This force made its way to Upcott on 23 October 1455, the home of Nicholas Radford, a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been recorder of the city of Exeter and member of parliament. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon {{and his sons}} for the <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past; and in January 1455 he had enfeoffed Bonville (and others) for land valued at £400.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website describes the character as the [...] "powerful millionaire-tycoon {{with a secret}} agenda to take everything from his long-lost mother Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper)." [...] Nichols describes Tucker as [...] "a self-made success, a regular guy who can tend bar and shoot pool and talk shit with anybody. He's very unassuming in many ways." [...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I think the reason he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that <b>very</b> <b>reason.</b> He does not want to get close to anyone.

500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E
