5|$|His The Round of the Prisoners (1890) {{was painted}} after an {{engraving}} by Gustave Doré (1832–1883). Tralbaut {{suggests that the}} face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> Van Gogh himself; Jan Hulsker discounts this.|$|E
5|$|Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as {{binoculars}} {{may result}} in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.|$|E
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E
40|$|Electronic bid {{documents}} {{are available from}} a variety of sources. Historically, contractors have printed the electronic documents and then performed their takeoffs. Takeoff <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> now available that allow the contractor to perform their takeoffs directly from the electronic documents. Several software companies that produce takeoff <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> listed and features of takeoff <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> described. An example is provided on how takeoff <b>viewers</b> have <b>been</b> successfully used in an estimating course and student feedback is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Each monumental figure {{occupied}} a nine-by-five-foot canvas in a twelve-sided space, into which <b>viewers</b> <b>were</b> invited to enter. Above the eleven panels, which formed {{a circle around}} the <b>viewers,</b> <b>was</b> a circular abstract painted ceiling by Ilise Greenstein (1976). <b>Viewers</b> <b>were</b> invited to imagine and see themselves in the company of historically significant figures in developing a new way of looking at history, culture, and themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> {{between the ages}} of 14 and 34. The average age of <b>viewers</b> <b>is</b> 18 years, with the {{majority of}} the audience being older. About 76% of viewers belong to the middle to upper class. As well, the channel notes a large number of <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> university students. Moreover, according to a study conducted by TGI Latina in 2004, MTV Latin America’s audience is 57% male and 43% female.|$|R
5|$|Many astronomical {{alignments}} {{have been}} claimed for Stonehenge, {{a complex of}} megaliths and earthworks in the Salisbury Plain of England. The most famous {{of these is the}} midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E
50|$|The <b>viewers</b> <b>were</b> {{priced at}} 1/6d (around 7.5p in today’s terms). The 3D {{experience}} given by these <b>viewers</b> <b>was</b> astonishing {{for the time}} of which they were invented. Picture cards were supplied in booklets, each one had about 10 cards in them costing around 2/6d (12.5p today).|$|R
50|$|Twitter Question of the Day - Each day the <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> {{provided}} with a question based on the main topic of discussion of the show (for example, if a celebrity tells of their celeb crush, then the <b>viewers</b> will <b>be</b> asked to send in their celeb crushes), the viewers should also include #TrendingLive somewhere within their tweet. <b>Viewers</b> tweets <b>are</b> then selected to be read out at various points throughout the show. During Trending Live! You Select, <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> also asked to send in shout-outs and to follow the main @TrendingLive account.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the hinge}} {{of the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
5|$|The right panel (220 × 97.5cm, 87 × 38.4in) {{illustrates}} Hell, {{the setting}} {{of a number of}} Bosch paintings. Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent. Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling qualityrendered through cold colourisation and frozen waterwaysand presents a tableau that has shifted from the paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely detailed scene, the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities and differences between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could be human remains stand in their places.|$|E

25|$|Kelley {{structures}} his episodes {{with multiple}} storylines. An episode may include a self-contained subplot plus other story arcs that either {{began in a}} previous episode or will continue subsequently—some will continue the entire season. The <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> thereby rarely sure whether what appears as a simple incident will blossom into a major plot point.|$|E
25|$|The Nritta {{performance}} is abstract, fast and rhythmic {{aspect of the}} dance. The <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> presented with pure movement in Nritta, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.|$|E
5000|$|Tim Reid and Daphne Maxwell Reid {{acted as}} hosts {{during the first}} season, {{introducing}} each pilot. <b>Viewers</b> <b>were</b> also encouraged to call a 1-800 number {{at the end of}} each episode, to voice their preference. However, the [...] "winning" [...] pilot chosen by the <b>viewers</b> <b>was</b> never picked up as a series.|$|R

5000|$|Heavy <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> {{individuals}} who watch {{at least four}} hours of television a day, [...] however Nielsen notes that heavy <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> now defined as those that watch more than 11 hours of television a day. Heavy <b>viewers</b> <b>are</b> consistently characterized as being more susceptible to the images and messages on television. They also rely on television more to cultivate {{their perceptions of the}} real world. In a recent study done on the cultivation effects of reality television, an Indiana University study found that young girls who regularly watched the MTV hit Teen Mom had an unrealistic view of teen pregnancy.|$|R
25|$|BBC World News is, for {{the most}} part, the same channel all over the world; the {{commercials}} are intended {{to be the only}} differences. However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, a number of programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as Indian feeds, and The Record Europe, which is only broadcast in Europe. Also, the weather focuses more on the area the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> watching from.|$|E
25|$|Trey Parker and Matt Stone both professed {{their love}} of the episode, but {{said that it is}} a {{polarizing}} one for the audience, claiming that if a <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> not on board with the episode's toilet humor, then the whole episode breaks down for them. The creators claimed that young people and women reacted poorly to the episode. Parker said that his father, who is the basis for Randy's character, was very thrilled by the episode.|$|E
25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that I {{was told that the}} cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened as far as the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E

25|$|The second Revelation {{that the}} Poor Man's Bible seeks {{to share with}} the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> the revelation of God's plan for humanity's Salvation through sending his son, Jesus, to be born as a human baby, to live among people and to die a cruel death to absolve the sins {{committed}} by humanity. Jesus, as depicted on the walls, domes and windows of churches, is the Revelation of God's love, his grace, his mercy and his glory. This, broadly speaking, is the theme of every Poor Man's Bible.|$|E
25|$|As {{observed}} {{from the}} Earth, a solar eclipse {{occurs when the}} Moon passes {{in front of the}} Sun. The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon's shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> inside the penumbra.|$|E
25|$|Symbols {{of death}} abound in The Wind Will Carry Us, with the scenery of the graveyard, the imminence {{of the old}} woman's passing, and the {{ancestors}} referred to early in the film by the character Farzad. Such devices prompt the viewer {{to reflect on the}} parameters of the afterlife and immaterial existence. The <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to it after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions, rather than answers them.|$|E
