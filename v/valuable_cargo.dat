5|$|Houston offered Bowie a {{commission}} {{as an officer}} on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining {{that he wanted to}} be in the midst of the fighting. Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin. He distinguished himself again in the Grass Fight on November 26. Cós had sent approximately 187men to cut grass for his horses. As they returned to San Antonio, Bowie took 60mounted men to intercept the party, which they believed carried <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo.</b> The Mexican troops quickened their pace in the hopes of reaching the safety of the city, but Bowie and his cavalry chased them. At the end of the fight, the Texians had two wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules.|$|E
5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 13 January 1798, Sybille and Fox arrived in Manila Bay, slipping unchallenged past the fortress of Corregidor and then sailing across the bay {{on the morning of}} 14 January, anchoring between Manila and Cavite. From his vantage point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in Cavite, the ships of the line San Pedro, Europa and Montañés and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa in dock and unfit for action. To Cooke's disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon, Marquesetta being unloaded at the Cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour. The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward Pakenham was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo</b> from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{campaign}} against the Dutch squadron in the East Indies allowed British forces in the Indian Ocean to focus exclusively on the French islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France, which proved very difficult to subdue during the ensuing Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811. Freedom of movement for British forces in the East Indies proved invaluable however: on 27 January 1807, Peter Rainier in Caroline had seized a Spanish ship San Raphael carrying over half a million Spanish dollars and an exceptionally <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo,</b> {{and the ability of}} British commerce raiders to act against French, Spanish and Dutch merchant shipping in the region was assured. When Pellew's successor Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury attempted to eliminate the Dutch East Indies islands in a series of large scale invasions during 1810 and 1811, British naval movements were completely unopposed, allowing a rapid and successful conclusion to the war in the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries were years of {{lawlessness}} on Lundy, {{particularly during the}} ownership of Thomas Benson (1708-1772), a Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1747 and Sheriff of Devon, who notoriously used the island for housing convicts whom {{he was supposed to}} be deporting. Benson leased Lundy from its owner, John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower (1694–1754) (who was an heir of the Grenville family of Bideford and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall), at a rent of £60 per annum and contracted with the Government to transport a shipload of convicts to Virginia, but diverted the ship to Lundy to use the convicts as his personal slaves. Later Benson was involved in an insurance swindle. He purchased and insured the ship Nightingale and loaded it with a <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo</b> of pewter and linen. Having cleared the port on the mainland, the ship put into Lundy, where the cargo was removed and stored in a cave built by the convicts, before setting sail again. Some days afterwards, when a homeward-bound vessel was sighted, the Nightingale was set on fire and scuttled. The crew were taken off the stricken ship by the other ship, which landed them safely at Clovelly.|$|E

50|$|The Marquis of Nesmond then {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a formidable raider, capturing many ships and their <b>valuable</b> <b>cargos.</b> In the Battle of Lagos (1693) he captured two Dutch warships and several merchant ships from the Smyrna Convoy.|$|R
25|$|The railroads' prosperous {{operations}} of the 1850s, hauling passengers as well as <b>valuable</b> <b>cargos</b> of cotton, tobacco and produce from the Piedmont to the tidewater port of Portsmouth, were interrupted by the Civil War, during which bridges and tracks of both railroads were destroyed at various times by Union or Confederate troops.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the many}} trading voyages that {{departed}} from Pulicat, in 1658 the Dutch trading ship Avondster (captured as the Blessing from the British in 1653 and renamed) transported money and <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo</b> from Pulicat to Bengal.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{the most}} <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo</b> of a sunken {{shipwreck}} was identified near {{the western edge}} of the Celtic Sea. This World War II era sinking of the SS Gairsoppa led to a treasure almost three miles deep.|$|E

5000|$|Duyfken ( [...] ; Little Dove), also spelled Duifken or Duijfken, was a {{small ship}} built in the Dutch Republic.

60|$|This was {{not only}} fortunate, as affording an {{opportunity}} for the Norsemen to procure full and <b>valuable</b> <b>cargoes</b> for both their ships, but as creating a busy and interesting occupation, which would prevent the natives from growing weary of inaction, and, perhaps, falling into those forms of mischief which proverbially lie ready to idle hands.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the war Andes carried cargo {{as well as}} troops. To the UK {{she brought}} cotton from Suez, bacon from Canada, beef and pork from New York and oranges and copper from South Africa.

25|$|After sacking the island, Turgut Reis headed towards Capo Passero in Sicily, {{where he}} {{captured}} the galley of Giulio Cicala, son of Duke Vincenzo Cicala.

He later sailed to Calabria, forcing the local population to flee towards the safety of the mountains. From there he went to Corsica and captured a number of ships.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{construction}} the Albert Dock was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for <b>valuable</b> <b>cargoes</b> such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a <b>valuable</b> store for <b>cargo.</b>|$|R
25|$|Factors {{contributing}} to piracy during the Golden Age included {{the rise in}} quantities of <b>valuable</b> <b>cargoes</b> being shipped to Europe over vast ocean areas, reduced European navies in certain regions, the training and experience that many sailors had gained in European navies (particularly the Royal Navy), and ineffective government in European overseas colonies. The colonial powers at the time constantly fought with pirates and engaged in several notable battles and other related events.|$|R
50|$|Zeffiro and Ostro both reached Benghazi {{the next}} day and arrived at Tobruk shortly after. Two-thirds of the convoy had been saved. The smaller Pilo and Missori also arrived safely with their <b>valuable</b> <b>cargoes.</b> Conversely, the massive {{expenditure}} of shells by the British cruisers exacerbated a shortage of ammunition at Alexandria so that the planned Malta convoys were postponed for two weeks. The British cruisers had fired nearly 5,000 rounds at the Italian destroyers.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the modern}} {{manufacturing}} process is unknown to them, members, leaders, and prophets of the cults {{maintain that the}} manufactured goods of the non-native culture have been created by spiritual means, such as through their deities and ancestors. These goods are intended for the local indigenous people, but the foreigners have unfairly gained control of these objects through malice or mistake. Thus, a characteristic feature of cargo cults {{is the belief that}} spiritual agents will, at some future time, give much <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo</b> and desirable manufactured products to the cult members.|$|E
25|$|Telegraph {{returned}} from a cruise on 23 January after stopping six vessels. She sent two Swedish and one Danish vessel into Dartmouth, the latter with a <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo</b> of tobacco from Baltimore bound for Stockholm. The Dane arrived on 4 January. The General Wraigh arrived at Portsmouth on 26 January and the Catherine Margaretta, which had been sailing from Seville to Altona, arrived on 4 February. On 3 February, the Vrow Jenetta, of Altona, came into Plymouth. When Telegraph had captured her she had been sailing from St. Bartolomew's to Hamburgh with a cargo of sugar and coffee. In all, on the one cruise Telegraph had captured six vessels.|$|E
25|$|Broompark was {{allocated}} the Code Letters GCBC and the United Kingdom Official Number 168288. Her {{port of registry}} was Greenock, Renfrewshire. The ship's master was Captain Olaf Paulsen. Born in Christiania, Norway, in 1878, he {{had left}} when he was 14 and made his home in Leith, Scotland, becoming a British citizen in 1904. After starting out with Christian Salvesen as a cook, he had earned his master's certificate, and joined the Denholm line. He had commanded SS Briarpark in the 1920s, but {{had been forced to}} retire in 1938 after running his ship aground. Ironically, soon after the Second World War broke out, Paulsen found himself in charge of the line's newest ship, and the most <b>valuable</b> <b>cargo</b> it had ever carried.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 April 1804 the French {{privateer}} Hirondelle, {{of fourteen}} 12-pounders and 80 crew, captured the Government of Malta brig or cutter King George off Cape Passero.

5000|$|Third, {{and unlike}} the Allies, the Germans {{were never able to}} mount a {{comprehensive}} blockade of Britain. Nor were they able to focus their effort by targeting the most <b>valuable</b> <b>cargoes,</b> the eastbound traffic carrying war materiel.

5000|$|Through {{the mid-19th}} century, India Wharf became Boston's [...] "headquarters {{of the trade}} with the Orient and many <b>valuable</b> <b>cargoes</b> from Canton, Calcutta, Russia and the Mediterranean ports were {{discharged}} there. ...There were 30 stores in the block.
