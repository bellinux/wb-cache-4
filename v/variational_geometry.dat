The calculus of variations is developed on the infinite jet spaces over such noncommutative bundles.

In the engineering design practice, tolerance analysis and synthesis computations, if any, are usually performed with very little support by computer tools and therefore hardly optimized, even though quality requirements and cost consideration might suggest a careful selection of the prescribed tolerances. The implementation of a tolerance analysis solver for 2 D models based on <b>variational</b> <b>geometry</b> that was able to manage size and geometric tolerances, except for form tolerances, together with uncertainties on design parameters, was detailed in a previous work (Concheri, 1995).

Advisor: John Gunnar Carlsson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF) : vi, 140 pages, appendices p. 129 - 140. This dissertation {{focuses on a}} fundamental but under-researched problem: how does one divide a piece of territory into smaller pieces in an efficient way? In particular, {{we are interested in}} map segmentation problem of partitioning a geographic region into smaller subregions for allocating resources or distributing a workload among multiple agents. This work would result in useful solutions for a variety of fundamental problems, ranging from congressional districting, facility location, and supply chain management to air traffic control and vehicle routing. In a typical map segmentation problem, we are given a geographic region R, a probability density function defined on R (representing, say population density, distribution of a natural resource, or locations of clients) and a set of points in R (representing, say service facilities or vehicle depots). We seek a partition of R that is a collection of disjoint sub-regions {R_ 1,..., R_n} such that _i R_i = R, that optimizes some objective function while satisfying a shape condition. As examples of shape conditions, we may require that all sub-regions be compact, convex, star convex, simply connected (not having holes), connected, or merely measurable. Such problems are difficult because the search space is infinite-dimensional (since we are designing boundaries between sub-regions) and because the shape conditions are generally difficult to enforce using standard optimization methods. There are also many interesting variants and extensions to this problem. It is often the case that the optimal partition for a problem changes over time as new information about the region is collected. In that case, we have an online problem and we must re-draw the sub-region boundaries as time progresses. In addition, we often prefer to construct these sub-regions in a decentralized fashion: that is, the sub-region assigned to agent i should be computable using only local information to agent i (such as nearby neighbors or information about its surroundings), and the optimal boundary between two sub-regions should be computable using only knowledge available to those two agents. This dissertation is an attempt to design geometric algorithms aiming to solve the above mentioned problems keeping in view the various design constraints. We describe the drawbacks of the current approach to solving map segmentation problems, its ineffectiveness to impose geometric shape conditions and its limited utility in solving the online version of the problem. Using an intrinsically interdisciplinary approach, combining elements from <b>variational</b> calculus, computational <b>geometry,</b> geometric probability theory, and vector space optimization, we present an approach where we formulate the problems geometrically and then use a fast geometric algorithm to solve them. We demonstrate our success by solving problems having a particular choice of objective function and enforcing certain shape conditions. In fact, it turns out that such methods actually give useful insights and algorithms into classical location problems such as the continuous k-medians problem, where the aim is to find optimal locations for facilities. We use a map segmentation technique to present a constant factor approximation algorithm to solve the continuous k-medians problem in a convex polygon. We conclude this thesis by describing how we intend to build on this success and develop algorithms to solve larger classes of these problems...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a functional programming approach to geometric design with embedded polyhedral complexes. Its main goals are {{to show the}} expressive power of the language {{as well as its}} usefulness for geometric design. The language, named PLASM (the Programming LAnguage for Solid Modelling), introduces a very high level approach to “constructive” or “generative” modelling. Geometrical objects are generated by evaluating some suitable language expressions. Because generating expressions can be easily combined, the language also extends the standard <b>variational</b> <b>geometry</b> approach by supporting classes of geometric objects with varying topology and shape. The design language PLASM can be roughly considered as a geometry-oriented extension of a subset of the functional language FL. The language takes a dimension-independent approach to geometry representation and algorithms. In particular it implements an algebraic calculus over embedded polyhedra of any dimension. The generated objects are always geometrically consistent because the validity of geometry is guaranteed at a syntactical level.

40|$|Dimensioning {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} stages in design development. It is traditionally learned through the sketches or drawings of parts to which the student adds their dimensional values. However, there are no computer teaching applications which are specifically oriented towards teaching the student how to dimension and showing what alternatives exist for such dimensioning. A methodology has been developed based on a computer application which in turn is based on <b>variational</b> <b>geometry,</b> which will allow students to design a sketch and obtain the different alternative dimensions, in line with ISO 129. Creating sketches through conceptual design implies the use of constraints. When developing conceptual design-based CAD programs, two independent modules must be created: on the one hand, the sketcher module, which must define the model's geometrical constraints and interpret the user's intention through a system of rules. On the other hand, the calculation module which must solve the final geometry and eventually dimension the mechanical part. The proposed approach establishes the complete geometry and constraints of a sketch and relates it with the complete dimensioning of the sketch. The developed methodology gives as a result a complete and consistent dimensioning of the sketch following the rules established by a standard like ISO.

The modified adjacency matrix expressed in linear vector space provides tools for manipulating features of kinematic connectivity of a mechanism through numerical computation rather than symbolic manipulation, and results in improving the efficiency of the design process for mechanism synthesis.

40|$|In this thesis, we derive {{necessary}} optimality {{conditions for}} bilevel programming problems (BPPs for short) in Banach spaces. This rather abstract setting reflects {{our desire to}} characterize the local optimal solutions of hierarchical optimization problems in function spaces arising from several applications. Since our considerations {{are based on the}} tools of variational analysis introduced by Boris Mordukhovich, we study related properties of pointwise defined sets in function spaces. The presence of sequential normal compactness for such sets in Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces as well as the <b>variational</b> <b>geometry</b> of decomposable sets in Lebesgue spaces is discussed. Afterwards, we investigate mathematical problems with complementarity constraints (MPCCs for short) in Banach spaces which are closely related to BPPs. We introduce reasonable stationarity concepts and constraint qualifications which can be used to handle MPCCs. The relations between the mentioned stationarity notions are studied in the setting where the underlying complementarity cone is polyhedric. The results are applied to the situations where the complementarity cone equals the nonnegative cone in a Lebesgue space or is polyhedral. Next, we use the three main approaches of transforming a BPP into a single-level program (namely the presence of a unique lower level solution, the KKT approach, and the optimal value approach) to derive necessary optimality conditions for BPPs. Furthermore, we comment on the relation between the original BPP and the respective surrogate problem. We apply our findings to formulate necessary optimality conditions for three different classes of BPPs. First, we study a BPP with semidefinite lower level problem possessing a unique solution. Afterwards, we deal with bilevel optimal control problems with dynamical systems of ordinary differential equations at both decision levels.
