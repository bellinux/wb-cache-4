40|$|Abstract 3 Phase PWM {{rectifier}} {{has become}} increasingly popular due to its capability of nearly sinusoidal waveform of the input current, and nearly unity power factor operation as a AC/DC rectifier of high capacity telecommunication power supply system. Generally, PI controller {{is used as a}} <b>voltage</b> <b>controller</b> of PWM rectifier and <b>voltage</b> <b>controller</b> must be designed to have low overshoot in transient state to get a reliability and stable operation.

40|$|Abstract – This paper proposes the {{development}} and implementation of a hybrid maximum <b>voltage</b> utilization <b>controller</b> for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) over a wide operating region. It has a structure that combines the current vector control (CVC) -type Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) controller and the modulating <b>voltage</b> scaled <b>controller</b> (MVSC). Particularly, the current regulator is deactivated for achieving the true maximum voltage utilization in the MVSC region. The hybrid structure provides a smooth transition from the CVC to the proposed MVSC mode by deactivating the current regulator in the flux weakening region. A seamless transition to the full six-step modulation can be easily realized by adjusting a scaling gain, which can be considered a very significant merit in terms of power utilization for wide flux weakening applications. This paper also attempts to investigate the torque control accuracy under motor parameter drifts and provide how to decouple its influence using a voltage disturbance state-filter design.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{deployment of}} the Smart Grid paradigm will support the evolution of conventional electrical power systems toward active, flexible and self-healing web energy networks composed of distributed and cooperative energy resources. In a Smart Grid platform, the optimal coordination of distributed <b>voltage</b> <b>controllers</b> {{is one of the}} main issues to address. In this field, the application of traditional control paradigms has some disadvantages that could hinder their application in Smart Grids where the constant growth of grid complexity and the need for massive pervasion of Distribution Generation Systems (DGSs) require more scalable, more flexible control and regulation paradigms. To try and overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the concept of a decentralized non-hierarchical voltage regulation architecture based on intelligent and cooperative smart entities. The distributed <b>voltage</b> <b>controllers</b> employ traditional sensors to acquire local bus variables and mutually coupled oscillators to assess the main variables that characterize the operation of the global Smart Grid.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from field tests that were carried out {{with the aim of}} verifying the performance of a model predictive control-based <b>voltage</b> <b>controller.</b> A voltage source converter capable of producing or consuming 4 MVAr was used as the reactive power source, which was able to influence the voltage magnitude at a remote bus within a real distribution system in Gothenburg, Sweden. The <b>voltage</b> <b>controller</b> is designed to maintain the remote bus voltage within a pre-defined range while respecting the reactive power output capability of the voltage source converter and an objective of minimum changes to the reference value of its local reactive power controller. Results from the field tests demonstrate that the <b>voltage</b> <b>controller</b> was able to successfully regulate the voltage even with significant errors in the state-space prediction model. An important lesson learned from the field test is that a smoothened voltage measurement feedback is critical to a satisfactory functioning of the controller. Furthermore, it is recommended to design the <b>voltage</b> <b>controller</b> to observe an initial delay, before it is activated for bus voltage control- this would deter it from unnecessarily reacting at the very instant it is brought online...|$|E
