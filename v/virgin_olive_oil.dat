5|$|Nabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased from a peak of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E
5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
40|$|Monovarietal <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> (VOOs) {{are very}} {{effective}} to study relationships among sensory attributes, the compounds responsible for flavour, and factors affecting them. The {{stimulation of the}} human sensory receptors by volatile and non-volatile compounds present in monovarietal <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> {{gives rise to the}} sensory attributes that describe their peculiar delicate and fragrant flavours. The formation of these compounds is briefly illustrated and the influence of the agronomic and technological factors that affect their concentrations in the oil is examined. The relationships between compounds responsible for the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> flavour and sensory attributes are discussed. Several approaches for the varietal differentiation of monovarietal <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> are also overviewed...|$|R

25|$|The {{polyphenol}} {{composition of}} olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, {{as measured by}} the Folin method, are 117mg/100 g in black olives and 161mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21mg/100 g for extra virgin and <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59mg/100 g in green olives.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, and broccoli stir-fried with extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|E
500|$|Nabulsi soap ( [...] , ṣābūn Nābulsi) {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus in the West Bank, Palestine. Its chief ingredients are [...] <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (the main agricultural product of the region), water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The finished product is ivory-colored and has almost no scent. Traditionally made by women for household use, it had become a significant industry for Nablus by the 14th century. In 1907 the city's 30 Nabulsi soap factories were supplying half the soap in Palestine. The industry declined during the mid-20th century following destruction caused by the 1927 Jericho earthquake and later disruption from the Israeli military occupation. As of 2008, only two soap factories survive in Nablus. The old Arafat soap factory {{has been turned into a}} Cultural Heritage Enrichment Center.|$|E

40|$|Background. Extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> are {{valuable}} and healthy products, appreciated by consumers. The {{aim of this}} study was an attempt to detect adulteration of <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> available on the Polish market (derived from Greece, Spain, and Italy) according to European Union Commission Regulation No 1348 / 2013. Material and methods. Ten extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> available on the Polish market were analysed for fatty acids composition, and amount and composition of sterols (including erythrodiol and uvaol) using gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometry, and values of extinction coefficients (K 232 and K 270). The results were compared with the requirements of European Union Commission Regulation No 1348 / 2013. Results. One of the most efficient methods for detecting <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> adulteration is qualitative and quantitative analysis of sterols. In certain of the analysed extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> some abnormal­ities in composition were detected, which may indicate an attempt to falsify the products. One of the methods can detect if extra <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> have been adulterated, and if they were falsified with the addition of <b>olive</b> pomace <b>oil.</b> Conclusions. Our research proves that consumers are sometimes misinformed and some food manufacturers attempt to sell lower quality products as high-quality products. There is a need to constantly monitor the quality of foodstuffs and provide consumers with access to reliable inform­ation on food products...|$|R
