40|$|Book synopsis: This {{major new}} {{reference}} presents The Foresight Mental Capital and Wellbeing Project (a UK Government {{project in the}} Government Office for Science). It offers a comprehensive exploration of how mental capital and wellbeing operate over the lifespan; how experiences in the family, in school, at work and following retirement augment or reduce mental capital and wellbeing, and the impact that this has for the individual and for the welfare and economic progress of the nation. Mental Capital and Wellbeingcomprises a series of scientific reviews written by leading international scientists and social scientists in the field. The reviews undertake systematic analyses of the evidence base surrounding five key themes, on which they propose future policies {{will have to be}} based. An internationally renowned team of Editors introduce each theme and draw together conclusions in terms of both policy and practice. Section 1 (Mental Capital and Wellbeing Through Life) – Mental capital refers to the totality of an individual’s cognitive and emotional resources, including their cognitive capability, flexibility and efficiency of learning, emotional intelligence and resilience in the face of stress. The extent of an individual’s resources reflects his or her basic endowment (e. g. genes and early biological programming), motivation and experiences (e. g. education) which take place throughout the life course. This section presents the <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> the science of mental capital throughout life. Section 2 (Learning Through Life) provides a coherent overview of a fast-moving and complex field of policy and practice. Educational attainment has a considerable impact on physical and mental wellbeing, both directly and indirectly, by enabling people better to achieve their goals. The ability to continue learning throughout the lifespan is critical to a successful and rewarding life in contemporary societies...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} published Yemeni observing report about SN 1006 from al-Yamani clearly gives AD 1006 Apr 17 ± 2 (mid-Rajab 396 h) as first observation date. Since {{this is about}} 1. 5 weeks earlier than the otherwise earliest reports (Apr 28 or 30) as discussed so far, we were motivated to investigate an early sighting in more depth. We searched for additional evidences from other areas like East Asia and Europe. We found that the date given by al-Yamani is fully consistent with other evidence, including: (a) SN 1006 "rose several times half an hour after sunset" (al-Yamani), which is correct for the location of Sana in Yemen for the time around Apr 17, {{but it would not}} be correct for late Apr or early May; (b) the date (3 rd year, 3 rd lunar month, 28 th day wuzi, Ichidai Yoki) for an observation of a guest star in Japan is inconsistent (there is no day wuzi in that lunar month), but may be dated to Apr 16 by reading wuwu date rather than a wuzi date; (c) there is observational evidence that SN 1006 was observed in East Asia early or mid April; for the second half of April, a bad weather (early monsoon) period is not unlikely [...] {{there is a lack of}} night reports; (d) the observer in St. Gallen reported to have seen SN 1006 "for three months", which must have ended at the <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> <b>on</b> AD 1006 Jul 10, given his northern location, so that his observations probably started in April. We conclude that the correctly reported details give quite high confidence in the fully self-consistent report of al-Yamani, so that the early discovery date should be considered seriously.
