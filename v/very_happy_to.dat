5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented {{followers}} seized Bligh and {{took control of}} the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other actually went out to the Pandora in canoes , <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be rescued-as they thought. They were then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E

25|$|Eugenia's {{reaction}} {{after this}} first approach differs from Felix's. She {{is not really}} interested in sharing her time with this circle. She doesn't like the Wentworth ladies and {{does not want to}} visit them frequently. In contrast, her brother is <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> share his spare time with Charlotte and Gertrude, spending hours in their piazza or garden creating portraits of the two ladies.|$|E
25|$|From {{an early}} age, Niikuni had chest ailments and was {{constantly}} {{worried about his}} health. He was reportedly <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> reach the age of 50, but would succumb to a sudden illness only two years later on August 23, 1977. He died in his home in Tokyo {{at the age of}} 52 (kazoedoshi). The publication of ASA also came to an end, with the seventh issue published in 1974 remaining as the last issue.|$|E
25|$|The expedition's {{weaponry}} and askaris {{had proved}} their superiority over muskets and Msiri's people {{were more interested}} in the succession than revenge. Stairs backed Mukanda-Bantu to succeed Msiri, but as chief of a reduced territory, and he restored the Wasanga chiefs overthrown by Msiri 30 years before. Mukanda-Bantu signed the treaties, and the restored Wasanga chiefs were <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> do so too. Msiri's brothers were unhappy with the sub-chieftainships they were given and refused to sign up, until threatened with the same fate as Msiri. By early January 1892 the expedition had the papers sufficient to convince their British rivals that they now had Katanga.|$|E

25|$|Parker {{wanted the}} show, which was {{scheduled}} as a Christmas season broadcast, {{to be little}} more than Presley singing Christmas carols. He believed the special could simply be a TV-version of the Christmas radio show Presley had contributed to the year before. Binder argued that the special was an opportunity to re-establish the singer's reputation after years of formulaic movies and recordings of variable quality. He and Howe hired writers to script a show with specific themes: large set designs, dance sequences and big productions of Presley's hits. However, Binder was open to any variations on this that would showcase the singer's talent, and Presley was apparently <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> go along with this flexible approach.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of season 9, Leonard and Penny marry, although not without some initial problems. They both reveal that they were subconsciously trying to sabotage their relationship, feeling unworthy of the other. Leonard, concerned {{that he was trying}} to sabotage his relationship with Penny, meets with the woman he kissed on the boat. She barely remembers the incident and quickly grows bored with Leonard's ramblings, taking a sarcastic and dismissive tone toward him. From that meeting Leonard comes to terms with his insecurities and he and Penny are able to become more comfortable in dealing with their mutual fears about their relationship. Leonard seriously tries to move into Penny's apartment though Sheldon has serious objections and makes them compromise to spend multiple nights a week in Leonard's old room. Early in season 10, the couple is <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be finally living alone after Sheldon moves in with Amy.|$|E
500|$|In My Life So Far, Fonda {{stated that}} she {{considers}} patriarchy to {{be harmful to}} men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were [...] "anti-male". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she [...] "still loves men", adding that when she divorced Ted Turner, {{she felt like she}} had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have done so.|$|E

500|$|As writers Carter and Frank Spotnitz {{aimed to}} avoid complicating the storyline of [...] with {{superfluous}} appearances of characters {{from the television}} series, Skinner is the only returning character in the movie. He {{was included in the}} film's plot only when a fitting opportunity to involve him arose, and Spotnitz and Carter were <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> write Skinner into the story. The scenes of The X-Files: I Want to Believe that include Skinner were filmed very late in the movie's filming schedule, and the particular scene that acts as the character's introduction in the movie was filmed, for reasons of time, in two different locations.|$|E
500|$|Peter Sagan's {{victory in}} the race was his first since winning the rainbow jersey {{at the world championships}} road race the {{previous}} year. It was the end of what Cycling Weekly called a [...] "frustrating run" [...] that had included second place at E3 Harelbeke two days previously. He said that he was <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have won in the rainbow jersey, especially as Gent–Wevelgem was an important race to him. He said that he was determined not to make the same mistake as he had in previous races by working hard in the final part of the race; Kuznetsov's early sprint then set him up for his own sprint.|$|E
500|$|To {{reflect the}} episode's setting in 1985, the typical title credit {{sequence}} was redone using different music, the Asimov font for early computer type for the show's logo, and terms that were [...] "fringe science" [...] at the time, such as [...] "virtual reality," [...] "genetic engineering," [...] and [...] "personal computing". Pinkner later recalled, [...] "One of our writers said off-handedly that if we’re doing a show from 1985, shouldn’t we do a credit sequence from 1985, and literally, we pounced on it". He and Wyman asked J. J. Abrams, {{who wrote the}} original credit sequence melody, to write a 1980s version; Abrams was [...] "very, <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> do that," [...] according to Wyman.|$|E

500|$|Bågenholm {{soon began}} {{to show signs of}} vitality, and woke up paralyzed from the neck down on 30 May. She feared she would spend {{the rest of her life}} on her back, and was angry with her colleagues for saving her. Bågenholm soon {{recovered}} from the paralysis, however, and later apologized to her friends; [...] "I was very irritated when I realized they had saved me. I feared a meaningless life, without any dignity. Now I am <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be alive and want to apologize." [...] Bågenholm's kidneys and digestive system were not working properly, so she had to recover in an intensive care unit for two more months. After spending 28days in the Tromsø intensive care unit, she was flown to Sweden in an ambulance helicopter for the remainder of her recovery.|$|E
500|$|When {{the episode}} was being cast, Michael McKean was not slated to play Morris Fletcher. Originally, the writers for the episode {{contacted}} Garry Shandling {{to play the}} part of Fletcher. Shandling, who was good friends with David Duchovny, was unavailable because he was filming a movie called Town and Country. Shandling would later appear in the seventh season episode [...] "Hollywood A.D." [...] playing himself. In the meantime, the production staff began looking for a replacement. Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files, stated that they went through [...] "lists and lists" [...] of potential actors. Vince Gilligan noted, however, that McKean {{was at the top}} of the list for inclusion. McKean was <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> play the part, although he did specifically ask the writers not to kill off his character.|$|E
500|$|Having {{completed}} his medical in June, Chelsea announced on 1 July 2014 {{that they had}} agreed to meet the £32million buy-out clause in Costa's contract. On 15 July, Chelsea confirmed {{the completion of the}} signing of Costa, who signed a five-year contract on a salary of £150,000 a week. On signing, Costa said, [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> sign for Chelsea. Everybody knows it is a big club in a very competitive league, and I am very excited to get started in England with a fantastic coach and team-mates. Having played against Chelsea last season I know the high quality of the squad I am joining". Following the departure of former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, Costa inherited his number 19 shirt, the same number he wore at the 2014 World Cup for Spain and previously at Atlético.|$|E
60|$|It was a <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> day <b>to</b> Honora; {{there was}} a repose and trust to be felt in Humfrey's company, such as she had not {{experienced}} since {{she had lost her}} parents, and the home sense of kindred was very precious.

60|$|The {{suggestion}} made a hit. There was {{no doubt}} about that. It was a success from the start. Quite a little chorus of voices expressed sincere approval of the <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> solution <b>to</b> what had seemed an insoluble problem. John, listening from above, failed to detect in the choir of glad voices one that might belong to Sam himself. Probably gratification had rendered the chosen one dumb.|$|R

500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us." [...] Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won but said the victory was not special: [...] "It's just one more. I had a few before this, I'm <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> win. It's important for the fans, for the club and especially for the players." [...] Striker Eiður Guðjohnsen said Chelsea's victory was down to their hard work ethic: [...] "It was a very intense and even game {{and it was hard}} to break them down, but hard work pays off in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> win, but we do not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1843, Verdi visited Vienna (where Gaetano Donizetti was musical director) {{to oversee}} a {{production}} of Nabucco. The older composer, recognising Verdi's talent, noted in a letter of January 1844: [...] "I am very, <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> give way to people of talent like Verdi... Nothing will prevent the good Verdi from soon reaching {{one of the most}} honourable positions in the cohort of composers." [...] Verdi travelled on to Parma, where the Teatro Regio di Parma was producing Nabucco with Strepponi in the cast. For Verdi the performances were a personal triumph in his native region, especially as his father, Carlo, attended the first performance. Verdi remained in Parma for some weeks beyond his intended departure date. This fuelled speculation that the delay was due to Verdi's interest in Giuseppina Strepponi (who stated that their relationship began in 1843). Strepponi was in fact known for her amorous relationships (and many illegitimate children) and her history was an awkward factor in their relationship until they eventually agreed on marriage.|$|E
