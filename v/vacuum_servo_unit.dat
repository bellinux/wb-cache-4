5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a [...] ZMZ-24D engine, an {{evolution}} of the ZMZ-21A. Retaining the basic OHV configuration, it now ran on 92 RON gasoline (while the ZMZ 24-01 could use commonly available 76 octane, and the 24-07 could use liquid propane). The cylinder block was die cast, instead of the slower coquille for the 21A. The engine featured a twin-choke carburettor, with a higher compression ratio, producing [...] at 4500 rpm and an even more impressive [...] of torque at 2200-2400 RPM. Transmission was now fully synchronised four on floor layout. The brakes were improved, with a hydraulic <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> (a licence-built Girling PowerStop), {{as well as an}} independent parking brake (rather than transmission brake of the GAZ-21). At the same time, certain features were retained for their proven reliability, like the kingpin front suspension and recirculating ball steering.|$|E
5000|$|This article mainly {{refers to}} the {{mechanical}} device {{in the context of}} a brake power booster or vehicular braking-system assist. The term [...] "vacuum servo" [...] is actually a generic term for any device which uses a vacuum to amplify/boost the mechanical effort of a device by use of a vacuum in an assisting chamber, either attached to the input or output, or placed between the input and output. In a <b>Vacuum</b> brake <b>servo,</b> the <b>unit</b> is placed between the brake pedal and the hydraulic master cylinder, using stored vacuum to amplify the drivers pedal efforts, giving a greater braking force.|$|R
40|$|A method {{constructing}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> {{control system}} with a combined vacuum generator is proposed and the single neural adaptive PID control strategy is also proposed due to the inherent defects of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system in this paper. The influence of the system parameters to {{the characteristics of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system is analyzed and discussed. The simulation and the experiment show that the kind of <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system has the characteristics of faster response, higher control accuracy and stronger robustness. The control strategy presented can improve the static and dynamic behavior of the system effectively. PREFACE The vacuum technology has been widely used in various kinds of industrial fields, e. g. food industry, automotive manufacturing industry, metallurgy industry, et al. The applications are just limited in open-loop control [1][2]. But the reports to <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> control technology are few. It is because the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system has the inherent defects of larger time const, greater nonlinear and change with time. Considering the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> control technology will be widely used in the field of aviation and space flight, and it is very important especially in the closed to semi-practicality simulation system of the low altitude aircraft. According to the characteristics of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system, the single neural adaptive PID control strategy is proposed based on the reasonable constructing of system in this paper. The servo control of the vacuum signal with higher accuracy and faster response has been realized, and the achievement solves the simulation problem of the dynamic pressure and the static pressure in the semi-practicality simulation system of the low altitude aircraft...|$|R

50|$|Four wheel, cable operated, {{drum brakes}} were fitted {{from the start}} but unusually a <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> was an option. The {{handbrake}} had {{its own set of}} shoes on the rear brakes. The steel section chassis had semi-elliptic leaf springs all round.|$|R

50|$|The chassis of Majestic Major was an {{evolution}} of the design introduced in 1937 with the Daimler New Fifteen. As with the New Fifteen and several derivatives in between, the Majestic Major had a cruciform-braced box-section frame with conventional coil-sprung independent front suspension and a live rear axle on semi-elliptic leaf springs.

500|$|By 1939, all {{the major}} car makers were using unassisted {{hydraulic}} brakes; Ford {{was the last to}} switch from cable-manipulated systems. [...] Power-assisted <b>Vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> brakes had been invented in 1903, but did not become generally available as an option until the 1950s. Self-adjusting brakes initially were offered on the 1957 Mercury and 1958 Edsel, and other manufacturers soon followed suit. Buick offered power brakes as standard equipment on several of its vehicles by the 1954 model year.|$|R
50|$|Steering was by cam and lever {{with the}} box {{mounted on the}} car's frame. From 1932 the brake <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> motor was run from the car's gearbox. Brakes were on all four wheels and {{operated}} by rods, drums were enclosed. The front brakes used the Perrott principle. The central hand lever used the same brake shoes at the back as the foot brake. Springs were semi-elliptical and flat with gaiters and shock absorbers. The rear springs were outside the frame.|$|R
50|$|The B5 S4 {{brake system}} {{consisted}} of radially ventilated discs, 321 mm in diameter by 30 mm thick up front, and 256 mm by 22 mm at the rear. Two-piston Lucas HP2 brake calipers {{at the front}} (with four pads per caliper), with Lucas single-piston sliding brake calipers at the rear. A Bosch ABS 5.3 four-channel Anti-lock Braking System (with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) and Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) - and later with ESP or Electronic Stability Programme), coupled with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> completed the system.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the MG, the 15/50 engine {{had only}} a single SU {{carburettor}} so the power output was slightly less at [...] at 4400 rpm. Unlike the 4/44, the 15/50 had a floor gear change. From 1956 a [...] "Manumatic" [...] two pedal (centrifugal clutch) transmission was an option. This was controlled by a micro switch hidden in the gear lever operating a <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo.</b> Having no synchromesh on bottom gear could make changes into the lowest ratio, which would normally require double declutching, difficult.|$|R
50|$|Drive by wire, DbW, by-wire, Steer-by-wire, or {{x-by-wire}} {{technology in}} the automotive industry {{is the use of}} electrical or electro-mechanical systems for performing vehicle functions traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages. This technology replaces the traditional mechanical control systems with electronic control systems using electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces such as pedal and steering feel emulators. Components such as the steering column, intermediate shafts, pumps, hoses, belts, coolers and <b>vacuum</b> <b>servos</b> and master cylinders are eliminated from the vehicle. This is similar to the fly-by-wire systems used widely in the aviation industry.|$|R
50|$|Manifold vacuum {{can be used}} {{to drive}} {{accessories}} on automobiles. The best-known application is the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo,</b> used to provide power assistance for the brakes. Obsolete applications include vacuum-driven windscreen wipers and Autovac fuel pumps. Some aircraft instruments (Attitude Indicator (AI) and the Heading Indicator (HI)) are typically vacuum-powered, as protection against loss of all (electrically powered) instruments, since early aircraft often did not have electrical systems, and since there are two readily available sources of vacuum on a moving aircraft, the engine and an external venturi.Vacuum induction melting uses electromagnetic induction within a vacuum.|$|R
