40|$|Abstract: Objective: To examine {{associations}} between disability {{and socioeconomic status}} (SES) in persons with hip radiographic OA (rOA) or symptomatic OA (sxOA) in the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project. Methods: Cross-sectional analyses were conducted on individuals with hip rOA (708) or sxOA (251). rOA was defined as Kellgren-Lawrence � 2. Educational attainment (< 12 years or � 12 years) and occupation (managerial or non-managerial) were individual SES measures. Census block group poverty rate (< 12 %, 12 - 25 %, � 25 %) was the community SES measure. Disability {{was measured by the}} HAQ-DI and the WOMAC (function, pain, total). Covariates included age, gender, race, BMI, and presence of knee symptoms. Analyses examined associations of disability with each SES effect separately, followed by multivariable analyses using all SES <b>variables,</b> <b>adjusting</b> for covariates. Results: In models with single SES <b>variables</b> <b>adjusted</b> for covariates, WOMAC scores were associated significantly (p< 0. 05) with low educational attainment and non-managerial occupation in rOA and sxOA. HAQ was significantly associated with low educational attainment in rOA and sxOA and with high community poverty in rOA. In models including all SES variables, the patterns of association were similar although with diminished significance. There was indication that education was more strongly associated with HAQ and WOMAC function, while occupation was more strongly associated with WOMAC pain. Conclusion: Our data provide evidence that individual SES is an important factor to consider when examining disability and pain outcomes in older adults with hip OA...|$|R
30|$|As {{in other}} areas of research, the {{conflicting}} results may be explained by the use of different methodologies, the focus on different periods—particularly in Mexico, which transited in the mid- 1980 s from having a heavily regulated trade regime to a mostly liberalized one, a transition that may have altered the way macroeconomic <b>variables</b> <b>adjust</b> to changes in relative prices—and the way the estimations handle the impact of the financial crises often linked to large depreciations. Because of the latter factor, some of the estimates may be picking up contractionary effects of a short-run nature, a possibility that arises from the way the equations are sometimes specified.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study aims to {{show that}} under several assumptions, in {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs), unadjusted, crude analysis will underestimate the Cohen's d effect size of the treatment, and an unbiased estimate of effect size can be obtained only by adjusting for all predictors of the outcome. Study Design and Setting: Four simulations were performed {{to examine the effects}} of adjustment on the estimated effect size of the treatment and power of the analysis. In addition, we analyzed data from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study (older adults aged 65 - 94), an RCT with three treatment arms and one control arm. Results: We showed that (1) the number of unadjusted covariates was associated with the effect size of the treatment; (2) the biasedness of effect size estimation was minimized if all covariates were adjusted for; (3) the power of the statistical analysis slightly decreased with the number of adjusted noise variables; and (4) exhaustively searching the covariates and noise <b>variables</b> <b>adjusted</b> for can lead to exaggeration of the true effect size. Analysis of the ACTIVE study data showed that the effect sizes adjusting for covariates of all three treatments were 7. 39 - 24. 70 % larger than their unadjusted counterparts, whereas the effect size would be elevated by at most 57. 92 % by exhaustively searching the <b>variables</b> <b>adjusted</b> for. Conclusion: All covariates of the outcome in RCTs should be adjusted for, and if the effect of a particular variable on the outcome is unknown, adjustment will do more good than harm.

40|$|Data from 970 feedlot steers and bulls {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} effects of different age end points on the accuracy of prediction models for percentage of retail product, retail product weight, and hot carcass weight. Cattle were ultrasonically scanned {{three or four times}} for fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, and percentage of intramuscular fat. Live animal measures of body weight and hip height were also taken during some of the scan sessions. Before development of prediction equations, live and ultrasound data were adjusted to four age end points using individual animal regressions. Age end points represented mean age at slaughter (448 d), mean age at the second last scan before slaughter (414 d), mean age at the third last scan before slaughter (382 d), and an age end point of 365 d. Ultrasound and live animal measures accounted for {{a large proportion of the}} variation in the dependent variables regardless of the age end point considered. For all three traits, final models based on independent <b>variables</b> <b>adjusted</b> to earlier ages of 365 d and 382 d showed better or at least similar model R 2 and root mean square errors than those based on independent <b>variables</b> <b>adjusted</b> to a mean slaughter age of 448 d.
