40|$|The wind-induced, {{steady state}} circulations in Lake Superior were {{investigated}} by use of, both mathematical and physical models. The mathematical model was {{developed from the}} equations of motion, assuming a homogeneous lake, negligible nonlinear accelerations, con-stant Coriolis force, hydrostatic pressure distribution, negligible horizontal turbulent shear stresses, and constant vertical eddy viscosity. With these assumptions, the equations of motion were solved analytically to give expressions for the velocities in terms of position in lake, wind stress, water surface slopes, depth, vertical eddy viscosity, and bottom condition (i. e. no-slip or slip). Water surface slopes were obtained from a numerical solution to the vertically integrated equations of motion, {{expressed in terms of}} a mass transport stream function and subject to appropriate wind stress and inflow-outflow conditions. Two- and three-dimensional velocity fields were obtained for uniform and curl wind stress distributions, for constant (average) and actual (variable) depth conditions, and for slip and no-slip on bottom. Laboratory experiments on the wind-generated circulation were conducted in a rotating, <b>vertically</b> <b>distorted</b> <b>model</b> of Lake Superior.

40|$|An {{arbitrary}} Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) three-dimensional hydrodynamic free-surface {{numerical model}} has been developed based on the time-dependent Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the finite volume method (FVM). The model with non-hydrostatic pressure distribution and a structured nonorthogonal curvilinear staggered mesh is capable of simulating non-homogeneous stratified flows and problems involving complex bathymetry. A projection method is deployed for solving {{the set of the}} equations, and a buoyant k-ε turbulence model is included in the numerical model. Six new advection schemes are introduced, and a fifth-order-accurate upstream scheme was utilised in the numerical model. Extensive numerical tests showed the capability of the model in simulating free surface flows and non-linear terms in Navier-Stokes equations. To achieve a better understanding of hydrodynamics, mixing, and salt transport and stratification and their interactive mechanisms in estuarine harbours and barrages, a laboratory tidal basin was designed, set up and employed for velocity, water surface elevation and salinity measurements of an idealised <b>vertically</b> <b>distorted</b> <b>model</b> harbour. For despiking and denoising the velocity data a linear algorithm was established, which successfully lowered the noise level and removed the spikes. The measurements showed a horizontal circulation in the harbour and weak vertical circulations. The salinity suppressed the circulation across the water depth, resulting in less mixing in vertical direction and stronger flushing on the surface. Comparisons of the numerical model simulations against the experimental data showed that the velocities and flow patterns were in generally good agreement with the measured values. For the fresh water the model under-predicted the dominant velocity components for the areas with strong circulation and for the saline water the simulated results showed an overprediction in lower layers and good agreements with the measured values for the top layer. The water elevations exhibited very close predictions compared with the measured data. The salinity simulated profiles showed good agreements with the measured values for lower layers and an over-prediction for the top layer. The investigations showed that the dominant velocities inside the harbour were increased for taller barriers, but with the increase of mean water depth the circulations weakened. The saline water flushing into the harbour flows underneath the fresh ambient water resulting in higher salinity concentration in the harbour over time...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of Coriolis {{force on the}} currents of large lakes is well acknowledged; very few contributions, however, investigate this aspect in medium-size lakes where its relevance could be questionable. In order to study the area of {{influence of}} the two major tributary rivers in Lake Iseo, a rotating <b>vertically</b> <b>distorted</b> physical <b>model</b> of the northern part of this lake was prepared and used, respecting both Froude and Rossby similarity. The model has a horizontal length scale factor of 8000 and a vertical scale factor of 500 and was used both in homogeneous and in thermally stratified conditions. We explored the pattern of water circulation in front of the entrance mouth for dif- ferent hydrologic scenarios at the beginning of spring and in summer. We neglected the influence of winds. The primary purposes of the model were twofold: i) to increase our level of knowledge of the hydrodynamics of Lake Iseo by verifying the occurrence of dynamical effects related to the Earth’s rotation on the plume of the two tributaries that enter {{the northern part of the}} lake and ii) to identify the areas of the lake that can be directly influenced by the tributaries’ waters, in order to provide guidance on water quality monitoring in zones of relevant environmental and touristic value. The results of the physical model confirm the relevant role played by the Coriolis force in the northern part of the lake. Under ordinary flow conditions, the model shows a systematic deflection of the inflowing waters towards the western shore of the lake. The inflow triggers a clockwise gyre within the Lovere bay, to the West of the inflow, and a slow counter-clockwise gyre, to the East of the inflow, that returns water towards the river mouth along the eastern shore. For discharges with higher return period, when only the contribution by Oglio River is relevant, the effect of the Earth’s rotation weakens in the entrance zone and the plume has a more rectilinear pattern, whilst in the far field the current driven by the inflows keeps moving along the western shore. On the basis of these results one could expect that the north-western part of the lake between Castro and Lovere, although not aligned with the tributaries’ axes, is more sensitive to accumulation effects related to river-borne pollution. The results obtained with the physical model are critically compared with data obtained from different sources: the trajectory of a lagrangian drogue; a map of reflectivity data from the lake floor; a map of water turbidity at the intrusion depth. The findings are also confirmed by the results of a 3 D numerical model of the lake...|$|R

We present new models for low-mass, pre-main sequence stars that include the combined distortion effects of tidal and rotational forces on the equilibrium configuration of stars. We investigate the effects of interaction between tides and rotation on the stellar structure and evolution. The Kippenhahn & Thomas (1970) approximation, along with the Clairaut-Legendre expansion for the gravitational potential of a self-gravitating body, is used to take the distortion effects into account. We obtained values of internal structure constants for low-mass, pre-main sequence stars from stellar evolutionary models that consider the combined effects of {{rotation and}} tidal forces due to a companion star.
