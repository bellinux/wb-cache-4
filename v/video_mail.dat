Introduced at DEMO 2007, Eyejot made it {{possible}} for its users to create, send and manage <b>video</b> <b>mail.</b> The Eyejot model is similar to other email systems in that it maintains its messages online and doesn't require any special client based software for access, just a web browser. At the time of its introduction Eyejot supported synchronization with iPods and Apple TV through iTunes. When the iPhone was introduced Eyejot quickly added native MP4 support enabling iPhone users to reach their video inbox through the platform's Safari browser.|$|E

5000|$|Schisms {{followed}} in the mid-1980s. Questions and concerns arose about whether the [...] "open pop star" [...] Monty Cantsin moniker was being overly associated with certain individuals. Later, writer Stewart Home sought to separate himself {{from the rest of}} the Neoist network, manifesting itself in Home's books on Neoism as opposed to the various Neoist resources in the Internet). In non-Neoist terms,Neoism could be called an international subculture which in thebeginning put itself into simultaneous continuity and discontinuity with, among others,experimental arts (such as Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus andConcept Art), punk, industrial music andelectropop, political and religious free-spirit movements, Science Fiction literature, 'pataphysics and speculative science.Neoism also gathered players with backgrounds in graffiti and streetperformance, language writing (later known as language poetry),experimental film and <b>video,</b> <b>Mail</b> Art, the earlyChurch of the Subgenius and gay and lesbianculture. Neoism then gradually transformed from an active subcultureinto a self-written urban legend. As a side effect, many othersubcultures, artistic and political groups since the late 1980s have -often vaguely - referred to or even opposed Neoism and thereby perpetuated its myth.|$|E
5000|$|The series follows Jay (Troy Wagner), a {{young man}} who {{attempts}} {{to find out what happened}} during the filming of [...] "Marble Hornets", a student film project of his friend, Alex Kralie (Joseph DeLage), three years previous. Alex abruptly ended the project after two months of production and has since been secluding himself from society. Before cutting contact with Jay, Alex gave the film tapes to Jay while telling the latter never to talk about it with him again. Jay discovers that the filming seemed to be hampered by a figure known as [...] "the Operator", who begins invading Jay's personal life after he watches the tapes, inducing him to set up cameras in his apartment. Posting the tapes to YouTube as [...] "Entries" [...] also nets Jay cryptic and threatening responses from a user known as [...] "totheark". Jay's attempts lead him to meet with one of the film's cast members, Tim (Tim Sutton), and a visit to the abandoned house of another cast member, Brian (Brian Haight), where he has his first encounter with a masked figure. Jay visits a red tower to find a tape showing Alex leaving his cameraman Seth (Seth McCay) at an abandoned building when confronted with the Operator, and deeming all of the cast and crew of Marble Hornets [...] "gone". Eventually, threats of stalking from totheark causes Jay to flee his apartment, which is subsequently burned down. Jay sets out to find Alex after receiving a <b>video</b> <b>mail</b> of Alex and his girlfriend, Amy (Bethann Williams), being attacked by the Operator.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a number}} of possible system architectures that can be employed for the development of <b>Video</b> <b>Mail.</b> Based on the following key issues: portability of system, flexibility of system, Internet standard support, security and authentication, and message compression and storage, a final architecture was selected to build <b>Video</b> <b>Mail.</b> The approach taken is that the system will be interfaced to the Web using a standard HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server and a standard Web browser. This is achieved through the use of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs and forms which reside in a standard HTTP server to provide the functionality of <b>video</b> <b>mail,</b> and a separate mail server for the storage and management of messages. This will cause the HTTP server to behave as if it is an electronic mail system. <b>Video</b> <b>Mail</b> has been successfully implemented at the School of Applied Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The development work has been carried out on a Sun SPARC 5 workstation and the Typhoon relational database system was used to construct the mail server. All software codes were written in C or C++. A video capturing application used in conjunction with a SunVideo card has been developed for video and audio recording. The paper also addresses implementation issues pertaining to the use of CGI programs, mail server development, and video and audio management. ...|$|E

For each keyword model type, effects on performance of re-scoring, Gaussian component number, and parameter set are evaluated on a set of spoken messages, taken from the <b>Video</b> <b>Mail</b> Retrieval database.
