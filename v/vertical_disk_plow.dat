40|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>plows</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. Two way (reversible) <b>disk</b> <b>plows</b> can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel reversing mechanism, stabilization mechanism of the <b>plow,</b> a <b>disk</b> angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the mechanism. Disk reversing mechanism was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the <b>disk</b> <b>plow.</b> The suitable displacement of the plow’s frame was achieved by dimensional analysis of Daniel mechanism and a derived mathematical equation. The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a slotted link to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries.

40|$|Tillage {{systems are}} {{a key element of}} the {{technology}} of crop production, both with a view to crop yield and from the perspective of soil conservation and sustainability of the production system. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects of five tillage systems on the physical properties of a cohesive Yellow Argisol. The experiment was installed in the field on January 21, 2011 and lasted 260 days, in an area previously used as pasture with Brachiaria grass without liming or fertilization, but irrigated by a low pressure spray system. The treatments, in five replications and in a randomized block design, consisted of: 1) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + ridge-furrow tillage (raising a ridge along the planting row), 135 days after transplanting (DP + RID); 2) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow (DP no RID); 3) subsoiler (SB); 4) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + scarification with three shanks along the plant row (DP + SPR); and 5) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + scarification with three shanks in the total area (DP + STA). In all tillage systems, furrows were mechanically opened for the papaya plants. After the treatments, the mechanical resistance to penetration was determined, followed by soil moisture, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), bulk density (BD), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), and number of fruits per plant. There were differences in penetration resistance (PR) between treatments. The subsoiler was more effective to decrease RP to a distance of 0. 35 m from the plants, perpendicular to the plant row. The scarifier resulted in a lower PR than DP or SB, even at the depth of 0. 40 m, and it was more effective at greater distances perpendicular to the plant. All tillage systems induced a PR between 2. 0 and 3. 0 MPa at the depth with the highest concentration of papaya tree roots (0 - 0. 25 m), improving the physical conditions to this depth. There was no statistical difference among the treatments for BD, Ma, Mi, MWD, and GMD at a depth of 0. 20 m. The <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> changed the physical properties of the soil most intensely to a depth of 0. 20 m. The use of scarification, reduced tillage with a forest subsoiler, or ridge-furrow tillage did not improve the physical properties in the rhizosphere.

40|$|Introduction: Mulch tillage {{system is}} an {{intermediate}} system which covers some of disadvantages of no tillage and conventional tillage systems. In farms in which tillage {{is done with}} a chisel plow, runoff and soil erosion have a less important relation to moldboard and <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> and naturally absorption of rainfall will be developed. Thus, the mulch tillage system is an appropriate alternative to conventional tillage and no tillage (Backingham and Pauli, 1993). The unwanted vibration in machinery and industry mainly processes most harmful factors, for example: bearing wear, cracking and loosening joints. And noise is produced in electrical systems by creating a short circuit (Wok, 2011). Self-induced and induced vibration are used in tillage systems. Induced vibration is created by energy consumption and self-induced vibration is created by collision among the blades and soil at the shank (Soeharsono and Setiawan, 2010). A study by Mohammadi-gol et al. (2005) was conducted. It was found that on the <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> plant residues maintained on the soil are more than that of moldboard plow. 99...|$|R

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial. Except in soil inversion, the effect of soil moisture {{on all of the}} performance parameters mentioned, was highly significant. Mean values of draft, specific draft and drawbar power requirements and clod mean weight diameter were minimized at 13 - 15 % and 16 - 18 % soil moisture contents, respectively. The effect of plowing depth was highly significant only on draft and drawbar power requirement of <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> {{in such a way that}} the mean values of these two parameters were significantly increased with plowing depth, while specific draft showed only a mild decreasing trend. In order to provide a quantitative index to express the degree of soil pulverization by tillage implements, a tractor-pulled rotary sieve was designed and fabricated. With this apparatus, in-field determination of soil clod mean weight diameter (MWD) following plowing was possible. The results showed that the effect of soil moisture content on MWD was highly significant, such that, plowing at 10 - 12 % moisture content produced the largest clods, whereas the effect of plowing depth on MWD was not significant. The decreasing trend of MWD with soil moisture content persisted to the highest moisture level studied (16 - 18 %), in which the average clod MWD (33. 8 mm) was about 72 % smaller than those formed at 10 - 12 % moisture content. The effects of plowing depth and soil m. c. on soil inversion by <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> were not significant and the overall soil inversion was about 54 % which was in agreement with those reported by other researchers...|$|R

This sample consists of two subsamples of 49 interacting/merging and 61 non-interacting galaxies. Additionally, 41 of these galaxies were observed in the NIR. We find significant changes of the <b>disk</b> structure in <b>vertical</b> direction, resulting in ~ 1. 5 times larger scale heights and thus vertical velocity dispersions. The radial disk structure, characterized by the cut-off radius and the scale length, shows no statistically significant changes. Thus, the ratio of radial to vertical scale parameters, h/z 0, is ~ 1. 7 times smaller for the sample of interacting/merging galaxies. The total lack of typical flat disk ratios (h/z 0) > 7 in the latter sample implies that <b>vertical</b> <b>disk</b> heating is most efficient for (extremely) thin disks.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Increases in food demand, {{favorable}} commodity {{markets and}} drive towards increasing productivity at a greater economic efficiency have accelerated negative agricultural externalities, particularly erosion and water quality. The {{potential impact of}} these externalities on environmental quality and human health prompted an examination of current and potential production strategies on four important dryfarmed soil associations [...] Walla Walla, Pilot Rock, Ritzville and Athena Soils [...] in the Umatilla County area of Oregon. The objective was to evaluate the economic and environmental costs of reducing soil erosion and leaching through implementing strategies that minimize soil loss and (or) nitrate leaching or offer some trade-offs between the pollutants. Four models [...] the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Micro-computer Budgeting Management System (MBMS), Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Program (NLEAP) and Multi-Objective Linear programming (MOP) [...] were employed to accomplish the study objectives. The results revealed that production strategies that focused on reducing only one pollutant generally exacerbated the other. The mixed objective strategies achieved a simultaneous reduction in both soil erosion and leaching. Once either pollutant had been substantially reduced, further reductions certainly increased the rate of generation of the other. On Walla Walla soil, the most cost effective erosion reducing strategies for winter wheat production included those that involved use of chisel plow for primary tillage under standard conservation practice. Large leachate reductions in winter wheat production were possible by using strategies that involved use of <b>disk</b> <b>plowing</b> for primary tillage followed by chisel plow for secondary tillage and a split fertilizer application. On Pilot Rock soil, production process that involved use of sweep plow for primary tillage with a one time spring fertilizer application and (or) with more farm acreage in spring barley production were least cost strategies that reduced leaching considerably. Soil loss and leaching rates on Ritzville soils were very low, indicating that this soil may {{not be subject to}} soil erosion or leaching problems. For Athena soils, least cost strategies that greatly reduced erosion involved use of chisel or <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> under conservation practices. No strategy was identified to reduce leaching significantly...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (IUE) and X-ray (Exosat) {{observations}} of the eclipsing dwarf nova OY Carinae during the superoutburst of May 1985 are presented. From the lack of X-ray eclipse and UV behavior, it is deduced that the X-ray flux originates in an optically thin corona comparable in size to the Roche lobe, and not directly from the white dwarf or boundary layer. The asymmetric UV line emission originates partly in the accretion disk and partly in a wind. There is a strong modulation of the UV continuum flux that {{is thought to be}} caused by extended <b>vertical</b> <b>disk</b> structure shadowing the inner regions...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{papers have}} shown that the dwarf nova OY Car has an {{extensive}} <b>vertical</b> <b>disk</b> structure during its superoutbursts. This structure is analogous to that seen in the low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), in that the whole disk flares toward its edge, and there is a bulge or 'dark spot' where the mass transfer stream meets the disk edge. The paper presents evidence suggesting that two more dwarf novae may have such a stream impact bulge, which manifests itself as a dip in the UV light curve, analogous to those seen in the X-ray light curves of the LMXB dippers...|$|R
