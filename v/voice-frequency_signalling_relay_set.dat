Since {{the one thing}} the long-distance trunks were definitely able to do was send <b>voice-frequency</b> <b>signals,</b> the Bell System used a selection of tones sent over the trunks to control the system. When calling long-distance, the local end-office switch would first route the call to a special switch which would then convert further dialing into tones and send them over an appropriately selected trunk line (selected with the area code). A similar machine {{at the far end}} of the trunk would decode the tones back into electrical signals, and the call would complete as normal.|$|R

40|$|A Gaussian Interference Channel with an Infrastructure Relay (ICIR) is investigated. The relay has finite-capacity {{links to}} both sources and {{destinations}} that are orthogonal {{to each other}} and to the underlying interference channel. A general achievable rate region is presented by using the relay both to convey additional information from the sources (<b>signal</b> <b>relaying)</b> and to ease interference cancelation (interference forwarding). Outer bounds to the capacity region are also derived, and used to determine a number of regimes of interest where either <b>signal</b> <b>relaying</b> only or both <b>signal</b> <b>relaying</b> and interference forwarding are optimal...|$|R

40|$|Collective {{migration}} {{is a key}} feature of the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum, where the binding of chemoattractants leads to the production and secretion of additional chemoattractant and the <b>relay</b> of the <b>signal</b> to neighboring cells. This then guides cells to migrate collectively in a head-to-tail fashion. We used mutants that were defective in <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> to elucidate which quantitative metrics of cell migration are most strongly affected by <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> and collective motion. We show that neither <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> nor collective motion markedly impact the speed of cell migration. Cells maintained a preferred overall direction of motion for several minutes with similar persistence, {{regardless of whether or}} not they were attracted to moving neighbors, moving collectively in contact with their neighbors, or simply following a fixed exogenous signal. We quantitatively establish that <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> not only increases the number of cells that respond to a chemotactic signal, but most remarkably, also transmits information about the location of the source accurately over large distances, independently of the strength of the exogenous signal. We envision that <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> has a similar key role in the migration of a variety of chemotaxing mammalian cells that can <b>relay</b> chemoattractant <b>signals...</b>|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{the total}} number of users in the cell (macro+ 2 <b>relay</b> <b>sets)</b> vary from 54 to 100. A 30 % {{overhead}} would be incurred for downlink signaling. In addition, the frame durations are split evenly between the three user types: <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 1, <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 2, and macro. Taking the overhead and frame splits into account, we thus target a bit loading corresponding to 2304 bits in a 0.5 -ms time slot for providing 1 Mbps data rate.|$|R
30|$|It {{is noted}} that the 24 macro-users and 24 <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 2 users were most often {{successfully}} supported served by the scheduler for their requested data rate of 500 kbps which {{is lower than the}} 1 Mbps requested by <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 1 users.|$|R
30|$|Importantly, {{we observe}} that this {{performance}} benefit is obtained even while avoiding {{interference in the}} inter-frame allocations. This interference avoidance is done via silencing the base station feeder link to <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 1 when any <b>relay</b> in <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 2 starts its transmission.|$|R
30|$|This high {{performance}} of macro-only case {{when there are}} high number of <b>relay</b> <b>sets</b> {{is caused by the}} combinatorial effect of admission control and multi-user diversity. In the case of cell-GBRS relaying, even though it is more resource efficient and the combinatorial effect of admission control and multi-user diversity still exists, the lack of feeder link resources becomes a limitation for high number of <b>relay</b> <b>sets.</b> Thus, we see that the macro-only and cell-GBRS cases converge as the number of <b>relay</b> <b>sets</b> increase.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} rodents suggest that {{maternal}} immune activation (MIA) by viral infection {{is associated with}} schizophrenia and autism in offspring. Although maternal IL- 6 is though t to be a possible mediator relating MIA induced these neuropsychiatric disorders, the mech-anism remains to be elucidated. Previously, we reported that the maternal leukemia inhibito-ry factor (LIF) –placental ACTH–fetal LIF <b>signaling</b> <b>relay</b> pathway (maternal–fetal LIF <b>signal</b> <b>relay)</b> promotes neurogenesis of fetal cerebrum in rats. Here we report that the maternal– fetal LIF <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> in mice is suppressed by injection of polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid into dams, which induces MIA at 12. 5 days post-coitum. Maternal IL- 6 levels and gene expression of placental suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs 3) increased according to the severity of MIA and gene expression of placental Socs 3 correlated with maternal IL- 6 levels. Furthermore, we show that MIA causes reduction of LIF level in the fetal cerebrospi-nal fluid, resulting in the decreased neurogenesis in the cerebrum. These findings suggest that maternal IL- 6 interferes the maternal–fetal LIF <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> by inducing SOCS 3 in the placenta and leads to decreased neurogenesis...|$|R

Figure 1 shows {{an example of}} three dedicated frames, one for users of <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 1, one for <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> 2 users, and one for macro-users. The introduction of dedicated frames provides fairness by pre-allocating equal number of resources to each <b>relay</b> <b>set</b> and macro-users.

30|$|Large-scale and {{wireless}} <b>signal</b> <b>relays.</b> When using wireless signals, {{the relationship between}} the transmitted power P and the transmitted distance d is P ∝ d^n, where 3 < n < 4. Thus, doubling the transmission distance d requires increasing the transmission power from 8 to 16 times [29]. To save energy, the wireless transmission range of a node is from a few meters to a few hundred meters. Subsequently, even for monitoring areas of moderate size, large amounts of nodes are needed. As a result, packet transmission usually requires a large number of wireless <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> hops, which increases the provenance’s size.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} relaying in interference-limited networks by studying a two-user Gaussian interference channel with a relay (ICR). Various models for relay reception and transmission are possible: The relay can receive and transmit in the same band as the sources (i. e., in-band relay reception / transmission), or else relay reception, or both reception and transmission, can take place over orthogonal links of limited capacity (i. e., out-of-band relay reception or / and transmission). In all scenarios, the selection of either <b>signal</b> <b>relaying,</b> interference forwarding or a combination thereof for the relay operation is identified as a common design choice. While <b>signal</b> <b>relaying</b> enables the destination to obtain a stronger desired signal or additional information, interference forwarding helps removing part of the interference. Important scenarios under which <b>signal</b> <b>relaying</b> and interference forwarding are optimal are identified, including cognitive relaying where the relay is unaware of the source codebooks and out-of band relaying, both under certain modified strong interference conditions and the latter under additional capacity constraints on the orthogonal relay links.

40|$|Dictyostelium cells form a {{multicellular}} organism {{through the}} aggregation of independent cells. This process requires both chemotaxis and <b>signal</b> <b>relay</b> {{in which the}} chemoattractant cAMP activates adenylyl cyclase through the G protein-coupled cAMP receptor cAR 1. cAMP is produced and secreted and it activates receptors on neighboring cells, thereby <b>relaying</b> the chemoattractant <b>signal</b> to distant cells. Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analyses, we have identified a TOR-containing complex in Dictyostelium that {{is related to the}} TORC 2 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and regulates both chemotaxis and <b>signal</b> <b>relay.</b> We demonstrate that mutations in Dictyostelium LST 8, RIP 3, and Pia, orthologues of the yeast TORC 2 components LST 8, AVO 1, and AVO 3, exhibit a common set of phenotypes including reduced cell polarity, chemotaxis speed and directionality, phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and the related PKBR 1, and activation of adenylyl cyclase. Further, we provide evidence for a role of Ras in the regulation of TORC 2.
