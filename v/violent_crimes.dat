40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sci.) -Univesity of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2010. Talk of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> in South Africa abounds, with {{criminal}} {{violence as a}} topic of discussion on many social platforms - from the President‟s State of the Nation address to conversations between people on the street. This study aims to explore the discourses that South Africans use in their accounts of <b>violent</b> <b>crime,</b> what presentation of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> is constructed {{through the use of}} these discourses, and the effects of such constructions. Using Wetherell and Potter‟s (1992) approach to discourse analysis, the transcripts from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with fifteen participants were analysed to identify and examine the discourses that participants drew on to construct an account of <b>violent</b> <b>crime.</b> Seven central themes were identified in the transcripts. These pertained to the causes of <b>violent</b> <b>crime,</b> the effects of <b>violent</b> <b>crime,</b> prevention and deterrence, victims, responsibility, perpetrators and categorisation of „good‟ and „bad‟ criminals. In the study each of the themes is examined in turn to explore the discourses that are drawn on in the construction of each theme and the presentation of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> that is constructed through the use of these discourses. Analysis of the discourses shows that the construction of crime, criminals and victims is complex and that this is often done {{in such a way as}} to manage the threat of <b>violent</b> <b>crime.</b> It also shows that race „colours‟ the way we see, understand and construct <b>violent</b> <b>crime.</b> Yet this is not only about the identification of others as particular kinds of people but also about self-identifying, as people actively construct their own identity when constructing <b>violent</b> <b>crime.</b> The way in which we construct <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> therefore has important implications for the way in which we experience others as well as ourselves. It also has important implications for the interventions that are used and proposed for managing <b>violent</b> <b>crime.</b> An understanding of these discourses and constructions of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> will allow us to more effectively evaluate the assumptions on which these interventions are based and thus improve the interventions themselves...|$|R
40|$|Every day in America, {{a case of}} <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> makes {{headlines}} {{across the}} television, newspapers, websites, and social media. These tragedies deeply affect those directly involved and the communities in which the crimes take place. Not only are individuals physically and mentally affected by <b>violent</b> <b>crime,</b> but communities and cities suffer an economic loss from rising <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates. Reducing the current rates of <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> (robbery, assaults, rapes, and murders) can reduce costs for cities and taxpayers, while ultimately {{improving the quality of}} life for Americans. Research into what affects <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates lead to discoveries that unemployment, gun ownership, and more interestingly, temperature, were some of the factors that affects a cityâ€™s <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rate. This study aims to expound on the temperature variable by examining a previously unstudied variable â€“ latitude â€“ on a cityâ€™s <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rate. This study aims to conduct an economic analysis through multi-variable regressions in support of the hypothesis that the latitude of a city does in fact have significance in a cityâ€™s <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rate.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{investigates the}} relationships between measures of civic community, population change, and <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates in rural communi-ties. Rural communities that are civically robust are hypothesized to have lower <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates and to experience less change in <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> over time. Alternatively, sustained population change is hypothesized to elevate <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> rates and to moderate the protective effect that civic robustness provides against <b>violent</b> <b>crime</b> over time. Results from both lagged panel and cross-sectional negative binomial regression models of county-level data support these expectations. In substan-tive terms, {{these findings suggest that}} civically robust communities are much better positioned to weather population change than civically weak communities, but continuous change over time compromises the protective effect that civic robustness provides against serious crime...|$|R

5|$|The five-officer Omak Police Department detachment, which {{covered the}} {{municipality}} and nearby rural communities, reported over 180 criminal code offenses in 2010.

According to Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2011, there were 19 <b>violent</b> <b>crimes</b> and 166 property crimes. The <b>violent</b> <b>crimes</b> consisted of one forcible rape, three robberies and 15 aggravated assaults, while 32 burglaries, 104 larceny-thefts, eight motor vehicle thefts and one arson defined the property crimes. The FBI classifies Omak as having 4,921 people located within the Omak Police Department area. The city's highest crime rate was recorded in 2004, with 413 incidents per 100,000 people. Until 2013, when a murder and motor-vehicle theft occurred in the city, there had not been a homicide for over ten consecutive years. The crime in Omak has decreased throughout the past decade. Before marijuana was legalized in Washington, marijuana users were arrested, per state law. Growers, drug lords and international smugglers residing in the Omak area are still arrested.|$|E

5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for <b>violent</b> <b>crimes,</b> but still a minority of the population.

5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for <b>violent</b> <b>crimes</b> per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino.
