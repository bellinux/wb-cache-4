40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the osteogenic {{potential}} of a synthetic and a demineralized bone matrix (DBM) putty using a cranial defect model in New Zealand white rabbits. Paired, bilateral critical-size defects (10 mm) were prepared in the frontal bones of 12 rabbits and filled with either OsteoSelect DBM Putty or NovaBone calcium-phosphosilicate putty. At days 43 and 91, 6 rabbits were killed and examined <b>via</b> semiquantitative <b>histology</b> and quantitative histomorphometry. Defects filled with the DBM putty were histologically associated with less inflammation and fibrous tissue in the defect and more new bone than the synthetic counterpart at both time points. Histomorphometric analysis re-vealed that the defects filled with DBM putty were associated with significantly more bone formation at day 43 (70. 7 % vs 40. 7 %, P = 0. 043) and at day 91 (70. 4 % vs 39. 9 %, P = 0. 0044). The amount of residual implant was similar for both test groups at each time point. Key Words: Bone regeneration, calvarial defect, demineralized bone matrix, bone graft substitute, DBM putt...|$|R

The classification problem studied by Khan et al. {{is related to the}} diagnosis of small round blue cell tumours (SRBCT) of childhood which are difficult to classify both clinically and <b>via</b> routine <b>histology.</b> Golub et al. study acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We used a simulated annealing-based method in learning a system of perceptrons, each obtained by resampling of the training set. Our results are comparable to those of Khan et al. and Golub et al., indicating that there is a role for perceptrons in the classification of tumours based on gene-expression data. We also show that it is critical to perform feature selection in this type of models, i. e. we propose a method for identifying genes that might be significant for the particular tumour types. For SRBCTs, zero error on test data has been obtained for only 13 out of 2308 genes; for the ALL/AML problem, we have zero error for 9 out of 7129 genes that are used for the classification procedure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Epicurean-style learning and simulated annealing-based search are both essential for obtaining the best classification results...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To study {{explanted}} stent-grafts {{to achieve}} {{a better understanding of}} the mecha-nisms of failure after endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Methods: Twelve stent-grafts were harvested at autopsy (n 3) or during surgical conver-sion (n 9). Device alterations were investigated by macroscopic examination, radiography, and surface analysis techniques. Healing around the implants was studied <b>via</b> <b>histology</b> and immunohistochemistry, with particular attention to the stent-graft/tissue interface. Results: Degradation was more important with Vanguard stent-grafts (off the market) than with AneuRx and Talent stent-grafts, but rupture of nitinol wires and poor surface finish in Talent stent-grafts raise concern about their corrosion resistance and long-term stability. Poor healing was observed around stent-grafts even after several years of implantation, with absence of vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and collagen formation.

40|$|The loss of {{cartilage}} tissue due to trauma, tumour {{surgery or}} congenital defects, such as microtia and anotia, {{is one of}} the major concerns in head and neck surgery. Recently tissue-engineering approaches, including gene delivery, have been proposed for the regeneration of cartilage tissue. In this study, primary chondrocytes were genetically modified with plasmid-encoding bone morphogenetic protein- 7 (BMP- 7) via the commercially available non-viral Turbofect vector, with the aim of bringing ex vivo transfected chondrocytes to resynthesize BMP- 7 in vitro as they would in vivo.

40|$|Type II Diabetes (T 2 DM) {{dramatically}} impairs the tendon healing response, {{resulting in}} decreased collagen organization and mechanics relative to non-diabetic tendons. Despite this burden, {{there remains a}} paucity of information regarding the mechanisms that govern impaired healing of diabetic tendons. Mice were placed on either a high fat diet (T 2 DM) or low fat diet (lean) and underwent flexor tendon transection and repair surgery. Healing was assessed <b>via</b> mechanical testing, <b>histology</b> and changes in gene expression associated with collagen synthesis, matrix remodeling, and macrophage polarization. Obese/diabetic tendons healed with increased scar formation and impaired mechanical properties. Consistent with this, prolonged and excess expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components were observed in obese/T 2 DM tendons. Macrophages are involved in both inflammatory and matrix deposition processes during healing. Obese/T 2 DM tendons healed with increased expression of markers of pro-inflammatory M 1 macrophages, and elevated and prolonged expression of M 2 macrophages markers {{that are involved in}} ECM deposition. Here we demonstrate that tendons from obese/diabetic mice heal with increased scar formation and increased M 2 polarization, identifying excess M 2 macrophage activity and matrix synthesis as a potential mechanism of the fibrotic healing phenotype observed in T 2 DM tendons, and as such a potential target to improve tendon healing in T 2 DM...|$|R
40|$|Background: Treatment {{of large}} bone defects due to trauma, tumor resection, or {{congenital}} abnormalities is challenging. Bone tissue engineering using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represents a promising treatment option. However, {{the quantity and}} quality of engineered bone tissue are not sufficient to fill large bone defects. The aim of this study was to determine if the addition of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) improves in vitro chondrogenic priming of MSCs to ultimately improve in vivo MSC mediated endochondral bone formation. Methods: MSCs were chondrogenically differentiated in 2. 0 × 105 cell pellets in medium supplemented with TGFβ 3 in the absence or presence of 1, 10, or 100 μg/mL EMD. Samples were analyzed for gene expression of RUNX 2, Col II, Col X, and Sox 9. Protein and glycoaminoglycan (GAG) production were also investigated <b>via</b> DMB assays, <b>histology,</b> and immunohistochemistry. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity were also assessed. Results: The addition of EMD did not negatively affect chondrogenic differentiation of adult human MSCs. EMD did not appear to alter GAG production or expression of chondrogenic genes. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were also unaffected though a trend toward decreased adipogenic gene expression was observed. Conclusion: EMD does not affect chondrogenic differentiation of adult human MSCs. As such the use of EMD in combination with chondrogenically primed MSCs for periodontal bone tissue repair is unlikely to have negative effects on MSC differentiation...|$|R

Background The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has dramatically increased and esophageal cancer {{is now the}} sixth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Mortality rates remain high among patients with advanced stage disease and esophagectomy is as-sociated with high complication rates. Hence, early identification of potentially metastatic disease would better guide treatment strategies. Methods The modified Levrat’s surgery was performed to induce EAC in Sprague-Dawley rats.

40|$|Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) {{has been}} {{frequently}} used in spinal surgery with good clinical results. The material {{has a low}} elastic modulus and is radiolucent. However, in oral implantology PEEK has displayed inferior ability to osseointegrate compared to titanium materials. One idea to reinforce PEEK would be to coat it with hydroxyapatite (HA), a ceramic material of good biocompatibility. In the present study we analyzed HA-coated PEEK tibial implants <b>via</b> <b>histology</b> and radiography when following up at 3 and 12 weeks. Of the 48 implants, 24 were HA-coated PEEK screws (test) and another 24 implants served as uncoated PEEK controls. HA-coated PEEK implants were always osseointegrated. The total bone area (BA) was higher for test compared to control implants at 3 (p < 0. 05) and 12 weeks (p < 0. 05). Mean bone implant contact (BIC) percentage was significantly higher (p = 0. 024) for the test compared to control implants at 3 weeks and higher without statistical significance at 12 weeks. The effect of HA-coating was concluded to be significant with respect to early bone formation, and HA-coated PEEK implants may represent a good material to serve as bone anchored clinical devices...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cement (CPC) {{is used in}} bone repair {{because of}} its biocompatibility. However, high similarity between CPC and the natural osseous phase results in poor image contrast {{in most of the}} available in vivo imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For accurate identification and localization during and after implantation in vivo, a composition with enhanced image contrast is needed. In this study, we labeled CPC with perfluoro- 15 -crown- 5 -ether-loaded (PFCE) poly(latic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (hydrodynamic radius 100 nm) and gold nanoparticles (diameter 40 nm), as 19 F MRI and CT contrast agents, respectively. The resulting CPC/PFCE/gold composite is implanted in a rat model for in vivo longitudinal imaging. Our findings show that the incorporation of the two types of different nanoparticles did result in adequate handling properties of the cement. Qualitative and quantitative long-term assessment of CPC/PFCE/gold degradation was achieved in vivo and correlated to the new bone formation. Finally, no adverse biological effects on the bone tissue are observed <b>via</b> <b>histology.</b> In conclusion, an easy and efficient strategy for following CPC implantation and degradation in vivo is developed. As all materials used are biocompatible, this CPC/PFCE/gold composite is clinically applicable...|$|E

40|$|Background Transplant vasculopathy (TV) is a {{major cause}} for late graft loss after cardiac transplantation. Endothelial damage and T cell {{infiltration}} play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of TV. Because N-octanoyl dopamine (NOD) inhibits vascular inflammation and suppresses T cell activation in vitro, we here tested the hypothesis that NOD treatment ameliorates TV. Methods Aortic grafts were orthotopically transplanted in the Dark Agouti to Brown Norway strain combination. Recipient rats were treated with NOD or vehicle administered <b>via</b> osmotic minipumps. <b>Histology</b> and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were performed on nontransplanted aortas and grafts explanted 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation to assess the degree of TV, inflammation, apoptosis, and number of (proliferating) smooth muscle actin (SMA) (+) neointimal cells. In vitro analyses of human aortic smooth muscle cells were performed to test the effect of NOD on proliferation (WST- 1 assay), cell cycle (flow cytometry and qPCR), and cytokine-induced apoptosis (flow cytometry). Results Allografts from vehicle-treated recipients developed neointimal lesions predominantly consisting of SMA-expressing cells. NOD treatment significantly reduced neointima formation and neointimal SMA(+) cells. In situ, smooth muscle cell proliferation (Ki 67) was not influenced by NOD. Macrophage (CD 68), T (CD 3), and Natural Killer (ANK 61) cell infiltration as well as intragraft TNF and IFN mRNA expression were similar in both groups. Medial apoptosis (cleaved caspase- 3) was significantly reduced by NOD. In vitro, NOD inhibited proliferation of human aortic smooth muscle cells by causing a G 1 -arrest and protected from TNF-induced apoptosis. Conclusions This study identified NOD as potential treatment modality to attenuate TV. Our data clearly support a vasculoprotective effect of NOD by reducing smooth muscle cell proliferation and inflammation-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diffusion {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) is the current-state-of-the-art technique to clinically investigate acute (0 – 24  h) ischemic stroke tissue. However, reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) —considered a marker of tissue damage—was observed to reverse spontaneously during the subacute stroke phase (24 – 72  h) which means that low ADC cannot be used to reflect the damaged tissue after 24  h in experimental and clinical studies. One reason for the change in ADC is that ADC values drop with cytotoxic edema (acute phase) and rise when vasogenic edema begins (subacute phase). Recently, combined 1 H- and 23 Na-MRI was proposed as a more accurate approach to improve delineation between reversible (penumbra) and irreversible ischemic injury (core). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of reperfusion on the ADC and the sodium MRI signal after experimental ischemic stroke in rats in well-defined areas of different viability levels of the cerebral lesion, i. e. core and penumbra as defined <b>via</b> perfusion and <b>histology.</b> Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in male rats by using the intraluminal filament technique. MRI sodium, perfusion and diffusion measurement was recorded before reperfusion, shortly after reperfusion and 24  h after reperfusion. The animals were reperfused after 90  min of ischemia. Results: Sodium signal in core did not change before reperfusion, increased after reperfusion while sodium signal in penumbra was significantly reduced before reperfusion, but showed no changes after reperfusion compared to control. The ADC was significantly decreased in core tissue at all three time points compared to contralateral side. This decrease recovered above commonly applied viability thresholds in the core after 24  h. Conclusions: Reduced sodium-MRI signal in conjunction with reduced ADC can serve as a viability marker for penumbra detection and complement hydrogen diffusion- and perfusion-MRI in order to facilitate time-independent assessment of tissue fate and cellular bioenergetics failure in stroke patients...|$|R

Of the 16 cats reviewed, seven cats had ischemic infarctions, five had hemorrhagic infarctions, and four were diagnosed with intracranial hemorrhage. The median age was 8 yr and 9. 5 yr in cats with infarctions and intracranial hemorrhages, respectively. Clinical signs were severe, acute, consistent with the localization of the cerebrovascular lesion, and influenced by underlying pathology. Four cats with infarction showed lateralized neurologic signs. Four cats with infarctions were diagnosed with pulmonary disease antemortem and three cats had hyperthyroidism. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and computed tomography scans were available in two cats. None of the infarctions were grossly visible. All cats with hemorrhagic infarcts had severe liver pathology and nephritis was identified in four cats. Hypoxia was a feature in four cats and one cat suffered cardiac failure.

METHODS: Women having limited access to health-care facilities were screened by trained doctors using VIA. If the test was positive, biopsies were taken and when eligible, women were directly treated with cryotherapy. Follow-up was performed with VIA and cytology after 6 months. When cervical cancer was suspected or diagnosed, women were referred. The positivity rate, positive predictive value (PPV) and approximate specificity of the VIA test were calculated. The detection rate for cervical lesions was given. RESULTS: Screening results were completed in 22 040 women, of whom 92. 7 % had never been screened. Visual inspection with acetic acid was positive in 4. 4 %. The PPV of VIA to detect CIN I or greater and CIN II or greater was 58. 7 % and 29. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: HIV-infected {{women are}} at high risk for {{cervical}} dysplasia/cancer. Pap smear screening is not available or feasible in many resource poor countries. We sought to evaluate the performance of VIA for cervical dysplasia/cancer screening in comparison with Pap smear. Methods: 268 HIV-infected women were screened simultaneously by a physician for Pap smear and VIA from January to December 2005 in a Women´s HIV clinic in Cambodia. Household vinegar was applied to the cervix under illumination and magnified by digital camera after 2 - 3 minutes. VIA were graded as negative acetowhite (normal) or positive acetowhite (low grade, HPV, or high grade). Pap smears were read by telepathology at the University of Basel, Switzerland Pathology Department based on the Bethesda classification. Results: Demographics of the women: mean age = 32 yrs (18 - 53), mean CD 4 count = 282 /mm 3 (2 - 1221), 117 / 268 (44 %) were on HAART. No data was available for 8 patients. Out of the 260 women, 205 (79 %) were diagnosed as normal on VIA and Pap smear. 15 (5. 8 %) were positive on both VIA and Pap smear (11 concordant, 4 non-concordant). 34 (13 %) were positive by VIA only (2 HPV, 22 low grade, 10 high grade) and 6 (2. 3 %) were positive by Pap smear only (1 HPV, 4 low grade, 1 high grade). The sensitivity of VIA was 71 %. The specificity was 86 %. Positive predictive value was 31 % and negative predictive value was 97 %. Mean CD 4 among patients with high-grade lesions by VIA was 148. Conclusions: VIA appears to be a reasonable screening tool for cervical abnormalities among HIV-infected women in resource limited settings where Pap smears are not readily available. Under these circumstances, we believe that abnormal VIA results should be followed by colposcopy or biopsy for confirmation.

40|$|The basic {{structural}} and chemical {{properties of the}} porous TiO 2 /glass composite Ecopore suggest that this novel material {{could be used as}} bone replacement. Ecopore is non-toxic and permits a limited cellular adhesion and growth on its surface. In order to optimize ingrowth of bone tissue in vivo, the aim of the work was to enhance adhesion and growth of bone forming cells on the composite via surface modification as well as the implementation of an osteoinductive system. The biochemical modification comprised acid and alkaline etching of the surface, respectively, and functionalization with aminosilane. Alkaline etching was most effective for the subsequent binding of silane. Silanized Ecopore was covalently coated with the cell adhesion mediator fibronectin and the osteoinductive factor BMP- 2, respectively, using a homobifunctional crosslinker with a polyethylene glycol spacer. A fraction of 60 % of the totally bound protein was adsorbed on Ecopore in both cases. In vitro studies revealed that human osteoblasts showed a better spreading and proliferation on fibronectin-coated compared to unmodified Ecopore. BMP- 2 -responsive embryonal fibroblasts proliferated on BMP- 2 -coated Ecopore, but only displayed a minor induction of alkaline phosphatase. This indicated that most of the BMP- 2 was inactivated after immobilization. Fibronectin-, BMP- 2 -coated, etched and unmodified Ecopore was implanted into rabbit femora. The animals received a weekly injection of fluorescent bone markers to quantify ingrowth of bone. After 6 weeks, cross sections of preparations of the implants were investigated <b>via</b> microscopy. <b>Histology</b> revealed no indication for inflammation {{in the vicinity of the}} implants. Ecopore and bone tissue established direct contact to each other without remaining gaps. In case of both protein-coated implant groups, bone apposition rates were significantly higher compared to the unmodified and etched controls, according to the distances of fluorescence-marked growth zones. Quantification of the totally ingrown bone via energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that bone was significantly most abundant in the fibronectin-coated group, whereas there was no significantly higher bone fraction in the BMP- 2 -coated group. According to the limited effectiveness of the BMP- 2 coating, an alternative strategy was pursued in the next part of the study. Ecopore was filled with heparinized collagen sponge to realize a surface-independent release system for BMP- 2. The surface was blocked with serum albumin prior filling to prevent adsorption of the osteoinductive factor. The release of BMP- 2 was retarded in the case of heparinized compared to unmodified collagen filling. The released factor induced alkaline phosphatase in embryonal fibroblasts, indicating unimpaired biological functionality. In the described animal model, unfilled, collagen filled as well as additionally heparinized Ecopore was compared, with the filled versions optionally loaded with BMP- 2. After 6 weeks, bridging of the defect gap and partial ingrowth only occured in the BMP- 2 -loaded heparinized group. Throughout this experiment, osteoconduction was less compared to the results of the surface modification study, indicating passivation of the surface after blocking with albumin. As a summary, Ecopore is a material which can be easily manufactured using highly available components and which shows basic biocompatibility. Its surface could be effectively functionalized with fibronectin, whereas BMP- 2 coating was almost ineffective. The combination with collagen matrix allowed a reversible binding and release of biologically functional BMP- 2. The suitability of Ecopore as bone replacement is restricted according to the limited mechanical strength, the heterogeneous structure of the pore system and the irreversible adsorption of proteins. In the field of hard tissue replacement, the gained experience nevertheless can be used in projects based on alternative carrier materials...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary reports showing {{negative}} temporal {{trends in}} human sperm quality {{have provided a}} weight of evidence, in spite of recognised methodological weaknesses of the early research, strongly indicative of declining male fertility {{over the past six}} decades. Other aspects of human male reproductive development, such as hypospadias, cryptorchidism and testis cancer are also showing negative trends in incidence and geographic variation in prevalence. Together these negative changes in parameters of fertility, which have comorbidity, are termed Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome (TDS). The relative short time period of the trend data and the spatial heterogeneity of these factors suggest an environmental aetiology. Two neighboring and ethno-linguistic similar countries, Denmark and Finland, are used as evidence of this as Denmark has significantly decreased sperm quality as well as an increased incidence of other aspects of TDS when compared to neighboring Finland. Additionally, exposure to persistent environmental chemical pollutants has been associated with decreased sperm quality and increases in other components of TDS. The suggested underlying cause of TDS is perturbed foetal/embryonal programming and reproductive development. In spite of overall poor epidemiological information and a paucity of empirical research data from companion animals there are suggestions that environmental pollutants are affecting the health of cats and dogs. Indeed, the dog may be a relevant research model as it shares our environment and ill health associated with it, such as human TDS. Based on the evidence of environmental pollutants affecting human and animal reproductive development and fertility, this PhD project was developed in order to determine if man’s closest companion, and the animal which wholly shares our environment, demonstrates any parallel reproductive impairment. Specifically, this thesis aims to investigate negative temporal trends related to canine fertility, determine the presence of and geographic variation in tissue concentrations of exemplar environmental pollutants and examine testes tissue and sperm cells, <b>via</b> culture and <b>histology,</b> for association between chemical concentrations and quantitative assessments. Canine testes were collected from three countries; UK (n = 58), Finland (Helsinki region) (n = 20), Denmark (Copenhagen region) (n = 10). These samples were tested for concentrations of three representative chemical groups: PCBs, PBDEs, DEHP. Samples of commercial dog food (n = 28), and a range of canine body fluid was also analysed for these same chemical groups. A retrospective analysis of database information from a population of service dogs in the UK was used to determine temporal trends in canine sperm quality and cryptorchidism over a 26 year period. The concentrations of the three chemical pollutant types were additionally analysed against land use with a Geographic Information System (GIS) and two CORINE land use categories: Artificial and Agricultural. These tissues were assessed histologically using histomorphometric scores, CYP 11 A 1 area stained. Canine testes tissue and sperm were cultured with PCB 153 and DEHP to determine direct effects of short term exposures to environmental pollutants by assessing testosterone production (testes explant culture), motility (CASA), sperm viability (hypo osmotic swelling test, chromatin integrity, live:dead ratio). Database analysis of service dog fertility reported two components of TDS: negative temporal trends in sperm quality and a concurrent increased incidence of cryptorchidism. Samples of canine testes tissue contained measurable concentrations of three exemplar pollutants (PCBs, PBDEs, DEHP). These pollutants were also largely present in commercial dog food and some were also present in prostatic fluid, full ejaculate and bitches milk. The profile of EDs and concentrations of specific chemicals showed significant variation across three regions of the UK (Southeast, East Midlands, and West Midlands). Notably, concentrations of legacy industrial chemicals (PCBs, PBDEs) were highest in the West Midlands and phthalate (DEHP) was highest in the southeast. The concentrations of DEHP was significantly higher in Artificial land categories compared to tissue collected in Agricultural land use areas (P< 0. 05). Canine testis samples collected from three international regions contained concentrations of PCBs and DEHP which were significantly higher in the UK (P< 0. 05) and PBDEs which were significantly higher in Finland (P< 0. 05). The histomorphometric assessment of testes showed significant variations across the three countries. The quantification of immunohistochemical testis area stained for CYP 11 A 1 from the three countries showed a significant variation (P= 0. 0001), and tissue from Denmark showed a significant association between area stained and concentrations of DEHP (P< 0. 05). Tissue exposed, via testes explant culture, to PCB 153 and DEHP at two concentrations showed no significant blunting of LH stimulated testosterone secretion. Sperm exposed, via culturing with two environmentally relevant concentrations of PCB 153 and DEHP, exhibited significantly increased (P< 0. 05) and decreased (P< 0. 05) measures of motility with these chemicals respectively. Additionally sperm viability, measured using the hypo osmotic swelling assay, was significantly reduced in the presence of PCB 153 (P< 0. 05) and a significant increased when cultured with DEHP (P< 0. 01). Both chemicals significantly increased sperm DNA fragmentation. Additionally, short term exposure to both chemicals significantly reduced the Live:Dead ratio of sperm (P< 0. 05). Robust, determinative evidence of negative trends in canine sperm quality and incidence of cryptorchidism indicate that canine and human male fertility are decreasing in parallel. An environmental aetiology is supported by the presence of environmental chemicals in canine diet, testes tissue, prostatic fluid and full canine ejaculate. Geographic differences (National and International) in testis chemical profiles and concentrations may equate with reported regional differences in human TDS. In support of this hypothesis, specific canine testis chemical concentrations were associated with histomorphometric scores from the same cohort of samples. Direct effects of PCB 153 and DEHP on sperm motility and viability may be indicative of an alternative acute negative effect on male fertility. These data suggest that the dog, while living in a shared environment with humans, exhibits some parameters of TDS and that canine, as well human, male fertility is declining due to exposure to environmental chemicals...|$|R

BW females mated to PO males (female bw × male po) produce viable growth-retarded offspring. In contrast, PO females mated to BW males (female PO × male BW) produce overgrown but dysmorphic conceptuses. Most female PO × male BW offspring are dead by midgestation; those surviving to later time points display numerous defects reminiscent of several diseases. The hybrid effects are particularly {{pronounced in the}} placenta. Here we examine placental morphological defects <b>via</b> <b>histology</b> and in situ hybridization {{as well as the}} relationship between growth and mortality in the female PO × male BW cross.

Further, we show that both cellular proliferation and death are abnormal in the hybrids through BrdU incorporation and TUNEL assays, respectively. Together the data indicate that the origin of the effects is prior to the equivalent of Mus E 10.

In this study, the biological effects of low-dose radiation on stimulating osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and fracture healing were identified using in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal studies. First, low-dose (0. 5 Gy) X-ray irradiation induced the cell viability and proliferation of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells. However, high-dose (5 Gy) X-ray irradiation inhibited the viability and proliferation of osteoblasts. In addition, dynamic variations in osteoblast differentiation markers, including type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, Runx 2, Osterix and osteocalcin, were observed after both low-dose and high-dose irradiation by Western blot analysis. Second, fracture healing was evaluated <b>via</b> <b>histology</b> and gene expression after single-dose X-ray irradiation, and low-dose X-ray irradiation accelerates fracture healing of closed femoral fractures in rats. In low-dose X-ray irradiated fractures, {{an increase in}} proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -positive cells, cartilage formation and fracture calluses was observed. In addition, we observed more rapid completion of endochondral and intramembranous ossification, which was accompanied by altered expression of genes involved in bone remodeling and fracture callus mineralization. Although the expression level of several osteoblast differentiation genes was increased in the fracture calluses of high-dose irradiated rats, the callus formation and fracture union were delayed compared with the control and low-dose irradiated fractures.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the mechanism by which IL- 6 might modulates TGF- 2 receptors in skin. Skin from WT, IL- 6 over-expressing mice and IL- 6 treated keratinocyte cultures was analysed for TGF- 2 RI and TGF- 2 RII expression <b>via</b> <b>histology,</b> PCR and flow cytometry. Receptor function was assessed by cell migration, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) proliferation assays, and Smad 7 expression and Smad 2 / 3 phosphorylation. Receptor localization within the membrane was determined by co-immunoprecipitation. IL- 6 overexpression and treatment increased TGF- 2 RII expression in the epidermis. IL- 6 treatment of keratinocytes induced TGF- 2 RI and II expression and augmented TGF- 21 -induced function as demonstrated through increased migration and decreased proliferation. Additionally, IL- 6 treatment of keratinocytes altered receptor activity as indicated by altered Smad 2 / 3 phosphorylation and increased Smad 7 and membrane localization. These results suggest that IL- 6 regulates keratinocyte function by modulating TGF- 2 RI and II expression and signal transduction via trafficking of the receptor to lipid raft pools.

40|$|Part 1 : Monitoring Response to Single-Dose (1000 cGy) Radiotherapy in a RIF- 1 Tumor Model The current {{standard}} of measure for monitoring chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic treatment response is tumor volume. Unfortunately, changes in tumor volume are generally slow and tumor volume {{does not necessarily}} indicate the degree of tumor viability. The development of marker(s) {{with the ability to}} detect an early therapeutic response would greatly aid in patient management, opening the possibility for both rapid dose optimization and replacement of ineffective therapies with alternative treatment. Previous studies have shown that diffusion measurements using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are sensitive to therapy-induced changes in cellular structure, allowing demarcation between regions of necrosis and viable tumor tissue. This sensitivity, based on the correlation between water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and tumor cellular density, may allow diffusion measurements to be employed in non-invasive monitoring of treatment response. Therapy-induced increases in tumor ADC preceding tumor regression have been reported in a variety of experimental tumor models and several human brain tumors. Despite the demonstrated diffusion sensitivity to therapeutic response in these particular studies, shortcomings still remain that hinder the efficacy of clinical application in oncology. Earlier studies have concentrated on the mean ADC present within the tumor, either within the entire tumor volume or a region of-interest (ROI) defined by the user, and their evolution pre-treatment and post-treatment. Because of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, volume-averaged ADC measurements suffer from poor correlation with treatment efficacy. In addition, most studies make little or no attempt to characterize the entire tumor volume (necrotic, viable, edema). The identification of regions of differing tissue viability should aid in the staging of treatment, therefore making accurate and reproducible tissue segmentation an important goal. The results of earlier, single-parameter studies indicate that a multi-parametric approach in which several MR parameters are monitored (ADC, T 2, M 0) may provide greater power than that of the single parameter approach. A multi-parametric or multi-spectral (MS) analysis uses pattern-recognition techniques, such as clustering, for image segmentation. Clustering algorithms use characteristics of the multiple MR-parameter dataset to group tissue of similar type, e. g., fat, muscle, viable tumor, necrosis. Specifically, k-means (KM) is an unsupervised segmentation algorithm that groups together similar tissue based on the difference in MR parameter space between the image voxel of interest and the mean parameter values of the voxels in that cluster. In the first step of the classification algorithm, it is applied to separate the data into two clusters (k = 2), tissue and background noise voxels. All voxels classified as background noise are set to zero and removed from further processing. In the second step, KM is applied to the remaining tissue voxels to segment the data into multiple tissue types. In the case of tumors, it is not clear in advance how many different types of tissue exist. The number of clusters, k, should be varied to ensure that all relationships between tissues are found. In the final step, the resulting KM maps may be compared to histological slices taken from the same tissue as the imaging slices in order to identify the tissue type of each cluster. In line with the studies and analyses described above, quantitative MRI was performed to investigate the spatial correlation between ADC, spin-spin (T 2) relaxation times, and proton density (M 0) in murine radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF- 1) tumors following single-dose (l 000 cGy) radiotherapy using the KM algorithm (Chapters 3 and 4) and different combinations of features and/or clusters. For all cluster/feature combinations, an in-depth comparison between KM-derived volume estimates and conventional <b>histology</b> <b>via</b> the hematoxylin-eosin (H 2 ̆ 6 E) staining procedure (for identification of viable tumor versus necrosis), as well as via hypoxic-inducible factor-lα. (HIF- 1 α) immunohistochemistry (for identification of regions of hypoxia versus well-oxygenated tissue) was performed (Chapter 3). The optimal cluster/feature combination was determined by minimizing the sum-of-squared-differences (SSD) between the actual datapoints and the ideal one-to-one correlation that should exist between KM-derived volume estimates and histology-derived volume estimates. The optimal cluster/feature combination was determined to be a 2 -feature (ADC, T 2) and 4 -c 1 uster (2 regions each of viable tissue and necrosis) segmentation. This KM method was then applied in analysis of the radiotherapeutic response: first, to gain insight into the various processes whose combination yield the total ADC response over time; second, to identify the contribution of tissue heterogeneity to the treatment response and changes in tumor growth kinetics and cell kill (Chapter 4). Comparisons between control and various time-points out to 14 days post-radiotherapy permitted more accurate tissue characterization and prediction of therapeutic outcome over analysis using ADC alone. The results based on histological validation demonstrated: (1) MS analysis provides an improved tissue segmentation method over results obtained from conventional methods employing ADC alone; (2) MS analysis permits subdivision based on the degree of necrosis, as well as delineation between well-oxygenated and hypoxic viable tissue; and (3) Individual KM volumes corresponded well with both H 2 ̆ 6 E volumes and regions with increased HIF- 1 α expression. The results based on the radiotherapeutic response demonstrated: (1) MS analysis provides a method for monitoring the range of tissue viability as a function of time post-treatment; (2) MS analysis permits assessment of the various contributions to the total ADC response post-treatment; (3) The relative fractions of well-oxygenated (i. e., radiosensitive) versus hypoxic (i. e., radioresistant) tissue pretreatment may be predictive of treatment response; and (4) The early ADC increase {{did not seem to be}} a result of radiation-induced vasogenic edema, but instead was most likely due to a slight reduction in cellular density following therapy. These studies provide a non-invasive method of tissue characterization that may be used in monitoring treatment response and optimizing drug dose-timing schemes, with the potential for predicting treatment efficacy. Part 2 : Role of Spreading Depression in Ischemic Stroke Stroke is a prevalent disease that ranks as the 3 rd leading cause of death and disability in the United States, according to NIH statistics, costing millions of dollars in medical costs and lost wages. At present, the mechanism by which focal ischemia evolves into infarction remains poorly understood. By determining the patho-physiological mechanisms involved in the evolution of focal brain ischemia, therapeutic strategies may be designed for instances of acute ischemic stroke. In the late 1980 s, researchers discovered MRI techniques that allow the detection of stroke very early after onset. Such techniques as diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging (DWI and PWI) have been applied both clinically and experimentally. Previous studies employing these techniques suggest that cortical spreading depression plays a detrimental role in the evolution of focal brain ischemia. Spreading depression (SD) is characterized by a spontaneous and reversible depression of cortical electrical activity that spreads from the site of onset as a wave with a speed of 2 - 5 mm/min. It is accompanied by an ionic redistribution, with efflux of potassium ions (K+) and influx of sodium, chloride, and calcium (Na+, Cl-, Ca 2 +) ions, as well as water. This results in cellular swelling and a decreased extracellular space (ES), yielding a decline in ADC. A positive correlation between the number of both spontaneous and induced SDs and infarct volume has well been documented, supporting the idea that SD inhibition might be neuroprotective if initiated early after ischemic onset. Even though these studies show promise in their ability to track SD using diffusion mapping, changes in ADCs reflect cytotoxic edema and do not necessarily correspond to SD or SD-like depolarizations or calcium (Ca 2 +) influx, leading to cell death. Recent studies have reported the use of manganese ions (Mn 2 +) as a depolarization-dependent contrast agent in monitoring brain activation through the application of glutamate, as well as in the study focal ischemia. Since extracellular accumulation of potassium (K+) ions or glutamate in ischemic tissue is believed to play a central role in the initiation and propagation of SDs, and knowing that Mn 2 +, having an ionic radius similar to that of Ca 2 +, is handled in a manner similar to Ca 2 +, these studies suggest the possible use of manganese ions (Mn 2 +) in tracking SD or SD-like depolarizations in the evolution of focal brain ischemia. In order to determine the utility of Mn 2 + as a marker for SD, two sets of T 1 -weighted MRI experiments were performed before applying Mn 2 + in an experimental stroke model (Chapter 6). First, for verification purposes, a glutamate administration group was evaluated to validate our use of the manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) method previously developed by Aoki et al, a modification of the original by Lin and Koretsky. When satisfied that the contrast enhancement was specific to glutamate only, a second set of experiments was performed. Here, experimental SD was elicited by chemical stimulation (direct application of concentrated potassium chloride [KC 1] on the exposed cortical surface) and compared with control conditions (perfusion of sodium chloride [NaC 1] on exposed brain cortex). This study demonstrated: (1) Mn 2 +, specific to Ca 2 + channel activity, is a more accurate marker for SD than DWI or T 2 methods; (2) Cortical restriction of MEMRI enhancement supports the contention that apical dendrites are necessary for SD propagation; (3) Subcortical enhancement is a result of corticalsubcortical neuronal connectivity; and (4) Because of the relatively slow clearance of Mn 2 +, MEMRI permits higher spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) via increased signal averaging. Based on these results, preliminary experiments involving the study of SD in focal ischemia using Mn 2 + were performed (Chapter 7). Initial results indicate: (1) MEMRI of ischemia, when compared with standard DWI/PWI methods, may provide a method for estimating the likelihood of progression to infarct at acute time points post onset of stroke. These studies provide a foundation for further investigation into the role of SD in stroke, and the application of Mn 2 + towards the design of therapeutic strategies targeting SD inhibition. Conclusions and Medical Significance The research within this dissertation employed magnetic resonance imaging techniques for monitoring the temporal evolution of pathological disease states such as focal ischemia and cancer, with and without therapeutic intervention. Optimization of these techniques in experimental models will open the possibility for future application in a clinical setting. Clinical availability of these non-invasive methods, with the ability to detect an early therapeutic response or to provide staging and prediction of tissue fate, would greatly aid in patient management of both cancer and stroke...|$|R

For an inducible model of retinal degeneration to be useful, it must recapitulate these changes. Intravitreal administration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has recently been found to induce acute photoreceptor death. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the chronic effects of ATP on retinal integrity. Five-week-old, dark agouti rats were administered 50 mM ATP into the vitreous of one eye and saline into the other. Vision was assessed using the electroretinogram and optokinetic response and retinal morphology investigated <b>via</b> <b>histology.</b> ATP caused significant loss of visual function within 1 day and loss of 50 % of the photoreceptors within 1 week. At 3 months, 80 % of photoreceptor nuclei were lost, and total photoreceptor loss occurred by 6 months. The degeneration and remodeling were similar to those found in heritable retinal dystrophies and age-related macular degeneration and included inner retinal neuronal loss, migration, and formation of new synapses; Müller cell gliosis, migration, and scarring; blood vessel loss; and retinal pigment epithelium migration. In addition, extreme degeneration and remodeling events, such as neuronal and glial migration outside the neural retina and proliferative changes in glial cells, were observed. These extreme changes were also observed in the 2 -year-old P 23 H rhodopsin transgenic rat model of retinitis pigmentosa. This ATP-induced model of retinal degeneration may provide a valuable tool for developing pharmaceutical therapies or for testing electronic implants aimed at restoring vision.

As bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) {{have the capacity}} to make both bone-like and cartilage-like tissues, they are an ideal cell population for use in the manufacture of osteochondral tissues. Effective differentiation of MSC to bone-like and cartilage-like tissues requires two unique medium formulations and this presents a challenge both in achieving initial MSC differentiation and in maintaining tissue stability when the unified osteochondral tissue is subsequently cultured in a single medium formulation. In this proof-of-principle study, we used an in-house fabricated microwell platform to manufacture thousands of micropellets formed from 166 MSC each. We then characterized the development of bone-like and cartilage-like tissue formation in the micropellets maintained for 8 – 14 days in sequential combinations of osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium. When bone-like or cartilage-like micropellets were induced for only 8 days, they displayed significant phenotypic changes when the osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium, respectively, was swapped. Based on these data, we developed an extended 14 -day protocol for the pre-culture of bone-like and cartilage-like micropellets in their respective induction medium. Unified osteochondral tissues were formed by layering 12, 000 osteogenic micropellets and 12, 000 chondrogenic micropellets into a biphasic structure and then further culture in chondrogenic induction medium.

40|$|In vivo and {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} alpha-amino- 3 hydroxy- 5 -methylisoxazole- 4 -propionic acid (AMPA) -receptor-mediated {{excitotoxicity}} causes cytoskeletal damage to axons. AMPA/kainate receptors are present on oligodendrocytes and myelin, but currently {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that axon cylinders contain AMPA receptors. Proteolipid protein (PLIP) and DM 20 are integral membrane proteins expressed by CNS oligodendrocytes and located in compact myelin. Humans and mice lacking normal PLP/DM 20 develop axonal swellings and degeneration, suggesting that local interactions between axons and the oligodendrocyte/myelin unit are important for the normal functioning of axons and that PLP/DM 20 is involved in this process. To determine whether perturbed glial-axonal interaction affects AMPA-receptor-mediated axonal damage, AMPA (1. 5 nmol) was injected into the caudate nucleus of anesthetized Pip knockout and wild-type male mice (n = 13). Twenty-four hours later, axonal damage was detected by using neurofilament 200 (NF 200) immunohistochemistry and neuronal damage detected <b>via</b> <b>histology.</b> AMPA-induced axonal damage, assessed with NF 200 immunohistochemistry, was significantly reduced in Plp knockout mice compared with wildtype mice (P = 0. 015).

In addition, there was no significant difference in the levels of glutamate receptor subunits GluR 1 - 4 or KA 2 in Plp knockout compared with wild-type littermates.

Previous studies in a murine model of allergic airways disease {{have shown that}} L-selectin {{plays a role in}} the regulation of airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma via mechanisms independent of inflammation. Airway remodeling has been shown to modulate airway hyperresponsiveness independently of inflammation. Purpose: Our aim was to determine if L-selectin influenced airway hyperresponsiveness via modulation of structural changes as a result of airway remodeling. Method: A chronic ovalbumin-induced allergic airways disease model was applied to L-selectindeficient mice and wild-type control mice. The development of airway inflammation was assessed by examining leukocyte influx into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Airway remodeling changes were determined <b>via</b> <b>histology</b> and morphometric analysis of lung tissue sections, and the development of airway hyperresponsiveness was assessed by invasive plethysmography. Results: Total cell counts, but not individual differential cell counts, were reduced in the ovalbumin-treated L-selectin-deficient mice compared to wildtype ovalbumin-treated mice. L-selectin-deficient mice had significantly reduced epithelial thickness and smooth muscle thickness. Airway hyperresponsiveness was abrogated in ovalbumin treated L-selectin-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls.

BackgroundInjectable materials offer promising alternatives to treat MI. Although most of the examined materials have shown preserved or improved cardiac function in small animal models, none have been specifically designed for the heart, and few have translated to catheter delivery in large animal models. MethodsWe have developed a myocardial-specific hydrogel, derived from decellularized ventricular ECM, which self-assembles when injected in vivo. Female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent ischemia reperfusion followed by injection of the hydrogel or saline 2 weeks later. The implantation response was assessed <b>via</b> <b>histology</b> and immunohistochemistry, and the potential for arrhythmogenesis was examined using programmed electrical stimulation 1 week post-injection. Cardiac function was analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging 1 week pre-injection and 4 weeks post-MI. In a porcine model, we delivered the hydrogel using the NOGA-guided MyoStar catheter (Biologics Delivery Systems, Irwindale, California), and utilized histology to assess retention of the material.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Post-traumatic {{arthritis}} (PTA) is a progressive, degenerative {{response to}} joint injury, such as articular fracture. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), are acutely elevated following joint injury and remain elevated for prolonged periods post-injury. To investigate {{the role of}} local and systemic inflammation {{in the development of}} post-traumatic arthritis, we targeted both the initial acute local inflammatory response and a prolonged 4 week systemic inflammatory response by inhibiting IL- 1 or TNF-α following articular fracture in the mouse knee. METHODS: Anti-cytokine agents, IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra) or soluble TNF receptor II (sTNFRII), were administered either locally via an acute intra-articular injection or systemically for a prolonged 4 week period following articular fracture of the knee in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The severity of arthritis was then assessed at 8 weeks post-injury in joint tissues <b>via</b> <b>histology</b> and micro computed tomography, and systemic and local biomarkers were assessed in serum and synovial fluid. RESULTS: Intra-articular inhibition of IL- 1 significantly reduced cartilage degeneration, synovial inflammation, and did not alter bone morphology following articular fracture. However, systemic inhibition of IL- 1, and local or systemic inhibition of TNF provided no benefit or conversely led to increased arthritic changes in the joint tissues. CONCLUSION: These results show that intra-articular IL- 1, rather than TNF-α, plays a critical role in the acute inflammatory phase of joint injury and can be inhibited locally to reduce post-traumatic arthritis following a closed articular fracture. Targeted local inhibition of IL- 1 following joint injury may represent a novel treatment option for PTA...|$|E

Two established mouse models were utilized (adult IRF 3 / 7 -/- -/- and wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 J mice) to evaluate disease manifestations in bones and joints at various timepoints. Novel lesions in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice consisted of periostitis (91 %) and foci of cartilage of necrosis (50 % of mice at 21 DPI).

The oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a rich source of water-soluble phenolics which have high antioxidant activities. This study aimed to identify the in vivo effects and molecular mechanisms involved in the biological activities of oil palm phenolics (OPP) during healthy states via microarray gene expression profiling, using mice supplemented with a normal diet as biological models. Results Having confirmed <b>via</b> <b>histology,</b> haematology and clinical biochemistry analyses that OPP is not toxic to mice, we further explored the gene expression changes caused by OPP through statistical and functional analyses using Illumina microarrays. OPP showed numerous biological activities in three major organs of mice, the liver, spleen and heart. In livers of mice given OPP, four lipid catabolism genes were up-regulated while five cholesterol biosynthesis genes were down-regulated, suggesting that OPP {{may play a role in}} reducing cardiovascular disease. OPP also up-regulated eighteen blood coagulation genes in spleens of mice. OPP elicited gene expression changes similar to the effects of caloric restriction in the hearts of mice supplemented with OPP. Microarray gene expression fold changes for six target genes in the three major organs tested were validated with real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the correlation of fold changes obtained with these two techniques was high (R 2 = 0. 9653). Conclusions OPP showed non-toxicity and various pleiotropic effects in mice.
