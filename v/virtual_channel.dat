5|$|In 2009, Raycom Media (owner of Honolulu-based NBC and MyNetworkTV affiliates, KHNL and KFVE) {{announced}} it would take over the operations of local CBS affiliate KGMB (then owned by MCG Capital Corporation), giving it control {{of three of the}} television stations in Hawaii. The deal was a complex arrangement which involved trading the non-license assets of KFVE (such as its call sign, programming, and network affiliation) for those of KGMB (effectively placing the station under Raycom ownership, but using KFVE's license, signal, and <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> 5), and taking over KFVE (which moved to the channel 9 license owned by MCG Capital) under a shared services agreement. Due to its nature, the swap was not a transaction that would require the intervention of the FCC, aside from the changing of call signs. The three stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as Hawaii News Now. An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 from the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement. On November 20, 2013, MCG Capital filed to sell KFVE to the aforementioned American Spirit Media.|$|E

40|$|A deadlock-free fully {{adaptive}} routing algorithm for 2 D meshes which is optimal {{in the number}} of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> required and {{in the number of}} restrictions placed on the use of these <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> is presented. The routing algorithm imposes less than half as many routing restrictions as any previous fully {{adaptive routing}} algorithm. It is also proved that, ignoring symmetry, this routing algorithm is the only fully adaptive routing algorithm that achieves both of these goals. The algorithm exploits the fact that for some adaptive routing algorithms, deadlock freedom is possible even when cycles are present in the channel dependency graph. The implementation of the routing algorithm requires relatively simple router control logic. The routing algorithm requires only the minimum number of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> even when extended to arbitrary dimension meshes, yielding a dramatic {{reduction in the number of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> needed to support fully adaptive routing. Compared to all previous algorithms which required an exponential number of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> with the dimension of the mesh, the new algorithm requires only 4 n - 2 <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> for an n-dimensional mesh...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{oblivious}} routing algorithms do {{not take}} into account resource requirements (e. g., bandwidth, latency) of various flows in a given application. As they are not aware of flow demands that are specific to the application, network resources can be poorly utilized and cause serious local congestion. Also, flows, or packets, may share <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> in an undetermined way; the effects of head-of-line blocking may result in throughput degradation. In this paper, we present a framework for application-aware routing that assures deadlock freedom under one or more <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> by forcing routes to conform to an acyclic channel dependence graph. In addition, we present methods to statically and efficiently allocate <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to flows or packets, under oblivious routing, when there are two or more <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> per link. Using the application-aware routing framework, we develop and evaluate a bandwidth-sensitive oblivious routing scheme that statically determines routes considering an application’s communication characteristics. Given bandwidth estimates for flows, we present a mixed integer-linear programming (MILP) approach and a heuristic approach for producing deadlock-free routes that minimize maximum channel load. Our framework can be used to produce application-aware routes that target the minimization of latency, number of flows through a link, bandwidth, or any combination thereof. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} achieve better performance than traditional deterministic and oblivious routing schemes on popular synthetic benchmarks using our bandwidth-sensitive approach. We also show that, when oblivious routing is used and there are more flows than <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> per link, the static assignment of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to flows can help mitigate the effects of head-ofline blocking, which may impede packets that are dynamically competing for <b>virtual</b> <b>channels.</b> We experimentally explore th...|$|R
