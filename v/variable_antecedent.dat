40|$|Abstract: Human {{injury is}} {{associated}} with inflamma-tory responses that are modulated by the acute and chronic activity of endogenous factors and exogenous interventions. A characteristic feature of chronic, se-vere inflammatory states is the diminished signal output variability of many organ systems, including innate im-mune responsiveness and endogenous neural and endo-crine-mediated functions. The attenuation of signal/re-sponse variability and integration of feedback capacity may contribute to systemic and tissue-specific deterio-ration of function. Some well-intentioned therapies di-rected toward support of systemic and tissue functions may actually promote the loss of system(s) adapt-ability and contribute to adverse outcomes in severely stressed patients. In vivo and in silico models of stress, injury, and infection have yet to fully define the influences of ongoing stressful stimulae as well as genetic variation and epige-netic factors {{in the context of}} an evolving inflam-matory state. Experimental and human models incorporating <b>variable,</b> <b>antecedent</b> stress(es) and altered neuroendocrine rhythms might approxi-mate the altered adaptability in immune and or-gan function responses. Such models may also provide insights into the salient mechanisms of risk and outcome more precisely than do the constrained study conditions of current animal or human models of systemic inflammation.

40|$|This study {{developed}} Mamdani-type {{fuzzy logic}} model to simulate daily discharge {{as a function}} of soil moisture measured at three different depths (10, 20 and 40 cm) and rainfall. The model was applied to 13 km 2 size Colorso Basin in central Italy for a period from October 2002 to April 2004. For each variable of soil moisture, rainfall, and discharge, 9 fuzzy subsets were employed while 30 fuzzy rules, relating the input variables (soil moisture and rainfall) to the output variable (discharge), were optimized. The model employed the min inferencing, max composition, and the centroid method. The model application results revealed that Mamdani-type fuzzy logic model can be employed to incorporate soil moisture along with rainfall to simulate discharge. Using soil moisture measured at 40 cm soil depth along with rainfall produced better simulation of discharge with NS= 0. 68 and R= 0. 82. The performance of the model was also tested against a conceptual rainfall- runoff model of MISDc (Modello Idrologico Semi-Distribuito in continuo). MISDc couples an event-specific component with a module for continuous time soil water balance for taking into account the <b>variable</b> <b>antecedent</b> wetness conditions. The MISDc model requires estimation of seven parameters and the measurements of the hydrometeorological variables such as rainfall and air temperature. The comparative study revealed that fuzzy model performs better in capturing runoff peak rates and overall trend of high and small flooding events. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{probabilistic}} sediment cascade model to simulate sediment transfer {{in a mountain}} basin (Illgraben, Switzerland) where sediment is produced by hillslope landslides and rockfalls and exported out of the basin by debris flows and floods. The model conceptualizes the fluvial system as a spatially lumped cascade of connected reservoirs representing hillslope and channel storages where sediment goes through cycles of storage and remobilization by surface runoff. The model includes all relevant hydrological processes that lead to runoff formation in an Alpine basin, such as precipitation, snow accumulation, snowmelt, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage. Although the processes of sediment transfer and debris flow generation are described in a simplified manner, the model produces complex sediment discharge behavior which {{is driven by the}} availability of sediment and antecedent wetness conditions (system memory) as well as the triggering potential (climatic forcing). The observed probability distribution of debris flow volumes and their seasonality in 2000 – 2009 are reproduced. The stochasticity of hillslope sediment input is important for reproducing realistic sediment storage variability, although many details of the hillslope landslide triggering procedures are filtered out by the sediment transfer system. The model allows us to explicitly quantify the division into transport and supply-limited sediment discharge events. We show that debris flows may be generated {{for a wide range of}} rainfall intensities because of <b>variable</b> <b>antecedent</b> basin wetness and snowmelt contribution to runoff, which helps to understand the limitations of methods based on a single rainfall threshold for debris flow initiation in Alpine basins...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Architecture of late Quaternary incised-valley fills is com-monly {{attributed}} to the interplay between sea-level rise, sediment sup-ply, and hydrodynamic processes. Inundation of fluvial terraces is com-monly overlooked as an autocyclic mechanism for formation of par-asequences. If the rate of sea-level rise and sediment supply is constant, architecture of terraced incised-valley fills will likely show backstep-ping parasequences. The control that <b>variable</b> <b>antecedent</b> topography has on architecture of incised-valley fills is examined in the Trinity incised valley, Texas. The Trinity valley {{is characterized by a}} series of downward-stepping terraces, and the Galveston Estuary formed above this irregular antecedent topography. Flooding surfaces, recognized in core by a decrease in sedimentation rates and a change from delta-plain to central-basin facies, formed at; 214 m, 8, 200 cal. yr BP and; 210 m, 7, 700 cal. yr BP, matching depths of the relatively flat fluvial terraces. Flooding surfaces formed rapidly and represent entire reor-ganization of the estuarine complex. Across the 210 m flooding sur-face, the river mouth and bay-head delta shifted landward at a rate of; 6. 5 km per century and the associated barrier shoreline was strand-ed on the inner continental shelf, forming Heald Bank. Flooding sur-faces formed as the rate of sea-level rise was decreasing, and are not associated with a decrease in sediment delivery to the estuary. As sea level inundates relatively flat fluvial terraces, rates of transgression rapidly increase, resulting in a sudden increase in accommodation space and an associated landward shift in coastal facies. Backstepping parasequences are inherent to the architecture of terraced incised-val-ley fills...|$|E

This study aimed {{to test the}} hypothesis that shorter participants in Wave- 3 of the Aboriginal Birth Cohort (ABC) study, a prospective longitudinal investigation of Indigenous Australian individuals born 1987 – 1990 at an Australian regional hospital, would have more caries and periodontal disease experience than their taller counterparts. METHODS: Data were collected through oral clinical examinations, anthropometric measures and self-report questionnaires. The outcome variables were participants’ caries (mean DMFT) and periodontal disease experience (moderate or severe periodontal disease as defined by the Centre for Disease Control), with height as an explanatory <b>variable.</b> <b>Antecedent</b> anthropometric, socio-demographic, sugar consumption frequency, dental behaviour and substance use variables were used as possible confounders. Linear regression was used in the analysis of caries experience, while adjusted prevalence ratios were used for prevalence of moderate or severe periodontal disease. RESULTS: Higher DMFT was found among participants in the shortest tertile (B= 1. 02, 95 % CI= 0. 02 – 2. 02) and those who consumed sweets every day or a few days a week (B= 1. 08, 95 % CI= 0. 11 – 2. 05), while lower DMFT was found among those owning a toothbrush (B= 0. 80, 95 % CI=- 0. 22 – 1. 82). Periodontal disease was positively associated with the shortest tertile (adjusted PR= 1. 39, 95 % CI= 0. 96 – 1. 82) and negatively associated with toothbrush ownership (adjusted PR= 0. 50, 95 % CI= 0. 34 – 0. 66).

40|$|Land use {{change has}} {{significant}} impacts on watershed hydrology because {{an increase in}} impervious/urban areas changes water quantity and quality {{on a variety of}} spatial and temporal scales. Urban areas are an important source of runoff and non-point source (NPS) pollution, and NPS pollution {{is the leading cause of}} water quality degradation in the US. Traditional hydrologic models focus on event-specific estimation of peak discharges and NPS pollution. Although these are appropriate for short-term, local scale surface water management problems, they are of limited value for attempts to understand the long term hydrologic impacts of land use change. A Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA) model has been developed and expanded, based on the widely used USDA Curve Number (CN) method. Long term climatic records are combined with soils, land use, and pollutant data to assess average annual runoff and NPS pollution at a watershed scale. This model is linked to a Geographic Information System (GIS) which allows easier creation and management of model input and output data, and advanced spatial analyses and visualization. Comparisons of L-THIA predictions with field data and results from two other widely used models (SWMM and WEPP) indicate that L-THIA produces reasonable results for assessing absolute and relative impacts of land use change. Sensitivity analyses show that L-THIA underestimates runoff when <b>variable</b> <b>antecedent</b> moisture conditions are assumed, compared to average antecedent moisture conditions, and that L-THIA results are very sensitive to the climate region. Applications of the technique to two urbanizing watersheds in Indiana demonstrated that increases in urban areas significantly increases annual average runoff and most NPS pollution, while decreases in agricultural areas significantly decreases nutrient pollution. Absolute and relative impacts were highly sensitive to the spatial scale of the analyses. Some sub-watersheds showed greater relative impacts than the entire watershed while other sub-watersheds were less affected by land use change. This technique allows identification of environmentally sensitive areas in terms of runoff and NPS pollution potential, which is critical for evaluating alternative land use management scenarios to improve management of the long-term hydrologic impacts of land use change. ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} occurring {{within the}} vadose zone, especially in heterogeneous soils and tills {{typical of the}} Canadian shield, are not well understood. This research investigates {{the importance of the}} vadose zone in a small headwater basin (Harp 4 - 21) in the Canadian shield with respect to the generation of stream runoff quantity and quality during episodic rainfall and snowmelt events. The study focused specifically on: ﬁrstly the effect of <b>variable</b> <b>antecedent</b> moisture conditions on water-table and stream response, secondly, the significance of the stored vadose water in water extracted from a rising water-table, and thirdly the significance of preferential flowpathways in the vadose zone as a means of rapidly rotating, stored vadose water to the stream during runoff events. The instrumentation of the Harp 4 - 21 basin includes three v-notch weirs along the stream, numerous piezometers and wells, several soil lysimeters, and three tensiometer nests. Much of the data used in this study was obtained from five sites located along a hillslope transect. Soil water content at each of the hillslope sites was accurately determined using time domain reflectometry (TDR), whereas water table elevations were measured using both electronic water level tapes and calibrated rod ﬂoats. Preferential flowpath data was derived from ﬂow gauging and chemical analyses of water samples. Results obtained from the near-stream and lower slope reaches of the hillslope transect indicated that soil water content in the vadose zone is maintained at a high level of saturation by shallow water-table depths. Further analysis of simultaneously measured soil water content and depth to water—table data clearly showed that the existence of a thick essentially saturated zone overlying the water table (capillary fringe) was responsible for the large and rapid water-table responses observed during many of the nine studied precipitation events. On a basin scale, the seasonal variability of the area in which the capillary fringe extended to the ground surface was largely responsible for the observed trend in basin yield (runoff volume/ rainfall volume) for the nine runoff events. Chemical tracing results using silica, pH and DOC showed that the large vadose water reservoir in the near-stream and lower slope areas was a dominant component in water extracted from a rising water-table during most precipitation events. Silica results from the near-stream vadose zone showed that only the massive groundwater recharge associated with spring snowmelt could completely replace the vadose water reservoir with shorter residence time snowmelt/rainfall water. The rapid routing of stored near-stream capillary fringe vadose water through preferential pathways (macropores, soil pipes) was a significant source of runoff to the stream during runoff events. The presence of soil pipes, along with the significant vadose water reservoir in near-stream and lower slope areas are sufficient to explain the large phreatic/vadose water component typically identified in two component flow separation models, and constitutes the basis of a physically-based conceptual runoff model for the Harp 4 - 21 basin...|$|E
40|$|The {{export of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural catchments {{is a major}} problem worldwide. The export of these nutrients is largely driven by storm events, and the hydrologic response of catchments varies within and between storm events. Antecedent soil moisture and rainfall rates have both been shown to affect the discharge and nutrient export from agricultural catchments, but their relationship to nutrient export is not fully understood. Currently, there are no studies that examine the leaching of both nitrate and phosphate from soil pools under the combined influence of differences in soil moisture and rainfall rates. The objectives of this study were to examine the combined effect of antecedent soil moisture and rainfall rates on the hydrologic response of soil and the export of nitrate and phosphate from the soil. The approach used intact soil monoliths in two experiments to first characterize the hydrologic response of the soil, and secondly to assess how the hydrologic response of the soil affects the leaching of nitrate and phosphate from soil pools. Differences in antecedent soil moisture and rainfall rates influenced both the amount of discharge and the hydrologic flow paths in the soil. As was expected, antecedent soil moisture governed the depth of discharge, with more discharge (runoff ratios= 0. 89 to 0. 91) produced by wet soil and the least runoff produced by dry soil (runoff ratios= 0. 08 to 0. 14) although this was not affected by the rainfall rate. Instead, rainfall rates predominantly affected hydrologic flow paths in the soil, with preferential flow {{at the beginning of the}} leaching period under high intensity rainfall (especially in wet soil), and predominantly matrix flow occurring under low intensity rainfall. The rainfall intensity did not appear to affect discharge volume. The mass of both nitrate and phosphate exported was higher under low intensity rainfall, ranging from 11. 2 to 60. 1 mg/mU+ 00 B 2 and 77 to 4980 μg/mU+ 00 B 2, respectively and from 0. 9 to 34. 4 mg/mU+ 00 B 2 and 18. 4 to 732 μg/mU+ 00 B 2, respectively under high intensity rainfall. Antecedent soil moisture was significantly positively correlated with the depth of discharge produced, which also had a significant positive relationship with the mass of nitrate and phosphate exported (Spearman’s ρ= 0. 75 to 0. 81, p= < 0. 001), with greater masses of both nutrients exported from wet soil than dry soil. Soil moisture had contrasting influences on the nitrate concentrations in leachate, where nitrate concentrations and soil moisture were negatively related under low intensity rainfall and positively related under high intensity rainfall. Concentrations of phosphate in leachate were more variable, with no clear relationship to soil moisture, discharge, rainfall rate or soil phosphate pools. Antecedent soil moisture and the rainfall rate have a combined influence on the concentration of nitrate in leachate and an influence on the mass of both nitrate and phosphate exported. Although different hydrologic flow paths (matrix, preferential) were observed under the <b>variable</b> <b>antecedent</b> conditions and rainfall rates, this did not appear to affect nutrient fluxes from soil. This may be related to available nutrient pools and distributions in the soil in the current study. Understanding of the influence of flow types on the export of soil nutrient pools requires further study in a lab and a comparison of the breakthrough of nitrate and phosphate from soil pools with that of a conservative tracer (chloride). Nutrient and tracer breakthrough could then be compared to the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the progression of the wetting front to fully understand the flow paths occurring and their effect on nutrient leaching...|$|E

We also tested the hypothesis that disease severity, depression, and perceived stress would correlate inversely with QOL and potential for self-management, whereas self-efficacy and perceived level of social support would correlate positively with QOL and potential for self-management. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables</b> did not correlate with the mediating variables, with one exception: a negative correlation was found between disease severity and social support. No correlations were found between social support and QOL or self-management. However, significant correlations were found between depression, self-efficacy, stress, and social support and QOL. No correlations were found between either the antecedent or the mediating variables and self-management. The results confirm previous findings of statistically significant correlations between psychosocial factors and QOL. Griffith Health, School of Nursing and MidwiferyFull Tex...|$|R

Further, for planning of water resources in a river basin, long term flow forecasts are more important. In this work, an approach is suggested to improve the forecasting of monthly inflows to the Manimuthar reservoir in the Tamarabarani river basin in Tamil Nadu, India. The releases from Manimuthar reservoir act as a support to the Tamarabarani river system which plays a vital role in agricultural production of the region. For the agricultural planning, it is desired to have monthly prediction, and hence an attempt has been made herewith towards this. The first step towards this involved a careful selection of the input <b>variables.</b> <b>Antecedent</b> inflows from previous years for the same month form a part of the input vector. Further, rainfall information is also included in the input vector, wherein such information is first estimated in those crucial locations along the river reach or the surrounding region which plays an important role in deciding the inflow to reservoir. This rainfall information is estimated using a Kriging based methodology (based on the Kriging standard deviations), which was presented in a previous study (Sivapragasam et al., 2011). Genetic Programming (GP), an evolutionary algorithm based data-driven modelling technique is chosen a...|$|R

We extend social exchange theory to include perceptions of the total job situation and develop a model that positions job satisfaction as a mediator of the relationships between various internal and external <b>antecedent</b> <b>variables,</b> and three volitional workplace behaviours: citizenship behaviours, counterproductive workplace behaviours, and job withdrawal. The fit of a fully mediated model is good and all four classes of antecedents (dispositions, workplace events, job characteristics, job opportunities) contributed uniquely to the prediction of satisfaction. Job satisfaction is also shown to mediate most antecedent-consequence relationships, although two important exceptions are evident. A direct link from pro-social disposition to OCBs, and a direct link and one from anti-social disposition to counterproductivity, suggest that job satisfaction does not fully moderate the relationships between dispositions and contextual behaviours...|$|R
