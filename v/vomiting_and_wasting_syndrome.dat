40|$|Abstract. A gnobiotic piglet, was inoculated intracerebrally with hemagglutinating {{encephalomyelitis}} virus (strain VWS 72). Mononuclear cells formed vascular {{cuffs and}} were disseminated {{in the brain}} parenchyma. A few neurons were surrounded by {{the same kind of}} cells. Virus particles morphologically similar to coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of both chromatolytic light neurons and hyperchromic dark neurons. The particles were in vesicles of distended endoplasmic reticulum and in the hypertrophied Golgi apparatus.

Both lpr/lpr and lprcg/lprcg BM transferred caused lymph node (LN) hyperplasia in lpr/+ and lprcg/+ recipients, {{although it was}} clearly smaller than that in lpr/lpr and lprcg/lprcg recipients of lpr/lpr and lprcg/lprcg BM. In addition, both BM induced significantly larger LN hyperplasia in lprcg/+ than lpr/+ recipients. Appearance of CD 4 − CD 8 −[double negative (DN) ] T cells in the periphery is the most consistent phenotype of Fas mutations. Importantly, the proportion of DN T cells was higher in larger LN hyperplasia {{in the order of}} lpr/+, lprcg/+ and lpr/lpr or lprcg/lprcg recipients. On the other hand, both lpr/lpr and lprcg/lprcg BM transferred into wild-type (+/+) mice caused marked LN atrophy.

40|$|The {{phenotype}} of the transforming {{growth factor}} beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) null mouse {{has been previously}} described and is characterized by inflammatory infiltrates in multiple organs leading to a <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> <b>and</b> death as early as 3 weeks after birth. Since this phenotype occurs {{in the absence of}} any detectable pathogen, potential autoimmune disease mechanisms were investigated. We examined major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mRNA expression in tissues of the TGF-beta 1 null mouse and found levels of both the class I and class II MHC mRNA elevated compared to normal or TGF-beta 1 heterozygous littermates. This elevated expression was seen prior to any evidence of inflammatory infiltrates, suggesting a causal relationship between increased MHC expression and activation of immune cell populations. Cell surface expression of MHC molecules was detected by immunohistochemistry and correlated well with mRNA levels. Expression of mRNA for interferon gamma and its receptor was unchanged at the ages when increased MHC expression became apparent. Down-regulation of class I MHC expression by TGF-beta 1 was also demonstrated in vitro in fibroblasts isolated from TGF-beta 1 null mice. These findings suggest that one natural function of TGF-beta 1 is to control expression of both MHC classes. Altered regulation of MHC expression may be a critical step leading to the multifocal inflammation <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> seen in the TGF-beta 1 null mouse. These results suggest potential applications for TGF-beta in the management of autoimmune disease, allograft rejection, and other problems associated with altered MHC expression...|$|R
40|$|When {{intracellular}} pathogens invade mammalian hosts, naïve CD 8 + T cells differentiate into cytotoxic killers, which lyse infected target {{cells and}} secrete cytokines that activate intracellular microbicides. We show that CD 8 + T cells deficient in the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes) fail to differentiate into functional killers required for defense against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Instead, virus-specific CD 8 + T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes differentiate into an interleukin- 17 –secreting lineage, {{reminiscent of the}} helper T cell fate that has been implicated in autoimmunity and extracellular microbial defense. Upon viral infection, mice with T cells lacking both T-bet and Eomes develop a CD 8 + T cell–dependent, progressive inflammatory <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> characterized by multi-organ infiltration of neutrophils. T-bet and Eomes, thus, ensure that CD 8 + T cells adopt an appropriate course of intracellular rather than extracellular destruction.

40|$|Pain in {{intensive}} care units is often underestimated, and therefore patients are insufficiently treated, leading to psychological, haemodynamic, metabolic and neuroendocrine responses that cause greater morbimortality. Pain can also cause anxiety, insomnia and disorientation, agitation and delirium, and depression that often times becomes chronic. Lack of or inadequate treatment increases pulmonary, metabolic and infectious complications. The combined use of analgesics and sedative agents decreases the stress response of patients {{in intensive}} care. There are many other situations {{in intensive care}} units that make communication between the patient and healthcare personnel difficult (being sedated, {{the presence of an}} endotracheal tube, etc.), making it difficult to manage analgesia.

Studies of E. bieneusi have been greatly limited due to the absence of genomic data and lack of a robust cultivation system. Here, we present the first large-scale genomic dataset for E. bieneusi. Approximately 3. 86 Mb of unique sequence was generated by paired end Sanger sequencing, representing about 64 % of the estimated 6 Mb genome. A total of 3, 804 genes were identified in E. bieneusi, of which 1, 702 encode proteins with assigned functions. Of these, 653 are homologs of Encephalitozoon cuniculi proteins. Only one E. bieneusi protein with assigned function had no E. cuniculi homolog.

40|$|Disruption of {{mitochondrial}} {{oxidative phosphorylation}} (OXPHOS) is amechanism of toxicity which disturbs mitochondrial respiration and thereby alters the energy metabolism [1]. This {{may lead to}} severe health effects, such as reproductive insufficiency <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> [2]. Disruption of OXPHOS is generally studied in vitro using isolated mitochondrial membranes or in whole organisms using tissue extracts [3]. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop a method to measure OXPHOS disruption in vivo in a living organism. For this purpose we used zebrafish embryos. We established a method of monitoring mitochondrial respiration using a combination of three in vivo measurements: total oxygen consumption, lactate acid production and mitochondrial membrane potential in zebrafish during early development (0 – 7 days). We studied the effects of short term and long term exposures to model OXPHOS disruptors like FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-ptrifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), KCN (potassium cyanide) and DNP (2, 4 -dinitrophenol). We also monitored dose–response relationships over time and compared our results with a standard in vitro method. Our results indicate that disruption of OXPHOS can be measured in vivo in the zebrafish embryo. Exposure to model compounds showed clear differences between uncouplers and inhibitors, as well as differences in sensitivity to OXPHOS disruption during development. The relative potency of the used compounds was similar between the in vivo and in vitro measurements.

40|$|International audienceTwo-thirds of the world's HIV-infected {{people live}} in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 1. 5 million of them die annually. As access to {{antiretroviral}} treatment has expanded within the region; early pessimism concerning the delivery of antiretroviral treatment using a large-scale public health approach has, {{at least in the}} short term, proved to be broadly unfounded. Immunological and virological responses to ART are similar to responses in patients treated in high-income countries. Despite this, however, early mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are very high; between 8 and 26 % of patients die in the first year of antiretroviral treatment, with most deaths occurring in the first few months. Patients typically access antiretroviral treatment with advanced symptomatic disease, and mortality is strongly associated with baseline CD 4 cell count less than 50 cells/mul and WHO stage 4 disease (AIDS). Although data are limited, leading causes of death appear to be tuberculosis, acute sepsis, cryptococcal meningitis, malignancy <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Mortality rates are likely to depend not only on the care delivered by antiretroviral treatment programmes, but more fundamentally on how advanced disease is at programme enrolment and the quality of preceding healthcare.

To determine whether this hormone responds to an acute inflammatory stimulus, plasma leptin concentrations were measured in 12 healthy subjects after intravenous administration of endotoxin. These subjects were randomized to receive concurrently ibuprofen or placebo normal saline (6 in each group). Endotoxin administration resulted in fever, leukocytosis, and an increase in plasma levels of the stress hormones adrenocorticotropic hormone (3. 2 { 0. 3 to 132. 6 { 75. 5 pmol/L, P. 001) and cortisol (431. 6 { 44 to 796. 9 { 99 mmol/L, P. 001). Plasma leptin levels, however, did not change significantly from baseline values after administration of endotoxin (0 h: 6. 9 { 3. 1 ng/ mL; 6 h: 6. 0 { 2. 2; 24 h: 6. 5 { 2. 8).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{establish}} {{the influence of}} clinical status at diagnosis and of gender on progression of HIV/AIDS determined by clinical-biological factors in patients from Cordoba City (Argentina) from 1995 to 2005). MethodsGender and clinical and laboratory data were evaluated by descriptive statistics, non-parametric survival analysis, and generalized linear models {{at the beginning of}} the study (diagnosis) and at the end (hospital records, n= 209). ResultsAt diagnosis, women (n= 28, 13. 4 %) had a higher probability of being asymptomatic than men (n= 181, 86. 6 %). High viremia was associated with advanced clinical stages, but was inversely related to CD 4 count. Truncated Kaplan-Meier curves were similar for both sexes. The probability of not having AIDS criteria at the end of the study was higher in patients without these criteria at diagnosis. Women had a higher probability of having AIDS at the end of the follow-up than men. In contrast, men had a higher prevalence of venereal diseases (n= 38, 21 %), dysmetabolic profile (n= 14, 7. 7 %) and positive serology for opportunists (n= 31, 17. 1 %). Marker diseases were mainly represented by internal mycosis <b>and</b> <b>waste</b> <b>syndrome,</b> although less specific findings (anemia, oral lesions) were also associated with progression.

Studies published in English between January 1996 and December 2010 were searched in Medline and EMBASE. Three independent reviewers examined studies of mortality within one year post-ART. An article was included if the study was conducted in a LMIC, participants were initiating ART in a non-clinical trial setting and were ≥ 15 years. Fifty studies were included; 38 (76 %) from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), 5 (10 %) from Asia, 2 (4 %) from the Americas, and 5 (10 %) were multi-regional. Median follow-up time and pre-ART CD 4 cell count ranged from 3 - 55 months and 11 - 192 cells/mm(3), respectively. Loss-to-follow-up, reported in 40 (80 %) studies, ranged from 0. 3 %- 27 %. Overall, SSA had the highest pooled 12 -month mortality probability of 0. 17 (95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 24) versus 0. 11 (95 % CI 0. 10 - 0. 13) for Asia, and 0. 07 (95 % CI 0. 007 - 0. 20) for the Americas. Of 14 (28 %) studies reporting cause-specific mortality, tuberculosis (TB) (5 %- 44 %), wasting (5 %- 53 %), advanced HIV (20 %- 37 %), and chronic diarrhea (10 %- 25 %) were most common. Independent factors associated with early mortality in 30 (60 %) studies included: low baseline CD 4 cell count, male sex, advanced World Health Organization clinical stage, low body mass index, anemia, age greater than 40 years, and pre-ART quantitative HIV RNA.

A prospective, hospital-based cohort study was conducted in HIV/AIDS patients registered in both provincial and community hospitals from 14 provinces in southern region of Thailand, between January 1993 and April 2010. Totally, 52, 459 of HIV/AIDS patients were routinely observed and followed up. One-fifth of the HIV/AIDS patients died (n= 11, 767, 22. 43 %) during the follow-up period. The outcome was timed from diagnosis of HIV/AIDS infection to death. Cox&#x 0027;s proportional hazard model was used to analyze the magnitude of clinical manifestations on survival of HIV/AIDS patients. Results: A statistically significant corresponding risk of clinical manifestation on death was found. HIV/AIDS patients who had clinical manifestations including: invasive cervical cancer (HR= 0. 14, 95 % CI: 0. 44 to 0. 43), herpes simplex (0. 81, 0. 66 to 0. 98), histoplasmosis (0. 67, 0. 46 to 0. 97), Mycobacterium other species (0. 78, 0. 64 to 0. 97) were more likely to have a longer life. However, patients expressed clinical manifestations including; candidiasis (1. 45, 1. 34 to 1. 56), cryptococcosis (1. 77, 1. 64 to 1. 91), cytomegalovirus retinitis (1. 58, 1. 26 to 1. 98), HIV encephalopathy (2. 17, 1. 92 to 2. 47), Mycobacterium avium complex (1. 76, 1. 32 to 2. 33) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1. 25, 1. 21 to 1. 30), pneumonia recurrent (1. 78, 1. 61 to 1. 96), Pneumocystis carinii (1. 71, 1. 63 to 1. 78), salmonella septicemia (1. 85, 1. 43 to 2. 39) toxoplasmosis (1. 47, 1. 30 to 1. 66) <b>and</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (2. 13, 2. 04 to 2. 21) were more likely to die faster. Conclusion: In conclusion, HIV/AIDS patients expressed clinical manifestations which were a risk of death must be monitored closely and intensively care to extend their life and increase their quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Muscle weakness, neuropathy, and {{transient}} {{rises in}} hepatic enzyme activity {{have been reported}} {{with the use of}} the antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone. A 68 year old teetotaller with normal liver function was given amiodarone for resistant supraventricular arrhythmias. He presented 19 months later with <b>vomiting,</b> muscle weakness <b>and</b> <b>wasting,</b> sensory neuropathy, <b>and</b> hepatomegaly. Liver biopsy showed fibrosis and the presence of hyaline. The amiodarone was withdrawn. Three months later he developed ascites. Oesophageal varices were found and he later died. The liver showed micronodular cirrhosis. The large volume of distribution and long half life of amiodarone may explain the persistence of toxicity, which may have been aggravated by simultaneously administered doxepin in this case. Amiodarone should be withdrawn if abnormal liver function or neuropathy develops...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPorcine Torque teno virus (PTTV) was {{recently}} shown to partially {{contribute to the}} experimental induction of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy <b>syndrome</b> <b>and</b> postweaning multisystemic <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> in pigs in the United States. We report here the identification of four distinct full-length genomic sequences of PTTV strains from a single pig in Virginia. Detailed analyses of the genomic organization, the degree of variability and the characteristics of conserved nucleotide and amino acid motifs of PTTV were conducted. The results showed that these four prototype U. S. strains of PTTV identified from the same pig represent distinct genotypes or subtypes and a revised classification system for PPTV is subsequently proposed. This is the first study documenting multiple PTTV infections with distinct genotypes or subtypes in a single pig. The identification of novel PTTV strains from pigs in the United States also {{pave the way for}} future disease characterization and genotyping of PTTV...|$|R

40|$|A {{concurrent}} {{outbreak of}} chlamydial disease in boars, {{sows and gilts}} <b>and</b> postweaning multisystemic <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PMWS) in weaned piglets was investigated on a large pig production farm in Estonia. Chlamydia suis DNA was detected in conjunctival swabs from boars, sows and gilts, {{but also in the}} faeces of boars and sows. Chlamydophila abortus DNA was found in semen, and in conjunctival swabs from sows; DNA was demonstrated by microarrays. Serum samples from boars were examined using a Chlamydiaceae-specific recombinant ELISA. All 10 serum samples examined were positive (1 : 960 to 1 : 3840). Chlamydiosis was characterised by reproductive failure and conjunctivitis. Piglets were not examined for Chlamydiaceae, as eye problems were not observed. Piglets showed wasting, respiratory signs, diarrhoea, enlargement of lymph nodes and increased mortality (10 per cent). Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV- 2) was detected in the lymph nodes of piglets by immunohistochemistry, and PCV- 2 antibodies were demonstrated in all 10 serum samples from sows examined using an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay...|$|R
