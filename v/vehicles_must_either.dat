40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{will provide}} for the visitation of various {{vehicles}} such as the Shuttle, Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), Crew Return Vehicle (CRV), Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) and Soyuz. These vehicles will provide for crew replacement, consumables resupply, and equipment delivery. In order for these vehicles to approach and eventually dock with the ISS, there must be near continuous communications coverage between the visiting vehicle and the ISS, as well as communications between the vehicle and a Mission Control Center (MCC). Since the ISS communications systems are already designed and scheduled for ISS activation, the <b>vehicles</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> utilize these communications systems or provide their own. There are two means of two-way communications with the ISS. These are (1) S-Band communications using TDRSS, and (2) UHF communications using some form of the Space to Space Station Radio (SSSR) link. The RLV utilizes ISS compatible communications systems to communicate with both the ISS and a Mission Control Center. Since all vehicles must adhere to the Visiting Vehicle Interface requirements given in reference 1, the RLV communications system design must meet these requirements during entry into the ISS Approach Ellipsoid (AE) and during Proximity Operations. Included in this paper are descriptions of these communications approaches {{as well as their}} potential utilization in the ISS communications system...|$|E

40|$|The large thrust {{augmentation}} obtainable with annular-jet configurations {{in ground}} proximity {{has led to}} the serious investigation of ground-effect machines. The basic theoretical work on these phenomena has been done by Chaplin and Boehler. Large thrust-augmentation factors, however, can be obtained only at very low heights, that is, of the order of a few percent of the diameter of the vehicle. To take advantage of this thrust augmentation therefore the <b>vehicle</b> <b>must</b> be <b>either</b> very large or must operate over very smooth terrain. Over-land uses of these vehicles then will probably be rather limited. The water, however, is inherently smooth and those irregularities that do exist, that is waves, are statistically known. It appears therefore that some practical application of ground-effect machines may be made in over-water application...|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, plates will be {{permanently}} assigned {{to that particular}} vehicle for its lifetime. If the vehicle is either destroyed or exported to a different country, the plate number is retired or reissued; exported <b>vehicles</b> <b>must</b> be re-registered in the jurisdiction of import. China requires the re-registration of any vehicle that crosses its borders from another country, such as for overland tourist visits, regardless {{of the length of}} time it is due to remain there; this has to be arranged with prior approval. Other jurisdictions follow a [...] "plate-to-owner" [...] policy, meaning that when a vehicle is sold the seller removes the current plate(s) from the <b>vehicle.</b> Buyers <b>must</b> <b>either</b> obtain new plates or attach plates they already hold, as well as register their vehicles under the buyer's name and plate number. A person who sells a car and then purchases a new one can apply to have the old plates put onto the new car. One who sells a car and does not buy a new one may, depending on the local laws involved, have to turn the old plates in or destroy them, or may be permitted to keep them. Some jurisdictions permit the registration of the vehicle with [...] "personal" [...] ("vanity" [...] or [...] "Cherished Mark") plates.|$|R
40|$|Household Vehicles Energy Consumption 1994 {{reports on}} the results of the 1994 Residential Transportation Energy Consumption Survey (RTECS). The RTECS is a {{national}} sample survey that has been conducted every 3 years since 1985. For the 1994 survey, more than 3, 000 households that own or use some 6, 000 vehicles provided information to describe vehicle stock, vehicle-miles traveled, energy end-use consumption, and energy expenditures for personal vehicles. The survey results represent the characteristics of the 84. 9 million households that used or had access to vehicles in 1994 nationwide. (An additional 12 million households neither owned or had access to vehicles during the survey year.) To be included in then RTECS survey, <b>vehicles</b> <b>must</b> be <b>either</b> owned or used by household members on a regular basis for personal transportation, or owned by a company rather than a household, but kept at home, regularly available for the use of household members.

40|$|The {{exploration}} of Mars {{is an important}} part of the space exploration programs of the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, and Japan. Many robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers have been launched toward Mars since the 1960 s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars as well as a preparation for a possible human mission to Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. In this context, taking into consideration other future means of exploration is a must. Since the Mars atmosphere is about 95. 3 % carbon dioxide, 2. 7 % nitrogen and 1. 6 % argon, the CO 2 in the Martian atmosphere may become an oxidizer of unconventional fuelled ramjets such as, in-situ manufactured silanes (Sin H 2 n+ 2) [1, 2]. Compared to a rocket 'hopper', ramjets using the Martian atmosphere may save on-board propellant and thus vehicle mass, a crucial issue, since any such <b>vehicle</b> <b>must</b> <b>either</b> be ferried from Earth, or built in situ. In a previous work [3] by these authors, a preliminary analysis for the feasibility of a hypersonic, CO 2 -breathing ramjet using silanes as fuel was demonstrated: in fact, assuming a total structural weight index of 21. 0 kgf/m 2 (weight index 7. 93 kgf/m 2 on Mars) and a cruise range of 5, 000 km yielded realistic solutions for current industrial materials and fabricating capabilities. In particular, for a 1 -metric ton payload, a take-off gross weigh (TOGW) of order 3. 2 ton, including the propellants needed to achieve ramjet operation turned out. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the engine flow path and of the cruise CL best conditions has been done. In fact, in order to define the optimal engine cycle (i. e., TBCC, RBCC) and combustor flow speed a Builder [4] analysis is performed. The critical flight speed above which the flow must become supersonic within the combustor is found to be 1600 m/s. The most favourable speed for cruise CL is found to be in the Mach range 6 - 7. This speed put this vehicle in the class of hypersonic vehicles with supersonic flow through the combustor...|$|R
