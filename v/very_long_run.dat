25|$|On 29 September 1931, {{the record}} attempt was made. Due to the {{aircraft}} having no flaps, Stainforth {{took off from}} the water after a <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> up. The record was established at a height of 400 m. He made a perfect record run over the four timed miles in opposing directions and achieved an average of , being the first {{man in the world}} to exceed 400mph. For this achievement he was awarded the Air Force Cross on 9 October 1931.|$|E
25|$|Sir Wesley Winfield Hall (born 12 September 1937) is a Barbadian former cricketer and politician. A tall, {{strong and}} powerfully built man, Hall {{was a genuine}} fast bowler and despite his <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> up, he was renowned {{for his ability to}} bowl long spells. Hall played 48 Test matches for the West Indies from 1958 to 1969. Hall's opening bowling {{partnership}} with fellow Barbadian Charlie Griffith was a feature of the strong West Indies teams throughout the 1960s. Hall {{was one of the most}} popular cricketers of his day and was especially popular in Australia, where he played two seasons in the Sheffield Shield with Queensland.|$|E

2500|$|Spofforth was lean {{but very}} strong at 6' 3" [...] tall (190.5cm) and {{weighing}} in at 12½ stone (80kg). He {{began as a}} fast bowler, {{although he did not}} have a <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run.</b> After the 1878 tour, as he began to study medium-paced and slow bowling, his speed quietened down to fast medium-pace with an occasional extra-fast or -slow ball thrown in; [...] "his objective", according to John Trumble, [...] "being a completely disguised combination of the three paces; and those who saw him bowling at his best will remember to what perfection he attained in this direction. His action on delivery was exactly the same for all of the three paces, and it was in his magnificent concealment of change in the pace of his bowling that he stood out from all other bowlers of all time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} the U.S. dollar {{declined}} significantly during wartime, especially during the American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. The Federal Reserve, which was established in 1913, was designed to furnish an [...] "elastic" [...] currency subject to [...] "substantial changes of quantity over short periods", which differed significantly from previous forms of high-powered money such as gold, national bank notes, and silver coins. Over the <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> the prior gold standard kept prices stable—for instance, the price level and the {{value of the}} U.S. dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s. The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U.S. dollar and price stability, reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing {{the value of the dollar}} during the 1920s, before presiding over a 30% deflation in U.S. prices in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Hicks and Terriss also starred here in Quality Street, {{a comedy}} by J. M. Barrie, which {{opened at the}} Vaudeville in 1902 and held the stage for another long run of 459 performances. It had first played in New York in 1901 but ran there for only a {{modestly}} successful 64 performances, {{making it one of}} the first American productions to score a bigger triumph in London. This was followed by the 1903 musical The Cherry Girl by Hicks, with music by Ivan Caryll, starring Hicks, Terriss and Courtice Pounds. [...] In 1904, Hicks scored an even bigger hit with the musical, The Catch of the Season, written by Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton, based on the fairy tale Cinderella. [...] It had a <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> of 621 performances, starring Hicks, Zena Dare (who created the role of Angela when Ellaline Terriss's pregnancy forced her to withdraw; and Dare was later replaced by Terriss and then by Dare's sister, Phyllis Dare) and Louie Pounds.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{printing}} plate materials: photopolymer and steel. Photopolymer plates are the most popular, as {{they are easy to}} use. These are typically used in short to medium production runs. Steel plates come in two forms: thin steel for medium to <b>long</b> <b>runs,</b> and thick steel for <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>runs.</b> Both steel plate types are generally processed by the plate supplier as it involves the use of specialized equipment.|$|R
50|$|A Brazilian tuck {{consists}} of the rider placing his/her back knee directly onto the board next to or behind the front foot. This Tuck has largely fallen out of favor for competitive riding. This is because it creates a very large frontal section that dramatically increases aerodynamic drag. It's mostly used by beginners or as a resting position for some people during <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{delivery}} pipe {{is much less}} critical since the pressure vessel prevents water hammer effects from traveling up it. Its overall design would {{be determined by the}} allowable pressure drop based on the expected flow. Typically the pipe size will be about half that of the supply pipe, but for <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>runs</b> a larger size may be indicated. PVC pipe and any necessary valves are not a problem.|$|R
60|$|A {{foreigner}} can {{do little}} good by talking of these things; {{for the same}} lean dry blood that breeds the fever of unrest breeds also the savage parochial pride that squeals under a steady stare or a pointed finger. Among themselves {{the people of the}} Eastern cities admit that they and their womenfolk overwork grievously and go to pieces very readily, and that the consequences for the young stock are unpleasant indeed; but before the stranger they prefer to talk about the future of their mighty continent (which {{has nothing to do with}} the case) and to call aloud on Baal of the Dollars--to catalogue their lines, mines, telephones, banks, and cities, and all the other shells, buttons, and counters that they have made their Gods over them. Now a nation does not progress upon its brain-pan, as some books would have us believe, but upon its belly as did the Serpent of old; and in the <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run</b> the work of the brain comes to be gathered in by a slow-footed breed that have unimaginative stomachs and the nerves that know their place.|$|E
6000|$|We then {{considered}} what {{we should}} do to get back again to Madagascar. We were much about the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, but had such a <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> and were neither sure of meeting with fair winds nor with any land in the way, that we knew not what to think of it. William was our last resort in this case again, and he was very plain with us. [...] "Friend," [...] says he to Captain Wilmot, [...] "what occasion hast thou to run the venture of starving, merely for the pleasure of saying thou hast been where nobody has been before? There are a great many places nearer home, of which thou mayest say the same thing at less expense. I see no occasion thou hast of keeping thus far south any longer than till you are sure you are to the west end of Java and Sumatra; and then thou mayest stand away north towards Ceylon, and the coast of Coromandel and Madras, where thou mayest get both fresh water and fresh provisions; and to that part it is likely we may hold out well enough with the stores we have already." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{penalty of}} shameful turpitude {{is that even}} {{reparation}} and contrition are made almost impossible by {{the dimensions of the}} abyss that separates the criminal from virtue. Or, more simply, the amount of explanation (of my baseness) that I have felt myself saddled with toward you, has long operated as a further and a fatal deterrent in respect to writing to you at all. The burden of my shame has in short piled up my silence, and to break that hideous spell I must now cast explanations to the winds--ere they crush me altogether. I've had a rather blighted and broken winter--a good deal of somewhat ominous unwellness, now happily (D.V.) over-past. Under the effect of it all my correspondence has gone to pieces, and though I've managed to write two books I've done so mainly by an economy of moyens that has forbidden my answering even a note or two. I've thought of you, dreamed of you, followed you, admired you, in fine tenderly loved you: done everything accordingly but treat you decently. But I'm all right in the long, the <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>run,</b> and your admirably interesting and charming letter of ever so many months ago has never ceased to be a joy and pride to me. Those emotions have just been immeasureably quickened by something told me by my brave little cousin Bay Emmet (the paintress)--viz. her having lately met you in New York and heard on your lips words (à mon adresse) not of resentment or scorn, but of divine magnanimity and gentleness. You appear to have spoken to her [...] "as if you still liked me," [...] and I like you so much for that that the vibration has started these stammering accents. I really write you these words not from my peaceful hermitage by the southern sea, but from the depths of the meretricious metropolis, which I've never known so detestable as at this most tawdry of crises, and from which I hope to escape in a day or two, utterly dodging the insane crush of the Coronation. The place is vilely disfigured by league-long hoardings (for spectators at £10 0. 0. a head,) and cheap and awful decorations, and the dear old Abbey in particular smothered into the likeness of the Earl's Court Exhibition--not to be distinguished from the Westminster Aquarium, in fact, opposite. And then the crowds, the gregarious, gaping millions, are appalling, and I fly, in fine, back to the Southern Sea--on the shore of which I've spent almost all my time for almost a year past. I've lately been dabbling a little, for compensation, in town; but I find small doses of London now go further, for my organisation, than they used.|$|E
500|$|The {{machinery}} arrangement [...] "provided good {{dispersal of}} the machinery spaces, {{but at the}} cost of <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>runs</b> for the wing shafts (ca. [...] )". The turbine compartments for the wing shafts were located forward of boiler room No. 1 and aft of the No. 2 turret magazines. The engine room for the center shaft's turbine was between boiler room No. 2 and No. 3. This meant that the wing propeller shafts had to run underneath the boilers.|$|R
