5|$|The <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> {{that was}} settled upon was a {{modified}} form of Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> the novel rotary cam-driven British Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> developed by Heenan & Froude with poppet valves. This {{was based on}} Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to the cylinders while improving exhaust flow and boiler draughting characteristics {{when compared to the}} more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> On paper this created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive capable of hauling heavy loads over long distances but, in practice, fundamental design errors and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{was based}} on the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia design. It {{incorporated}} three sets of modified Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> relatively new to British locomotive engineering and more efficient than Walschaerts or Stephenson <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The Duke was regarded as a failure by locomotive crews due to its poor steaming characteristics and its heavy fuel consumption. Trials undertaken by British Railways also returned negative feedback, reporting problems with the poor draughting of the locomotive which resulted in difficulty adhering to the timetables.|$|E

5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b> The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of three}} {{separate}} sets of <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> on the 1930 batch eased maintenance and improved the standardisation of parts. The prototype was rebuilt {{to the same}} specification as the 1930 batch, creating a robust workhorse capable of a good turn of speed when working heavy passenger and freight trains. The revised <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> layout was subsequently applied to the 3-cylinder U1 and Vclass designs. The relatively early withdrawal of the N1s pre-dated the era of preservationists buying withdrawn locomotives from scrap dealers or British Railways, and consequently no examples of the N1class survived into preservation.|$|E
5|$|The 1470-class Pacific was {{the third}} Great Northern {{locomotive}} type to incorporate Gresley's universal 3-cylinder layout. All three cylinders drove the middle coupled axle. The outside cranks were set at 120°, with the inside crank displaced by about 7 degrees {{to allow for the}} 1:8 inclination of the inside cylinder. Gresley conjugated <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> derived the motion of the inside valve spindle from the two outside valve spindles: this eliminated an inaccessible middle set of <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> between the frames. A feature of the K4 that had soon been abandoned by the Pennsylvania Railroad was an unusual three-bar version of the Laird slide-bar. However, Gresley adopted this type of slide-bar for all his locomotives and it was later taken up by Bulleid for his Pacifics and by Riddles for the British Railways standard designs.|$|E

5|$|The {{completion}} of the final locomotive, No. 34110 66 Squadron, in January 1951 was delayed for several months pending consideration of proposals from British Railways management for a major modification to a standard two-cylinder design without the chain-driven <b>valve</b> <b>gear.,</b> but the locomotive entered service as Bulleid intended.|$|E
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
50|$|Expansion valves {{were used}} for {{stationary}} engines and marine engines. They were not used for locomotives, although expansive working was achieved {{by the use of}} the later variable expansion <b>valve</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Corliss <b>valve</b> <b>gearing</b> allowed more uniform {{speed and}} better {{response}} to load changes, making it suitable for applications like rolling mills and spinning, and greatly expanding {{its use in}} manufacturing.|$|R
50|$|In {{stationary}} steam engines, traction {{engines and}} marine engine practice, {{the shortcomings of}} <b>valves</b> and <b>valve</b> <b>gears</b> were among the factors that lead to compound expansion. In stationary engines trip valves were also extensively used.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives found new homes on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The N1 {{prototype}} was {{the result}} of modifications made to Nclass No.822 during construction in 1922. The locomotive became operational in 1923 and used parts interchangeable with other Maunsell locomotive classes. The prototype N1 was {{the only member of the}} class constructed before the SECR became part of the Southern Railway at the Grouping in 1923, and featured a variant of the Gresley conjugated <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> designed by Harold Holcroft. The class set the precedent for the Southern Railway's subsequent 3-cylinder designs.|$|E
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
50|$|An {{expansion}} valve is a secondary valve within a steam engine. They represent an intermediate step between steam engines with non-expansive working and later <b>valve</b> <b>gears</b> {{that could provide}} for expansion by controlling the motion of a single valve.|$|R
50|$|ALE {{owned the}} UK {{rights for the}} {{production}} of poppet <b>valve</b> <b>gears</b> for steam locomotives, including British-Caprotti, and the Lentz Rotary Cam and Oscillating Cam systems. The most important locomotive equipped by the company was the unique BR Standard Class 8 4-6-2 No.71000 Duke of Gloucester.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fully}} {{developed}} {{forms of the}} high-speed engine (from around 1900) though, expansion was controlled by governing the timing of a single valve, rather than a separate expansion valve. These led to further complex valve types such as poppet valves, often driven by cam-based <b>valve</b> <b>gears</b> rather than linkages.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{grouping}} of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, modified the Urie locomotives in the light of operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his Chief Draughtsman James Clayton incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning {{that they could not}} be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather than the standard 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of <b>valve</b> <b>gear,</b> and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E
50|$|Later {{compound}} mill engines {{with sophisticated}} <b>valve</b> <b>gears</b> often fitted the complex gear to the HP cylinder whilst retaining a simpler traditional slide valve for the LP cylinder. Examples existed with four {{different sets of}} valves: drop valve HP inlets, Corliss HP exhausts and a LP slide valve with a Meyer expansion valve.|$|R

5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> {{proved to}} be expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the boiler lagging. Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the boiler lagging in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{experience}} with the Nclass prototype demonstrated that it was capable of coping with peacetime passenger and freight traffic on the mainline between London and Ramsgate, but Maunsell anticipated an increase in traffic that would require a more powerful locomotive capable of hauling longer trains. The use of larger engines was prevented by low permitted axle loadings on parts of the SECR network, caused by economies in track construction by using flint beach pebbles as track ballast; this material failed to hold the track in place when under strain and could not support heavy locomotives. In the meantime Maunsell settled upon producing a 3-cylinder version of the Nclass 2-6-0, which provided the opportunity to test {{a variant of the}} Gresley conjugated <b>valve</b> <b>gear</b> developed by his assistant, Harold Holcroft.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts <b>valve</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
