25|$|One {{might say}} {{the second stage}} of the {{amplifier}} is just a <b>voltage</b> <b>follower,</b> transmitting the voltage at the collector of the input transistor to the top of R2. That is, the monitored output signal is really the voltage at the collector of the input transistor. That view is legitimate, but then the <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> stage becomes part of the feedback network. That makes analysis of feedback more complicated.|$|E
25|$|We begin these {{examples}} {{with that of}} the differential amplifier, from which many of the other applications can be derived, including the inverting, non-inverting, and summing amplifier, the <b>voltage</b> <b>follower,</b> integrator, differentiator, and gyrator.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the strong}} (i.e., unity gain) {{feedback}} and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor stability margins. Consequently, the system may be unstable when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a lag compensation network (e.g., connecting the load to the <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> through a resistor) {{can be used to}} restore stability. The manufacturer data sheet for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{impedance}} {{is implemented}} by a non-inverting amplifier with gain of 0 < Av < 1. The (magnitude of) output voltage {{is less than}} the input voltage Vi and partially neutralizes it. Examples are imperfect <b>voltage</b> <b>followers</b> (emitter, source, cathode follower, etc.) and amplifiers with series negative feedback (emitter degeneration), whose input impedance is moderately increased.|$|R

2500|$|Another way to {{classify}} amplifiers {{is by the}} phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. [...] An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or {{mirror image of the}} input as seen on an oscilloscope). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An emitter follower is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. <b>Voltage</b> <b>follower</b> is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.|$|E
50|$|One {{aspect of}} buffer action is {{transformation}} of impedances. For example, the Thévenin resistance {{of a combination}} of a <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> driven by a voltage source with high Thévenin resistance is reduced to only the output resistance of the <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> (a small resistance). That resistance reduction makes the combination a more ideal voltage source. Conversely, a <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> inserted between a small load resistance and a driving stage presents a large load to the driving stage—an advantage in coupling a voltage signal to a small load.|$|E
50|$|In addition, this circuit {{is used to}} {{transform}} impedances. For example, the Thévenin resistance {{of a combination of}} a <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> driven by a voltage source with high Thévenin resistance is reduced to only the output resistance of the <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> (a small resistance). That resistance reduction makes the combination a more ideal voltage source. Conversely, a <b>voltage</b> <b>follower</b> inserted between a driving stage and a high load (i.e. a low resistance) presents an infinite resistance (low load) to the driving stage—an advantage in coupling a voltage signal to a large load.|$|E
