Amongst these technologies are a high resolution camera, navigation camera, hazard avoidance camera, an 800 N throttleable liquid main engine and attitude thrusters, altimeter, <b>velocity</b> <b>meter,</b> accelerometer, and the software needed to run these components. The lander's main engine has successfully undergone a high altitude test for a duration of 513 seconds, and closed loop verification tests of the sensors, actuators and software are planned for the middle of 2016. Engineering models of the lander began undergoing ground and aerial tests in late October 2016, in Challakere in the Chitradurga district of Karnataka. The ISRO created roughly 10 craters in the surface to help assess the ability of the lander's sensors to select a landing site.|$|E

Thus these types of meters are recommended to be installed horizontally with its roller index pointing skywards.|$|R

CFD simulations validated the subcritical contraction in a rectangular and trapezoidal cross section by showing errors within + 1. 8 and - 2. 2 %.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the measurement of self-aerated flow on the spillway of a large dam. The major part of the project involved the development of an air concentration probe and a <b>velocity</b> <b>meter</b> suitable for use under field conditions. The air concentration probe basically measures the electrical conductivity of a small filament of the flowing air-water mixture. The <b>velocity</b> <b>meter</b> measures the stagnation pressure at a point in the flow and relates this to the velocity and air concentration. Results subsequently obtained with the instruments on the spillway of the Aviemore Dam are presented. During testing, it was noted that the “critical point”, where aeration commenced, moved downstream with increasing flow discharge. Furthermore, it was found that its position could be predicted by means of a formula derived from a previous experimental study of model overflow spillways. An analysis of model data, obtained in a previous model study, was carried out and found to correlate well with the prototype data obtained on the Aviemore spillway. A design method for partially - aerated developing flows is presented. It was found that the governing criterion in spillway design is the extent of wall-induced aeration. Further development of the instruments to enable measurements to be made near the spillway side wall is discussed...|$|E

Acoustic Doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>meters</b> have been used for the field {{measurements of}} velocity and turbulence, particularly in the interface region between river channel and floodplain. The values of local shear velocity and roughness length for the reach under study were calculated using measured velocity data. The distributions of turbulent intensities, and the Reynolds stresses are also presented. The variation of horizontal shear stress in the vertical direction deviates from linear for the main channel/floodplain interaction region due to the existence of a lateral shear and momentum transfer from the floodplain towards the main channel. Comparisons are made between the field data and previous experimental data from the Flood Channel Facility...|$|R

30|$|Acoustic Doppler current {{profiler}} method (ADCPs) transmits sound {{into the}} water and receives echoes from particles suspended in the stream. The difference in the frequency of the transmitted sound and echoes is used to calculate the velocities of the particles and the water in which they are suspended (Costa et al. 2000, 2006). Mounted on a ship or a boat, ADCPs provide the quasi-continuous vertical profile of horizontal current (Muste et al. 2004; Chauhan et al. 2014). It measures boat speed and direction by tracking the river bottom and compensate for the boat movement in the computation of water velocities (Oberg and Mueller 2007). ADCPs can be classified into two classes {{on the basis of the}} techniques used to configure and process the acoustic signal-narrowband and broadband (Lu and Lueck 1999; Lee et al. 2014). ADCP method measures the stream discharge faster and yields accurate results because ADCPs measure a much larger portion of the water column (Mueller and Wagner 2009). It is non-invasive but costly and needs trained personnel, for if used with inappropriate techniques it may give inaccurate results, and is suitable only for large streams and rivers in flat terrains (Visbeck 2001; Flener et al. 2015). However, the ADCP equipment may be deployed by the use of a tethered boat, or small powered launches or catamarans, where, with the aid of two operators, this method can be used for small rivers (Herschy 2008; Flener et al. 2015). Acoustic <b>velocity</b> <b>meters</b> (AVMs) are not related to the float method. AVMs measure the flow velocity across the channel at one or more fixed levels and an index velocity rating is used to convert this velocity to the cross-sectional average velocity that is used to compute discharge. Some simple, narrow-beam acoustic Doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>meters</b> (ADVMs) measure <b>velocity</b> at a single point in the flow and relate this to the cross-sectional average velocity.|$|R
