5|$|By 1961, MIT had {{acquired}} the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer, {{the successor to}} the TX-0, which also used a <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> system. The system's comparatively small size and processing speed meant that, like with the TX-0, the university allowed its undergraduate students and employees to write programs for the computer which were not directly academically related whenever {{it was not in}} use. In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series. The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American academic institutions, making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
25|$|The {{golden age}} of arcade video games was the era of {{greatest}} popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is disputed, but key moments include the release of Space Invaders in 1978 {{and the introduction of}} <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> technology in 1979.|$|E
500|$|Asteroids was {{conceived}} {{during a meeting}} between Logg and Rains and used hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for Lunar Lander. Based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos and inspired by Spacewar!, Computer Space, and Space Invaders, Asteroids physics model, control scheme and gameplay theme were derived from these earlier games and refined through trial and error. [...] The game is rendered on a <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> in a two-dimensional view that wraps around in both screen axes.|$|E
50|$|Some refresh <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> use {{a normal}} {{phosphor}} that fades rapidly and needs constant refreshing 30-40 times per second {{to show a}} stable image. These displays such as the Imlac PDS-1 require some local refresh memory to hold the vector endpoint data. Other storage tube displays such as the popular Tektronix 4010 use a special phosphor that continues glowing for many minutes. Storage displays do not require any local memory. In the 1970s, both types of <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> were much more affordable than bitmap raster graphics displays when megapixel computer memory was still very expensive. Today, raster displays have replaced nearly all uses of <b>vector</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Golden Age {{also saw}} {{developers}} experimenting with <b>vector</b> <b>displays,</b> which produced crisp lines that couldn't be duplicated by raster displays. A {{few of these}} vector games became great hits, such as 1979's Asteroids, 1980's Battlezone and Tempest and 1983's Star Wars from Atari, as well as 1982's Star Trek from Sega. However, vector technology fell out of favor with arcade game companies due to {{the high cost of}} repairing <b>vector</b> <b>displays.</b>|$|R
50|$|The early black-and white <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> could {{somewhat}} distinguish {{for example}} a molecular structure from its surrounding electron density map for crystallographic structure solution work by drawing the molecule {{brighter than the}} map. Color display makes them easier to tell apart. During the 1970s two-color stroke-writing Penetron tubes were available, but not used in molecular computer graphics systems. In about 1980 Evans & Sutherland made the first practical full-color <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> for molecular graphics, typically attached to an E&S PS-300 display. This early color tube was expensive, because it was originally engineered to withstand the shaking of a flight-simulator motion base.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the exact}} years differ, all {{timelines}} overlap {{in the early}} 1980s. Technology journalist Jason Whittaker, in The Cyberspace Handbook, places {{the beginning of the}} golden age in 1978, with the release of Space Invaders. Video game journalist Steven L. Kent, in his book The Ultimate History of Video Games, places it at 1979 to 1983. The book pointed out that 1979 was the year that Space Invaders – which he credits for ushering in the golden age – was gaining considerable popularity in the United States, and the year that saw the advent of <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> technology which in turn spawned many of the popular early arcade games. However, 1983 was the period that began [...] "a fairly steady decline" [...] in the coin-operated video game business and when many arcades started disappearing.|$|E
2500|$|Early games used {{interactive}} {{electronic devices}} with various display formats. The earliest example is from 1947—a [...] "Cathode ray tube Amusement Device" [...] was filed {{for a patent}} on 25 January 1947, by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992. Inspired by radar display technology, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen. Other early examples include: The Nimrod computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain; OXO a tic-tac-toe Computer game by Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952; Tennis for Two, an electronic interactive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958; Spacewar!, written by MIT students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC PDP-1 computer in 1961; and the hit ping pong-style Pong, a 1972 game by Atari. Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights {{to play the game}} of Nim, OXO used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe Tennis for Two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court, and Spacewar! used the DEC PDP-1's <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> to have two spaceships battle each other.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other non-portable {{video game}} consoles, which {{connected}} to televisions and rendered raster graphics, the Vectrex has an integrated <b>vector</b> monitor which <b>displays</b> <b>vector</b> graphics. The Vectrex is monochrome and uses plastic screen overlays to simulate color and various static graphics and decorations. At the time, {{many of the}} most popular arcade games used <b>vector</b> <b>displays,</b> and through a licensing deal with Cinematronics, GCE was able to produce high-quality versions of arcade games such as Space Wars and Armor Attack.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vector</b> <b>displays</b> do {{not suffer}} from the display {{artifacts}} of aliasing and pixelation (especially, B&W ones; color displays keep some artifacts, due their discrete nature). But they are limited in that they can display only a shape's outline (advanced vector systems can provide {{a limited amount of}} shading). Text is crudely drawn from short strokes. Refresh <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> are limited in how many lines or how much text can be shown without refresh flicker. Irregular beam motion is slower than steady beam motion of raster displays. Beam deflections are typically driven by magnetic coils, and those coils fight against rapid changes to their current.|$|R
40|$|In the {{protocol}} presented here, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are specifically transduced with a <b>vector</b> <b>displaying</b> the HSC-activating polypeptides, stem cell factor (SCF) and thrombopoietin (TPO). Targeted HSC transduction is evaluated in the non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodefi-ciency (NOD/SCID) mouse model...|$|R
50|$|A vector monitor or <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> is {{a display}} device used for {{computer}} graphics {{up through the}} 1970s. It {{is a type of}} CRT, similar to that of an early oscilloscope. In a <b>vector</b> <b>display,</b> the image is composed of drawn lines rather than a grid of glowing pixels as in raster graphics. The electron beam follows an arbitrary path tracing the connected sloped lines, rather than following the same horizontal raster path for all images. The beam skips over dark areas of the image without visiting their points.|$|E
50|$|The 1982 {{release of}} Odyssey {{included}} seven programs for geographical analysis: Like {{most of the}} Laboratory's software, {{it was written in}} FORTRAN and operated on several platforms. The POLYPS and PRISM modules could draw maps on a variety of <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> devices.|$|E
50|$|Founded by Larry Rosenthal (game designer) {{and based}} on his patent for a custom arcade <b>vector</b> <b>display,</b> Vectorbeam was in direct {{competition}} with other arcade game manufacturers. The company ceased operations soon after poor sales of its Barrier arcade game, and sold its assets to Cinematronics.|$|E

50|$|The player {{controls}} Jack, {{who must}} climb the beanstalk {{to reach the}} castle, steal a series of treasures from the giant, and escape. The game used hardware licensed from Hara Industries of Japan, with raster graphics instead of the <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> Cinematronics was known for.|$|R
5000|$|... 1968 The Direct-View Bistable Storage Tube CRT retains static {{information}} displayed upon it, written using a steerable {{electron beam}} {{that can be}} turned off. In principle the DVBST is similar to an Etch-a-Sketch, and was used in <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> of early computers and in oscilloscopes.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 740 Cathode Ray Tube Output Recorder {{was also}} available, {{which is a}} 21-inch <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> with a very long {{phosphor}} persistence time of 20 seconds for human viewing, together with a 7-inch display receiving the same signal as the larger display but with a fast-decaying phosphor brightness designed to be photographed with an attached camera.|$|E
50|$|Cinematronics Incorporated was a {{pioneering}} arcade game developer that had its heyday {{in the era}} of <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> games. While other companies released games based on raster displays, early in their history, Cinematronics and Atari released vector-display games, which offered a distinctive look and a greater graphic capability (at the time), at the cost of being only black and white (initially).|$|E
50|$|The {{golden age}} of arcade video games was the era of {{greatest}} popularity and technological innovation for arcade video games. The exact time period is disputed, but key moments include the release of Space Invaders in 1978 {{and the introduction of}} <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> technology in 1979. The golden age lasted until the 1980s, when home video game consoles like the NES were introduced.|$|E
25|$|They draw {{graphics}} point-to-point, {{rather than}} scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs {{can be used}} in <b>vector</b> <b>displays,</b> and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vector</b> <b>displays</b> {{were good}} for showing data charts, modifying line {{drawings}} and CAD diagrams, tumbling 3-D wire-frame shapes, editing text, laying out printed pages, and playing simple games. But {{they did not}} handle colors, images, filled-in areas, black-on-white screens, or WYSIWYG fidelity to the fonts of professionally printed text.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vector</b> <b>{{displays}}</b> {{were used}} for head-up displays in fighter aircraft because of the brighter displays {{that can be achieved}} by moving the electron beam more slowly across the phosphors. Brightness is critical in this application because the display must be clearly visible to the pilot in direct sunlight.|$|R
50|$|Another type of 3D display {{which is}} a {{candidate}} member {{of the class of}} swept-volume 3D displays is the varifocal mirror architecture. One of the first references to this type of system is from 1966, in which a vibrating mirrored drumhead reflects a series of patterns from a high frame rate 2D image source, such as a <b>vector</b> <b>display,</b> to a corresponding set of depth surfaces.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternate}} form {{of information}} display using lines and curves {{is known as}} a <b>vector</b> <b>display,</b> was used with early computing devices such as air traffic control radar displays and pen-based plotters but is no longer used. Electronic vector displays were typically monochrome only, and either don't fill in the interiors of closed vector shapes, or shape-filling is slow, time-consuming, and often non-uniform, as on pen-based plotters.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{waveform}} {{monitors and}} other oscilloscopes have largely abandoned old-style CRT technology as well. All new waveform monitors {{are based on}} a rasterizer, a piece of graphics hardware that duplicates the behavior of a CRT <b>vector</b> <b>display,</b> generating a raster signal. They may come with a flat-panel liquid crystal display, or they may be sold without a display, in which case the user can connect any VGA display.|$|E

50|$|The density, capacity, {{and price}} of {{computer}} memory have improved steadily and exponentially for decades, an engineering trend called Moore's Law. The limitations of refreshed or storage <b>vector</b> <b>displays</b> were accepted {{only in the}} era when those displays were much cheaper than raster-scan alternatives.

50|$|The monitor was a 14-inch {{monochrome}} <b>vector</b> <b>display,</b> continually refreshed {{from local}} memory. Its normal resolution was 1024 by 1024 addressable points, and 2K x 2K in small-font scaling mode. The CRT electron beam moved freely in X and Y position and angle under program control to draw individual sloped lines and letter forms, {{much like the}} pen-on-paper motions of a pen plotter. The beam skipped blank areas of the screen. Things could be drawn in arbitrary order.|$|E
5000|$|Tempest {{was one of}} {{the first}} games to use Atari's Color-QuadraScan <b>vector</b> <b>display</b> technology. It was also the first game to allow the player to choose their {{starting}} level (a system Atari dubbed [...] "SkillStep"). This feature increases the maximum starting level depending on the player's performance in the previous game, essentially allowing the player to continue. Tempest {{was one of the}} first video games to sport a progressive level design in which the levels themselves varied rather than giving the player the same layout with increasing difficulty levels.|$|E
