40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{conceptual}} design of a low cost, twin-engine helicopter {{in the category of}} <b>Very</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Rotorcraft</b> CS-VLR (Anonymous, 2008) to be employed for pilot training and for territorial and environmental monitoring. A new class of rotorcraft is developed to ll a gap currently present in the market: A twin piston-engine helicopter. The twin engine will ensure the possibility to certify the aircraft as a Class-A VTOL aircraft and to y over densely populated areas. At the same time, the piston engine technology will ensure low acquisition and operating costs compared with classical twin-turbine engine helicopters, making this solution very attractive for the envisaged operative roles. The possibility to design such type or aircraft can be achieved by exploiting the potential of the Twin Pack Engine System (TEPS), a twin piston motorization that possesses the appropriate performance, degree of redundancy, reliability and costs for this peculiar role. The TEPS engine is currently developed by Robby Moto Engineering. The project {{is the result of the}} collaboration between Robby Moto Engineering (Project Manager), the Aerospace Science and Technology and Mechanical departments of Politecnico di Milano, AQM and Metasystem...|$|E

25|$|The Ultra-light {{found itself}} a {{casualty}} of the British defence economies of the later 1950s, {{as well as of}} intense competition from rival firms who had their own <b>light</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> projects, in particular the Saunders-Roe Skeeter. While Fairey attempted to proceed with development of the Ultra-light independently, promoting the type towards the civil market and achieving appropriate type certification for such use, no orders were ultimately received. The firm shelved the project, choosing to concentrate on the larger Fairey Rotodyne instead, which shared some design features.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated multidisciplinary rotorcraft design and optimization framework, deployed {{for the design}} and assessment of a conceptual rotorcraft powerplant configuration at mission level. The proposed approach comprises a wide-range of individual modeling theories applicable to rotorcraft flight dynamics, gas turbine engine performance and weight estimation {{as well as a}} novel physics-based, stirred reactor model for the rapid estimation of gas turbine gaseous emissions. A novel Single-Objective and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizer is coupled with the aforementioned integrated rotorcraft multidisciplinary design framework. The combined approach is applied to the multidisciplinary design and optimization of a reference Twin Engine <b>Light</b> civil <b>rotorcraft</b> modeled after the Eurocopter Bo 105 helicopter, operating on representative mission scenario. Through the application of Single-Objective optimization, optimum engine design configurations are acquired in terms of mission fuel consumption, engine weight and gaseous emissions at constant technology level. Multi-Objective studies are carried out in order to quantify the optimum interrelationship between mission fuel consumption and gaseous emissions for the representative Twin Engine <b>Light</b> <b>rotorcraft</b> operation and a variety of engine configurations. The proposed approach essentially constitutes an enabler in terms of focusing the multidisciplinary design of rotorcraft powerplants to realistic, three-dimensional operations and towards the realization of associated engine design tradeoffs at mission level...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "For several years, a number of aviation manufacturers have been designing and testing <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jets, a type of small jet aircraft equipped with advanced technologies and priced below other business jets. Aviation forecasters predict that thousands of <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jets will enter the National Airspace System (NAS) {{over the next two}} decades, contributing to the overall growth of the general aviation fleet. While some experts predict that <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jets will be used in ways that are similar to current general aviation aircraft, others predict that they will be used to expand the air taxi market to provide on-demand, point-to-point air transportation. In 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified the first <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jets for flight. This report identifies (1) current <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jet forecasts and what factors could affect <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jet deliveries, (2) how increasing numbers of <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jets might affect the capacity and safety of the NAS, (3) how FAA is planning to accommodate the entry of <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jets into the NAS, and (4) how <b>very</b> <b>light</b> jets might affect FAA's costs and Airport and Airway Trust Fund revenues. To address these issues, GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed agency officials and aviation experts. GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

40|$|IntroductionAlthough smoking {{prevalence}} and average cigarette consumption have declined, <b>very</b> <b>light</b> smoking (5 or fewer cigarettes per day) has increased. <b>Very</b> <b>light</b> smoking is common among young adult women. This study examines {{the differences between}} the sociodemographic and psychosocial factors associated with women in emerging adulthood who are <b>very</b> <b>light</b> smokers and similar women who are at other smoking levels. MethodsThe sample consisted of 9, 789 women aged 18 to 25 years {{who took part in the}} 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health in the United States. Variables were sociodemographic factors, psychological adjustment, substance misuse, smoking attitudes, daily smoking, age at smoking initiation, and nicotine dependence. Analyses used were 2 ̆ 0212 and multinomial logistic regression. ResultsAlmost a fifth of participants and about three-fifths of smokers were <b>very</b> <b>light</b> smokers (no more than 5 cigarettes per day). <b>Very</b> <b>light</b> smokers were relatively more likely than other smokers to be young (aged 18 to 20), to be from a minority group, and to have some college education. They also were less likely to be married. The characteristics of <b>very</b> <b>light</b> smokers (poor psychological adjustment and tendency to misuse other substances) were similar to the characteristics of other smokers. However, <b>very</b> <b>light</b> smokers were more likely than other smokers to recognize high risks in smoking, less likely to report nicotine dependence, and more likely to be nondaily smokers. ConclusionPrevention programs targeting women in emerging adulthood need to recognize the prevalence of <b>very</b> <b>light</b> smoking in this population. Although comorbid psychological disorders and substance use present challenges, <b>very</b> <b>light</b> smokers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 perception of higher smoking risks and lower nicotine dependence compared with that of other smokers provide intervention opportunities. 26182146 PMC 450910...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{examine the}} {{relevance}} of physical activity intensity when assessing the relationship between activity and psychological health in 9 – 10 -year-old children. Methods Activity was assessed by accelerometry in 57 boys (n = 23) and girls (n = 34). Total activity and time spent in <b>very</b> <b>light</b> (≤ 1. 9 METs) through to vigorous activity (≥ 6 METs) were recorded. Psychological health inventories to assess anxiety, depression and aspects of self-worth were completed. Results Time accumulated in <b>very</b> <b>light</b> activity had positive correlations with anxiety and depression (r > 0. 30, p − 0. 29, p − 0. 30, p 0. 28, p < 0. 05). Children spending over 4 h in <b>very</b> <b>light</b> intensity activity had more negative psychological profiles than children spending under 4 h at this intensity. Conclusion Aspects of psychological health were negatively correlated with <b>very</b> <b>light</b> intensity activity and positively correlated with vigorous intensity activity. Further research should investigate whether reducing time spent in <b>very</b> <b>light</b> intensity activity and increasing time spent in vigorous intensity activity improves psychological health in children...|$|R
