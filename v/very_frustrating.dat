25|$|The Dukes of Hazzard was {{consistently}} among the top-rated television series (at one point, ranking {{second only to}} Dallas, which immediately followed the show on CBS' Friday night schedule). With that success came huge profits in merchandising, with {{a wide array of}} Dukes of Hazzard toys and products being licensed and becoming big sellers. However, {{over the course of the}} show's fourth season, series stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider became increasingly concerned about a contract dispute over their salaries and merchandising royalties owed to them over the high sales of Dukes products. Neither were being paid what was owed to them and this became <b>very</b> <b>frustrating</b> to the duo. As a result, in the spring of 1982, as filming was due to begin on the fifth season, Wopat and Schneider did not report to the set in protest over the matter. Catherine Bach also considered walking out due to similar concerns, but Wopat and Schneider convinced her to stay, insisting that if she left then there may not be a show to come back to, and that settling the issue was up to them.|$|E

Matt Wittaker (Hardcore Gamer) appreciated the quests: he praised the main questline for its focus on [...] "moral ambiguity and tough choices", saying that that was what Fallout fans were seeking. The reviewers for Game Revolution and GameCentral disliked the puzzles, as did Jack de Quidt (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) who regarded them as <b>very</b> <b>frustrating</b> even though he felt they were [...] "a {{small part of the}} release".

The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture.

Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was <b>very</b> <b>frustrating</b> to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup.

Even people in the business think the guy who did Birdcage, Quiz Show and Great Expectations are three different actors—which in a way makes me proud, but in another way is <b>very</b> <b>frustrating.</b> It's the curse and blessing of the character actor". The shoot's physical challenges, and the film's critical failure, led Azaria to later describe it as [...] "tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, 'That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time'." [...] In 1999, he starred in the drama Mystery, Alaska as Charles Danner, and the comedy superhero film Mystery Men, as the faux-British silverware throwing expert The Blue Raja.

[...] EGM found the challenge to be [...] "rewarding" [...] as it [...] "motivates you to actually get better at the game." [...] Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially <b>very</b> <b>frustrating</b> and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. Ninja Gaiden, in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings [...] "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of War and Peace."
