25|$|Whitcomb {{married his}} wife, the wealthy widow Martha Ann Renick Hurts, on March 24, 1846. The couple soon {{had a baby}} girl, on July 1, 1847. The {{pregnancy}} was difficult for his wife, and she died only sixteen days after giving birth. The death was <b>very</b> <b>troubling</b> to Whitcomb, who shut himself away for several days. His daughter grew up to marry a prominent Terre Haute lawyer, Claude Matthews, who was elected governor of Indiana in 1896.|$|E
25|$|When {{a parent}} or {{caregiver}} dies or leaves, children may have symptoms of psychopathology, but they are less severe than in children with major depression. The loss of a parent, grandparent or sibling can be <b>very</b> <b>troubling</b> in childhood, but even in childhood there are age differences {{in relation to the}} loss. A very young child, under one or two, may be found to have no reaction if a carer dies, but other children may be affected by the loss.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2015, Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, {{who served}} in the House {{throughout}} Hastert's tenure as speaker, released a statement reading: [...] "Anyone who knows Denny is shocked and confused by the recent news. The former speaker should be afforded, like any other American, his day in court to address these very serious accusations. This is a <b>very</b> <b>troubling</b> development that we must learn more about, but I am thinking of his family during this difficult time." [...] On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk's 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert's Keep our Mission PAC. Kirk's announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)'s call upon the senator to [...] "return or donate Denny Hastert's money immediately." [...] The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert's PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.|$|E

2500|$|Don MacKay of the Canadian Foundation of the Americas {{was troubled}} by the coup, saying: [...] "This {{is the first time}} in a decade the {{military}} has stepped into power in Latin America. It is <b>very</b> <b>troubling....</b> This will be a test case to see whether the OAS's democracy clause has any teeth." [...] Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Pérez Roque said that in the eyes of his country Chávez was still president, and Cuba's Communist Party daily, Granma, wrote that Chávez had been [...] "overthrown in a conspiracy by the country's wealthy classes, corrupt politicians and the news media." ...|$|E
2500|$|Likewise, in {{agreement}} with Ottolenghi, the journalist Dan Rickman said that [...] "Shahak ignores [...] aspects of the sources. Further, through overstating his case, his analysis fits into anti-Semitic traditions of such accusations against the Talmud. Copies of the Talmud have been burned, and {{the text of the}} Talmud that is studied today is still heavily censored. Shahak's view that chauvinism in these sources in any way 'justifies' anti-Semitism is also <b>very</b> <b>troubling.</b> However, I do believe that his trenchant critique of Judaism is, tragically, not without some force. The contemporary situation is that we do see some modern Orthodox rabbis utilise xenophobic sources in modern rulings. Orthodox rabbis in organisations such as Rabbis for Human Rights are sadly {{the exception rather than the}} rule".|$|E
2500|$|According to Richard W. Hurd, {{the history}} of the {{organizing}} model in the U.S. began from the failure of a [...] "labor law" [...] to be passed in the 1970s. In addition, Hurd explains that the 1980s were a <b>very</b> <b>troubling</b> time for unions in the U.S. as a result of [...] "...the anti-union reign of Ronald Reagan..." [...] and [...] "Twin recessions." [...] Both of these factors contributed to the decline of union membership that so infamously characterized the labor movement in the U.S. in the 1980s. In fact, Hurd says that, [...] "The labor movement lost more than one-fifth of its private sector members {{during the first half of}} the 1980s." [...] Therefore, U.S. unions were forced to try some new tactics in the hopes of regaining the membership they were losing.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} {{widespread}} calls from public figures, governments and organizations to the Iranian government {{to release the}} Bahá'ís, especially after the trial was announced on February 11, 2009. Many Brazilian members of government have spoken out for the Bahá'ís as early as April 2008. [...] From the United States, representative Frank R. Wolf stated he was deeply disturbed about the systematic persecution of the Bahá'ís witnessed through the announced trial. [...] Later congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois offered a resolution {{on the subject of}} the trial condemning the government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Bahá'í minority; the resolution was co-sponsored by other Representatives. A Senatorial resolution has been introduced by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, cosponsored by Sam Brownback, Kansas; Robert Menendez, New Jersey; Olympia Snowe, Maine; and Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island. In Canada, Deepak Obhrai, Canadian Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, found the announcement of the trial <b>very</b> <b>troubling,</b> which was echoed by Lawrence Cannon, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs. In Germany, German chairman of the CSU Group in the Bundestag, Peter Ramsauer stated that he had [...] "deep concern". In the United Kingdom, British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell also expressed concern over the trial. The Presidency of the European Union (EU), with the support of the EU associated countries denounced the trial, which was echoed by the President of the European Parliament. In Australia, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spoke to the subject, as did Mark Weitzman, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Task Force Against Hate. In the Netherlands, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen said the Netherlands was seriously concerned, fears that the trial will not be fair and has asked for an independent observer. The Canadian Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Human Rights has adopted a strongly worded motion February 24 which was forwarded to the full committee on the 26th. On the same day the UK Board of Deputies president, Henry Grunwald QC, has written to Foreign Secretary David Miliband with a renewed call to the government to support the persecuted Bahá’i community in Iran. Repeating steps taken in 2006 following the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Religion reports of the time, in April 2009 the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House of the Spanish Congress of Deputies unanimously approved a resolution concerning the [...] "systematic" [...] persecution being exerted on the Bahá'í community. In May 2009 a motion from the Australian House of Representatives expressed [...] "serious concern" [...] there was no access to legal representation or due legal process, that charges of [...] "spying, insulting religious sanctities, and propaganda against the Islamic Republic, and that these charges could attract the death penalty". The Representatives rose in motion calling on Iran [...] "to respect rights to freedom of religion and the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression and association, in accordance with international human rights conventions" [...] and [...] "to release the seven Baha’i detainees without delay." [...] Six members of Parliament from both major parties spoke in support of the motion: Leichhardt Turnour, Cowan Simpkins, Hindmarsh Georganas, O’Connor Turckey, Isaacs Dreyfus, and Longman Sullivan. Members of the German Bundestag, partisan speakers Erika Steinbach MP (CDU/CSU), Christoph Strässer MP (SPD), Volker Beck MP (B90/DIE GRÜNEN) and chairman Burkhardt Müller-Sönksen MdB (FDP) united in issuing a joint declaration demanding [...] "the immediate and unconditional release of the leaders of the Baha’i religious community." ...|$|E
60|$|Oliver Haddo began then {{to speak}} of Leonardo da Vinci, {{mingling}} with his own fantasies the perfect words of that essay which, so wonderful was his memory, he seemed to know by heart. He found exotic fancies in the likeness between Saint John the Baptist, with his soft flesh and waving hair, and Bacchus, with his ambiguous smile. Seen through his eyes, the seashore in the Saint Anne had the airless lethargy of some damasked chapel in a Spanish nunnery, and over the landscapes brooded a wan spirit of evil that was <b>very</b> <b>troubling.</b> He loved the mysterious pictures in which the painter had sought to express something {{beyond the limits of}} painting, something of unsatisfied desire and of longing for unhuman passions. Oliver Haddo found this quality in unlikely places, and his words gave a new meaning to paintings that Margaret had passed thoughtlessly by. There was the portrait of a statuary by Bronzino in the Long Gallery of the Louvre. The features were rather large, the face rather broad. The expression was sombre, almost surly in the repose of the painted canvas, and the eyes were brown, almond-shaped like those of an Oriental; the red lips were exquisitely modelled, and the sensuality was curiously disturbing; the dark, chestnut hair, cut short, curled over the head with an infinite grace. The skin was like ivory softened with a delicate carmine. There was in that beautiful countenance more than beauty, for what most fascinated the observer was a supreme and disdainful indifference to the passion of others. It was a vicious face, except that beauty could never be quite vicious; it was a cruel face, except that indolence could never be quite cruel. It was a face that haunted you, and yet your admiration was alloyed with an unreasoning terror. The hands were nervous and adroit, with long fashioning fingers; and you felt that at their touch the clay almost moulded itself into gracious forms. With Haddo's subtle words the character of that man rose before her, cruel yet indifferent, indolent and passionate, cold yet sensual; unnatural secrets dwelt in his mind, and mysterious crimes, and a lust for the knowledge that was arcane. Oliver Haddo was attracted by all that was unusual, deformed, and monstrous, by the pictures that represented the hideousness of man or that reminded you of his mortality. He summoned before Margaret the whole array of Ribera's ghoulish dwarfs, with their cunning smile, the insane light of their eyes, and their malice: he dwelt with a horrible fascination upon their malformations, the humped backs, the club feet, the hydrocephalic heads. He described the picture by Valdes Leal, in a certain place at Seville, which represents a priest at the altar; and the altar is sumptuous with gilt and florid carving. He wears a magnificent cope and a surplice of exquisite lace, but he wears them as though their weight was more than he could bear; and in the meagre trembling hands, and in the white, ashen face, in the dark hollowness of the eyes, there is a bodily corruption that is terrifying. He seems to hold together with difficulty the bonds of the flesh, but with no eager yearning of the soul to burst its prison, only with despair; {{it is as if the}} Lord Almighty had forsaken him and the high heavens were empty of their solace. All the beauty of life appears forgotten, and there is nothing in the world but decay. A ghastly putrefaction has attacked already the living man; the worms of the grave, the piteous horror of mortality, and the darkness before him offer naught but fear. Beyond, dark night is seen and a turbulent sea, the dark night of the soul of which the mystics write, and the troublous sea of life whereon there is no refuge for the weary and the sick at heart.|$|E

50|$|Prayers of {{individual}} Carthaginians were often addressed to Baal Hammon. Yet this deity was {{recipient of the}} <b>very</b> <b>troubling</b> practice of child sacrifice. Diodorus (late 1st century BC) wrote that when Agathocles had attacked Carthage (in 310) several hundred children of leading families were sacrificed to regain the god's favour. Modernly, the French novelist Gustave Flaubert's 1862 work Salammbô graphically featured this god as accepting such sacrifice.|$|E
