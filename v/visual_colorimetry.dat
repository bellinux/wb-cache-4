The first method {{is based on}} direct measurements of mass before and after corrosion tests. The second approach follows the principle of <b>visual</b> <b>colorimetry</b> by which soluble corrosion products are transformed into red complexes allowing monitoring of the products&# 8217; concentration according to increases in solution color intensity. Both methods proved able to determine the corrosion rate...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and rapid method of {{evaluating}} galvanized steel sheet corrosion in a CuSO 4 solution, as an experimentation proposal for corrosion teaching. Galvanized steel corrosion is present in tanks and tubing by leading of natural or industrial waters which contain soluble copper compounds. This was the rationale for choosing the Cu 2 + ions solution as an oxidizing agent. The method principle is based on <b>visual</b> <b>colorimetry</b> because the used oxidant has an intense blue color. Thus, a change in its concentration {{as a result of}} the corrosive process can be followed by a color intensity change in the solution thereby allowing evaluation of the corrosion rate...|$|E
40|$|It was {{developed}} {{a study of}} optimal conditions for functionalizing an anionic resin (Dowex 1 X 8) with a reagent (diphenylcarbazide) specifically designed for the determination of Hg (II) in aqueous solutions. The setting of conditions was carried out to determine the Hg-DFC complex, which can achieve an effective, fast and inexpensive method to detect concentrations of Hg in arrays of organic nature, even complex, by performing spectrophotometry UV-Vis absorption (solid-phase spectrophotometry). The resin {{can be used to}} pre-concentrate Hg (II) during pre-treatment for analysis with specific instrumental methods (absorption/atomic emission). Also, the intensity of color developed by the functionalized resin is closely linked with Hg(II) concentrations in the samples, which implies that the method can be performed even if the necessary equipment is not available, using semi-quantitative techniques such as <b>visual</b> <b>colorimetry</b> (naked eye) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{test and}} {{improve the quality of}} color images, we need to knowhow the human <b>visual</b> system operates. <b>Colorimetry</b> is a method thatquantitatively assesses the changes that the {{engineer}} makes to an image. Recent advances in this field are due {{to a better understanding of}} visualmechanisms. This chapter first describes the physiological mechanisms that aretransferred from the retina in the eye to the human brain, which producethe physiological perception of color. Then it presents two approaches tocolorimetry: first, as recommended by the International Commission onIllumination (CIE), and second, deriving directly from the physiologyof the visual system that results in the ability to specify stimuli andcolor differences. Finally, the chapter outlines the difficulties in definingthe appearance of color and the advantages in modeling the humanvisual system...|$|R
30|$|Lubricant oils take {{significant}} part in current {{health and environmental}} considerations since they are an integral and indispensable component of modern technology. Antioxidants {{are probably the most}} important additives used in oils because oxidative deterioration {{plays a major role in}} oil degradation. Zeolite nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven as another option as green antioxidants in oil formulation. The anti-oxidative behavior of zeolite NPs is obvious; however, the phenomenon is still under investigation. Herein, a study of the effect of extra-framework cations stabilized on Linde Type L (LTL) zeolite NPs (ca. 20 nm) on inhibition of oxidation in palm oil-based lubricant oil is reported. Hydrophilic LTL zeolites with a Si/Al ratio of 3.2 containing four different inorganic cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Ca 2 +) were applied. The oxidation of the lubricant oil was followed by <b>visual</b> observation, <b>colorimetry,</b> fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 1 H NMR spectroscopy, total acid number (TAN), and rheology analyses. The effect of extra-framework cations to slow down the rate of oil oxidation and to control the viscosity of oil is demonstrated. The degradation rate of the lubricant oil samples is decreased considerably as the polarizability of cation is increased with the presence of zeolite NPs. More importantly, the microporous zeolite NPs have a great influence in halting the steps that lead to the polymerization of the oils and thus increasing the lifetime of oils.|$|R
40|$|Broadband <b>colorimetry,</b> <b>visual</b> photometry, {{near-infrared}} photometry, and 10 and 20 micron radiometry of the near-earth asteroids (NEAs) 1986 DA and 1986 EB {{are used}} to show that these objects belong to the M class of asteroids. The similarity among the distributions of taxonomic classes among the 38 NEAs to the abundances found in the inner astoroid belt between the 3 : 1 and 5 : 2 resonances suggests that NEAs have their origins among asteroids {{in the vicinity of}} these resonances. The implied mineralogy of 1986 DA and 1986 EB is mostly nickel-iron metal; if this is indeed the case, then current models for meteorite production based on strength-related collisional processes on asteroidal surfaces predict that these two objects alone should produce about one percent of all meteorite falls. Iron meteorites derived from these near-earth asteroids should have low cosmic-ray exposure ages...|$|R
40|$|Ispitani su faktori koji utječu na tačnost vizuelnog ocjenjivanja obojenosti otopina u usporedbi s ograničenim brojem standarda. Utvrđeno je da na tačnost ocjenjivanja utječe: (1) raspored standarda, i (2) diferencijalna osjetljivost ocjenjivača, što treba prije praktične primjene te metode provjeriti testiranjem. Najpovoljniji je logaritamski raspored standarda. Za takav niz standarda relativna pogreška ocjenjivanja podjednaka je za cijelo područje koncentracija obuhvaćeno standardnom skalom. Factors were {{investigated}} influencing {{the accuracy of}} visual estimation of colour intensity of solutions, made by comparison with {{a limited number of}} standards. Investigations were carried out with the yellow coloured product of ammonia with Nesslers reagent and for the magenta coloured product of NO 2 with Saltzman 2 ̆ 7 s reagent. Preliminary investigations have shown that: (I) the observers were not able to distinguish colour intensities if the optical density of the examined solution was greater than about 0, 5, (2) there were marked differences among observers as to the ability of judging colour intensity, (3) most observers were inclined to identify the sample with a standard or to place it just in the middle between two standards, (4) in consequence of (3) relative errors for low concentrations were rather high. On the basis of these results and taking into account Weber 2 ̆ 7 s law stating that the minimal noticeable difference between two stimuli and the basic stimulus are in a constant ratio over a wide range of intensities, the assumption was made that a logarithmic sequence of standards might prove best for practical <b>visual</b> <b>colorimetry.</b> Therefore, a logarithmic series of standards was prepared and compared with two different equidistant series. Enabling the observer to make the best use of his ability to differentiate colour intensities, the logarithmic sequence of standards proved the best for this purpose. In addition, with the logarithmic series the relative error of estimation was of the same order over the whole range of concentrations covered by standards. It is advisable to test candidates before using them as observers for <b>visual</b> <b>colorimetry.</b> With the logarithmic series performed, good observers are those making an average relative error below 5. 5...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Sensory {{evaluation}} and instrumental methods {{were applied to}} the evaluation of strawberry juice concentrate (68 °Brix) stored at 20 °C which had been produced both commercially (C-SJC) and in a pilot plant (SJC). Sensory evaluation included taste and aroma ratings by intensity scaling and time-intensity of taste, and <b>visual</b> <b>colorimetry</b> by matching Munsell color chips. Instrumental analyses included tristimulus colorimetry (i. e. Hunter colorimeter), spectrophotometric colorimetry for pigment analyses, titrametric analyses for acidity (pH and titratable acidity) and free α-amino acids (formol number), and headspace gas analyses for CO₂ and O₂. During six days storage of C-SJC, a decrease in concentration of anthocyanins and increase in polyphenolics (tannin) was associated {{with an increase in}} astringency. Free α-amino acids were observed to decrease, while CO₂ was released. These changes were associated with an increase in musty/moldy and pungent aromas. Free sugars and titratable acidity did not change. The pilot plant SJC was processed from blanched and unblanched fruit to evaluate the relative importance of oxidase activity (i. e. polyphenoloxidase) prior to pasteurization. The blanching treatment increased the astringency and sourness in unstored SJC. These affects were associated with an increase in concentration of polyphenolics (tannin). During storage, the blanch treatment decreased the rate of anthocyanin loss and decreased the release rate of CO₂, yet degradation rates were still high. The 0 ₂ concentration in headspace did not change significantly during storage indicating that polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity during storage was low. The musty/moldy and pungent aromas increased similarly to C-SJC. A chemical mechanism accounting for these changes is proposed where products from the oxidative degradation of ascorbic acid contribute directly or indirectly to the degradation of anthocyanins to yield browning. Further, high initial concentrations and subsequent decreases during C-SJC storage of free α-amino acids indicate that Strecker degradation is a participating mechanism. Associations of browning with the development of off-flavors suggest this chemical mechanism forms odor-active volatile compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of dyes and subsequent examination, with a <b>colorimetry</b> <b>visual</b> criterium, is a gastroenterology procedure for distinguishing, in endoscopic images, normal and aberrant colonic crypts. These {{are thought to}} be possible precursors of colon cancer. In this paper a combined image segmentation and parameter estimation model is proposed for in vivo colonic crypts’ images, obtained with chromoscopic colonoscopy. The parameter estimation is an inverse problem. It is formulated as a partial differential equation constrained optimization problem, and involves an absorption-diffusion equation. A Lagrange multiplier formulation is employed and analyzed for resolving this inverse problem. Using only the segmentation of the medical endoscopic image, which separates normal and aberrant crypts, the mathematical model, proposed in this paper, performs a non invasive mathematical, and dimensionless, quantification of the dye absorption and diffusion coefficients, as well as, the dye absorbed, in normal and aberrant colonic crypts. This mathematical quantification can be important for clinicians, if it is able to provide a distinction between individuals with and without cancer. Numerical simulations, on a test image and on some medical endoscopic images, are presented for the validation and evaluation of the proposed mathematical mode...|$|R
