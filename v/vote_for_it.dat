25|$|For much of {{the rest}} of his tenure of the Staffordshire seat, Littleton was either in default or on sick leave. He was {{considered}} still 'friendly' to the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, but was unable to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> On his death in 1812, his nephew Edward Walhouse replaced him as MP, soon after changing his name to Littleton. He was a very different MP from the 4th Baronet: urbane, studious, a master of political detail and a determined debater, he first joined the Canningite Tories, but later became a Whig.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} action of Obama's first 100 days was {{the passage of the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to address the Great Recession. After much debate, ARRA was passed by both the House and Senate on February 13, 2009. Originally intended to be a bipartisan bill, Congressional passage of the bill relied largely on Democratic votes, though three Republican Senators did <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The lack of Republican support for the bill, and the inability of Democrats to win that support, foreshadowed the gridlock and partisanship that continued throughout Obama's presidency. The $787 billion bill combined tax breaks with spending on infrastructure projects, extension of welfare benefits, and education.|$|E

There were expectations that at the interleague meetings that year, the National League teams would <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and the American League teams against it, leaving Landis to cast the deciding vote. In the event, the proposal was withdrawn, and Landis did not disclose how he would have voted on this early version of the [...] "designated hitter" [...] rule.|$|E

500|$|Two {{days after}} the election, Prime Minister Jan≈°a {{announced}} that he might resign following {{what was perceived as}} a heavy defeat for the Government: [...] "We will analyze the situation further, but all possibilities are open, including a resignation of the Government." [...] He said that [...] "it is particularly worrying that a lot of energy was invested in blackening the Government abroad", claiming his opponents portrayed Slovenia [...] "as Belarus" [...] or some other authoritarian country. The opposition parties said that talk of resignation just weeks before Slovenia took over European Union presidency was irresponsible and unwise, but the Prime Minister called a vote of confidence for 19 November 2007. The Government won the confidence vote, but support for the ruling SDS subsequently reached an all-time low, with only 18% of voters intending to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the fall 2008 election.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{supported}} a general amnesty for former Confederates, Blaine opposed extending it to include Jefferson Davis, and he cooperated with Grant {{in helping to}} pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in response to increased violence and disenfranchisement {{of blacks in the}} South. He refrained from voting on the anti-third term resolution that overwhelmingly passed the House that same year, believing that to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> would look self-interested. Blaine was loyal to Grant, and the scandals of the Grant administration did not seem to affect how the public perceived him; according to his biographer, Blaine was never more popular than when he was Speaker of the House. Liberal Republicans saw him as an alternative to [...] the evident corruption of other Republican leaders, and some even urged him to form a new, reformist party. Although he remained a Republican, this base of moderate reformers remained loyal to Blaine and became known as the Half Breed faction of the party.|$|E

When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's {{the most important thing to}} me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> We're out here on the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E

Producer Don Hahn expressed concern that this would cause confusion among audiences and voters, and potentially result in an unfavorable tie. In order to prevent this from happening, the studio fought {{in favor of the}} film's title song and decided to release a pop rendition of [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as a commercial single in an attempt to persuade voters to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> When [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was written, it was composed with the potential of having [...] "half a life outside the movie."

Employing a method known as [...] "catch and release", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips {{from both sides of the}} aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power.|$|E

In December Samuel Whitbread MP introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and Fox said he would <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture, Arthur Young; but he failed to complete it. These fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as, Thoughts and Details on Scarcity.

2500|$|In 2002, Congressional Democrats {{were divided}} on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq: 147 voted against it (21 in the Senate and 126 in the House) and 110 voted for it (29 in the Senate, 81 in the House). Since then, many {{prominent}} Democrats, such as former Senator John Edwards, have expressed regret about this decision, and have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator Hillary Clinton have criticized {{the conduct of the}} war but not repudiated their initial <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> (though Clinton later went on to repudiate her stance during the 2008 primaries). Referring to Iraq, in April 2007 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared the war to be [...] "lost" [...] while other Democrats (especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle) accused the president of lying to the public about WMDs in Iraq.

Thornton that congressional term limit laws are unconstitutional, so a constitutional amendment {{is the only way}} to implement term limits. Gutknecht voted for such a proposed amendment in 1995, which failed to muster the two-thirds <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to move on to the Senate. After Gutknecht was elected in November 1994, he pledged to serve no more than 12 years. In March 1995 he drafted a bill that would bar House members from accruing additional pension benefits after they have served for six terms.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{volume of}} research has suggested the efficacy of get-out-the-vote campaigns in the UK: having identified its potential supporters, a party then contacts them {{to encourage them to}} turn out on election day, and those contacted are more likely to reward the party by <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> than are those not contacted. This article illustrates these findings with data from the 2011 Welsh Election Study. Each of the four main parties concentrated its attention on those who <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> at the previous contest in 2007; those contacted - especially those contacted via media other than leaflets - were more likely to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> the party again in 2011 than those who were not contacted...|$|R

2500|$|PR {{tries to}} resolve the {{unfairness}} of majoritarian and plurality voting systems where the largest parties receive an [...] "unfair" [...] "seat bonus" [...] and smaller parties are disadvantaged and have difficulty winning any representation at all (Duverger's law). The established parties in UK elections can win formal control of the parliament with as little as 35% of votes (2005 UK general election). In certain Canadian elections, majority governments have been formed by parties {{with the support of}} under 40% of votes cast (2011 Canadian election, 2015 Canadian election). If turnout levels in the electorate are less than 60%, such outcomes allow a party to form a majority government by convincing as few as one quarter of the electorate to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> [...] In the 2005 UK election, for example, the Labour Party under Tony Blair won a comfortable parliamentary majority with the votes of only 21.6% of the total electorate. [...] Such misrepresentation has been criticized as [...] "no longer a question of 'fairness' but of elementary rights of citizens". [...] However, PR systems with a high electoral threshold, or other features that reduce proportionality, are not necessarily much fairer: in the Turkish general election, 2002, using an open list system with a 10% threshold, 46% of votes were wasted.|$|E
