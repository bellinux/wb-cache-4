This type of compressor uses a special drive to control the speed (RPM) of the unit, which in turn saves energy compared to a fixed speed equivalent.|$|E
50|$|While an air {{compressor}} {{powered by a}} <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive</b> can offer the lowest operating-energy cost without any appreciable reduction in service life over a properly maintained load/unload compressor, the variable-frequency power inverter of a <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive</b> typically adds significant cost {{to the design of}} such a compressor, negating its economic benefits if there are limited variations in demand. However, a <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive</b> provides for a linear relationship between compressor power consumption and free air delivery. In harsh environments (hot, humid or dusty), variable-speed drives may not be suitable due to the sensitivity of the equipment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{describes}} the modelling and {{the prediction of}} the steady-state or transient behaviour of different modern <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drives</b> and electrical networks. The necessity of a performant numerical simulation tool in order to guarantee an optimized design is illustrated by examples based on existing large <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drives</b> and power plants...|$|R

50|$|Annette Muetze {{from the}} Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2016 for {{contributions}} to the analysis and mitigation of bearing currents in <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} varying the fan speed {{is to use}} an electronic <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive</b> to control {{the speed of the}} motor driving the fan. This offers better overall energy efficiency than mechanical couplings, especially at greatly-reduced speeds.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{application}} of <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive</b> (VSD) technology has increased efficiencies of vaporcompression chillers. The first VSD {{was applied to}} centrifugal compressor chillers in the late 1970s andhas become the norm {{as the cost of}} energy has increased. Now, VSDs are being applied to rotary screwand scroll-technology compressors.|$|E
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} servomotors use optical rotary encoders {{to measure}} {{the speed of the}} output shaft and a <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive</b> to control the motor speed. Both of these enhancements, usually in combination with a PID control algorithm, allow the servomotor to be brought to its commanded position more quickly and more precisely, with less overshooting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Variable-speed</b> <b>drives</b> {{can also}} run a motor in {{specialized}} patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an S-curve pattern {{can be applied}} to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} is energy savings and reduced wear. VAV fan control, especially with modern electronic <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drives,</b> reduces the energy consumed by fans, {{which can be}} a substantial part of the total cooling energy requirements of a building. Modulating control of the compressor also reduces wear and delivers further energy savings.|$|R

5000|$|An adjustable-speed drive (ASD) or <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive</b> (VSD) is an {{interconnected}} {{combination of}} equipment {{that provides a}} means of driving and adjusting the operating speed of a mechanical load. An electrical adjustable-speed drive consists of an electric motor and a speed controller or power converter plus auxiliary devices and equipment. In common usage, the term “drive” is often applied to just the controller. Most modern ASDs and VSDs can also implement soft motor starting.|$|E
40|$|Many {{electrical}} machines are nowadays controlled using digital controllers resulting in <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drives.</b> To enhance control engineers {{want to deal}} with the switching behaviour of the power converters or pulse-width modulation in more detail.

50|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{adjustment}} in compressor power consumption relative to compressed-air output capacity, modulation is a generally inefficient method of control when compared to <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drives.</b> However, for applications where it is not readily possible to frequently cease and resume operation of the compressor (such as when a compressor is driven by an internal-combustion engine and operated without {{the presence of a}} compressed-air receiver), modulation is suitable.|$|R
50|$|A wound-rotor motor {{can be used}} {{in several}} forms of adjustable-speed drive.

All of the heads offer variable speeds, the earlier ones via a step pulley (cone pulley) and the later ones via electrically or electronically modulated <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drive.</b> Typical table sizes are 9″ × 49″ (Y and X, respectively) and 10″ × 54″. Machine tapers for toolholding include Morse tapers (on early models) and the R8 taper (a widely used standard that Bridgeport created) on most models. Both Morse and R8 allow for both collets and solid holders; and a drill chuck can be held by either of the latter. Machine slides are of the dovetail type, and rotary bearings are mostly of the roller and ball types.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Multiphase <b>variable-speed</b> <b>drives,</b> {{supplied}} from two-level voltage-source inverters (VSIs), are nowadays con-sidered {{for various}} industrial applications. Depending {{on the drive}} structure and/or the motor design, the VSI is required to generate either sinusoidal voltages or voltages that contain {{a certain number of}} sinusoidal components (“multifrequency out-put voltages”). The existing space vector pulsewidth-modulation (SVPWM) schemes are based on selection of (n − 1) active space vectors (for odd phase numbers) within a switching period and they yield either sinusoidal voltage or sinusoidal fundamental voltage in combination with a limited amount of other harmonic terms. This paper develops a SVPWM scheme, which enables multifrequency output voltage generation with arbitrary values of various sinusoidal components in the output voltage. The method is based on initial selection of (n − 1) 2 / 2 active space vectors within a switching period, instead of the common (n − 1) active vectors. By properly arranging the sequence of the vector applica-tion, it is possible to provide an automatic postreduction of the number of applied active vectors to (n − 1), thus maintaining the same switching frequency as with the existing schemes while simultaneously avoiding the limiting on the generated sinusoidal output voltage components. Theoretical considerations are de-tailed using a five-phase VSI. The experimental verification is provided using a five-phase two-motor series-connected induction motor drive, supplied from a custom-designed five-phase DSP– controlled VSI.
