2500|$|The {{design of}} the Stipa-Caproni was {{very similar to that}} of modern jet engines; in fact, after having {{patented}} his design in Italy, Germany, and the United States in 1938, Stipa became convinced that German rocket and jet technology (especially the V-1 flying bomb) was using his patented invention without giving proper credit. Stipas basic idea—which he called the [...] "intubed propeller"—was to mount the engine and propeller inside a fuselage that itself formed a tapered duct, or <b>venturi</b> <b>tube,</b> and compressed the propeller's airflow and the engine exhaust before it exited the duct at the trailing edge of the aircraft, essentially applying Bernoulli's principle of fluid movements to make the aircraft's engine more efficient.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, Stipa applied {{his study}} of {{hydraulic}} engineering to develop a theory of how to make aircraft more efficient as they traveled through the air. Noting that in fluid dynamics—in accordance with Bernoulli's principle—a fluid's velocity increases as the diameter of a tube it is passing through decreases, Stipa believed that the same principle {{could be applied to}} air flow to make an aircraft's engine more efficient by directing its propeller wash through a <b>venturi</b> <b>tube</b> in a design he termed an [...] "intubed propeller". In his concept, the fuselage of a single-engined airplane designed around an intubed propeller would be constructed as a tube, with the propeller and engine nacelle inside the tube, and therefore within the fuselage. The propeller would be of the same diameter as the tube, and its slipstream would exit the tube via the opening at the tube's trailing edge {{at the rear of the}} fuselage.|$|E

50|$|This {{is the use}} of {{pressure}} sensors in conjunction with the venturi effect to measure flow. Differential pressure is measured between two segments of a <b>venturi</b> <b>tube</b> that have a different aperture. The pressure difference between the two segments is directly proportional to the flow rate through the <b>venturi</b> <b>tube.</b> A low pressure sensor is almost always required as the pressure difference is relatively small.|$|E
5000|$|Venturi {{devices have}} also been used for over 100 years to measure fluid flow (<b>Venturi</b> <b>tubes</b> derived their name from Giovanni Battista Venturi, an Italian physicist).|$|R
50|$|<b>Venturi</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} to construct than a simple orifice plate which uses the same principle as a tubular scheme, but the orifice plate causes significantly more permanent energy loss.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Venturi</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are also}} {{used to measure the}} speed of a fluid, by {{measuring}} pressure changes at different segments of the device. Placing a liquid in a U-shaped tube and connecting the ends of the tubes to both ends of a Venturi is all that is needed. When the fluid flows though the Venturi the pressure in the two ends of the tube will differ, forcing the liquid to the [...] "low pressure" [...] side. The amount of that move can be calibrated to the speed of the fluid flow.|$|R

50|$|On petrol engines, fuel {{injection}} replaced carburetors from the 1980s onward.

50|$|Manufacturing puffed grain by venting a {{pressure}} chamber is essentially a batch process. To achieve large-scale efficiencies, continuous-process equipment has been developed whereby the pre-cooked cereal is injected into a high pressure steam chamber. It then exits the steam chamber via a <b>Venturi</b> <b>tube</b> to an expansion chamber, where the puffed cereal is collected and conveyed to the next process step.

50|$|Overall {{pressure}} loss across different pressure meters using a <b>Venturi</b> <b>tube</b> to measure flow causes a {{pressure drop in}} the flow which is partly recovered downstream of the meter. In dry gas flows the recovery is greater than in wet gas flows due to the liquid component. This difference can be exploited to provide a measurement for the liquid fraction.

JA Prestwich at first would deliver the same engine to the aircraft manufacturer, allowing them to make local modifications - mainly larger <b>venturi</b> <b>tubes</b> for the carburettor, to allow for greater air intake at altitude.

50|$|The Dall tube is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} a Venturi meter, with a lower pressure drop than an orifice plate. As with these flow meters the flow rate in a Dall tube is determined by measuring the pressure drop caused by restriction in the conduit.

Since these meters have significantly lower permanent pressure losses than orifice meters, Dall tubes are widely used for measuring the flow rate of large pipeworks. Differential pressure produced by a Dall tube is higher than <b>Venturi</b> <b>tube</b> and nozzle, all of them having same throat diameters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Venturi</b> <b>tubes</b> and orifice {{plates are}} devices largely {{used in the}} {{petroleum}} industry for measuring multiphase flows. In the project and calibration of these flow meters, the homogeneous model is commonly used. This model calculates the velocity and pressure drop of the mixture using correlations for single phase flow with a modified viscosity and density {{to account for the}} presence of the other phase, but no consideration is made about the relative velocity between the phases. However, the pressure difference, the measuring variable in these flow meters, is known to be affected by the relative velocity between phases, which be-comes more and more important when the flow mixture acceler-ates. This paper addresses this issue and aims to demonstrate the importance of using models which consider the relative velocity between phases in the calculation of the flow within a venturi me-ter. For this purpose, pressure-difference values obtained using the two-fluid model based on an Eulerian- Eulerian approach for the multiphase flow are compared with the results of the homo-geneous model and with experimental data. Both theoretical cal-culations are performed using the CFX 4. 4 package, code which solves multidimensional multiphase flows. Considerations about the two-fluid model are presented, focusing, on the effects of the stress tensor in the dispersed phase. Considerations regarding the two-dimensional nature of the flow are also made.
