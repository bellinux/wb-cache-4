40|$|Poly(vinyl alcohol), PVA, is {{the most}} active {{synthetic}} mimic of antifreeze proteins and has extremely high ice recrystallization inhibition, IRI, activity. Addition of PVA to cellular cryopreservation solutions increases the number of recovered viable cells due to its potent IRI, but it is intrinsically non-degradable in vivo. Here we report the synthesis, characterization and IRI activity of PVA-containing degradable ester linkages. <b>Vinyl</b> <b>chloroacetate,</b> VClAc, was copolymerized with 2 -methylene- 1, 3 -dioxepane (MDO) which undergoes radical ring-opening polymerization to install main-chain ester units. The use of the chloroacetate monomer enabled selective deacetylation with retention of esters within the polymer backbone. Quantitative IRI assays revealed that the MDO content had to be finely tuned to retain IRI activity, with higher loadings (24 mol%) resulting in complete loss of IRI activity. These degradable materials will help translate PVA, which is non-toxic and biocompatible into a range of biomedical applications...|$|E
