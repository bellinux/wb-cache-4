40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of}} the law that liberalizes voluntary abortion in Uruguay and enables health services to offer these services to the population. MethodsThe legal and regulatory provisions are described and the national data—provided by the Ministry of Public Health’s National Information System (SINADI) —on the number <b>of</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy, the abortion method (medical or surgical), and whether it was performed as an outpatient or inpatient are analyzed. To determine complications, the number of maternal deaths and admissions to intensive care units for pregnant women was used. The study period ran from December 1, 2012, to December 31, 2014. ResultsA total of 15 996 abortions were performed during the study period; only 1. 2 % were surgical and 98. 8 % were medical. Of the latter, only 3. 4 % required hospitalization. Less than half of the pregnancies were terminated up to 9 weeks of gestation and 54 % were at 10 to 12 weeks in a sample from the Pereira Rossell Hospital. ConclusionThe rapid nationwide rollout <b>of</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy <b>services</b> to all women was possible to a large degree thanks to the availability and broad acceptance of medical abortion, facilitated by the prior experience in applying the risk and harm reduction strategy...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> {{pregnancy}} has for a {{long time}} been a controversial theme. Few studies have been conducted in this context and they are frequently contaminated by methodological, theorical, ideological and legal biases, and no consensus exists regarding its psychological impact. This study aimed to evaluate the psychological adjustment to decision-making and to the experience <b>of</b> <b>voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy. Methods: The sample was collected in the Maternity Doctor Daniel de Matos of University of Coimbra Hospitals a tertiary care university hospital, and consisted of 53 women who requested <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy, between December 2007 and March 2008. Self-reporting instruments were used to assess women’s feelings before termination, and two to four weeks later. Results: The decision to terminate pregnancy involved many motivations, but the majority were of a socio-economical nature. It also generated negative emotional reactivity (anxiety and guilt) and psychopatology (somatization, anxiety, hostility and depression), that were significantly different to those of the general population. Respondents also experienced less happiness and more guilt than the general population. However, when compared to the moment of decision-making, responses after <b>voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy evidenced an increase in happiness and a decrease in anxiety. Discussion: Our results tend to support the model of stress and coping as the predominat psychological adaptation to <b>voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy...|$|R

ResultsDescriptive analysis of abortion before and after decriminalization showed that there was no reduction, during the period analyzed, in adolescent fertility, nor any changes in the distribution of births. ConclusionThe normative change brought about by the law on the <b>voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy was not associated with any substantial change in the reproductive behavior of adolescents in Montevideo.

40|$|Apoptosis {{is intimately}} {{involved}} in placental homeostasis, growth and remodelling, and apoptotic rates increase progressively during normal pregnancy as part of normal placental development. Moreover, apoptosis increases in pregnancies complicated by some pathologies such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and diabetes. In the present study, we describe differences in the expression of proapoptotic protein Bax, in first trimester <b>voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy, first trimester abortion (reserved abortion), caesarean birth, spontaneous birth, preeclampsia and diabetes. We first observed a strong increase of Bax expression in the cytotrophoblast, stroma, endothelial cells and decidua of placentas of the first trimester abortion compared to the low/moderate Bax immunopositivity in all the placental compartments during the first trimester <b>voluntary</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy. Secondly, we showed a more intense immunopositivity for Bax in the third trimester spontaneous birth {{with respect to the}} third trimester caesarean birth. Thirdly, we observed an increase of Bax expression in preeclamptic placentas compared to the normal full-term placentas. In contrast, we observed a moderate Bax expression in diabetic placentas only slightly lower than the normal full-term placentas. Our results seem to suggest that deregulation of apoptotic turnover may lead to placental dysfunction and pathologies...|$|R
