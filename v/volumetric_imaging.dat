40|$|International audienceSurgical {{treatment}} of {{epilepsy is a}} challenge for patients with non-contributive brain magnetic resonance imaging. However, surgery is feasible if the seizure-onset zone is precisely delineated through intracranial electroencephalography recording. We recently described a method, <b>volumetric</b> <b>imaging</b> of epileptic spikes, to delineate the spiking volume of patients with focal epilepsy using magnetoencephalography. We postulated that {{the extent of the}} spiking volume delineated with <b>volumetric</b> <b>imaging</b> of epileptic spikes could predict the localizability of the seizure-onset zone by intracranial electroencephalography investigation and outcome of surgical treatment. Twenty-one patients with non-contributive magnetic resonance imaging findings were included. All patients underwent intracerebral electroencephalography investigation through stereotactically implanted depth electrodes (stereo-electroencephalography) and magnetoencephalography with delineation of the spiking volume using <b>volumetric</b> <b>imaging</b> of epileptic spikes. We evaluated the spatial congruence between the spiking volume determined by magnetoencephalography and the localization of the seizure-onset zone determined by stereo-electroencephalography. We also evaluated the outcome of stereo-electroencephalography and surgical treatment according to the extent of the spiking volume (focal, lateralized but non-focal or non-lateralized). For all patients, we found a spatial overlap between the seizure-onset zone and the spiking volume. For patients with a focal spiking volume, the seizure-onset zone defined by stereo-electroencephalography was clearly localized in all cases and most patients (6 / 7, 86 %) had a good surgical outcome. Conversely, stereo-electroencephalography failed to delineate a seizure-onset zone in 57 % of patients with a lateralized spiking volume, and in the two patients with bilateral spiking volume. Four of the 12 patients with non-focal spiking volumes were operated upon, none became seizure-free. As a whole, patients having focal magnetoencephalography results with <b>volumetric</b> <b>imaging</b> of epileptic spikes are good surgical candidates and the implantation strategy should incorporate <b>volumetric</b> <b>imaging</b> of epileptic spikes results. On the contrary, patients with non-focal magnetoencephalography results are less likely to have a localized seizure-onset zone and stereo electroencephalography is not advised unless clear localizing information is provided by other presurgical investigation methods...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{feasibility}} {{and image}} quality (IQ) {{of a new}} post-processing algorithm for retrospective extraction of an optimised multi-phase CT (time-resolved CT) of the liver from <b>volumetric</b> perfusion <b>imaging.</b> METHODS: Sixteen patients underwent clinically indicated perfusion CT using 4 D spiral mode of dual-source 128 -slice CT. Three image sets were reconstructed: motion-corrected and noise-reduced (MCNR) images derived from 4 D raw data; maximum and average intensity projections (time MIP/AVG) of the arterial/portal/portal-venous phases and all phases (total MIP/ AVG) derived from retrospective fusion of dedicated MCNR split series. Two readers assessed the IQ, detection rate and evaluation time; one reader assessed image noise and lesion-to-liver contrast. RESULTS: Time-resolved CT was feasible in all patients. Each post-processing step yielded a significant reduction of image noise and evaluation time, maintaining lesion-to-liver contrast. Time MIPs/AVGs showed the highest overall IQ without relevant motion artefacts and best depiction of arterial and portal/portal-venous phases respectively. Time MIPs demonstrated a significantly higher detection rate for arterialised liver lesions than total MIPs/AVGs and the raw data series. CONCLUSION: Time-resolved CT allows data from <b>volumetric</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> to be condensed into an optimised multi-phase liver CT, yielding a superior IQ and higher detection rate for arterialised liver lesions than the raw data series. KEY POINTS: - Four-dimensional computed tomography is limited by motion artefacts and poor image quality. - Time-resolved-CT facilitates 4 D-CT data visualisation, segmentation and analysis by condensing raw data. - Time-resolved CT demonstrates better image quality than raw data images. - Time-resolved CT improves detection of arterialised liver lesions in cirrhotic patients...|$|R
