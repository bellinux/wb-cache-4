40|$|IntroductionMeasurement of tumor {{response}} by standard response criteria is challenging in thymic malignancies, {{especially when the}} pleura is involved, as it often is in stage IV disease. In this study, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of volumetric response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (<b>volumetrics)</b> for evaluating response in patients with thymic malignancies treated on a phase II study of belinostat. MethodsWe evaluated the {{tumor response}}s of 25 patients with thymic cancer using computed tomography-based RECIST, World Health Organization (WHO), modified RECIST, and <b>volumetrics.</b> As a control, we assessed 37 patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) with RECIST and <b>volumetrics.</b> ResultsAgreement analyses in 23 patients with thymic cancer at the time of RECIST-determined progressive disease (PD) compared <b>volumetrics</b> with RECIST, modified RECIST, and WHO criteria. Use of <b>volumetrics</b> was associated with 22 % discordance compared with RECIST, 15 % versus modified RECIST, and 22 % versus WHO criteria. <b>Volumetrics</b> revealed PD 72 days earlier than RECIST (p = 0. 016). In another cohort of 35 patients with NSCLC, there was 9 % discordance between <b>volumetrics</b> and RECIST at the time of PD. <b>Volumetrics</b> demonstrated PD 32 days earlier than RECIST in NSCLC (p = 0. 0078).

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{preparation}} of culture media for IVF-ET and GIFT was developed which eliminated {{the requirement for}} <b>volumetrics</b> and glassware. Water weight was used instead of <b>volumetrics</b> for preparation of media. Media prepared by the volumetric and water weight methods were compared for (i) preparation time, (ii) pH, (iii) osmolarity and (iv) the percentage of two-cell murine embryos developing to blastocysts. The time required for preparation of media was significantly less for the water weight method. Following equilibration with 5 % CO 2, no differences were observed between the two methods for pH, osmolarity or development of embryos to the blastocyst stage. Time for media preparation and osmolarity was less variable among preparation days for the water weight method. These results suggest that media can be prepared more efficiently and precisely with the water weight method than with the standard volumetric method used by most IVF laboratories. The former method eliminates considerable technician time which must be devoted to proper cleaning/sterilization of <b>volumetrics</b> {{and the possibility of}} media contamination by residual substances remaining on <b>volumetrics</b> following improper cleaning...|$|E

Since then IDOT {{has been studying}} {{the ability of the}} compactor to analyze fundamental properties of aggregates such as shape, texture, and gradation by studying the <b>volumetrics</b> of the aggregate blends under a standard load using the SHRP gyratory compactor. This method of analyzing the <b>volumetrics</b> of aggregate blends is similar to SHRP's fine aggregate angularity procedure, which analyzes void levels in noncompacted aggregate blends, which in turn can be used to evaluate the texture or shape of aggregates, what SHRP refers to as angularity. Research is showing that by splitting the aggregate blend on the 2. 36 -mm (# 8) sieve and analyzing the <b>volumetrics</b> or angularity of the separated blend, important fundamental properties can be determined. Most important is structure (the degree and location of aggregate interlock). In addition, analysis of the volumes of the coarse and fine portions can predict the voids in the mineral aggregate and the desired asphalt content.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityExisting asphalt mixture design {{approaches}} are mainly empirical based "trial-and-error" methods. Based purely on <b>volumetrics,</b> such design methods have little {{consideration of the}} mechanical performance of the mixtures. With the trend of moving the pavement research into more mechanistic based methods and targeting the ultimate goal to good field performance, {{it is necessary to}} develop a sophisticated mix design and characterization methodology which can help the designer understand the expected engineering performance of the mix at the early stages, at the same time, to have a more efficient tool to evaluate the quality of the mixtures. This research develops a comprehensive aggregate gradation and asphalt mixture design method that estimates the mechanical properties of the mix at early stage. In this method, strong correlations between aggregate properties, <b>volumetrics,</b> and mechanical properties are identified, making the VMA (Voids in Mineral Aggregate) an excellent media to link the properties of aggregates and asphalt binder to their engineering performance. The concept of the design procedure, especially the aggregate gradation design procedure, is largely based on an analysis of aggregate packing and interlocking. As a fast and convenient design method that emphasizes more on the mechanical performance of the mix, the new design method can be used to evaluate the quality of an existing gradation and mix design, and adjust the gradation of a new mix to satisfy both <b>volumetrics</b> and mechanical properties. In addition, the characteristics of asphalt mixture are studied using micromechanical based discrete element method (DEM) and macromechanical modeling. In DEM simulation, an image based ball clumping technique is used for simulating the angularity properties of aggregate particles. The DEM model is established and calibrated to describe the viscoelastic (dynamic modulus and phase angle) and viscoelastic plastic (strength) properties of asphalt mixtures with or without damage involved. As for macromechanical modeling, a constitutive model for characterizing the permanent deformation of asphalt mixture is explored by taking consideration of the directional distribution of aggregates (anisotropy), and the damage induced by plasticity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} abnormal functional connectivity patterns in the brains of people with autism that may be accompanied by decreases in white matter integrity. Since autism is a developmental disorder, we aim to investigate the nature and location of decreases in white and grey matter integrity in an adolescent sample while accounting for age. METHODS: We used structural (T 1) imaging to study brain <b>volumetrics</b> and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate white and grey matter integrity in people with autism. We obtained magnetic resonance images for adolescents aged 12 - 18 years with high-functioning autism and from matched controls. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, as well as grey and white matter <b>volumetrics</b> were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 17 participants with autism and 25 matched controls included in this study. Participants with autism had lower fractional anisotropy in {{the left and right}} superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, but this effect was not significant after adjusting for age and intelligence quotient (IQ). The kurtosis of the white matter fractional anisotropy probability distribution was higher in this participant group, with and without adjustment for age and IQ. Most notably, however, the mean diffusivity levels were markedly increased in the autism group throughout the brain, and the mean diffusivity probability distributions of both grey and white matter were shifted toward a higher value, particularly with age and IQ adjustment. No volumetric differences in grey and white matter were found. Limitations: We corrected for age and IQ using a linear model. The study was also limited by its sample size, investigated age range and cross-sectional design. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that autism is characterized by a generalized reduction of white matter integrity that is associated with an increase of interstitial space. The generalized manifestation of the white matter abnormalities provides an important new perspective on autism as a connectivity disorder...|$|E
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of asphalt mixture design it was desired to understand the interaction of aggregates, asphalt, and the voids created during their compaction. In asphalt mixture design, guidance is lacking {{in the selection of}} the design aggregate structure and understanding the interaction of that aggregate structure and mixture volumetric properties. This paper presents mixture design concepts that utilize aggregate interlock and aggregate packing to develop an aggregate blend that meets volumetric criteria and provides adequate compaction characteristics. The presented concepts rely on coarse aggregate for the skeleton of the mixture with the proper amount of fine aggregate to provide a properly packed aggregate structure. The objective is to utilize aggregate packing concepts to analyze the combined gradation and relate the packing characteristics to the mixture volumetric properties and compaction characteristics. The presented concepts include an examination of aggregate packing and aggregate interlock, blending aggregates by volume, a new understanding of coarse and fine aggregate, and an analysis of the resulting gradation. This study presents comprehensive mix analysis concepts for developing and analyzing hot mix asphalt gradations. It is presented through a rational approach to the selection of relative amounts of coarse and fine aggregate. Evaluation of gradation with aggregate ratios provides a new tool for examining aggregate gradations. These ratios, based on particle packing, provide distinct relationships with the resulting mixture <b>volumetrics</b> and compaction characteristics.
