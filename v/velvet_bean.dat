There are three types of koro that widely planted in Indonesia such as <b>velvet</b> <b>beans,</b> jack beans, and lima beans. Koro are high in protein and carbohydrate, but it has low fat content. Based on this condition, koro was a good raw material to be process become very useful product. Nowadays, koro only become a simple product because limited process applied, so we cannot get the maximum utilization of the raw material itself. This study aims to determine the protein contents, the most effective protein isolation method for each koro, and analysis of protein profiles in protein isolates. Koro that used in this research was <b>velvet</b> <b>beans,</b> jack beans, and lima beans. The isolates will be analyzed on protein content and protein profiles using electrophoresis. Based on preliminary test results, obtained drying protein isolate by freeze drying method showed optimal results of yield, isolate of <b>velvet</b> <b>beans,</b> isolate of jack beans, and isolate of lima beans respectively 79, 326 %, 17, 962 %, and 13, 58 %.

50|$|In {{developing}} countries, providing {{access to}} markets has encouraged farmers to invest in livestock, with the result being improved livelihoods. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has worked in Zimbabwe to help farmers make their most of their livestock herds. ICRISAT works to improve local farming systems through 'innovation platforms' at which farmers, traders, rural development agencies, and extension officers can discuss the challenges they faced. One finding was that if farmers devoted half of three hectares to maize and half to mucuna (<b>velvet</b> <b>bean)</b> in a rotation system, they could obtain 80% of the biomass needed to see their livestock through the dry season. If they only grew maize, they could only meet 20% of their biomass needs. In the town of Gwanda, the platform helped create a strong local market for goats, raising {{the value of a}} single animal from US$10 to $60. This gave the farmers a great incentive to invest in their own goats by growing their own feed stock, buying commercial feed only as a supplement, and improving their rangeland management techniques. Because the platform has helped regulate prices, farmers now plan ahead and sell animals at auction, rather than just selling one or two animals at their farm gate as opportunities arise.|$|E
40|$|<b>Velvet</b> <b>bean</b> (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC cv. group utilis) {{is widely}} {{promoted}} as a GMCC for tropical regions. Reports of insufficient biomass production in certain environments and concerns over seed production, however, suggest {{a need for}} a more complete description of growth and development of <b>velvet</b> <b>bean</b> under different production scenarios and environments. Process-based simulation models offer the potential for facilitating an assessment of management strategies for different environments, soils and production systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} review the physiology of <b>velvet</b> <b>bean</b> and using the generic legume model CROPGRO, to provide a structured and quantitative framework for describing crop response to management and environment. Model coefficients used to describe growth and development of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) served as initial reference values. Information on <b>velvet</b> <b>bean</b> from published sources was then used to revise the functions and parameters of the model. Phenology, canopy development, growth and partitioning were calibrated for two <b>velvet</b> <b>bean</b> varieties using experimental data from three sites in Mexico. Compared to soybean, <b>velvet</b> <b>bean</b> has a much longer growth cycle, allowing a very large numbers of nodes to form. <b>Velvet</b> <b>bean</b> has larger, thinner leaves than soybean, resulting in more rapid leaf area development, and larger seeds, which affects germination, early season growth and pod development. A modification to CROPGRO to track senesced tissues was incorporated. Overall, the physiological processes underlying growth and development of <b>velvet</b> <b>bean</b> appear to be similar to other tropically adapted legumes. The new model, incorporated as part of the DSSAT, version 3. 5 suite of crop simulation models, has potential for evaluating management strategies in specific environments and to identify potential regions for introduction of <b>velvet</b> <b>bean</b> as a green manure cover crop...|$|E

Another plant containing substantial amounts of L-DOPA is Vicia faba, the plant that produces fava beans (also known as [...] "broad beans").
