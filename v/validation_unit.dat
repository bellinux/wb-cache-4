This paper is focused on the security and privacy challenges of cloud computing with specific reference to user authentication and access management for cloud SaaS applications. The suggested model uses a framework that harnesses the stateless and secure nature of JWT for client authentication and session management. Furthermore, authorized access to protected cloud SaaS resources have been efficiently managed. Accordingly, a Policy Match Gate (PMG) component and a Policy Activity Monitor (PAM) component have been introduced. In addition, other subcomponents such as a Policy <b>Validation</b> <b>Unit</b> (PVU) and a Policy Proxy DB (PPDB) have also been established for optimized service delivery.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{motivation}} for the usage of modeling frameworks for environmental simulation software is to manage and simplify the interoperability of (loosely) coupled simulation components. Conventional approaches in collaboration are using an Application Programming Interface (API). Recent developments in simulation frameworks focus on introspecting architectures for simulation components, where components become passively explored and integrated in to the framework. Such solutions {{seem to be more}} flexible to support the framework evolution because components are less tight to a specific framework API. The Object Modeling System (OMS) is an introspecting simulation framework, which uses metadata in annotated components such as (i) spatial and temporal constraint specification, (ii) data annotation for variables and parameters to specify simulation related data like runtime constraints for range <b>validation,</b> <b>unit</b> conversion, or automated testing. The OMS utilizes metadata annotation (i) at model construction time to support proper spatial and temporal model assembly (ii) and at model runtime to support proper data linkage. This paper will emphasize on metadata access to support model linkage to simplify the development of simulation components for environmental scientists and will give application examples based on the Object Modeling Syste...|$|E

40|$|The {{calibration}} of a multiphase flowmeter {{is usually}} {{highly dependent on}} the flow regime of the mixture being monitored. Since the flow regime present in a pipeline cannot always reliably be predicted, then online calibration of such instruments is usually required. As the range and capabilities of multiphase flowmeters increase, the problems of how to validate the performance of such instruments online also increases. This study considers {{the extent to which}} simple capacitance-sensing techniques can be used to validate the multiphase flowmeters’ performance by identifying the carrier, dispersed phase(s), and flow regime in the flow stream. Finite-element analysis, using the ANSYS software, was used to predict the ability of a simple capacitance sensor to identify carrier and phase composition in a range of oil, water, and gas mixtures. The sensor parameters investigated included electrode length, electrode separation, pipe material, and the effect of guards. The results obtained were used to optimize the sensor geometry for reliable identification of carrier and phase(s). The results obtained from the simulation were experimentally verified. It was shown that a capacitance measurement technique combined with statistical and fuzzy-logic-type methods can form the basis of a simple and robust <b>validation</b> <b>unit</b> that could be retrofitted to multiphase flowmeters for online validation. Such a system could be used as an early warning system for instrument malfunctions...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} risk model incorporating diagnostic information to adjust for case-mix severity during routine monitoring of outcomes for pediatric cardiac surgery. MethodsData from the Central Cardiac Audit Database for all pediatric cardiac surgery procedures performed in the United Kingdom between 2000 and 2010 were included: 70 % for model development and 30 % for <b>validation.</b> <b>Units</b> of analysis were 30 -day episodes after the first surgical procedure. We used logistic regression for 30 -day mortality. Risk factors considered included procedural information based on Central Cardiac Audit Database “specific procedures,” diagnostic information defined by 24 “primary” cardiac diagnoses and “univentricular” status, and other patient characteristics. ResultsOf the 27, 140 30 -day episodes in the development set, 25, 613 were survivals, 834 were deaths, and 693 were of unknown status (mortality, 3. 2 %). The risk model includes procedure, cardiac diagnosis, univentricular status, age band (neonate, infant, child), continuous age, continuous weight, presence of non–Down syndrome comorbidity, bypass, and year of operation 2007 or later (because of decreasing mortality). A risk score was calculated for 95 % of cases in the validation set (weight missing in 5 %). The model discriminated well; the C-index for validation set was 0. 77 (0. 81 for post- 2007 data). Removal of all but procedural information gave a reduced C-index of 0. 72. The model performed well across the spectrum of predicted risk, but there was evidence of underestimation of mortality risk in neonates undergoing operation from 2007. ConclusionsThe risk model performs well. Diagnostic information added useful discriminatory power.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{specification}} of outcomes {{for a higher}} education course unit is perceived as bringing many benefits to both students and educators.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{advantages}} of multi directional load carrying capabilities, the complicated interlacing pattern of the yarns in a textile composite produce large stress – strain gradients. The stress-strain behavior in a textile composite is influenced by: a) stacking sequence; b) number of plies in the laminate; c) distance of the ply to the surface [1]. From the numerical perspective, {{the investigation of the}} free edge and free surface effects in a textile composite unit cell [2] reveals that the local stress behavior changes considerably depending upon the finite/ infinite conditions used for the unit cell FE analysis. In the above context, to capture the variation in local parameters such as strain and damage profiles at different locations (inside/surface) of the satin weave composite under the tensile load, experimental techniques such as strain mapping, Fibre Brag Grating sensors (FBG’s) and the microscopic analysis is used. For the numerical <b>validation,</b> different <b>unit</b> cell stacking models with appropriate boundary conditions are used for the FE analysis.

During the authorization process, the respective worker thread performs a binary search to obtain the authentication data from the shared memory instead of the system database to hasten the authorization process of credit card transactions.

Developers rely on many forms of software <b>validation,</b> from <b>unit</b> tests to assertions and formal specifications, dynamic contract checking to static formal verification, to ensure the reliability of software packages. Traditionally, however, the benefits seem to stop there, at checking whether there are problems. But once problems have been detected, those spent validation efforts play {{no role in the}} challenging task of debugging those problems, a task which requires manual, time-consuming, and error-prone developer efforts. The key insight of this dissertation is that we can leverage the efforts that developers currently put into the validation of software, such as unit tests and formal verification, to get software engineering benefits that can go beyond validation, including automated software repair. Validation mechanisms can be elevated to this status using modern constraint solving, a technology that is already in use for the purpose of formal verification of software. I present three novel and practical instances of this idea, that I was able to identify by focusing on particular domains and scenarios. The first work, used in development, builds on unit testing as {{the most common form of}} validation, and exploits a constraint solving method to automatically fix a certain class of bugs in the source code (offline repair). The second builds on dynamic, specification-based validation as in assertions and contracts used during development and testing, and applies it to deployed software to make it robust to unforeseen run-time failures by falling back to constraint solving (online repair). Finally, I use specifications and constraint solving to improve an existing validation methodology in test-driven development, used to enable testing when part of the depended upon software is unavailable or hard to set up...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{languages}} are often source-to-source compiled to mainstream ones, which offer standardized, fine-tuned im-plementations of non-functional concerns (NFCs) —including persistence, security, transactions, and testing. Because these NFCs are specified through metadata such as XML config-uration files, compiling an emerging language to a main-stream {{one does not}} include NFC implementations. Unable to access the mainstream language’s NFC implementations, emerging language programmers waste development effort reimplementing NFCs. In this paper, we present a novel ap-proach to reusing NFC implementations across languages by automatically translating metadata.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{analysis}} of a hypothetical Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) at the Swedish Ringhals- 3 Pressurized Water Reactor. Ringhals- 3 is of a three-loop Westinghouse design with an original design power of 2783 MWth. A power uprate to 3142 MWth is planned for this reactor, {{and the consequences of}} this uprate on different MSLB scenarios are investigated in this paper. The codes used in the analysis are PARCS and RELAP 5. The PARCS model accounts for the full heterogeneity of the core, with explicit modelling of the top, bottom, and radial reflectors. The RELAP 5 model accounts for each individual fuel assembly in the core, which means that there is a radial one-to-one correspondence between the thermal-hydraulic and neutronic models. Both the stand-alone PARCS model and the stand-alone RELAP 5 model were earlier validated against steady-state measurements at the Ringhals- 3 <b>unit.</b> <b>Validations</b> for the coupled model using measured transients that occurred at Ringhals- 3 were also successfully carried out in the past.

Simulations performed at Hot Zero Power conditions demonstrate the time between the reactor scram and the break has a strong influence on the behaviour of the system (effect due to the delayed neutrons).

40|$|The {{management}} of combustion dynamics in gas turbine combustors {{has become more}} challenging as strict NOx/CO emission standards have led to engine operation in a narrow, lean regime. While premixed or partially premixed combustor configurations such as the Lean Premixed Pre-vaporized (LPP), Rich Quench Lean burn (RQL), and Lean Direct Injection (LDI) have shown a potential for reduced NOx emissions, they promote a coupling between acoustics, hydrodynamics and combustion {{that can lead to}} combustion instabilities.

A prototypical lean-direct-inject combustor was designed in a modular configuration so that a suitable geometry could be found by test. The combustor comprised a variable length air plenum and combustion chamber, air swirler, and fuel nozzle located inside a subsonic venturi. The venturi cross section and the fuel nozzle were consistent with previous studies. ^ Test pressure was 1 MPa and variables included geometry and acoustic resonance, inlet temperatures, equivalence ratio, and type of liquid fuel. High-frequency pressure measurements in a well-instrumented metal chamber yielded frequencies and mode shapes as a function of inlet air temperature, equivalence ratio, fuel nozzle placement, and combustor acoustic resonances. The parametric survey was a significant effort, with over 105 tests on eight geometric configurations. A good dataset was obtained {{that could be used for}} both operating-point-dependent quantitative comparisons, and testing the ability of the simulation to predict more global trends. ^ Results showed a very strong dependence of instability amplitude on the geometric configuration of the combustor, i. e., its acoustic resonance characteristics, with measured pressure fluctuation amplitudes ranged from 5 kPa (0. 5 % of mean pressure) to 200 kPa (~ 20 % of mean pressure) depending on combustor geometry. The stability behavior also showed a consistent and pronounced dependence on equivalence ratio and inlet air temperature. Instability amplitude increased with higher equivalence ratio and with lower inlet air temperature. A pronounced effect of fuel nozzle location on the combustion dynamics was also observed. Combustion instabilities with the fuel nozzle at the throat of the venturi throat were stronger than in the configuration with fuel nozzle 2. 6 mm upstream of the nozzle. ^ A second set of dynamics data was based on high-response-rate laser-based combustion diagnostics using an optically accessible combustor section. High-frequency measurements of OH*-chemiluminescence and OH-PLIF and velocity fields using PIV were obtained at a relatively stable, low equivalence ratio case and a less stable case at higher equivalence ratio. PIV measurements were performed at 5 kHz for non-reacting flow but glare from the cylindrical quartz chamber limited the field of view to a small region in the combustor. ^ Quantitative and qualitative comparisons were made for five different combinations of geometry and operating condition that yielded discriminating stability behavior in the experiment with simulations that were carried out concurrently. Comparisons were made on the basis of trends and pressure mode data as well as with OH-PLIF measurements for the baseline geometry at equivalence ratios of 0. 44 and 0. 6. Overall, the ability of the simulation to match experimental data and trends was encouraging. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) analysis was performed on two sets of computations - a global 2 -step chemistry mechanism and an 18 -step chemistry mechanism - and the OH-PLIF images to allow comparison of dynamic patterns of heat release and OH distribution in the combustion zone. The DMD analysis was able to identify similar dominant unstable modes in the combustor. ^ Recommendations for future work are based on the continued requirement for quantitative and spatio-temporally resolved data for direct comparison with computational efforts to develop predictive capabilities for combustion instabilities at relevant operating conditions. Discriminating instability behavior for the prototypical combustor demonstrated in this study is critical for any robust <b>validation</b> effort <b>Unit</b> physics based scaling of the current effort to multi-element combustors along with improvement in diagnostic techniques and analysis efforts are recommended for advancement in understanding of the complex physics in the multi-phase, three dimensional and turbulent combustion processes in the LDI combustor. ...|$|R
