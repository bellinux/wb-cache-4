40|$|<b>Vanishing</b> {{points are}} {{valuable}} in many vision {{tasks such as}} orientation estimation, pose recovery and 3 D reconstruc-tion from a single image. Many methods have been pro-posed to address the problem, however, a consistent framework to quantitatively analyze the stability and ac-curacy of <b>vanishing</b> point estimation is still absent. This paper proposes a new concept, <b>vanishing</b> hull, which solves the problem. Given an edge error model, the range of a true edge can be modeled using a fan region. The intersection of all these fan regions is a convex hull, which is called <b>vanishing</b> hull. A <b>vanishing</b> hull gives the region of a true <b>vanishing</b> point, and its distribution determines the probability of the <b>vanishing</b> point. The expectation of the <b>vanishing</b> hull is the optimal solution of the <b>vanishing</b> point, its variance defines {{the accuracy of the}} estimation, and its shape determines the stability of the <b>vanishing</b> point. Hence, we can quantita-tively analyze the stability and accuracy of the <b>vanishing</b> point estimation using <b>vanishing</b> hull. Simulation results show that our method is significantly better than one state-of-the-art technique, and real data results are also promising. 1...|$|R

We prove {{a formal}} {{criterion}} for generic <b>vanishing,</b> {{in the sense}} originated by Green and Lazarsfeld and pursued further by Hacon, but {{in the context of}} an arbitrary Fourier-Mukai correspondence. For smooth projective varieties we apply this to deduce a Kodaira-type generic <b>vanishing</b> theorem for adjoint bundles associated to nef line bundles, and in fact a more general generic Nadel-type <b>vanishing</b> theorem for multiplier ideal sheaves. Still in the context of the Picard variety, the same method gives various other generic <b>vanishing</b> results, by reduction to standard <b>vanishing</b> theorems. We further use our criterion in order to address some examples related to generic <b>vanishing</b> on higher rank moduli spaces...|$|R
