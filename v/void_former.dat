The analysis of strain-stress state of new type of architectural and construction system ‘Monofant’ under the effect of high temperature heating in standard fire mode, considering the change of design pattern was carried out. Numerical study of concrete slab with given reinforcement and complex inner geometry was carried out with use of software packages based on finite element method. Temperature fields throughout the depth of {{cross section of the}} slab of new type of architectural and construction system ‘Monofant’ upon heating in standard fire mode for time interval 0 - 240 min. were obtained.

30|$|The {{studies of}} voided slab {{systems that have}} been carried out have focused on the {{development}} of anchoring methods and devices, shape of <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> for optimal <b>void</b> ratio, structural performance, such as shear and flexural capacity, and shear reinforcement. Considering the aspect of structural performance, voided slab systems are vulnerable to shear capacity, when compared to solid slabs (Aldejohann and Schnellenbach-Held 2002; Hegger et al. 2009; Jung et al. 2016; Miwa et al. 1995; Chung et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2011). Schnellenbach-Held and Pfeffer (2002) found that while the so-called control perimeter is treated as a shear resistance section in flat slab designs, the shear area within the bubble-containing voided slab could be reduced. Chung et al. (2009) indicated that the shapes of the <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> might be crucial factors that determine the capacities of the shear forces in voided slab systems. They maintained that donut-shaped <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> could resist approximately 20 % more shear strength over other shapes of <b>void</b> <b>formers.</b> Lee et al. (2011) performed experimental studies to evaluate the punching shear of two-way voided slab-to-column connections with TVS lightweight balls. Along with the shear resistance performance of the voided slab system, various studies have also attempted to evaluate the flexural performance of the voided slab. Many studies have confirmed that the flexural capacities of the voided slab are similar in performance to the solid slab system for equal depth (Chung et al. 2010; Jung et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2014). Chung et al. (2013) demonstrated that two-way slab systems with donut type <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> showed similar flexural capacities, when compared with the conventional reinforced concrete slabs.|$|R

40|$|Large span {{concrete}} flat-slab {{systems with}} internal spherical <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> (SVF) {{have been used}} in Europe for over a decade. They are bi-axially reinforced concrete flat-slab systems with a grid of internal spherical <b>void</b> <b>formers.</b> This paper addresses three issues associated with SVF slab systems: their shear resistance, their short-term elastic deflections and their economical value in a South African context. Due to the "loss" (or reduction) of aggregate interlock required for shear resistance in SVF slabs, the design requirements of the reinforced concrete design code are affected. Research at the Technical University of Darmstadt (TUD) in Germany proved a shear resistance reduction factor of 0, 55 to be conservative, while research at the University of Pretoria suggests a greater factor of 0, 85 when taking into account the shear capacity of the permanent steel cages that hold the spheres in position in some SVF slab systems. Laboratory tests at the TUD, supported by theoretical calculations, further showed reduced deflections for SVF slabs compared to solid slabs. Stiffness is not reduced as much as the selfweight, resulting in smaller overall deflections for SVF slabs compared to those of solid slabs with the same thickness. In this paper the economical value of SVF slabs in South Africa will be investigated by comparing the direct construction cost to that of two other large span slab systems, namely coffer and post-tensioned slabs...|$|R
50|$|The overall {{floor area}} {{can be divided}} down {{into a series of}} planned {{individual}} elements, up to 3 m wide dependent upon site access, which are manufactured off-site using MMC techniques. These elements comprise the top and bottom reinforcement mesh, sized to suit the specific project, joined together with vertical lattice girders with the <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> trapped between the top and bottom mesh reinforcement to fix their optimum position. This is termed a ‘bubble-reinforcement’ sandwich, which is then cast into bottom layer of 60 mm pre-cast concrete, encasing the bottom mesh reinforcement, to provide permanent formwork within part of the overall finished slab depth.|$|R
40|$|Long span {{flat slab}} systems with {{internal}} spherical <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> {{have been used}} in Europe for a decade now. Cobiax® is the brand name of a successful system, recently introduced in South Africa. It is a bi-axial reinforced concrete flat slab system, with a grid of internal spherical <b>void</b> <b>formers.</b> The main advantage is the possibility of long spans due to the significant reduction in own weight, as well as the fast construction sequence with the use of flat slab formwork systems. Design requirements of SANS 10100 : 2000 are affected. Vertical shear capacity is a concern due to loss of aggregate interlock. Research in Germany proved a factor of 0. 55 to be a conservative shear resistance reduction factor for Cobiax slabs. Theoretical and preliminary laboratory South African research suggests that a greater factor of 0. 85 might be used when considering the shear capacity of the steel cages. These cages’ vertical legs also cross the cold joint caused by the two concrete pours required for Cobiax slabs, and proved to provide sufficient horisontal shear resistance if the correct cage diameters are used. Laboratory tests in Germany supported by theoretical calculations further showed reduced deflections for Cobiax slabs. Although stiffness and own weight are reduced due to the voids, Cobiax slabs had smaller absolute deflections than solid slabs with the same thickness. Cobiax research factors are safe to apply to SANS 10100 - 01 : 2000. The economy of Cobiax slabs was tested against that of coffer and post-tensioned slabs. Different span lengths and loads were considered. Based on 2007 material costs in South Africa, Cobiax slabs subject to the same loads and span lengths will be slightly more expensive than that of coffer slabs and post-tensioned slabs when considering only direct slab construction costs. Cobiax will be most appropriate where a flat soffit is required for high multi-storey buildings, requiring large spans with a light load application.

30|$|Floor impact noises are {{considered}} as structure-borne sounds that {{are caused by}} either impacting on or vibrating directly on the structure, and then travelling through the entire building (Uno 1992). In general, one of the effective methods to lower the floor impact sounds is to separate or isolate the noise from its source. There {{are a number of}} approaches to lower the influence of floor impact noise, such as increasing the thickness of concrete slab, inserting sound absorptive materials, and creating space to isolate the sound sources. A number of studies point out {{that one of the most}} effective methods to separate the floor impact sounds in concrete structures is through the use of floating floors (Schiavi 2018; Miškinis et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2015; Faustino et al. 2012; D’alessandro et al. 2014; Sipari 2002). A floating floor is a combination of concrete slab and resilient, as well as sound absorbing, material, such as rubber (D’alessandro et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2006; Schiavi 2018). Neves e Sopusa and Gibbs (2011) compared both homogeneous concrete floors and floating floors in dwellings. In their study, the floating floor would be beneficial to insulate low frequency impact sound transmission. Schiavi (2018) tested various resilient materials, such as glass fibre, polyester fibre, cork, and rubber grains, to form floating structures in the concrete slab. Cho (2013) indicated that the concrete slab with resilient layers would be useful to insulate floor impact sound, compared to the normal concrete slab. In this study, the voided slab system, which is filled with lightweight expanded polystyrene (EPS), is suggested as one of the floating floor systems to isolate and separate the floor impact sounds in a commercial–residential complex building. The EPS <b>void</b> <b>formers</b> were designed as a means of isolating floor impact sound in the concrete structure. In order to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the voided slab systems for lightweight and heavyweight floor impact sound insulation, a field test was conducted to evaluate the sound insulation performance in the studied building.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} new statistical methods {{for the study}} of cosmic voids, focusing on the statistics of largest size voids. We distinguish three different types of distributions of voids, namely, Poisson-like, lognormal-like and Pareto-like distributions. The last two distributions are connected with two types of fractal geometry of the matter distribution. Scaling voids with Pareto distribution appear in fractal distributions with box-counting dimension smaller than three (its maximum value), whereas the lognormal void distribution corresponds to multifractals with box-counting dimension equal to three. Moreover, <b>voids</b> of the <b>former</b> type persist in the continuum limit, namely, as the number density of observable objects grows, giving rise to lacunar fractals, whereas voids of the latter type disappear in the continuum limit, giving rise to non-lacunar (multi) fractals. We propose both lacunar and non-lacunar multifractal models of the cosmic web structure of the Universe. A non-lacunar multifractal model is supported by current galaxy surveys as well as cosmological $N$-body simulations. This model suggests, in particular, that small dark matter halos and, arguably, faint galaxies are present in cosmic voids. Comment: 39 pages, 8 EPS figures, supersedes arXiv: 0802. 038...|$|R
40|$|The moment-based {{non-parametric}} {{species richness}} estimator of Chao {{is one of}} the most widely used estimators for the number of unobserved species in a sampling experiment. This is due in large part to its simplicity and robustness. This simplicity can also be a drawback, as it only uses a small amount of information contained in the observed experiment, essentially only the first moment. Previous authors, specifically Harris and Chao, have presented a general moment-based framework for estimating species richness that includes the Chao estimator. The application of this framework has been stymied by both the lack of deep sampling experiments, where higher moments can be accurately estimated, and the lack of efficient algorithms to properly use this information. Technological advances have filled the <b>former</b> <b>void,</b> allowing for sampling experiments orders of magnitude larger than previously considered. We aim to address the latter by connecting results from the theory of moment spaces and Gaussian quadrature to provide a general moment-based non-parametric estimator of species richness that uses more information through more moments and is computationally efficient. We show this estimator performs well and improves upon the Chao estimator on discrete abundance distributions, the simplest cases of heterogeneity. We demonstrate the performance on a simulated populations taken from emerging high-throughput technologies such as RNA-seq, immune repertoire, and metagenomic sequencing.

The one-pot LSH generation yields agglomerates of well intercalated platelets, 9 – 10 nm separated from each other. However the corresponding Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) of formal composition Zn 2 Al(OH) 6 (acetate) ·nH 2 O is found to proceed via the formation of crystallized, similarly spaced LSH sheets {{in the neighborhood of}} amorphous Al rich domains as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron micrographs. The initial phase segregation effaces over time while LSH platelets convert into the LDH phase. Fingerprinted by the change of in-plane cation accommodation, the associated topochemical reaction of the edge-sharing octahedral LSH platelets involves the transformation of metal lacunae, adjacently covered by one tetrahedral coordinated cation on each side to balance the negative surcharge, into fully occupied and monolayered platelets of edge-sharing octahedral LDH, the <b>former</b> <b>voids</b> being occupied by trivalent cations. This replenishing process of empty sites, coupled with the dissolution of tetrahedral sites is likely to be observed for the first time due to the presence of well separated, polymer intercalated platelets. TEM pictures vision crystal growth arising from the zone of the LSH edge-slab and by using solid state kinetics formalism the associated high activation energy of the first-order reaction agrees well with a plausible dissolution re-precipitation mechanism.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{consequences of}} confinement within zeolite voids were examined for several elimination (alkane cracking and dehydrogenation, alkene cracking, alkanol dehydration) and addition (alkene hydrogenation, alkylation and oligomerization) reactions catalyzed by Brønsted solid acids. These reactions are mediated by cationic transition {{states that are}} confined within voids of molecular dimensions (0. 4 - 1. 3 nm) and proceed at rates that reflect the Gibbs free energies of late ion-pairs at transition states relative to those for the relevant reactants. Ion-pair stabilities depend on electrostatic interactions between organic cations and catalyst conjugate anions and on dispersion interactions between these cations and framework oxygen atoms. The former interactions are essentially unaffected by confinement, which influences weakly Brønsted acid strength, while the latter depend strongly on the sizes and shapes of voids and the species confined within them. The catalytic effects of confinement in stabilizing ion-pairs are prevalent when transition states are measured relative to gaseous reactants, but are attenuated {{and in some cases}} become irrelevant when measured with respect to confined reactants that are similar in composition and size. Zeolite voids solvate confined species by van der Waals forces and mediate compromises in their enthalpic and entropic stabilities. Confinement is generally preferred within locations that benefit enthalpic stability over entropic freedom at low temperatures, in which free energies depend more strongly on enthalpic than entropic factors. For example, the carbonylation of dimethyl ether (400 - 500 K) occurs with high specificity within eight-membered (8 -MR) zeolite voids, but at undetectable rates within larger voids. This specificity reflects the more effective van der Waals stabilization of carbonylation transition states within the <b>former</b> <b>voids.</b> In contrast, entropic consequences of confinement become preeminent in high temperature reactions. Alkane activation turnovers (700 - 800 K) are much faster on 8 -MR than 12 -MR protons of mordenite zeolites because the relevant ion-pairs are confined only partially within shallow 8 -MR side pockets and to lesser extents than within 12 -MR channels. The site requirements and confinement effects found initially for elimination reactions were also pertinent for addition reactions mediated by ion-pair transition states of similar size and structure. Ratios of rate constants for elimination and addition steps involved in the same mechanistic sequence (e. g., alkane dehydrogenation and alkene hydrogenation) reflected solely the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the stoichiometric gas-phase reaction. These relations are consistent with the De Donder non-equilibrium thermodynamic treatments of chemical reaction rates, in spite of the different reactant pressures used to measure rates in forward and reverse directions. The De Donder relations remained relevant at these different reaction conditions because the same elementary step limited rates and surfaces remained predominantly unoccupied in both directions. Rate constants for elementary steps catalyzed by zeolitic Brønsted acids reflect the combined effects of acid strength and solvation. Their individual catalytic consequences can be extricated using Born-Haber thermochemical cycles, which dissect activation energies and entropies into terms that depend on specific catalyst and reactant properties. This approach was used to show that thermal, chemical and cation-exchange treatments, which essentially change the sizes of faujasite supercage voids by addition or removal of extraframework aluminum species, influence solvation properties strongly but acid strength only weakly. These findings have clarified controversial interpretations that have persisted for decades regarding the origins of chemical reactivity and acid strength on faujasite zeolites. Born-Haber thermochemical relations, together with Marcus theory treatments of charge transfer reaction coordinates, provide a general framework {{to examine the effects of}} reactant and catalyst structure on ion-pair transition state enthalpy and entropy. The resulting structure-function relations lead to predictive insights that advance our understanding of confinement effects in zeolite acid catalysis beyond the largely phenomenological descriptions of shape selectivity and size exclusion. These findings also open new opportunities for the design and selection of microporous materials with active sites placed within desired void structures for reasons of catalytic rate or selectivity. The ability of zeolite voids to mimic biological catalysts in their selective stabilization of certain transition states by dispersion forces imparts catalytic diversity, all the more remarkable in light of the similar acid strengths among known aluminosilicates. This offers significant promise to expand the ranges of materials used and of reactions they catalyze...|$|R
