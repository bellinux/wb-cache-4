40|$|Choosing {{the right}} time to borrow Cue: For many people, the idea of {{borrowing}} money is worrying. What if I can?t pay it back on time? Will I risk losing my possessions or even my house? It?s right to be cautious about taking a loan, and to look carefully at the conditions for borrowing, such as interest rates, payment schedules and penalties for non payment. But taking a loan can still be a good decision, if you have a good investment plan for the money. We hear next from Wambi Michael in Uganda. He recently met a wine producer, who took a loan, used it to build her business, and has recently been recognised with an award. Here?s his report. IN:	?Lack of access to credit is? OUT:	?You are welcome. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 47 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Thereza Namusisi, founder of the Thereza wine company in Uganda. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Wambi	Lack of access to credit is often a major problem for women in Uganda. Even where it is available many women don?t have information about how to access it. Some women have feared to seek credit from micro-finance institutions for fear of being debtors. I?m here in Njeru to meet Thereza Namusisi, a rural Ugandan woman who has taken credit from micro-finance institutions and has excelled. Thereza how did you learn about micro-finance institutions? Namusisi	Uganda Gatsby Trust is an organisation which started from the university. But later on they saw that only helping the university students is not enough. So they came down to the grassroots to help women who have small projects. And that?s how I came to learn about it. Wambi	Have you ever sought a loan from a commercial bank? Namusisi	No. I feared it just because of the problems I see other people facing. Wambi	And what did you use the credit for? Namusisi	I used it for increasing on my wine productivity. So I increased on the quantity of my wine, and it will make a better quality. Wambi	Why are many women in Uganda not accessing credit from micro-finance institutions, even when they are available in the country? Namusisi	Women are fearing micro-finance from those unfriendly institutions. Just because once you fail or once you get a problem, they come and confiscate your things, they take plots of land, they want to take houses of people. So it scares people, especially women. Wambi	Association of Micro-Finance Institutions and Citibank gave you an award for having got credit, used it well, paid it back. How did you manage to pay back the loan and still improve on your business? Namusisi	When I got the loan I utilised it fully. I got a profit. But don?t look at money as money. Just try to get the little money you get and inject it back in your project, that?s how you can only increase your productivity. That?s how you can sustain your project and enlarge your enterprise. That?s the only thing I did myself. Wambi	What could be done to ensure that women access more friendly credit? Namusisi	If possible they would start with a grant. We can start with something small and grow bigger. By the time you see that you are growing bigger, that?s when a woman should access a loan from the micro-financers, other than starting with a loan from the grassroots. Wambi	Thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time.</b> Namusisi	You are welcome. End track.

40|$|A natural {{birthright}} CUE: For {{thousands of}} years, Lake Malawi {{has been a}} source of fresh water for the villagers who live along its shores. Even now the water of the lake is still used for washing clothes, bathing and cooking. However, Lake Malawi is also becoming increasingly popular with tourists, and as the number of hotels and lodges around the lake increases, so access for the local people becomes more difficult. Patrick Mphaka went to Nkhata Bay to find out how lodge owners and villagers there are dealing with the issue of rights to the lake shore. IN: 		?There are a number of development? OUT:		?You are welcome sir? DUR?N:	 4 ? 50 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dan Chirwa was explaining to Patrick Mphaka how the water of Lake Malawi is a natural birthright for all Malawians. Transcript Mphaka	There are a number of development activities which have taken place along Lake Malawi, lodges, hotels and other activities. Along the lake also there are a number of villages who use the waters of the lake. We are trying to find out what rights these people have and what about the owners, what rights do they enjoy themselves on the beach of the lake? One of such people is Mr Arnold Shaba, he?s the owner of the Ilala Bay Lodge located at Nkhata Bay. Now as I?ve indicated we are trying to find out the activities which you have here and how much access you allow the local people to still have on the waters of Lake Malawi where your lodge is located. Naturally you came to a place where there were people already and these people must have been using the water of the lake. What difference does it make now that you are here? Shaba	The major difference really is that before we came here accessibility was much more than it is at the moment but as soon as we opened our place for business, obviously those people who only came here to do minor things they are no longer coming. But we do have people like fishermen, women drawing water, women who like to wash their clothes, even people like to come and swim, they still do come here to use the facilities. We have no specific restrictions on that. Mphaka	Since you have been here have you had any conflicts as regards the user rights of the waters with the local people? Shaba	So far, no. We have never had any specific conflicts. Obviously some people have complained that maybe they are not as free as in the past but I think now the understanding which I begged from them they seem to have now accepted and I think we are living harmoniously. We also did have discussions with the local chief to explain to him that our intention was to accommodate peoples needs in terms of access to the lake. So the chief understood everything right from the beginning. Mphaka	Do you think this is the type of situation of understanding which everyone else has from the locals as regards the people who are developing the lake shore areas, or do you think other people have got problems of resistance from the local people? Shaba	Well we understand in some lodges accessibility is not as the locals would like but I believe that if the developers can only discuss their projects or their businesses with the locals and come to an understanding, I think the conflicts can be resolved. Mphaka	We have heard there what one of the people who has developed places along the lake shore has to say about restricting the local people on using the water and what he does in order to ensure that the villagers as well, the locals, do have their rights. With me now is one of the locals themselves and his name is Dan Chirwa. Dan Chirwa is from Chikale village. Now can you tell me specifically for what is this water being used by local people here? Chirwa	To a large extent it?s being used for domestic purposes like washing, some other people are bathing there. They also use it for cooking after distillation. Mphaka	Is it true that some people do stop villagers from using the water and to what extent is the problem? Chirwa	The owners of the lodges to a large extent do not restrict people from using the lake. Because this is a public place and they know that people have the right. It is their birth right to use the lake. Mphaka	Are you trying to say that everyone who comes here knows that they can go into the water and no one owns the water, it?s for everybody? Chirwa	I know this is a natural reservoir, it was not constructed by a man and by virtue of being a Malawian you?ve got the right to use a public thing like this one so long as you do not pollute it, and you do not destroy natural resources. Mphaka	Now Dan are you trying to tell me that people in your village can find it very strange if anybody came by and said ?Don?t use this water?? Chirwa	Yes sometimes, we never know, they can even beat him because that can sound very strange. Mphaka	Well thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> to speak to me and enlighten me on the way people use the water here. Chirwa	You are welcome sir. End of tape.

40|$|Business {{skills for}} borrowers Cue: It?s {{one thing to}} have a good idea for a business. It?s another thing to make it a success. You will {{probably}} need some money to get started, but you will also need {{to make a lot of}} decisions. Who are your customers? Where is the best place to locate the business? When is demand highest, and how will you find, and keep, your customers? In The Gambia, the Indigenous Business Advisory Service, IBAS, has been supporting new businesses for over 30 years, giving both training and loans. Teaching business skills is a passion for Manka Sanyang, the IBAS manager, as Ismaila Senghore found out when he visited his office in Bakau. In Africa, where so many of us run small businesses of one sort or another, what are the business skills he likes to build? IN:	?Some people have their own business ? OUT:	? You are welcome. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 05 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ismaila Senghore reporting from The Gambia. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sanyang	Some people have their own business all right, but since the training started, people were voluntarily coming in to be trained. After they go through their training they say ?Hah! There are a lot of things that I thought I knew, but I really didn?t know. I was making a mistake all along. ? Because some people cannot distinguish their personal money from their business money. They?ll be doing their business, a relative will come and say there is a christening, or somebody died. They will just pull open their drawer and take money and give it to them, and you cannot do that. You are killing your business. It is not your money, it is the business?s money. These are the things we try to emphasise. Senghore	Can you please expand on the basic things that you train them on when they come? Sanyang	OK we train them how to locate their business and where to locate their business. How to select their business and where to look for funding. We train them how to handle their customers. Customer relationship is very important. It defines whether you will succeed or you will fail. We also train them how to recover their loans. If you go through our training programme it exposes you to various options and then you will know all the advantages and disadvantages, and where to acquire some of your basic raw materials or things to do with the business. After knowing all that it assists you to narrow down your choices in which area to go into. Senghore	Do you only deal with individuals or do you have groups? Sanyang	Initially we were working with individuals, but as time goes on we started receiving requests from groups, especially female groups which we call kaffos. And then we are also helping a group of school leavers who have gone through NYSS. Senghore	NYSS is the National Youth Service Scheme? Sanyang	Yes. Some of their students who have acquired training either in carpentry or auto-mechanics or things of that sort. We try to establish a garage for them. We try to help them locate an area and then we help them establish a garage and then we buy the basic tools, and then provide them with a small working capital. And our extension staff are usually on the ground to monitor their progress, and they pay the loans as time goes on. Senghore	You have been into this for over 30 years now, and I?m sure along the way you must have had very good examples of, let?s say first of all, a successful case. Sanyang	OK, to give you a typical example of a successful case, is the poultry producers at the central prisons. They made an application. We went there and saw the area and appraised it, and then extended a loan to them. And they were able to purchase their day old chicks over there. The project was targeting the fast month. Senghore	Ramadan, the month of fasting, yes. Sanyang	The month of fasting. This was one of the successful cases which I?m very much proud of. These people acquired those chicks and we bought feed and gave it to them, and they also acquired drugs and treated all their chickens. And sure enough, come around Ramadan they hit the market. All their chickens were sold and they successfully paid their loan. And I encouraged them to expand, which they did. And they took a second loan and also paid it. Right now they are still operating, but they have not come to me for any additional assistance yet. Senghore	Maybe they are independent now? Sanyang	I hope so. This is our objective. Whoever we help, we want to see you stand on your two legs as time goes on. Senghore	Now on a final note, Mr Sanyang, what lessons can one learn from the IBAS experience, if you were to transpose the IBAS experience into other Third World countries. What lessons can be learned from you? Sanyang	It is a very useful lesson. You are moulding minds of the indigenous people who will become business people tomorrow. Who will become tax payers and employers of youth and other income generating for the economy. So it is very effective. Senghore	Thank you very much Mr Manka Sanyang, it has been a pleasure talking to you and thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>time.</b> Sanyang	You are welcome.
