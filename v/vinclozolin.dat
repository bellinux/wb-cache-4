50|$|In June 1998 the EPA {{put a new}} {{safety factor}} on <b>vinclozolin.</b> BASF voluntarily {{cancelled}} <b>vinclozolin</b> use on some fruits and turf.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} reregistration process, the U.S. EPA {{reviewed}} all {{toxicity studies}} on <b>vinclozolin.</b> The main effect induced by <b>vinclozolin</b> is related to its antiandrogenic activity {{and its ability to}} act as a competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor. <b>Vinclozolin</b> can mimic male hormones, like testosterone, and bind to androgen receptors, while not necessarily activating those receptors properly. There is evidence that <b>vinclozolin</b> itself binds weakly to the androgen receptor but that at least two of its metabolites are responsible for much of the antiandrogenic activity. When male rats were given low dose levels (>3 mg/kg/day) of <b>vinclozolin,</b> effects such as decreased prostate weight, weight reduction in sex organs, nipple development, and decreased ano-genital distance were noted. At higher dose levels, male sex organ weight decreased further, and sex organ malformations were seen, such as reduced penis size, the appearance of vaginal pouches and hypospadias. In the rat model, {{it has been shown that}} the antiandorgenic effects of <b>vinclozolin</b> are most prominent during the developmental stages. In utero, this sensitive period of fetal development occurs between gestation days 16-17. [...] Embryonic exposure to <b>vinclozolin</b> can influence sexual differentiation, gonadal formation, and reproductive functions. In bird models, <b>vinclozolin</b> and its metabolites were shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit androgen receptor binding and gene expression. <b>Vinclozolin</b> caused reduced egg laying, reduced fertility rate, and a reduction in successful hatches. Androgens also play a role in puberty, and it has been shown an antiandrogen like <b>vinclozolin</b> can delay pubertal maturation. Antiandrogenic toxins are also known to alter sexual differentiation and reproduction in the rabbit model. Male rabbits exposed to <b>vinclozolin</b> in utero or during infancy did not show a sexual interest in females or did not ejaculate. Since the androgen receptor is widely conserved across species lines, antiandrogenic effects would be expected in humans.In vertebrates, <b>vinclozolin</b> also acts as a neuroendocrine disruptor, affecting behaviors tied to locomotion, cognition, and anxiety.|$|E
50|$|In rats, <b>vinclozolin</b> {{has been}} shown to affect other steroid hormone receptors, such as those of {{progesterone}} and estrogen. Just as with androgens, the timing of the exposure to <b>vinclozolin</b> determines the magnitude of the effects related to these hormones. In a study with rats, in vitro research showed the ability of two <b>vinclozolin</b> metabolites to bind to the progesterone receptor. However, the same study in vivo using adult male rats showed no effects. When mice experienced <b>vinclozolin</b> exposure in utero, male offspring exhibited up-regulated estrogen receptor and up-regulated progesterone receptor. In females, <b>vinclozolin</b> down-regulated expression of estrogen receptors and up-regulated progesterone receptor expression. This result causes virilization and the feminization of males and masculinization of females.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{phase-out}} of <b>vinclozolin,</b> {{farmers are}} faced with fewer options to control gray and white mold. The New York State Agricultural Experiment Station has carried out efficacy trials for gray and white mold. Research has showed potential alternatives to <b>vinclozolin.</b> Trifloxystrobin (Flint), iprodione (Rovral), and cyprodinil plus fludioxonil (Switch) control gray mold. Thiophanate-methyl (Topsin M) was as effective as <b>vinclozolin</b> in controlling white molds. Switch was the most promising alternative to <b>vinclozolin</b> for controlling both gray and white mold on pods and for increasing marketable yield.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vinclozolin</b> is then {{formulated}} into a dry flowable or extruded granular. It can {{be applied}} by through the air (aerial), through irrigation systems (chemigation), or by ground equipment. <b>Vinclozolin</b> is also applied to some plants, such as decorative flowers, as a dip treatment where the plant is dipped into the fungicide solution and then dried. It is also common to spray a <b>vinclozolin</b> solution using thermal foggers in greenhouses.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. EPA has {{classified}} <b>vinclozolin</b> as {{a possible}} human carcinogen. <b>Vinclozolin</b> induces an increase in leydig cell tumors in rats. The 3,5-DCA metabolite is thought to possess a mode of tumor induction based on its similarity to p-choroaniline.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. EPA has {{examined}} dietary (food and water), non-dietary, and occupational exposure to <b>vinclozolin</b> or its metabolites. In general, fungicides {{have been shown}} to circulate through the water and air, and it possible for them to end up on untreated foods after application. Consumers alone cannot easily reduce their exposure because fungicides are not removed from produce that is washed with tap water. A key example of exposure to <b>vinclozolin</b> is through wine grapes which is considered to account for about 2% of total <b>vinclozolin</b> exposure. It has been determined that people may be exposed to residues of <b>vinclozolin</b> and its metabolites containing the 3,5-dichloroaniline moiety (3,5-DCA) through diet, and thus tolerance limits have been established for each crop. Although <b>vinclozolin</b> is not registered for use by homeowners, it is still possible for people to come into contact with the fungicide and its residues. For example, golfers playing on treated golf courses, and families playing on sod which has been previously treated may be at risk for exposure. Occupationally, workers can be exposed to <b>vinclozolin</b> while doing activities such as loading and mixing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vinclozolin</b> (trade names Ronilan, Curalan, Vorlan, Touche) is {{a common}} dicarboximide {{fungicide}} used to control diseases, such as blights, rots and molds in vineyards, and on fruits and vegetables such as raspberries, lettuce, kiwi, snap beans, and onions. It is also used on turf on golf courses. Two common fungi that <b>vinclozolin</b> is used to protect crops against are Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. First registered in 1981, <b>vinclozolin</b> is widely used but its overall application has declined. As a pesticide, <b>vinclozolin</b> is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). In addition to these restrictions within the United States, as of 2006 {{the use of this}} pesticide was banned in several countries, including Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.It has gone through a series of tests and regulations in order to evaluate the risks and hazards to the environment and animals. Among the research, a main finding is that <b>vinclozolin</b> {{has been shown to be}} an endocrine disruptor with antiandrogenic effects.|$|E
5000|$|In rats, <b>vinclozolin</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to have trangenerational effects, meaning {{that not only is}} the initial animal affected, but effects are also seen in subsequent generations. One study demonstrated that <b>vinclozolin</b> impaired male fertility not only in the first generation that was exposed in utero, but in males born for three generations and beyond. Furthermore, when affected males with were mated with normal females, some of the offspring were sterile and some had reduced fertility. After three generations, male offspring continued to show low sperm count, prostate disease and high rates of testicular cell apoptosis., Other studies conducted experiments where rat embryos were exposed to <b>vinclozolin</b> during sex determination. F1 (first generation) <b>vinclozolin</b> treated males were bred with F1 <b>vinclozolin</b> treated females. This pattern continued for three generations. The initial F0 mother was the only subject that was directly exposed to doses of <b>vinclozolin.</b> F1-F4 generation males all showed an increase in the prevalence of tumors, prostate disease, kidney disease, test abnormalities and immune failures when compared to the control group. F1-F4 females also showed an increased incidence of tumors and kidney disease. Furthermore, transgenerationally transmitted changes in mate preference and anxiety behavior have also been observed in rats following exposure to <b>vinclozolin.</b> It has been reported that these transgenerational reports correlate with epigenetic changes, specifically, an alteration in DNA methylation in the male germ line. However, these transgenerational changes have not been successfully reproduced by other laboratories ...|$|E
50|$|On July 18, 2000 the EPA {{established}} that certain meat, bean {{and dairy products}} have a 3-year time-limited tolerances for <b>vinclozolin</b> and its metabolites. This led to a phase-out of most domestic food uses for <b>vinclozolin.</b> In September 2000, the EPA received objections to the issued tolerance for beans.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{studies show}} that {{deformities}} result in offspring exposed to antiandrogens. Male mice can display malformations that resemble the reproductive organs of females {{as in the case}} of exposure to <b>vinclozolin</b> or proymidone. Exposure to <b>vinclozolin</b> or procymidone in utero feminized male offspring, as seen in abnormalities of anogenital distance, small or absent sex accessory glands, hypospadias, undescended testes, retained nipples, cleft phallus, and presence of a vaginal pouch. Male mice exposed before puberty to <b>vinclozolin</b> experienced delayed pubertal development visualized by delayed onset of androgen-dependent preputial separation.|$|E

50|$|Laboratory test {{indicate}} that <b>vinclozolin</b> easily breaks down and dissipates {{in the environment}} {{with the help of}} microbes. Of its several metabolites 3,5-dichloroaniline resists further degradation. In terrestrial field dissipation studies conducted in various states, <b>vinclozolin</b> dissipated with a half-life between 34 and 94 days. Half-lives including residues can reach up to 1,000 days. Residues may accumulate and be available for future crop uptake.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vinclozolin</b> is {{manufactured}} by the chemical company BASF {{and has been}} registered {{for use in the}} United States since 1981. The following is a compilation of data indicating the national use of <b>vinclozolin</b> per crop (lbs AI/yr) in 1987: apricots, 124; cherries, 3,301; green beans, 13,437; lettuce, 24,779; nectarines, 1,449; onions, 829; peaches, 15,203; plums, 163; raspberries, 3,247; and strawberries, 41,006. In 1997, two applications totaling 285 pounds each, were applied to kiwifruit in California to prevent the gray mold and soft rot caused by Botrytis cinerea. In general, the United States has seen an overall decline in the national use of <b>vinclozolin.</b> In 1992, a total of approximately 135,000 pounds were used. However, in 1997 this number dropped to 122,000 and in 2002 it was down to 55,000 pounds.|$|E
50|$|In April 1997, BASF {{proposed}} a new use for <b>vinclozolin</b> and thus all risks were reevaluated under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).|$|E
50|$|Oxazolidines {{where the}} carbon centers at the 1 and 3 {{positions}} are carbonyls are called dioxooxazolidines. Some {{of these are}} commercial fungicides including chlozolinate, <b>vinclozolin,</b> and famoxadone.|$|E

50|$|Fungicide {{residues}} {{have been}} found on food for human consumption, mostly from post-harvest treatments. Some fungicides are dangerous to human health, such as <b>vinclozolin,</b> which has now been removed from use.

5000|$|The {{following}} {{chemical reactions}} {{are used to}} make vinclozolin: [...] One method combines methyl vinyl ketone, sodium cyanide, 3,5-dichloroaniline, and phosgene. This process involves formation of the cyanohydrin, followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile. <b>Vinclozolin</b> is also prepared by the reaction of 3,5-dichlorophenyl isocyanate with an alkyl ester of 2-hydroxy-2-vinylpropionic acid. Ring closure is achieved at elevated temperature.|$|E
50|$|Some other {{examples}} of putative EDCs are polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) and -furans (PCDFs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenol derivatives {{and a number of}} pesticides (most prominent being organochlorine insecticides like endosulfan, kepone (chlordecone) and DDT and its derivatives, the herbicide atrazine, and the fungicide <b>vinclozolin),</b> the contraceptive 17-alpha ethinylestradiol, as well as naturally occurring phytoestrogens such as genistein and mycoestrogens such as zearalenone.|$|E
5000|$|All {{pesticides}} sold or {{distributed in}} the United States must be registered by U.S. EPA.

50|$|Lettuce drop {{is another}} {{resilient}} {{disease of the}} lettuce plant. It {{can be found in}} all lettuce-growing regions of the U.S. and is able to survive in the soil for up to a decade after infecting a field. The fungus appears on the plant as a white mass on the leaf that slowly turns into a hard black growth. These growths release spores that infect the lettuce plant with pathogens that slowly move up the stalk, killing tissue as they travel. Use of DCNA, iprodione, and <b>vinclozolin</b> about a month before harvest has been shown to significantly reduce lettuce drop in treated fields. In treated California fields fungicides are able to reduce yield losses as low as 5%.|$|E

Studies have shown thatpesticides, particularly fungicides, have shown up in analyses ofinfant's cord blood, proving that such toxins are indeed transferredinto the baby's body. Overall, the twopesticides most frequently detected in cord blood are diethyltolaumide( [...] a commonly used repellant) and <b>vinclozolin</b> (a fungicide). Although pesticide toxicity is not as frequentlymentioned {{as some of the}} other methods of environmental toxicity, suchas air pollution, contamination can occur at any time from merelyengaging in everyday activities such as walking down a pathway near acontaminated area, or eating foods that have not been washed properly. In 2007 alone, 1.1 billion pounds ofpesticides were found present in the environment, causing pesticideexposure to gain notoriety as a new cause of caution to those wishingto preserve their health.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Crews {{discovered}} that the transgenerational epigenetic modification caused by <b>Vinclozolin</b> exposure changes the way rats three generations removed (F3) from the original exposure perceive and react to conspecifics. This was the first demonstration that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can promote a transgenerational alteration in the epigenome that influences sexual selection, and possibly affect the viability of a population and evolution of the species. This work was recognized by the University Cooperative Society with the 2008 Research Excellence Award for Best Research Paper, University of Texas at Austin. It has already become a classic, being cited as [...] "100 Top Science Stories of 2007."
