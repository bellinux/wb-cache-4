40|$|Background. Increased plasma {{homocysteine}} {{has been}} associated with atherosclerotic vascular disease in elderly persons. The Framingham Study found that plasma homocysteine was a risk factor for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Methods. We investigated in an academic nursing home the association of plasma homocysteine with atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease plus <b>dementia</b> (group 1), atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease without <b>dementia</b> (group 2), <b>dementia</b> without atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease (group 3), and no <b>dementia</b> or atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease (group 4). Results. The mean plasma homocysteine level was 15. 36 3. 0 lmol/L in 50 group 1 patients, 15. 16 2. 7 lmol/L in 50 group 2 patients, 14. 4 6 2. 7 lmol/L in 50 group 3 patients, and 10. 6 6 3. 2 lmol/L in 50 group 4 patients (p,. 0001 for group 1 vs group 4, for group 2 vs group 4, and for group 3 vs group 4). Conclusions. The mean plasma homocysteine level was significantly higher in elderly patients with atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease plus <b>dementia,</b> atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease without <b>dementia,</b> and <b>dementia</b> without atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease than in patients with no <b>dementia</b> or atherosclerotic <b>vascular</b> disease.

50|$|In the 21st century, {{a number}} of other types of {{dementia}} have been differentiated from Alzheimer's disease and <b>vascular</b> <b>dementias</b> (these two being the most common types). This differentiation is on the basis of pathological examination of brain tissues, by symptomatology, and by different patterns of brain metabolic activity in nuclear medical imaging tests such as SPECT and PETscans of the brain. The various forms of dementia have differing prognoses (expected outcome of illness), and also differing sets of epidemiologic risk factors. The causal etiology of many of them, including Alzheimer's disease, remains unclear, although many theories exist such as accumulation of protein plaques as part of normal aging, inflammation (either from bacterial pathogens or exposure to toxic chemicals), inadequate blood sugar, and traumatic brain injury.|$|R

25|$|DLB is {{the most}} common cause of {{dementia}} after Alzheimer's disease and <b>vascular</b> <b>dementia.</b> It typically begins after the age of 50. About 0.1% of those over 65 are affected. Men appear to be more commonly affected than women. In the late part of the disease, people may depend entirely on others for their care. Life expectancy following diagnosis is about eight years. The abnormal deposits that cause the disease were discovered in 1912 by Frederic Lewy.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of DLB overlap clinically {{with those of}} Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but are associated more commonly with the latter. Because of this overlap, early DLB is often misdiagnosed. The overlap of neuropathological and presenting symptoms (cognitive, emotional, and motor) may make an accurate differential diagnosis difficult. In fact, DLB often is confused {{in its early stages}} with Alzheimer's disease and/or <b>vascular</b> <b>dementia</b> (multi-infarct dementia). However, while Alzheimer’s disease usually begins gradually, DLB frequently has a rapid or acute onset, with an especially rapid cognitive and physical decline in the first few months. Thus, DLB tends to progress more rapidly than Alzheimer’s disease. Despite the difficulty, a prompt diagnosis is important because of the risks of sensitivity to certain neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications and because appropriate treatment of symptoms may improve life for both the person with DLB and the person's caregivers.|$|E
40|$|The {{aging of}} populations has raised {{concerns}} over the im-pact of an aging population on the prevalence and inci-dence of age-associated diseases, such as the dementias. This demographic shift began earlier in Europe than elsewhere; during the 1980 s, several epidemiologic studies recorded the prevalence and incidence of dementia in Europe (1 – 4). Other studies investigated US populations (5 – 7). By the early 1990 s, comparative summaries had been written (8), and gen-eral consensus arose on several key findings. From age 65 to age 90 years, incidence and prevalence rates double with roughly every 5 {{years of age and}} then slow.

Meta analysis of many reported studies suggests that SPECT with this tracer is about 74% sensitive at diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, vs. 81% sensitivity for clinical exam (mental testing, etc.).

In meta analysis, SPECT was superior to clinical exam and clinical criteria (91% vs. 70%) in being able to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from <b>vascular</b> <b>dementias.</b> This latter ability relates to SPECT's imaging of local metabolism of the brain, in which the patchy loss of cortical metabolism seen in multiple strokes differs clearly from the more even or [...] "smooth" [...] loss of non-occipital cortical brain function typical of Alzheimer's disease.|$|R

Alzheimer as well as Binswanger patients have low levels of acetylcholine and this helps to restore the normal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. This drug may improve memory, awareness, and the ability to function.

40|$|Dementia is {{understood}} as a clinical syndrome characterized by impairment in memory impairment along with cognitive deficits in other domains. Over the years, understanding {{about the causes of}} dementias has improved. Broadly, dementias can be classified as irreversible degenerative dementias and reversible dementias. Alzheimer′s disease is the prototype of degenerative dementias and is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (called as amyloid plaques) outside the neurons and accumulation of tau protein (called tau tangles) inside the neurons. <b>Vascular</b> <b>dementias</b> are characterized by cerebrovascular insults which lead to pathological brain changes that impair cognition. The pathological hallmark of Lewy body dementia is the presence of α-synuclein neuronal inclusions, also known as Lewy bodies, accompanied by neuronal loss. Frontotemporal dementias are characterized by abnormal deposits of the microtubule-associated protein tau, the trans-activation response TAR DNA-binding protein with molecular weight 43 kDa (TDP- 43), and the fused in sarcoma protein. Reversible dementias are characterized by the primary illness and may not present with characteristic brain deposits as seen with many degenerative dementias...|$|R

And the strong anxiolytic effect of NPS may be concerned with the increased dopamine releasing in medial prefrontal cortex (Lukas and Neumannid 2012; Si et al. 2010). The BDNF gene encodes a few proteins of nerve growth factor families, involving the process of neurogenesis and the realization of neuroprotective functions. It was also found that BDNF {{played a key role in}} memory and learning organization and motor function.

NPS and BDNF could be used as neurobiological markers in pathological process, and the increased concentration may provide a potential novel treatment option.|$|R
