5|$|In 2016 a {{partially}} effective <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> dengue fever became commercially {{available in the}} Philippines and Indonesia. It has also been approved for use by Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Paraguay. In Indonesia it costs about US$207 for the recommended three doses.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{licensed}} <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> HIV or AIDS. The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction {{in the risk of}} transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine. Further trials of the RV 144 vaccine are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Prevention is by washing {{hands and}} not sharing eating utensils. There is no <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> the disease. Treatment with {{antibiotics}} is only recommended {{in those with}} a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.|$|E

25|$|Measures {{have been}} {{considered}} including requiring insurers to cover HPV vaccination, and funding HPV <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> those without insurance. The cost of the HPV <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> females under 18 who are uninsured is covered under the federal <b>Vaccines</b> <b>for</b> Children Program. As of 23 September 2010, vaccines are required to be covered by insurers under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. HPV vaccines specifically are to be covered at no charge for women, including those who are pregnant or nursing.|$|R
5|$|There is no <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> {{the common}} cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and {{staying away from}} other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure for the common cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{have been}} made using animals since their {{discovery}} by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live cowpox afforded protection against the more dangerous smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> rabies. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases mumps and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro.|$|E
5|$|A novel <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> {{dengue fever}} has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
25|$|A {{licensed}} {{vaccine to}} prevent measles first became available in 1963, and an improved one in 1968. <b>Vaccines</b> <b>for</b> mumps and rubella became available in 1967 and 1969, respectively. The three <b>vaccines</b> (<b>for</b> mumps, measles, and rubella) were combined in 1971 {{to become the}} measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.|$|R

[...] The primary focus of research is the development of <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> AIDS, but the VRC also is working to develop <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> Ebola and Marburg viruses and for influenza.|$|R
5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Georgetown {{received}} $172 {{million in}} external research grants, ranking #113 amongst all {{universities in the}} United States, for research. In 2012, Georgetown spent $180 million on research, ranking it 108th nationwide. In 2007, it received about $14.8 million in federal funds for research, with 64% from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, the United States Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. In 2010, the school received $5.6 million from the Department of Education to fund fellowships in several international studies fields. Georgetown's Vincent Lombardi Cancer Center is one of 41 research-intensive comprehensive cancer centers in the United States, and developed the breakthrough HPV <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> cervical cancer and Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells (CRC) technology.|$|E
5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
40|$|Biotechnology {{has been}} used {{extensively}} {{in the development of}} <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> aquaculture. Modern molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning and microarray analysis have facilitated antigen discovery, construction of novel candidate vaccines, and assessments of vaccine efficacy, mode of action, and host response. This review focuses on DNA <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> finfish to illustrate biotechnology applications in this field. Although DNA <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> fish rhabdoviruses continue to show the highest efficacy, DNA <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> several other viral and bacterial fish pathogens have now been proven to provide significant protection against pathogen challenge. Studies of the fish rhabdovirus DNA vaccines have elucidated factors that affect DNA vaccine efficacy as well as the nature of the fish innate and adaptive immune responses to DNA <b>vaccines.</b> As tools <b>for</b> managing aquatic animal disease emergencies, DNA vaccines have advantages in speed, flexibility, and safety, and one fish DNA vaccine has been licensed...|$|R

5|$|The car is {{tracked down}} by a {{government}} gunship. Canaris arrives and reveals he will let the virus continue {{as a form of}} population control and profit. Cally's blood is {{to be used as a}} <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> the virus. Cally and Stirling board the gunship, while Sinclair chooses to stay behind. Nelson flies into the quarantine zone to speak with Sinclair and she gives him a recording of the conversation, the evidence to bring down Canaris. The recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang. Looking at the head, the marauders cheer, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people. Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, Sabin in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine, containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral <b>vaccine.</b> <b>For</b> this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American {{during the height of the}} cold war. Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961. Once Sabin’s oral vaccine became widely available, it supplanted Salk’s injected vaccine because it was cheaper to produce and easier to administer.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 influenza virus in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E

In this study, we isolated a feline infectious ERV (RD- 114) in a proportion of live attenuated <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> pets. Isolation of RD- 114 was made in two independent laboratories using different detection strategies and using <b>vaccines</b> <b>for</b> both cats and dogs commercially available in Japan or the United Kingdom.

5|$|The {{university}} operates six {{research centres}} and institutes, the Centre for Neuroscience Studies, GeoEngeering Centre, High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory, Human Mobility Research Centre, Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Institute, and the Southern African Research Centre. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory's director, Arthur B. McDonald, {{is a member}} of the university's physics department. The observatory managed the SNO experiment, which demonstrated that the solution to the solar neutrino problem was that neutrinos change flavour (type) as they propagate through the Sun. The SNO experiment proved that a non-zero mass neutrino exists. This was a major breakthrough in cosmology. In October 2015, Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita (University of Tokyo) jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physics for illustration of neutrino change identities and identification of mass. This is the first Nobel Prize awarded to a Queen's University researcher. In 1976 urologist Alvaro Morales, along with his colleagues, developed the first clinically effective immunotherapy for cancer by adapting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin tuberculosis <b>vaccine</b> <b>for</b> treatment of early stage bladder cancer.|$|E
