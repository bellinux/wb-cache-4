5|$|Since the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> {{of these}} {{ceramics}} are without provenance, analysis has largely {{focused on the}} ceramics' styles and subjects.|$|E
5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are harmful. However, the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.|$|E
5|$|A {{virus has}} either a DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively. The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have {{single-stranded}} RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.|$|E

5|$|The {{anonymous}} fourth-century compilation Medicina Plinii {{contains more}} than 1,100 pharmacological recipes, the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> {{of them from the}} Historia naturalis; perhaps because Pliny's name was attached to it, it enjoyed huge popularity in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of American made {{vehicles}} {{continued to}} use simple Live rear axles into the 1980s, but Americans could access four wheel Independent suspension technology on imported cars, like the 1952 Volkswagen Beetle, 1961 Jaguar E-Type, and 1968 Datsun 510.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of FBO/Robertson-Cole pictures, {{produced}} during either the silent era or {{the transitional period}} of the conversion to sound cinema, {{are considered to be}} lost films, with no copies now known to exist.

5|$|The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of {{butterflies}} have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and imago (adult). In the genera Colias, Erebia, Euchloe, and Parnassius, {{a small number}} of species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> {{of cases}} of {{hyperparathyroidism}} {{are the result of}} the random formation of benign, but metabolically active, parathyroid adenoma swellings. These instances comprise approximately 80–85% of all documented cases of hyperparathyroidism.|$|E

5|$|Thousands {{of bronze}} coins {{have been found}} from the pre-Roman period, the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> having been struck by the Durotriges.

5|$|Toothache may {{be caused}} by dental (odontogenic) {{conditions}} (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by non-dental (non-odontogenic) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or angina pectoris).

5|$|Hybrids - The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of LARPs {{engage in}} a {{combination}} of these combat systems with either the Point or Limb Loss system being at the foundation.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the original procedure shown above (which may have compatibility issues for sensitive substrates), Weinreb amides can be synthesized {{from a variety of}} acyl compounds. The <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of these procedures utilize the commercially available salt N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride , which is typically easier to handle than the free amine.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} {{after the publication}} of On the Origin of Species in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution.
