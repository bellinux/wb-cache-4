5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} reined in inflation {{by making the}} peso equal in <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. dollar, and privatised numerous state-run companies, using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt. However, a sustained recession {{at the turn of}} the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued the peso. By 2005 the economy had recovered, but a judicial ruling originating from the previous crisis led to a new default in 2014.|$|E

He would not swim the 400m, claiming he would not have enough time to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{first entered}} {{what would become}} Indiana {{near the end of}} the last ice age. The region around Harrison County was of {{particular}} <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early humans because of the abundance of flint. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the Hopewells and Mississippians. One flint-working and camping location is known as the Swan's Landing Archeological Site; it is among the most important Early Archaic archaeological sites anywhere in eastern North America. Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in the last decade of the 18thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E

5|$|Realising the {{symbolic}} {{significance of the}} dam to the Portuguese, FRELIMO proceeded to spend seven years attempting to halt its construction by force. No direct attacks were ever successful, but FRELIMO had some success in attacking convoys {{en route to the}} site. FRELIMO also lodged a protest with the United Nations about the project, and their cause was aided by negative reports of Portuguese actions in Mozambique. In spite of the subsequent withdrawal of much foreign financial support for the dam, it was finally completed in December 1974. The dam's intended propaganda <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese was overshadowed by the adverse Mozambican public reaction to the extensive dispersal of the indigenous populace, who were forced to relocate from their homes to allow for the construction project. The dam also deprived farmers of the critical annual floods, which formerly re-fertilised the plantations.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} would {{probably}} be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to an explosion in a ship to measure the effect of a ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lairds {{transformed}} the estate into a valuable asset. Lord Pitfour, the second laird, purchased additional lands including Deer Abbey and Inverugie Castle. Pitfour's son, James Ferguson, {{who became the}} third laird, continued to improve and expand the estate by adding the lake and bridges, and establishing planned villages. The third laird died a bachelor with no children, so the estate passed to the elderly George Ferguson, who was only in possession of the property for a few months. George was already a wealthy man, owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago, but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inheritance passed to his illegitimate son. The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the sequestration of the estate, which was sold off piecemeal to pay their debts.|$|E

5|$|The <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sinecurist of {{an office}} like that of Paymaster of Marines lay {{not so much in}} the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E
5|$|When Rooke {{arrived in}} the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the {{inhabitants}} of Barcelona to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at Toulon was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take Cádiz had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic <b>value</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.|$|E
