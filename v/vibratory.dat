5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile <b>vibratory</b> stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of rock {{tumbling}}: barrel (rotary) tumbling, and <b>vibratory</b> tumbling. Rotary tumbling is more common, simpler, quieter and less expensive than <b>vibratory</b> tumblers. There are two differentiating factors, however, that may lead one to use a <b>vibratory</b> tumbler. First, <b>vibratory</b> tumbler retain the overall shape of the rough rock, whereas rotary tumblers tend to make rocks round. Thus, {{it is important to}} use <b>vibratory</b> tumbler to make faceted shapes and tear drop forms. Second, <b>vibratory</b> tumblers tend to process much faster than rotary tumblers, generally reducing the process time to half.|$|E
25|$|Vocal registration: a {{particular}} series of tones, {{produced in the}} same <b>vibratory</b> pattern of the vocal folds, and possessing the same quality, which originate in laryngeal function, because each of these <b>vibratory</b> patterns appears within {{a particular}} range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds.|$|E
25|$|Other: Shoe pegs, leather, carpet tacks, {{and many}} other solid {{materials}} have been used {{at one time or}} another in tumble or <b>vibratory</b> finishing for certain applications.|$|E
25|$|Persistent onset vertigo is {{characterized}} by symptoms lasting for longer than one day and is caused by degenerative changes that affect balance as people age. Naturally, the nerve conduction slows with aging and a decreased <b>vibratory</b> sensation is common.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s {{there were}} far fewer orders for ships with {{reciprocating}} steam engines. However, geared steam turbines are more compact, {{more powerful and}} less <b>vibratory</b> than reciprocating engines. Early in the 1950s Burntisland took two orders for steam turbine cargo ships.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} in the dental literature that malleting of an osteotome during closed sinus floor elevation, otherwise known as osteotome sinus elevation or lift, transmits percussive and <b>vibratory</b> forces capable of detaching otoliths from their normal location and thereby leading to the symptoms of BPPV.|$|E
25|$|The {{separator}} {{separates the}} coated workpieces from the medium after coating. It {{can be as}} simple as a screen with water nozzles or as complicated as a <b>vibratory</b> system with magnetic separators. A medium handling machine then takes the separated medium and transports it to a storage tank for reuse.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{involved}} in producing different pitches on a brass instrument. Slides, valves, crooks (though {{they are rarely}} used today), or keys are used to change <b>vibratory</b> length of tubing, thus changing the available harmonic series, while the player's embouchure, lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series.|$|E
25|$|A {{vibrating}} structure gyroscope (VSG), {{also called}} a Coriolis <b>vibratory</b> gyroscope (CVG), uses a resonator made of different metallic alloys. It takes a position between the low-accuracy, low-cost MEMS gyroscope and the higher-accuracy and higher-cost FOG. Accuracy parameters are increased by using low-intrinsic damping materials, resonator vacuumization, and digital electronics to reduce temperature dependent drift and instability of control signals.|$|E
25|$|Within speech {{pathology}} {{the term}} vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain <b>vibratory</b> {{pattern of the}} vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and {{a certain type of}} sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register. This view is also adopted by many teachers of singing.|$|E
25|$|Blanchard {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to gun barrels, and invented a machine tool that streamlined the process of their manufacture. Hired by the Springfield Armory during its construction, Blanchard finished the machine in 1822. The machine turned and finished gun barrels in a single operation; the octagon portion of the barrel was finished by changing the action of the lathe to <b>vibratory</b> motion. This invention was afterward extended to the turning of all kinds of irregular forms.|$|E
25|$|In linguistics, a {{register}} {{language is a}} language which combines tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological system. Within speech pathology, the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain <b>vibratory</b> pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and {{a certain type of}} sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register.

25|$|The Buddy-Watcher is a wrist mounted buddy alert device which sends an {{ultrasonic}} signal when a key is pressed, for {{at least}} 20m through the water to the matching unit on the dive buddy, which will produce a silent <b>vibratory</b> and visual signal alerting the diver that their buddy wants attention. There is no direct indication to the sender whether the signal has been received and no indication of distance or direction to the buddy. The device is waterproof to 40m, therefore is suited for recreational scuba diving use, but not technical diving.|$|E
25|$|Maratus is {{a spider}} genus {{of the family}} Salticidae (jumping spiders). These spiders are {{commonly}} referred to as peacock spiders due to the males' colorful and usually iridescent patterns on the upper surface of the abdomen often enhanced with lateral flaps or bristles, which they display during courtship. Females lack these bright colors, being cryptic in appearance. In at least one species, Maratus vespertilio, the expansion of the flaps also occurs during ritualised contests between males. The male display and courtship dance are complex, involving visual and <b>vibratory</b> signals.|$|E
25|$|High-strength {{aluminium}} alloys have the tensile strength of medium strong steel alloys while providing significant weight advantages. Therefore, aluminium forged parts are mainly used in aerospace, automotive industry {{and many other}} fields of engineering especially in those fields, where highest safety standards against failure by abuse, by shock or <b>vibratory</b> stresses are needed. Such parts are for example chassis parts, steering components and brake parts. Commonly used alloys are AlSi1MgMn (EN AW-6082) and AlZnMgCu1,5 (EN AW-7075). About 80% of all aluminium forged parts are made of AlSi1MgMn. The high-strength alloy AlZnMgCu1,5 is mainly used for aerospace applications.|$|E
25|$|Species {{vary greatly}} in visual and <b>vibratory</b> {{components}} of courtship. Many species have patches of UV reflectance, which are exhibited in mature males. This visual component {{is used by}} some female jumping spiders for mate choice. Body size dimorphism seems {{to play a role}} in male-male competition, where the larger bodied males will have a fitness advantage to hook the competitor and push down its legs into a vulnerable state, thus impairing the competitor's ability to fight back. Since larger spiders have a better chance of winning the fight, they also have a greater chance to successfully mate and will be favored by sexual selection.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mechanical and electronic cones, {{a variety of other}} CPT-deployed tools have been developed over the years to provide additional subsurface information. One common tool advanced during CPT testing is a geophone set to gather seismic shear wave and compression wave velocities. This data helps determine the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio at intervals through the soil column for soil liquefaction analysis and low-strain soil strength analysis. Engineers use the shear wave velocity and shear modulus to determine the soil's behavior under low-strain and <b>vibratory</b> loads. Additional tools such as laser-induced fluorescence, X-ray fluorescence, soil conductivity/resistivity, pH, temperature and membrane interface probe and cameras for capturing video imagery are also increasingly advanced in conjunction with the CPT probe.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and <b>vibratory</b> finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E
25|$|BART trains travel between San Francisco and Oakland {{through an}} {{underwater}} tube structure. The tube {{is composed of}} welded plate steel segments. Each oval outer section carries two inner train tubes of circular cross section and a central rectangular access and rescue tunnel, with the void between elements filled with concrete. The segments were sunk into a ditch dredged through bay mud and covered with rock fill, and then pumped free of water upon completion, making the resulting tube somewhat buoyant, but held in place with a rock overfill. Subsequent seismic analysis indicated {{the possibility that the}} overfill could fail due to agitation, allowing the buoyant tube to float upward, misaligning the tracks and possibly overstressing the bolted connections. This potential problem has been addressed by <b>vibratory</b> compaction of the overfill covering the tube. Additional stabilization includes the driving of large pilings and the connection of additional restraints.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{knowledge}} of physiology has {{increased over the}} past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University and William Vennard at the University of Southern California, have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice. In particular, the use of the terms chest register and head register have become controversial since vocal registration is more commonly seen today as a product of laryngeal function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the <b>vibratory</b> sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to vocal resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms chest voice and head voice over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including speech pathology, phonetics, and linguistics. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.|$|E

500|$|During {{spawning}} season, the fins and {{underside of}} male bowfin often {{change in color}} to a bright lime green. The courtship/spawning sequence lasts one to three hours, and can repeat up to five times. Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. [...] The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive, at which time the pair lie {{side by side in}} the nest. [...] She deposits her eggs while he shakes his fins in a <b>vibratory</b> movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur. A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests.|$|E

2500|$|Describing vocal {{sound is}} an inexact science {{largely because the}} human voice is a {{self-contained}} instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced {{is complicated by the}} vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it [...] "sounds" [...] and more on how it [...] "feels". <b>Vibratory</b> sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.|$|E
