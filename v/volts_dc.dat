Voltage multiplier is two or more rectifier of top which result voltage DC equal to multiply top input voltage (2 Vp, 3 Vp, 4 Vp, and continuing) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a Co-Co wheel {{arrangement and}} there were six 340 kW traction motors giving a total output of 2,040 kW. The gear ratio was 3.74:1 and the wheels were 48 inch diameter. Following the introduction of 3,000 <b>volt</b> <b>DC</b> electrification, some locomotives were converted to dual voltage, 1,500 or 3,000 <b>volt</b> <b>DC.</b>|$|R
25|$|Multi-layer {{varistor}} (MLV) devices provide {{electrostatic discharge}} protection to electronic circuits from low to medium energy transients in sensitive equipment operating at 0-120 <b>volts</b> <b>dc.</b> They have peak current ratings from about 20 to 500 amperes, and peak energy ratings from 0.05 to 2.5 joules.|$|E
25|$|The {{power system}} was changed from 6600 volts AC to 1500 <b>volts</b> <b>DC</b> on July 28, 1926, {{allowing}} trains to operate {{directly to the}} Illinois Central Railroad's Randolph Street Terminal without an engine change. Trains began running to Chicago on August 29. That same year, the original line between East Chicago and Indiana Harbor was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Like the New York City Subway and in {{contrast}} with the London Underground the Paris Métro mostly uses two-way tunnels. As in most French métro and tramway systems, trains drive on the right (the SNCF drives on the left). The tracks are standard gauge (1.435 metres). Electric power is supplied by a third rail which carries 750 <b>volts</b> <b>DC.</b>|$|E
500|$|Electrical {{power was}} [...] {{provided}} by three 100kW, 100 V dc [...] generators, powered by two Brotherhood steam and two Mirrlees diesel engines (which later changed to three steam and one diesel). Among the equipment powered by 100 <b>volt</b> <b>dc</b> and 15 <b>volt</b> <b>dc</b> electrical systems were five lifts, eight coaling winches, pumps, ventilation fans, lighting and telephone systems.|$|R
50|$|Line 51 to Amstelveen runs metro service between Central Station and Station Zuid. At Station Zuid it {{switches}} {{from third}} rail to pantograph and catenary wires. From there to Amstelveen Centrum it shares its track with tram line 5. The light rail vehicles on this line {{are capable of}} using both 600 <b>volt</b> <b>DC</b> and 750 <b>volt</b> <b>DC.</b>|$|R

25|$|Electrical {{power is}} {{supplied}} by three MHW-RTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They are powered by plutonium-238 (distinct from the Pu-239 isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470 W at 30 <b>volts</b> <b>DC</b> when the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 87.74 years, so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose a factor of 1−0.5(1/87.74) = 0.79% of their power output per year.|$|E
25|$|S-trains run on standard-gauge {{tracks and}} are powered via {{overhead}} wires. The voltage is 1,500 or 1,650 <b>volts</b> <b>DC</b> (negative overhead wire), indicating that it varies considerably with the loading and distance from a feeder station. Power {{is drawn from}} the national grid through 38 feeder stations. They have to be relatively {{close to each other}} because the large currents in the overhead wires (caused by the relatively low voltage) would lead to unacceptably large transmission losses otherwise.|$|E
25|$|In 1848 before Riverside station opened, the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway {{had been}} {{incorporated}} into the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), which ran the services until 1923 when, under the railway grouping of the Railways Act 1921, the LSWR {{became part of the}} Southern Railway. In 1930 the line was electrified on the third rail system at a nominal 660 <b>volts</b> <b>DC.</b> In the 1948 nationalisation the line became part of the Southern Region of British Railways.|$|E

25|$|The first common {{application}} of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers {{in the late}} 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the valve amplifier technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 <b>volts</b> <b>DC.</b> Waxed paper and oiled silk film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.|$|E
25|$|Electric-motor-driven {{mechanical}} sirens may draw 50 to 200 amperes at 12 <b>volts</b> (<b>DC)</b> when spinning up to operating speed. Appropriate {{wiring and}} transient protection for engine control computers {{is a necessary}} part of an installation. Wiring should be similar in size to the wiring to the vehicle engine starter motor. Mechanical vehicle mounted devices usually have an electric brake, a solenoid that presses a friction pad against the siren rotor. When an emergency vehicle arrives on-scene or is cancelled en route, the operator can rapidly stop the siren.|$|E
25|$|Some {{microphones}} such as condenser microphones require power. An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 <b>volts</b> <b>DC,</b> although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E
50|$|The {{two older}} subway lines, the Higashiyama and Meijō/Meikō Lines, run on {{standard}} gauge track and use 600 <b>volt</b> <b>DC</b> electrification {{from a third}} rail. They, are, along with the Ginza and Marunouchi Lines, the only railway lines in Japan to use this electrification system. Subsequent lines were built to narrow gauge and employ 1,500 <b>volt</b> <b>DC</b> electrification from overhead lines, in common with most other rapid transit lines in the country.|$|R

50|$|The two power rails of 300 <b>volts</b> {{positive}} <b>DC</b> and {{the other}} of 300 <b>volts</b> negative <b>DC</b> together produce 600 volts.|$|R
25|$|Each cathode {{can be made}} to glow in the {{characteristic}} neon red-orange color by applying about 170 <b>volts</b> <b>DC</b> at a few milliamperes between a cathode and the anode. The current limiting is normally implemented as an anode resistor of a few tens of thousands of ohms. Nixies exhibit negative resistance and will maintain their glow at typically 20 V to 30 V below the strike voltage. Some color variation can be observed between types, caused by differences in the gas mixtures used. Longer-life tubes that were manufactured later in the Nixie timeline have mercury added to reduce sputtering resulting in a blue or purple tinge to the emitted light. In some cases, these colors are filtered out by a red or orange filter coating on the glass.|$|E
25|$|A {{power station}} {{was built in}} 1903 to power the public trams. Using coal, brought to the town quay by local {{businessman}} Samuel Bemister, and water from the nearby River Avon; the power station produced 500 <b>volts</b> <b>DC</b> and although the boilers were shut down at night, the excess generated was sufficient to light the town. In 1940 it {{was added to the}} national grid. Today the power station is a museum and a grade II listed building. It {{is one of the most}} complete buildings of its kind. Trams ran from 1905 to 1936 when they were replaced by trolleybuses. The last trolleybus ran in 1969. Tuckton Bridge, first opened in 1883 as a wooden structure, had to be rebuilt in 1905 to take the weight of the trams, and the, then main route out of the town was widened through wide scale demolition on the west side; although many of these buildings were rebuilt further back.|$|E
25|$|High-pass {{filters are}} also used for AC {{coupling}} at the inputs of many audio power amplifiers, for preventing the amplification of DC currents which may harm the amplifier, rob the amplifier of headroom, and generate waste heat at the loudspeakers voice coil. One amplifier, the professional audio model DC300 made by Crown International beginning in the 1960s, did not have high-pass filtering at all, and {{could be used to}} amplify the DC signal of a common 9-volt battery at the input to supply 18 <b>volts</b> <b>DC</b> in an emergency for mixing console power. However, that model's basic design has been superseded by newer designs such as the Crown Macro-Tech series developed in the late 1980s which included 10Hz high-pass filtering on the inputs and switchable 35Hz high-pass filtering on the outputs. Another example is the QSC Audio PLX amplifier series which includes an internal 5Hz high-pass filter which is applied to the inputs whenever the optional 50 and 30Hz high-pass filters are turned off.|$|E
