The columns on the elevation bore only <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> so Tange was able to design them to be thin, maximising the surfaces for glazing.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{equivalence}} principle, the concentrated <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> {{which acts}} on the Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement(CRCP) transverse crack is translated into the equivalent half-wave sine load by Fourier transform. According to the translation {{principle of the}} force, the half-wave sine <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> acting on the CRCP transverse crack is decomposed to the half-wave sine <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> and the torsion force acting {{on the center of}} CRCP. Lastly, the deflection, torsional displacement and stress formulas of CRCP under the concentrated <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> with hollow foundation are put forward, which is {{on the basis of the}} small deflection theory of elastic thin plate and torsion theory. The results show that increasing the slab thickness is the most effective measure to reduce maximal deflection, distortion displacement and stress of CRCP concentrated <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> with hollow foundation...|$|R
3000|$|For {{the second}} assumption, the {{position}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> {{is assumed to be}} applied at the top center of column. Before column rocking, the assumption is reasonable. But once rotation of the column occurs, {{the position of}} <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> deviates from the center of column head. Because the theoretical model is mainly obtained based on the small rotation angle, the offset distance of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> is small. While the position of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> makes a little effects on the restoring moment. Equation (71) changes into Ph+N([...] Δ - Δ _d)=M^+_bc with taking the partial compression into consideration. Δ _d is the offset distance of <b>vertical</b> <b>load.</b> The theoretical moment may be overestimated without considering the partial compression based on the above formula. All in all, {{it should be noted that}} the above assumptions should be improved in the future study in order to make the theoretical model more accurate.|$|R

25|$|Resonant {{vibrational}} modes due to <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) {{and wind}} loads are well understood in bridge design. In {{the case of}} the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial point is that when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this at exactly the same time.|$|E
25|$|These {{methods of}} {{retaining}} wall construction employ bored piling techniques, normally CFA or rotary. They provide special advantages where available working space dictates that basement excavation faces be vertical. Both methods offer technically effective and cost efficient temporary or permanent means of retaining {{the sides of}} bulk excavations even in water bearing strata. When used in permanent works, these walls can be designed to accommodate <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> in addition to moments and horizontal forces. Construction of both methods {{is the same as}} for foundation bearing piles. Contiguous walls are constructed with small gaps between adjacent piles. The size of this space is determined {{by the nature of the}} soils.|$|E

30|$|In {{low-rise}} wood frame building, the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> {{resistance of}} wall and column is not noticed {{as a critical}} performance in a structural design. However, in mid-rise buildings the walls and columns need to resist heavy <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> of the upper storeys. Cross-laminated timber has shown a great possibility for the use in the mid-rise wood frame construction. The cross-laminated timber (CLT) walls in a mid-rise building need to resist much heavier <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> than low-rise buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Coulomb {{friction}} theory {{says that}} the maximum horizontal force developed should be proportional to the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> on the tire.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study how it {{influence}} the horizontal bearing capacity of the disk pile when there exists a <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> a group of model tests has been designed. Three double-disk piles {{were used in the}} test, and the distance of the two disks is 5 times as the disk diameter. First drew a <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> V= 200 N/ 300 N/ 400 N on the top of pile 1 / 2 / 3 respectively, then put on the horizontal load stage by stage. And by the test, we can study the differences of the pile bearing properties such as changes in the pile bending moment, the horizontal and vertical deformation on the top. Experiment showed that when the <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> is quite small（V= 200 N, 300 N）, the existence of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> {{has little to do with}} horizontal bearing capacity. When a <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> increases to a certain value（V= 400 N）, The maximum bending moment and horizontal displacement of the pile under the same horizontal load reduce, which indicates that the disks of the pile play a significant role in bearing combined loading...|$|R

This paper analyzes the variation of stress, strain, deformation and deflection of the pile body by finite element numerical simulation of single bored concrete pile under <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> together with horizontal load. Based on the existing research results, conclusions {{could be that the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> can increase horizontal bearing capacity of the pile in sandy soils, but horizontal bearing capacity of the pile in clayey soils is more complicated. Hope that the simulation can provide some references for the design of pile foundation...|$|R

50|$|In a {{next phase}} the forces caused by wind must be considered. Wind will cause {{pressure}} on the upwind side of a roof (and truss) and suction on the downwind side. This will translate to asymmetrical loads but the Cremona method is the same. Wind force may introduce larger forces in the individual truss members than the static <b>vertical</b> <b>loads.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{load path}} of the self-anchored {{suspension}} (SAS) bridge converts <b>vertical</b> <b>loads</b> into tension forces in the main cables which are countered by compressive forces in the towers and deck.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} automated parameter fitted {{analytical model}} that numerically predicts the load-displacement response of wood frame shear walls subjected to static monotonic loading {{with and without}} <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> is presented. This analytical model referred to as Analytical Model of wood frame SHEar walls subjected to <b>Vertical</b> <b>load</b> (AMSHEV) {{is based on the}} kinematic behavior of wood frame shear walls and captures significant characteristics observed from experimental testing through appropriate modeling of three failure mechanisms that can occur within a shear wall under static monotonic load: 1) failure of sheathing-to-framing connectors, 2) failure of vertical studs, and 3) uplift of end studs from bottom sill. Previous models have not accounted for these failure mechanisms as well as the inclusion of <b>vertical</b> <b>load,</b> which has shown to reveal beneficial effects such as increasing the ultimate load capacity and limiting uplift of the wall as noted in experimental tests. Results from the proposed numerical model capture these effects within 7 % error of experimental test data even when different magnitudes of <b>vertical</b> <b>load</b> are applied to predict the ultimate load capacity of wood frame shear walls...|$|R
