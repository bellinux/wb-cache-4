40|$|Each year in America {{an unknown}} number of {{children}} in primary and secondary schools are strip searched by teachers and/or school administrators, forced to remove pants and shirts down to their underwear and sometimes forced to expose their breasts and genitals.

The Fourth Amendment's proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures is analyzed in terms of traditional search theory and the modifications to those theories in applying the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard to searches in the public school sector. Selected state and federal cases are examined which illustrate the Fourth Amendment in the context of legal concepts and doctrines of law, including judicial power, federal and state authority, in loco parentis, standing to sue, and the doctrine of selective incorporation. An analysis of the evidentiary standards of probable cause and reasonable suspicion provide the basis for a review of traditional search and seizure theory and the judicially-created modifications to traditional theory in the public education context.

40|$|Incidents {{of illegal}} drug use 2 ̆ 7 and violent crime plague public school {{authorities}} across the nation. As narcotics and weapons appear on school campuses, school officials seek to conduct searches of students 2 ̆ 7 lockers, property, and persons for contraband or prohibited weapons. Public school authorities justify their actions by stating that since the state requires children to attend school, the state retains a compelling interest, if not an affirmative duty, in ensuring that the school environment remain free of illegal substances which might present safety hazards to teachers or fellow students. The fourth amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted to protect individual citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. In New Jersey <b>v.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.,</b> the Supreme Court held the fourth amendment applicable to school searches and recognized that students have some constitutionally protected expectation of privacy in their belongings. 2 ̆ 2 However, the majority ultimately de cided 2 ̆ 2 that the prevalence of student drug use 2 ̆ 2 and {{the uniqueness of the}} school setting would allow school authorities to invade students 2 ̆ 7 privacy rights and conduct searches for prohibited substances upon 2 ̆ 2 reasonable suspicion 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 reasonable cause, 2 ̆ 2 rather than the higher traditional standard of 2 ̆ 2 probable cause. 2 ̆ 2 The Court did not establish fixed criteria concerning the type of information necessary to support a 2 ̆ 2 reasonable suspicion 2 ̆ 2 that a student possesses contraband. Thus, a crucial unaddressed issue remains whether a student search should be deemed valid if, prior to the, search, school officials lacked individualized suspicion that a particular student or group of students had violated a criminal law or school rule. If individualized suspicion is not an essential element of the requisite reasonable suspicion, school authorities could conceivably form a subjective assessment of the student population, determine that a drug use problem exists, and then proceed to randomly search some or all students to locate contraband {{which may or may not}} be present. The possibility of dragnet searches for contraband grows more alarming as the potential scope of student searches widens. Since the late 19602 ̆ 7 s, school officials have conducted three major types of searches at public high schools. The least invasive searches were typically of a school locker, an automobile, or a student 2 ̆ 7 s personal property, such as a handbag, or piece of luggage. More invasive searches include narcotic detection dogs sniffing lockers and persons to uncover illegal drugs. Until recently, the most invasive school searches were student body searches, which ranged from a patdown to a full strip search. However, during the past year, several schools have instituted policies requiring students to undergo urinalysis testing in order to detect drug use. This Note examines the conflict between a school 2 ̆ 7 s right to preserve educational safety and a student 2 ̆ 7 s right to privacy in his possessions, his person, and his body fluids. Section II addresses the history of the fourth amendment and its application to public schoolchildren. Section III discusses New Jersey <b>v.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.</b> and the decision 2 ̆ 7 s impact on school search law. Sections IV and <b>V</b> employ the <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.</b> balancing test to evaluate public school officials 2 ̆ 7 need to conduct searches, weighing that need against the rights of students to preserve their privacy against invasive searches. Section VI reviews analogous invasive body search programs instituted in nonschool contexts. This Note will conclude that invasive body searches should not be conducted in public schools without the added safeguard of individualized suspicion to protect students 2 ̆ 7 fourth amendment rights...|$|R
40|$|The Fourth Amendment {{special needs}} {{exception}} {{may be one}} of the Court’s most puzzling doctrines. Since its origin, the Court has struggled to define its limits and its place in the Court’s suspicionless search and seizure jurisprudence. At times the Court has suggested that the exception is the only route to upholding a search or seizure in the absence of individualized suspicion, while at other times it has stated that it is just one of a limited number of exceptions to the requirement of individualized suspicion. Historically, while the application of the special needs exception has been unpredictable, one thing was clear: once the Court found a “special need,” the search in question was upheld. More recently, the Court has struck down several suspicionless search schemes because, in the Court’s view, they were implemented with the primary purpose of ordinary crime control. However, just as some limits have appeared to rein in suspicionless and/or special needs searches, the Court seems ready to jettison the exception in favor of what it refers to as “a general Fourth Amendment analysis. ” This Article, written as part of the National Center for Justice and the Rule of Law annual Fourth Amendment symposium on Children and the Fourth Amendment, analyzes the current state of the special needs exception created in New Jersey <b>v.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.</b> The Article begins with a detailed discussion of the Court’s suspicionless search jurisprudence and explains how <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.,</b> and specifically Justice Blackmun’s concurrence, shaped the Court’s jurisprudence. The Article then reviews two recent parolee/probationer cases as well as the Court’s most recent school search case, Safford Unified School District No. 1 v. Redding, and argues that these cases suggest that after decades of ambiguity, confusion, and even explicit contradiction, the Court appears to have given up in its attempts to define the special needs exception and instead has turned to the even less well defined “general Fourth Amendment analysis” to analyze suspicionless searches and seizures. Most troubling, the Court may have done so as a means to avoid the few limits, particularly the “primary purpose” test, recently imposed on special needs searches. The Article warns that while civil libertarians used to, and still do, lament the “standardlessness” and permissiveness of the special needs exception, they may be wishing for the good old days once they see where the “general Fourth Amendment analysis” path leads...|$|R
40|$|In this digital age, {{individuals}} and {{society as a}} whole struggle to balance the advantages of digital connectivity against the reality that this very connectivity inevitably gives others access, licitly or illicitly, to private information. Youth, in particular, bring a new dimension to this issue with their concept of privacy. While risks to privacy are certainly not limited to youth, an argument can be made that conceptualizations of privacy for those who have grown up with this technology are unique. One could further argue that as a group, youth possibly demonstrate distinct expectations of privacy when compared with older generations. This article concerns the intersection of youth, technology, expectations of privacy, and the Fourth Amendment. More specifically, the article examines whether this norm of conditioned increased information disclosure, combined with decreased privacy rights for students, effectively strips or compromises the Fourth Amendment protections of a class of people - youth. This article seeks to explore a Fourth Amendment issue never before faced. What is society to do when a large subset of citizens, as a result of social or technological conditioning and not government action, demonstrates an arguably lesser expectation of privacy? Part I of this article examines data regarding digital natives and their interaction with current technologies. Part II reviews current law regarding expectations of privacy in general, under the Katz test and more specifically, for public school students, under New Jersey <b>v.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.</b> and Safford Unified School District v. Redding. The article further reviews what guidance the Court has offered in situations where the familiar two-pronged Katz test is not useful. Part III reviews possible solutions to this problem, calling into question the utility of the Katz test. The article explores whether a more value-laden approach outlined by Justice Harlan in his dissent in United States v. White may offer a more promising solution than the traditional Katz analysis. Because the jurisprudence addressing searches of public school students in a school setting is developing, Part IV applies the different approaches offered by the Court to a hypothetical modification of the facts in Redding. Suppose instead of the virtual strip search, school officials had seized her cell phone and examined its digital contents. This article explores that scenario and concludes that, for several reasons, the Supreme Court‘s current approach to applying the Fourth Amendment is inadequate to sufficiently address the issues presented in this all-too-common scenario. It further argues that the proposal of Justice Harlan in his White dissent offers the most promise...|$|R
40|$|STUDY QUESTION Do serum FSH {{levels on}} day of hCG trigger differ between {{women with a}} poor, normal or hyper {{response}} to a fixed daily dose of 150 IU recombinant FSH (rFSH) ? SUMMARY ANSWER There is no consistent relationship between ovarian response and serum FSH levels on day of hCG trigger in a 150 IU fixed dose treatment protocol. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY When ovarian response to stimulation for IVF/ICSI is suboptimal, the FSH dose is often adjusted in a subsequent cycle, thereby assuming that serum FSH levels were inadequate for optimal stimulation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Nested cohort study within a randomized controlled trial conducted at the University Medical Centre Utrecht between March 2009 and July 2011. Blood was drawn from 124 women on cycle Day 2 and on day of hCG triggering. Serum FSH level {{was determined by the}} Beckman-Coulter Unicel DXi 800 chemiluminescence assay. In order to detect a difference of 2 IU/L between poor, normal and hyper responders, a total of 64 participants (16 poor, 32 normal and 16 hyper responders) would provide 80 % power, assuming a standard deviation of 2 and an alpha of 0. 05. PARTICIPANTS, SETTING, METHODS Women aged ≤ 39 years with a regular cycle and fixed FSH dose of 150 IU. Exclusion criteria: BMI > 32 kg/m 2 and > 2 previous unsuccessful IVF/ICSI cycles. The primary outcome measure was serum FSH level on day of triggering. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Median [range] body weight was 70. 0 kg [55. 0 - 85. 6], 68. 0 kg [52. 0 - 94] and 60. 6 kg [51. 0 - 78. 0] for poor (n = 16), normal (n = 94) and hyper (n = 17) responders, respectively. Mean (SD) serum FSH levels on day of triggering were 9. 5 IU/L (2. 4) in poor, 10. 4 IU/L (2. 3) in normal and 11. 5 IU/L (2. 2) in hyper responders. Serum FSH levels on day of hCG in poor responders differed significantly as compared to those in hyper responders (P = 0. 03). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The number of retrieved oocytes is only minimally determined by serum FSH level on the day of hCG trigger. After correction for age, body weight, basal serum FSH and basal anti-Mullerian hormone the correlation between serum FSH level on the day of hCG and ovarian response regarding the number of retrieved oocytes disappeared. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The current study shows that a poor response is not related to inadequate serum FSH levels per se. One could therefore question whether increasing the rFSH dose in women with a suboptimal response is meaningful. In women with a hyper response, however, lowering the dose of rFSH in a subsequent IVF cycle may lead to lower serum FSH levels and thereby mitigate ovarian response and improve safety of the IVF treatment. As this was not a dose-response study, future research should assess whether dose adjustments benefit the poor and hyper responder.

S. <b>T.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>T.</b> is a resource-oriented training program targeting NEET youth (Not in Education, Employment or Training), so music therapy is in this case a part of an already established program with predefined goals. The study follows an action research model, where the participants’ evaluations are used in the planning of the practice, and the changes the student makes based on the evaluations are given special attention. The results shows several shifts in the student’s methodological and theoretical perspective, leading to a discussion about terms as participation, freedom and relation, in addition to focusing on the consequences of having a practice with mandatory attendance. In order to understand the practice and its development, several theories are used, including Hannah Arendt’s definition of human action, the Bildung tradition, sociomusicology and music therapy theory. The thesis concludes with reflections about whether music therapy should be targeted towards the especially interested, or if the discipline should look towards areas of practice where the clients are not necessarily gathered because of their interest in music...|$|R

The teacher took both students to the Principal's Office where they met with Assistant Vice Principal Theodore Choplick. In a search of <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.'s</b> purse, Choplick observed a pack of cigarettes, and while removing the cigarettes he noticed a package of rolling papers, often {{closely tied to the}} use of marijuana. Choplick then began a more thorough search for the evidence of drugs, which revealed a small amount of marijuana, a pipe, empty plastic bags, a large quantity of money in $1 bills, an index card that appeared to list students who owed <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.</b> money, and two letters that implicated <b>T.</b> <b>L.</b> <b>O.</b> in being a drug dealer.|$|R
