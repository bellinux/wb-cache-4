40|$|Durum wheat {{is grown}} in the Mediterranean area where drought and high {{temperature}} frequently prevail and impact grain texture, composition and yield. The purpose of this work {{was to examine the}} effect of high temperature on grain development and final composition according to the timing of exposure. High temperature (up to 27. 5 °C) was applied either during the linear grain-filling or drying phases or during whole grain development. The dynamics of grain dry mass, water, glutenin polymers, and protein bodies during grain development were determined. Irrespective of high temperature timing, the arrest of grain filling was observed at 45. 9 % grain moisture content. At that point, starch granules included in endosperm cells reached their physical packing limit, limiting further deposits. HT applied before physiological maturity shortened the duration of grain filling and resulted in a significant increase in grain protein concentration and in the proportion of <b>vitreous</b> <b>grain.</b> Late formation of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) -insoluble glutenin polymers below 32 % grain moisture content was also favoured. The ability of wheat storage protein to form a viscoelastic matrix embedding starch granules at the beginning of grain desiccation is proposed to be mandatory for gaining vitreous grains and a high proportion of SDS-insoluble glutenin polymers...|$|E
30|$|The {{plot size}} was four rows of six plants with a 35 [*]×[*] 35  cm spacing. Mature seeds of each line were {{harvested}} 30  days after heading and dried in an electro-thermal incubator (ZXDP-A 2160, Shanghai) at 30  °C for 72  h after harvest. The dried seeds (20  g) were dehulled and polished, and then intact seeds {{were selected for}} measurement of chalkiness related traits. The ACE, DEC and PGWC were evaluated according to He et al. (1999) and National Standard of People Republic of China (NSPRC 1999). To separate chalky <b>grains</b> from <b>vitreous</b> <b>grains,</b> 40 grains selected at random per entry were assessed on a chalkiness scanner. PGWC was calculated based on these photographs. ACE and {{the area of the}} whole endosperm for each grain were estimated visually by the software, and the values for both were averaged. DEC was the ratio of ACE to the area of the whole endosperm.|$|R
40|$|Ultraweak {{luminescence}} (UWL) from mealy and <b>vitreous</b> wheat <b>grain</b> was investigated. Before {{the investigation}} the mealy and <b>vitreous</b> wheat <b>grains</b> were moistened {{in water for}} a period of 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. The grains were then dried to the mass they had before moistening. UWL measurements were made twice before and during imbibition of the grains. At the imbibition phase UWL was measured for 8 h. It was observed that UWL depended on the grain structure and the time of moistening. As moistened grain was of a more porous structure a higher UWL emission in the initial phase of imbibition was noted. Then UWL from the grains with a more porous structure quickly decayed. Finally after 8 h of imbibition UWL from moistened and not moistened grains was of similar intensity...|$|R
40|$|Durum wheat is a traditi onal cereal crop of the Mediterranean countries. Compared {{to common}} wheat its disti nguishing feature is almost {{exclusively}} used for human consumpti {{on in the}} form of semolina, pasta and couscous. In this context, demands of the durum wheat processing industries are of utmost importance and drive the agricultural practi ces. Industries target on fully <b>vitreous</b> <b>grains</b> of yellow-amber colour with high protein content. For the farmers, reaching durum grain quality standards mainly rely on appropriate crop management techniques and especially on ferti lizati on inputs. Durum wheat producti on is thus demanding and potenti ally could have high environmental impact in case of nitrogen leaching from soils. Submitt ed to several abioti c stresses, durum yield is in average low to medium compared to other crops. Unti l a couple of years ago, this was not a problem for the farmers from south of France. Indeed in the years 2000 ’s durum was marketed at a high price and farmers especially those from the south of France received fi nancial supports from the EU’s common agricultural policy (CAP). Compared to common wheat, the market price was so high that durum growing increase in central France, traditionally more focused on common wheat production. Because of milder climatic conditions higher yield were achieved compared to south France, while grain quality was secured by increasing nitrogen supplies. Since that ti me the landscape of durum production in France has profoundly changed. Starting from 2003 the automatic price support from CAP was cancelled and since 2008 emphasis has been placed on environmental concerns with an increasingly regulated use of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides. A direct consequence of these changes has been the progressive decline in durum-wheat growing lands by 20 % in EU- 27 over the past 10 years. In France between 2012 and 2014, the durum wheat land occupancy dropped by 33 % while production felt by 40 %. In order to reverse this trend before it threatened the economic position the French durum wheat sector, French public agronomic research institutes launched the “Plateforme Blé Dur” a brainstorming group gathering all the actors of the durum sector. During this presentation, the key strategic orientations adopted by the “Plateforme Blé Dur” and the recently launched research program “Dur-Dur” funded by the French National Research Agency in 2014 will be detailed. The objective of Dur-Dur is to deliver sustainable and innovative agronomic and technological solutions towards securing the French durum wheat sector, from the farmers to the end-users...|$|R
40|$|The new mineral species vapnikite, Ca 3 UO 6, {{was found}} in larnite pyrometamorphic rocks of the Hatrurim Formation at Jabel Harmun in the Judean desert, Palestinian Autonomy, Israel. Vapnikite is an {{analogue}} of the synthetic ordered double-perovskite β-Ca 3 UO 6 and is isostructural with the natural fluorperovskite – cryolite Na 3 AlF 6. Vapnikite Ca 3 UO 6 (P 21 /n,Z = 2, a = 5. 739 (1), b = 5. 951 (1), c = 8. 312 (1) Å, β = 90. 4 (1) °, V = 283. 9 (1) Å 3) forms yellow-brown xenomorphic grains with a strong <b>vitreous</b> lustre. Small <b>grains</b> up to 20 – 30 m m in size are wedged between larnite, brownmillerite and ye'elimite. Vapnikite has irregular fracture, cleavage and parting were not observed. The calculated density is 5. 322 g cm– 3, the microhardness is VHN 25 = 534 kg mm– 2 (mean of seven measurements) corresponding to the hardness of ~ 5 on the Mohs scale. The crystal structure of vapnikite Ca 3 UO 6 {{differs from that of}} its synthetic analogue β-Ca 3 UO 6 by having a larger degree of Ca, U disorder. Vapnikite formed at the high-temperature retrograde stage of pyrometamorphism when larnite rocks were altered by fluids/melts of high alkalinity...|$|R
