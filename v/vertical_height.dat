In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E

Since every player only has one button, the <b>vertical</b> <b>height</b> controls boost the ship vertically when the button is pressed and leaves the ship to slowly descend when unpressed.

The game was displayed at Gamma IV in San Francisco and at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. 4fourths was Michael Rose of IndieGame.com favorite game of the Gamma IV selections.

We determined the effects of 4 different warm-up protocols followed by 20 minutes of basketball activity on flexibility and <b>vertical</b> jump <b>height.</b> Subjects participated in 6 weeks (2 times per week) of warm-up and basketball activity. The warm-up groups participated in ballistic stretching, static stretching, sprinting, or basketball shooting (control group). We asked 3 questions.

Flexibility increased for the ballistic, static, and sprint groups compared to the control group (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), while <b>vertical</b> jump <b>height</b> did not change for any of the groups. Our second question was what is the acute effect of each warm-up on <b>vertical</b> jump <b>height?</b> We measured <b>vertical</b> jump immediately after the warm-up on 4 separate occasions during the 6 weeks (at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6). <b>Vertical</b> jump <b>height</b> was not different for any group.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare static and dynamic warm-up regimes on lower limb muscle power and thereby the perform-ance of the individual. Methodology: Twenty eight (28) {{subjects}} were assigned into groups consisting of 2 members. From each group, 1 subject performed the static stretching and the other subject performed dynamic stretching as warm-up. This was followed by non-counter movement jumps on a force platform and the <b>vertical</b> jump <b>heights</b> were recorded. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA and paired t-test at 0. 05 alpha. Result: The results showed that dynamic stretching as warm-up causes significant increase (p= 0. 01) in the <b>vertical</b> jump <b>height</b> as compared to static stretching (p= 0. 03). Discussion: The increase in <b>vertical</b> jump <b>height</b> could be related to the increase in force pro-duction which plays an important role during the vertical jump test. On the other hand the decrease in <b>vertical</b> jump <b>height</b> following static stretching could be attributed to a decrease in the force production in the muscles.
