40|$|Background: A {{rapidly growing}} {{subset of the}} world¡¯s elderly {{population}} lives in Bangladesh, where the population aged 60 years and above is projected to almost double in twenty years, from 8. 5 million in 2005 to 17. 8 million in 2025. The recognition of population ageing and an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases are factors that {{recognize the importance of}} quality of life as an outcome measure in health research. Aim: This thesis aims to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older people (¡Ý 60 years) living in rural communities in Bangladesh, focusing on their perception of HRQoL and the impact of demographic and socio-economic factors. Methods: This thesis combines qualitative and quantitative research methods. The qualitative data was obtained through interviews with eleven elderly men and women aged 63 - 86 years. The quantitative data was collected through a cross-sectional survey in Bangladesh and Vietnam. A multi-stage sampling method was used to select the study sample of elderly people (¡Ý 60 years). In Bangladesh (BD) the sample included 1, 031 elderly people and 870 elderly people in <b>Vietnam</b> (<b>VN).</b> A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to obtain data on HRQoL, demographic indicators, socio-economic status, self-reported health as well as social capital. Results: The findings demonstrated that {{there was a lack of}} suitable health-related quality of life instruments applicable for elderly people in rural Bangladesh. It was also found that in addition to commonly assessed dimensions of HRQoL (e. g., physical, psychological and social), the spiritual, financial and environmental dimensions are of importance for elderly people in rural Bangladesh. Qualitative data showed that having a role in the family and in the community and being functional both physically and economically was described to be of utmost importance for the elderly people¡¯s HRQoL. It was also found that low social capital on both individual- (OR: 1. 7; 95 % C. I. : 1. 2 - 2. 4) and community-levels (OR: 1. 9; 95 % C. I. : 1. 1 - 3. 3) was significantly associated with poor quality of life. Results showed that belonging to the oldest age group (¡Ý 75 years) (OR: 1. 7; 95 % C. I. : 1. 2 - 2. 5) and living in poor households (OR: 2. 5; 95 % C. I. : 1. 9 - 3. 3) were significant determinants of poor QoL. In addition, illiterate people were found to be more likely (OR: 1. 4; 95 % C. I. : 0. 9 - 2. 1) to report poor QoL than those with more than 5 years of education. Significant differences were found on all dimensions of HRQoL when comparing data from Bangladesh and Vietnam. Elderly people in Vietnam (median 63, range 30 - 86) reported significantly more favourable HRQoL outcomes compared to Bangladesh (median 62, range 40 - 89), reporting higher on all dimensions except spiritual and environmental. In terms of determinants of HRQoL, similarities were found between the two countries: advanced age, being a woman, belonging to poor households, and having a poor self-reported health status were significantly associated with poor HRQoL. Illiteracy was additionally found to be a significant determinant of poor HRQoL in Bangladesh. Conclusions: This study revealed the importance of culturally appropriate and multidimensional tools when assessing HRQoL among elderly people in rural Bangladesh. Among the elderly people, there are certain groups that are particularly vulnerable and to whom interventions to improve HRQoL should be directed. These are the oldest old, women, illiterate, belonging to poor households and those with a poor health status...|$|E
40|$|White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) {{is a large}} enveloped DNA {{virus that}} infects shrimp and other crustaceans. The virions are {{approximately}} 275 x 120 nm in size and have an ovoid to bacilliform shape and a tail-like appendage at one end. Sequencing revealed that the circular, double stranded (ds) DNA genome of WSSV ranges between 293 and 307 kb in size depending on the WSSV isolate. For a sequenced isolate originating from Thailand (WSSV-TH) 184 putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified on the genome, {{most of which are}} unassigned as they lack homology to known genes in public databases. Based on its unique morphological and genetic features, WSSV has been accommodated in the new virus family Nimaviridae (genus Whispovirus). WSSV causes serious economic losses in shrimp culture, as 100 % cumulative mortalities can be reached within 3 - 10 days under farming conditions. After its discovery in 1992 in Taiwan WSSV has quickly spread into Southeast-Asia and subsequently to shrimp farming areas all over the world. This thesis aims at obtaining fundamental insights in the genomic structure ("genomics") and transcription regulation ("transcriptomics") of WSSV. This in turn may provide better insight in the molecular basis of WSSV biology and epidemiology, which can be useful in the identification of targets for WSSV intervention strategies. Alignment of the complete genome sequences of the isolates WSSV-TW, WSSV-CN and WSSV-TH, originating from Taiwan, China and Thailand, respectively, revealed that the sequences were very similar (over 99 % sequence identity), suggesting that the isolates are variants of the same virus species (Whispovirus) and probably evolved recently from a common ancestor (Chapter 2). Two major polymorphic loci were identified, variable region (VR) ORF 14 / 15 and VR ORF 23 / 24, and both appeared to be genomic regions where large deletions occur. Further polymorphisms included loci with variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR loci). Next to VR ORF 14 / 15 and VR ORF 23 / 24, three of these loci, located in the regions coding for ORF 75, ORF 94 and ORF 125, were identified as useful markers in epidemiological and ecological studies. The highly conserved genomic loci, e. g. the gene encoding the major structural virion protein VP 26, are useful for reliable monitoring of WSSV infections in PCR based assays. The observation that the isolate WSSV-TH contains a large deletion in VR ORF 23 / 24 relative to the isolates WSSV-TW and WSSV-CN suggested the evolution and spread of WSSV from a common ancestor, provisionally located near the Southeast coast of China. Further support for this model was obtained by the genomic characterization of eight WSSV isolates collected in 2003 and 2004 along the central- and south-coast of <b>Vietnam</b> (<b>VN)</b> during WSSV outbreaks (Chapter 3). These WSSV-VN isolates contained deletions of intermediate size in VR ORF 23 / 24 relative to WSSV-TW and WSSV-TH. In VR ORF 14 / 15, the WSSV-VN isolates contained deletions of various sizes compared to WSSV-TH. These collective data suggest that the VN isolates and WSSV-TH have a common lineage, which branched off from WSSV-TW and WSSV-CN early on, and that WSSV possibly entered Vietnam by multiple introductions. Further comparisons among the WSSV-VN isolates revealed that the VNTR loci in ORF 75 and ORF 125, but not in ORF 94, are suitable markers to study local and regional spread of WSSV. To study the possible effect of the genetic differences on the fitness and virulence of WSSV, two divergent WSSV isolates (TH- 96 -II and WSSV-TH) were compared (Chapter 4). TH- 96 -II was a newly characterized archival WSSV isolate from 1996, which has the largest genome size (~ 312 kb) of all WSSV isolates identified thus far. As TH- 96 -II does not contain deletions in either VR ORF 14 / 15 or VR ORF 23 / 24, it may be ancestral to all known WSSV isolates. WSSV-TH contains the smallest genome (~ 293 kb) identified at present, due to large deletions in VR ORF 14 / 15 and VR ORF 23 / 24. Comparison between TH- 96 -II and WSSV-TH, when administered to shrimp Penaeus monodon, showed a higher virulence and competitive fitness for the latter. This may suggest that the virus became more virulent over the years during the epidemic while moving south. This enhanced virulence is possibly caused by the continuous contact with susceptible animals, a behavior also seen with some other emerging viruses. Since the more virulent variant (WSSV-TH) has a smaller genome, it may replicate faster to reach a lethal dose. However, {{it is also possible that}} the observed differences in virulence are caused by other genetic polymorphisms between the two isolates. As WSSV differs profoundly from other large ds DNA viruses and mainly contains unique genes, the mechanism of gene expression and transcription regulation of this new virus was investigated in the second part of this thesis. To study WSSV gene expression on a genome wide scale, a WSSV DNA microarray was constructed containing probes corresponding to nearly all putative WSSV ORFs (Chapter 5). Using a WSSV infection time course we could show expression of at least 79 % of the WSSV ORFs included on the microarray in gill tissue of Penaeus monodon. Clustering of the transcription profiles of the individual genes showed the presence of two major classes of genes, a putative early and a putative late class, suggesting that the WSSV genes at large are expressed in a coordinated and cascaded fashion. Five genes encoding WSSV major virion proteins (VP 28, VP 26, VP 24, VP 19 en VP 15), which clustered in the late class, were further confirmed to be late by RT-PCR (Chapter 6). Furthermore, the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the mRNA of these late genes were determined for identification of common promoter motifs. To search for common conserved WSSV promoter motifs associated with WSSV early or late gene expression, as determined by the microarrays, two in silico methods were employed (Chapter 7). The abundance of all 4 through 8 nucleotide motifs in the upstream sequences of WSSV genes relative to the complete genome was determined and the upstream sequences of early or late WSSV genes were analyzed for conserved sequences motifs using MEME. Both methods were complemented by alignments of empirically determined 5 ' ends of various WSSV mRNAs. The collective information shows that the upstream region of WSSV early genes, containing a TATA box and an initiator sequence, is reminiscent to Drosophila RNA polymerase II promoters, suggesting utilization of the cellular transcription machinery for generating early transcripts. The alignment of the 5 ' ends of known late genes, including the 5 ' ends determined in chapter 6, identified a degenerate consensus late transcription initiation motif (ATNAC). Of these genes, only one contained a functional TATA box. However, almost half of the WSSV late genes, as assigned by microarrays, did contain a TATA box in their upstream region. This may suggest the presence of two separate classes of late WSSV genes, one exploiting the cellular RNA polymerase II system for mRNA synthesis and the other generating messengers by a new virus-induced transcription mechanism. Alignments of the 3 ' ends of various WSSV mRNAs suggest that there is no difference in polyadenylation between early and late mRNAs. The WSSV polyadenylation characteristics of both classes resemble regular polyadenylation in eukaryotic mRNAs, which is typically located 10 to 25 nt downstream of the sequence AATAAA. In conclusion, the research performed for this thesis has led to a model on the mechanism of WSSV gene expression, and the promoter motifs involved (Chapter 8). The identification of genetic markers has led to more insight in the quick geographical spread of the virus, and the genetic characterization of WSSV isolates may add to the identification of virulence related factors on the WSSV genome. The fundamental insights obtained in the biology and epidemiology of WSSV in this thesis may help in the identification of WSSV genes which can be targets for WSSV intervention strategies...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the Vietnamese side of the Vietnam War. Though this war {{is one of the}} wars best documented, {{literature}} about the Vietnamese side is much less in comparison with that about the American side. In the war, inherited from the long history of national defence and influenced by Marxism-Leninism on war and army, North Vietnam applied the Vietnamese strategy of people's war. calling all Vietnamese people to participate in national effort to fight against American aggression. The North Vietnam's military strategy was not consistent with the basic principles of the laws of war as it did not distinguish combatants from non-combatants. This strategy put civilian population at risk. However, the thesis demonstrates through original archive and interview based research how the People's Army of <b>Vietnam</b> (PA <b>VN)</b> was not unrestrained. It had its own rules of engagement in fighting as well as in everyday contact with civilian, in order to minimize civilian casualties and protect civilian lives and assets. Also, PAVN paid great attention to winning and maintaining support of civilian as this support was crucial for its own existence as well as its war fighting capability. One implication of studying the North Vietnam's way of war is that North Vietnam's war against America was not immoral. It also has implications on the debate about the morality of American war in Vietnam and reflection to the American's current counterinsurgency doctrine - the Petraeus Doctrine.
