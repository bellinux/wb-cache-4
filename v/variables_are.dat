5|$|Initially, {{there is}} no choice point, and all <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> unassigned.|$|E
5|$|<b>Variables</b> <b>are</b> {{assigned}} {{using an}} equals sign, but compared using two consecutive equals signs.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> {{stars that}} {{experience}} sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events. This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and flare stars, {{as well as}} giant and supergiant stars.|$|E
30|$|Continuous <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> {{assessed}} for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Parametric continuous <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> compared between groups using the t test; nonparametric <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> compared using the Mann–Whitney test. Categorical <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> compared between groups using the Chi-squared test.|$|R
30|$|If {{one or more}} <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> not {{significant}}, {{the less}} significant <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> eliminated. The model was then simplified, and the procedure was repeated until all <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> maintained.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, in a formula, a {{dependent}} <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> a <b>variable</b> that <b>is</b> implicitly {{a function of}} another (or several other) variables. An independent <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> a <b>variable</b> that <b>is</b> not dependent.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began {{a series}} of studies of {{globular}} clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae variables in the clusters (which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause both of whose <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> already set, {{in a way that}} falsifies the clause, then the {{algorithm}} backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remaining}} case, each clause is either guaranteed to become true {{no matter how}} {{the remaining}} <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> assigned, or neither of its two variables has been assigned yet. In this case the algorithm creates a new choice point and sets any one of the unassigned variables to an arbitrarily chosen value.|$|E
30|$|In the {{analysis}} of seasonal distribution, the primary predictor <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> the date of injury, and the primary outcome <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> the number of fracture patients. In {{the analysis}} of fracture cause, the primary predictor <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> the cause of fracture, and the primary outcome <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> the region of fracture. In {{the analysis of}} postoperative complications, the primary predictor <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> sex, age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol intoxication, day of the week, beginning/middle/end of the month, time from injury to treatment, duration of admission, fracture site, and fracture cause; the primary outcome <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> the occurrence of postoperative complication.|$|R
30|$|Quantitative <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> {{expressed}} as mean (standard deviation) if the <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> normally distributed (as assessed graphically and {{by using the}} Shapiro–Wilk test) and as median (interquartile range) if not. Qualitative <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> {{expressed as}} frequencies and percentages.|$|R
50|$|A set {{of random}} <b>variables</b> <b>is</b> {{pairwise}} independent if {{and only if}} every pair of random <b>variables</b> <b>is</b> independent. Even if the set of random <b>variables</b> <b>is</b> pairwise independent, it is not necessarily mutually independent as defined next.|$|R
5|$|Perl {{also takes}} {{features}} from shell programming. All <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> marked with leading sigils, which allow variables to be interpolated directly into strings. However, unlike the shell, Perl uses sigils on all accesses to variables, and unlike most other programming languages that use sigils, the sigil doesn't denote {{the type of}} the variable but the type of the expression. So for example, to access a list of values in a hash, the sigil for an array ("@") is used, not the sigil for a hash ("%").|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei <b>variables,</b> <b>are</b> unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, the CC-VSC {{needs to be}} {{connected}} to a reference voltage Ũ_g. Its output current is Ĩ and the terminal voltage is Ũ_PCC. In this system, the reference <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> Ũ_g, the independent <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> Ĩ, and the dependent <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> Ũ_PCC. For a traditional voltage- source-based system, the independent <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> the terminal voltage of the voltage source, and the dependent <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> its output current. This is a basic difference, and it is also the foundation of the subsequent definition of current angle.|$|R
40|$| <b>Variables</b> <b>were</b> {{analyzed}} by analysis of variance. None of <b>variables</b> <b>was</b> affected (Pa 0. 01) by zeranol implants. |$|R
50|$|In an experiment, the {{dependent}} <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> the event expected to change when the independent <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> manipulated.|$|R
5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|Eclipsing <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> star {{systems that}} vary in {{brightness}} {{because of one}} star passing {{in front of the}} other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
3000|$|The {{baseline}} {{characteristics of the}} patients and outcome <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> compared between the two groups.

30|$|The {{predictor}} <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> time (T 0 and T 1). The primary outcome <b>variable</b> <b>was</b> teeth position. It {{was analyzed}} {{at both the}} beginning (T 0) and end (T 1) of the study. The secondary outcome <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> the following: the clinical findings; root formation; width of pericoronal radiolucency; bone coverage; and histopathological analysis of the collected follicles. Other <b>variables</b> studied <b>were</b> age and sex. The assessments of clinical and histopathological outcome <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> performed {{only at the end}} (T 1) as described in the following sections.|$|R
30|$|Continuous {{normally}} distributed <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> {{reported as}} mean[*]±[*]standard deviation, while not normally distributed <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> reported as median and range.|$|R
5|$|PHP 5 {{introduced}} {{private and}} protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes, final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that}} of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E
25|$|Local <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> {{created as}} the point of {{execution}} passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> called {{at the end of}} the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed RAII, which is widely used in C++.|$|E
25|$|To {{describe}} a set with {{an infinite number}} of solutions, typically some of the <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> designated as free (or independent, or as parameters), meaning that they are allowed to take any value, while the remaining <b>variables</b> <b>are</b> dependent on the values of the free variables.|$|E
50|$|ExampleIf the {{variance}} inflation factor of a predictor <b>variable</b> <b>were</b> 5.27 (√5.27 = 2.3) {{this means that the}} standard error for the coefficient of that predictor <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> 2.3 times as large as it would be if that predictor <b>variable</b> <b>were</b> uncorrelated with the other predictor variables.|$|R
