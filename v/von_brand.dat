The overall prevalence of B 19 IgG in the hemophilia patients was 74 % (133 / 180), and in the controls 56. 5 % (226 / 400, P< 0. 001). The significant difference in prevalence of B 19 IgG between hemophiliacs and healthy persons demonstrated that there was a high risk of transmission of parvovirus B 19 through plasma- derived clotting products.

We have examined the relationships between total alcohol intake and type of alcoholic beverage and several potential biological mechanisms. We carried out the study in 3158 men aged 60 - 79 years drawn from general practices in 24 British towns with no history of myocardial infarction, stroke or diabetes and who were not on warfarin. Total alcohol consumption showed a significant positive dose-response relationship with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), coagulation factor IX, haematocrit, blood viscosity, and tissue plasminogen (t-PA) antigen, and an inverse dose-response relationship with insulin, fibrinogen, <b>von</b> Wille- <b>brand</b> factor (vWF) and triglycerides after adjustment for possible confounders. Total alcohol consumption showed weak associations with plasma viscosity and fibrin D-dimer, and no association with factors VII,VIII, or C-reactive protein (CRP). Wine was specifically associated with lower CRP, plasma viscosity, factor VIII and triglycerides. The {{findings are consistent with}} the suggestion that HDL-C in particular but also insulin and haemostatic factors may contribute to the beneficial effect of light {{to moderate}} drinking on risk of CHD.

Therefore, to elucidate phenotype/genotype correlation among the above-mentioned conditions in del 22 q 11. 2 syndrome patients and hemizygosity of the GpIbβ gene, we performed platelet function tests and gene analysis in such patients.

Also, del 22 q 11. 2 syndrome patients with a decreased number of platelets had abnormal platelet function as seen in BSS patients, commonly had a distal breakpoint in deletion size confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, had no homozygous point mutation or deletion as seen in BSS patients and frequently suffered from psychiatric disorders. These findings suggest that half the amount of GpIbβ in del 22 q 11. 2 syndrome patients compared to normal may lead to a decrease in platelets and functional abnormalities and that psychiatric disorders should be considered in del 22 q 11. 2 syndrome patients with a decreased number of platelets...|$|R

40|$|The e>:periments {{described}} in this thesis were performed in order to clarify the mechanism of efflux of cellular cholesterol, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport. It is not known which factors influence the rate of transfer of cholesterol from cells to HDL. Rate limiting steps are important steps in the efflux process and may give more insight into the mechanism of the efflux of cellular cholesterol. Possible rate limiting steps are the cholesteryl ester hydrolysis and subsequent transport of cholesterol to the plasma membrane, the desorption of cholesterol from the membrane, the binding of HDL to the membrane or {{the composition of the}} HDL particles. The major pan of the experiments {{described in}} this thesis were performed with human endothelial cells (EAhy 926 cell line). These cells are hybrids of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with lung carcinoma cells (A 549 line) and show many characteristics of differentiated endothelial cells, e. g., the expression of <b>von</b> Wille <b>brand</b> factor, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activtor inhibitor-type 1, and the production of prostacyclin. In addition, the cells formed confluent monolayers with contact-inhibition of cell growth. For obvious reasons (see section 1. 6) we choose to measure only net mass transfer of cholesterol from the cells and first developed a method to enrich the cells with cholesterol using cationized LDL (see chapter 2). Subsequently, we studied the efflux of cholesterol from loaded EAhy 926 cells by different plasma lipoproteins, and the effects of the plasma enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, as described in chapters 3 and 4. In chapter 5 the effect of HDL binding on HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux was studied using modifications of HDL with tetranitromethane and dimethyl suberimidate. The effect of cell membrane phospholipid composition on HDL binding and cholesterol efflux is described in chapter 6. All these experiments were carried out with ultracentrifugally isolated HDL or HDL,. HDL is a heterogeneous population of lipoprotein particles and HDL subfractions with distinct apolipoprotein compositions can be isolated from plasma with immune-affinity columns. The different apolipoprotein composition of these HDL subfractions are expected to be important for the interaction with possible plasma membrane HDL binding proteins and may therefore clarify the role of HDL binding in the efflux of cellular cholesterol. Chapter 7 and 8 contain a description of our investigations of the role of different immunopurified HDL subfractions in the efflux of cellular cholesterol from various cell types {{as well as in the}} uptake of HDL hy hepatocytes...|$|R

40|$|The pre-antibiotic era was characterised by {{the lack}} of {{antibiotics}} and hence, the lack of adequate means for the treatment of numerous infectious diseases. The ground-breaking discovery of penicillin and other antibiotics, which came to be widely used in clinical practice, brought great benefit and contributed to the increase of the average human life expectancy from 47 years in 1900 to 74 years (in men) and 80 years (in women) in 2000 in the USA (Lederberg 2000). Furthermore, in 1941 Skinner and Keefer reported a shocking 82 % mortality among 122 consecutive patients who had been treated for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia before antibiotics were available (Skinner and Keefer 1941), as contrasted to 20 - 40 % mortality rates being reported in the post-antibiotic era (Mylotte, McDermott et al. 1987; Shurland, Zhan et al. 2007). The use of antimicrobials is not limited to clinical applications. Currently antimicrobials, such as, for example, chitosan based products, triclosan and various bacteriocins, are widely used in hand washing products, toothpastes and in the food industry to increase the shelf life of various products (Stephen, Saxton et al. 1990; Waaler, Rolla et al. 1993; Barkvoll and Rolla 1994; Bhargava and Leonard 1996; Gould 1996; Jones, Jampani et al. 2000; Haas, Marie et al. 2005; Galvez 2007; Dutta, Tripathi et al. 2009). By comparison to chemical disinfectants, these natural products are generally less toxic and also provide great advantages, such as biodegradability, biocompatibility as well as chemical and physical versatility (Gould 1996; Dutta, Tripathi et al. 2009). Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases historically remains the main focus of antimicrobial research. Ever since the discovery of penicillin there have been many attempts to find novel antimicrobials due to the inevitability of development of bacterial resistance towards the widely used antibiotics. In the past years much of the effort in that direction was focused on terrestrial sources. Nowadays, more than ever before, the exploration of new and under-explored sources becomes extremely important in the process of finding biologically active compounds (“bioactives”) with novel chemical structures. The majority of antibiotics currently used in clinical practice are of natural product origin (Newman, Cragg et al. 2003; Singh and Barrett 2006; <b>Von</b> Nussbaum, <b>Brands</b> et al. 2006). For example, 70 out of the 90 antibiotics marketed in the years 1982 – 2002 originated from natural products (Newman, Cragg et al. 2003). Notably, the quinolones or fluoroqinones, {{one of the most successful}} classes of synthetic antibiotics, are also based on the structure of the natural product quinine (Demain and Sanchez 2009) (Figure 1). In fact, chemical modifications based on a natural product scaffold is a widely used approach in modifying the chemical and physical properties of the molecule, thus making it useful for a particular pharmacological application (Walters, Murcko et al. 1999; Leeson, Davis et al. 2004). It has been suggested that the success of natural compounds is due to the fact that they have undergone natural selection and, therefore, are best suited to perform their activities (Nisbet and Moore 1997; Muller-Kuhrt 2003; Koehn and Carter 2005). Thus, further research on bioactive natural products may provide a source of new chemical structures that can guide the design of novel chemical compounds (Breinbauer, Vetter et al. 2003; Nicolaou, Chen et al. 2009), as well as reveal yet unknown modes of action (Urizar, Liverman et al. 2002). 32 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Calcareous corpuscles are a {{characteristic}} structure in cestodes, and {{are found in}} the juvenile and adult stages of various tapeworm species (Nieland and <b>von</b> <b>Brand,</b> 1969). Several suggestions have been made on possibilities about their functions, but their exact roles remain unclear. The main components of calcareous corpuscles are inorganic in nature, e. g., calcium and magnesium, and phosphates and carbonates (<b>von</b> <b>Brand</b> et al., 1960). The organic matrix of calcareous corpuscles is composed of carbohydrates, lipids, and relatively few proteins (<b>von</b> <b>Brand</b> and Nylen, 1970). In particular, the proteins are regarded as important components of the structural framework or to act as a substrate for mineral deposition (Nieland and <b>von</b> <b>Brand,</b> 1969). The presence of corpuscular proteins was first demonstrated in worm sections by histo-chemical staining (Chowdhury et al., 1955; <b>von</b> <b>Brand</b> et al., 1960), and purified corpuscles showed protein binding activities against crude extracts of Platyhelminthes (Yang, 2000).

40|$|Nutrient {{profiles}} in Southwest Pacific interstitial solutions {{suggest that in}} environments of oxic pelagic sedimentation microbially mediated nitrification is recognizable as a two-step process. During the first step partially oxidized nitrogenous intermediaries accumulate in distinctive ammonia and nitrite maxima along with nitrate. During the second step nitrification continues and all intermediate species are fully oxidized to nitrate. Both steps occur within a zone that corresponds in thickness to the biologically active surface layer. Similarly, experimental nitrogen regeneration from decomposition of plankton in seawater (<b>VON</b> <b>BRAND</b> and RAKESTRAW, 1941 : <b>VON</b> <b>BRAND</b> et al., 1942) suggests that each step corresponds to a distinct reaction in the microbially mediated transformation of N-org → NH 3 → NO 2 → NO 3. The resolution of distinct reaction zones in pore water nutrient profiles possibly depends on the nature and mode of supply of the organic matter undergoing nitrification or reflects the spatial succession downcore of microbial populations capable of deamination, ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation, respectively. Finally, stoichiometric ratios of nutrients in the free water column - here demonstrated on published data from Saanich Inlet - reflect the same two steps of nitrification as delineated by the dissolved pore water species. Future pore water studies should include dissolved oxygen measurements as well as accurate ∑CO 2, PO 4 and nitrogenous species profiles, to verify and better quantify these separate steps in nitrification mechanism of oxic pelagic sediments...|$|E
