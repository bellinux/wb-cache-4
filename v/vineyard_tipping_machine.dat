Currently it is highly competitive or end-user of metal workings fluid to reduce cost and improve productivity. Considering the high cost and problems associated with health and safety, it would be desirable if the use of cutting fluids be omitted. This study investigates the flank wear behavior of coated Titanium Carbonitride (TiCN) coated tools in dry and wet machining of T 6061 Aluminum alloy with the aim of obtaining the optimum cutting speed for dry and wet machining respectively. By using specific depths of cut 0. 2 and 0. 6 mm with feed rates of 0. 4 and 0. 8 mm/rev respectively, the wear was investigated for 3 different high cutting speeds; 290, 360 and 446 mm/min. Results of dry machining was compared with traditional wet machining process. The temperature of tool <b>tip,</b> <b>machining</b> time and tool wear were recorded. Wear rate of the tool increases with the increasing cutting speed and parameters for both dry and wet machining.

The measured α and A values specific to the <b>tip</b> and <b>machine</b> used can then be employed to accurately measure the elastic modulus of a third sample, assuming that the tip does not get significantly plastically deformed during the calibration procedure.

There has been a growing interest in using scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) as tools for nanofabrication. This dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s research is an attempt to utilize the principles of electric discharge machining (EDM) and electro chemical machining (ECM) to machine at nanoscale using the atomic force microscope (AFM). The experiments included machining an array of cavities using a single <b>tip,</b> <b>machining</b> of grooves, 2 D machining, micro machining, and studying the effect of electrostatic forces on machining. ^ The experiments setup included: A Multimode AFM as the machining platform, deionized water as the machining medium, samples made of copper and gold films, and conductive AFM probes used as the machining tools. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature and pressure. Each machining experiment was done by first scanning the sample in deionized water. One of four proposed methods was then chosen to set the desired gap distance prior machining. The voltage was then applied between the tip and the workpiece for the specified time. Finally, another scan was taken to the sample to reveal the topographical effects induced by the tip-to-substrate bias. ^ Machining a series of cavities using a single tip was achieved and the depths of the machined cavities ranged between 17 nm and 53 nm. A study was conducted to investigate the stability of the machined nano cavities. It was found that these features were stable within the 48 hours time frame of the experiment and scanning itself played a major role in features destruction. Nano-grooves as deep as 54 nm, as wide as 300 nm, and as long as 13 μm were successfully machined. The length of the groove was limited by the maximum scan size of the AFM scanner. There was a high consistency in the groove 2 ̆ 7 s width and depth across the groove. Mechanical scratching was found to be not involved in grooves machining. ^ Machining in deionized water led to uncertainty about the mechanism of the machining process. The most two probable mechanisms involved in the machining process were EDM and mechanical hammering due to the electrostatic forces. It is expected that the electro-machining process using the AFM can be extended to other conducting tool materials such as copper, cobalt and nickel, and to be capable of machining any electrically conductive material including hard and difficult-to-cut materials. ...|$|R

In this method, a nano-scale single crystal diamond (SCD) tool is produced by focused ion beam (FIB) machining. The nano SCD tool is then further applied to cut periodic nanostructures using single-point diamond turning (SPDT). A divergence compensation method and surface topography generation model forms a deterministic FIB fabrication approach. It has been used to generate four periods of the required periodic nano-grating structures (with a minimal dimension of 150 nm) on a normal SCD tool tip and achieves 10 nm form accuracy. The contribution of the beam tail effect has also been evaluated by using the surface topography simulation method. The fabricated diamond tool is then applied to obtain nano-grating on an electroless nickel substrate in a total area of 5 × 2 mm 2 through SPDT. The whole SPDT machine process only takes 2 min (with a material removal rate up to 1. 8 [*]×[*] 104 [*]μm 3 [*]s− 1). Due to the elastic recovery that occurred upon the workpiece material, the practical cutting width is 13 nm smaller than the tool <b>tip.</b> The <b>machining</b> trial shows it is very promising to apply this scale up nanofabrication approach for commercialization of nano-products which possess period nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|Modern era of mass {{production}} of holes with good surface finish and geometrical accuracy (cylindricity, roundness) {{is the basic}} requirement for precise assembly of different machined components. Even in today's industrial era, most of the machining operations are performed using flood lubrication but flood lubrication contributes to adverse health effect and safety issues, including toxicity, lung diseases to operator and air pollution, etc. Because of this mentioned issues the use of cutting fluid needs to be minimized and hence the Minimal Quantity Lubrication (MQL) technology was introduced. MQL is the process to apply minute amount of lubrication to the tool <b>tip</b> during <b>machining.</b> The lubricant is mixed with compressed air and forms aerosol mixture called as MQL. Conventional cutting fluids (flood lubrication) eliminate such problems as higher cutting temperature, tool wear and greater dimensional deviation. But, they possess {{a significant portion of}} the total machining cost. Thus machining under Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) condition has drawn the attention of researchers as an alternative to the traditionally used flood lubrication with a view to minimizing the cooling and lubricating cost as well as reducing cutting zone temperature, tool wear, surface roughness and dimensional deviation. It was observed that the use of MQL technology resulted in decrease of overall cost by about 13 % and it is possible to achieve effective lubrication of cutting process with extremely small quantity of oil. The result is not only high productivity but also longer tool life and cost saving...|$|R
40|$|High-aspect-ratio arrayed {{structures}} find {{application in}} the creation of deep blind holes used in ink-jet nozzles, air-bearings, etc. This paper focuses on the use of reverse micro-electric discharge machining (micro-EDM), to generate high-aspect-ratio micro-rod arrays. A micro-rod of 60 mu m in diameter and a high-aspect-ratio of 33 is successfully fabricated using the process. An L 8 orthogonal array is used to study the effect of gap voltage, capacitance, threshold, and feed rate on the process response variables. The measured process responses are dimensional accuracy (measured at various locations {{along the length of the}} micro-rod), zero error length, and surface roughness. Furthermore, the surface morphology and chemical composition at the root and tip of the generated structure are studied. Analysis of variance studies show that the statistically significant factors that influence response variables are the gap voltage and capacitance. The gap voltage is identified as the single most important factor governing the accuracy of the micro-rods at almost all locations. Analysis of surface morphology reveals that there are more craters at the <b>tip</b> of <b>machined</b> rods whereas, the area around the base is relatively smooth. Value of surface roughness varies from 1. 6 mu m Ra to 6. 3 mu m Ra under different experimental conditions. A variation in chemical composition is observed along the length of the rod. Plausible explanations are presented for the various phenomena observed during the reverse micro-EDM process...|$|R
