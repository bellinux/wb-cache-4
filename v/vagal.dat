5|$|The {{reactive}} feed-forward system {{refers to}} an incompletely understood system that induces renal potassium secretion in response to potassium ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma potassium. This is probably initiated by gut cell potassium receptors that detect ingested potassium and trigger <b>vagal</b> afferent signals to the pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron is {{a highly}} {{specific}} and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on <b>vagal</b> nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate <b>vagal</b> afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of <b>vagal</b> afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors.|$|E
25|$|The <b>vagal</b> and sacral {{neural crest}} cells develop into the ganglia of the enteric nervous {{system and the}} {{parasympathetic}} ganglia.|$|E
25|$|Increases in <b>vagal</b> {{activities}} to the SA node decreases the firing {{rate of the}} pacemaker cells by decreasing {{the slope of the}} pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, <b>vagal</b> activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the firing rate. Similar electrophysiological effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse conduction velocity through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of <b>vagal</b> tone on the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} mature insulin is packaged inside mature granules {{waiting for}} metabolic signals (such as leucine, arginine, glucose and mannose) and <b>vagal</b> nerve stimulation to be exocytosed from the cell into the circulation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also some}} <b>vagal</b> {{innervation}} of the atrial muscle, {{and to a}} much lesser extent, the ventricular muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in atrial contractility (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in ventricular contractility.|$|E
25|$|The 5-HT3 receptors {{are present}} in several {{critical}} sites involved in emesis, including <b>vagal</b> afferents, the solitary tract nucleus (STN), and the area postrema itself. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate <b>vagal</b> afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists suppress vomiting and nausea by inhibiting serotonin binding to the 5-HT3 receptors. The highest concentration of 5-HT3 receptors in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) are found in the STN and chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and 5-HT3 antagonists may also suppress vomiting and nausea by acting at these sites. The 5-HT3 antagonists are greatly selective and have little affinity for other receptors, such as dopamine, histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{intestinal}} phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food {{fills the}} duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits <b>vagal</b> nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.|$|E
25|$|Digoxin, which {{decreases}} conduction {{of electrical}} impulses through the AV node and increases <b>vagal</b> activity via its central {{action on the}} central nervous system, via indirect action, leads {{to an increase in}} acetylcholine production, stimulating M2 receptors on AV node leading to an overall decrease in speed of conduction.|$|E
25|$|Muscarinic {{receptor}} antagonists bind to muscarinic receptors thereby preventing ACh from binding to and activating the receptor. By {{blocking the}} actions of ACh, muscarinic receptor antagonists very effectively block the effects of <b>vagal</b> nerve activity on the heart. By doing so, they increase heart rate and conduction velocity.|$|E
25|$|Patients who {{experience}} frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities {{as well as}} chronic pain in the abdomen. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, ileus, intussusception, hypoganglionosis, and encopresis in children {{have been associated with}} porphyrias. This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system and <b>vagal</b> nerve dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin and {{synthetic}} ghrelin mimetics (growth hormone secretagogues) increase body weight and fat mass by triggering receptors in the arcuate nucleus {{that include the}} orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons. Ghrelin-responsiveness of these neurons is both leptin- and insulin-sensitive. Ghrelin reduces the mechanosensitivity of gastric <b>vagal</b> afferents, so they are less sensitive to gastric distension.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscientific {{studies are}} {{examining}} the physiological underpinnings of observable attachment style, such as <b>vagal</b> tone which influences capacities for intimacy, stress response which influences threat reactivity (Lupien, McEwan, Gunnar & Heim, 2009), {{as well as}} neuroendocrinology such as oxytocin,. These types of studies underscore the fact that attachment is an embodied capacity not only a cognitive one.|$|E
25|$|The vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that {{innervate}} {{the heart}} release acetylcholine (ACh) {{as their primary}} neurotransmitter. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (M2) that are found principally on cells comprising the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to the Gi-protein; therefore, <b>vagal</b> activation decreases cAMP. Gi-protein activation also leads to the activation of KACh channels that increase potassium efflux and hyperpolarizes the cells.|$|E
25|$|The diving reflex {{is used in}} {{clinical}} practice {{as a means to}} treat supraventricular tachycardia. This {{is an example of a}} <b>vagal</b> maneuver, whereby the vagus nerve is stimulated in order to block the atrioventricular node, which interrupts the abnormal electrical circuit taking place in a supraventricular tachycardia. This is especially useful in infants in whom the diving reflex is well-preserved, allowing the valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage to be more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Neurogenic shock {{is caused}} by the loss of {{vascular}} tone normally supported by the sympathetic nervous system due to injury to the central nervous system especially spinal cord injury. Rupture of a hollow organ, with subsequent evacuation of contents in the peritoneal cavity could also determine neurogenic shock, a subtype of distributive shock. This happens due to the widespread peritoneal irritation by the ruptured viscus contents, as in peptic ulcer perforation, with consequent strong <b>vagal</b> activation, and generalized, extensive peripheral vasodilation and bradycardia.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart rate}} is rhythmically {{generated}} by the sinoatrial node. It is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata. The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, <b>vagal</b> stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine is an {{antagonist}} at {{all four}} adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies. The affinity (KD) values of caffeine {{for the human}} adenosine receptors are 12μM at A1, 2.4μM at A2A, 13μM at A2B, and 80μM at A3. Knockout mouse studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A2A receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine. Antagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine stimulates the medullary <b>vagal,</b> vasomotor, and respiratory centers, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. Heart palpitations are caused by blockade of the A1 receptor.|$|E
25|$|A {{link between}} {{what we now know}} as the {{sympathetic}} system and the lung was shown in 1887 when Grossman showed that stimulation of cardiac accelerator nerves reversed muscarine induced airway constriction. In elegant experiments in the dog, where the sympathetic chain was cut {{at the level of the}} diaphragm, Jackson showed that there was no direct sympathetic innervation to the lung, but that bronchoconstriction was reversed by release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. An increased incidence of asthma has not been reported for adrenalectomized patients; those with a predisposition to asthma will have some protection from airway hyper-reactivity from their corticosteroid replacement therapy. Exercise induces progressive airway dilation in normal subjects that correlates with work load and is not prevented by beta blockade. The progressive dilation of the airway with increasing exercise is mediated by a progressive reduction in resting <b>vagal</b> tone. Beta blockade with propranolol causes a rebound in airway resistance after exercise in normal subjects over the same time course as the bronchoconstriction seen with exercise induced asthma. The reduction in airway resistance during exercise reduces the work of breathing.|$|E
25|$|Volvulus of {{the large}} colon usually occurs where the {{mesentery}} attaches to the body wall, but may also occur at the diaphragmatic or sternal flexures, with rotations up to 720 degrees reported. It is most commonly seen in postpartum mares, usually presents with severe signs of colic that are refractory to analgesic administration, and horses often lie in dorsal recumbency. Abdominal distention is common due to strangulation and rapid engorgement of the intestine with gas, which then can lead to dyspnea as the growing bowel pushes against the diaphragm and prevents normal ventilation. Additionally, compression can place pressure on the caudal vena cava, leading to pooling of blood and hypovolemia. However, horses {{may not have a}} high heart rate, presumably due to increased <b>vagal</b> tone. Rectal palpation will demonstrate a severely gas distended colon, and the examiner {{may not be able to}} push beyond the brim of the pelvis due to the obstruction. The colon may be irreversibly damaged in as little as 3–4 hours from the initial time of the volvulus, so immediate surgical correction is required. The surgeon works to correct the volvulus and then removes any damaged colon. 95% of the colon may be resected, but often the volvulus damages more than this amount, requiring euthanasia. Plasma lactate levels can help predict survival rates, with an increased survival seen in horses with a lactate below 6.0mmol/L. Prognosis is usually poor, with a survival rate of approximately 36% of horses with a 360 degree volvulus, and 74% of those with a 270 degree volvulus, and a reoccurrence rate of 5–50%. Complications post-surgery include hypoproteinemia, endotoxic shock, laminitis, and DIC.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vagal</b> paraganglioma: These are {{the least}} common {{of the head and}} neck paragangliomas. [...] They usually present as a painless neck mass, but may result in {{dysphagia}} and hoarseness.|$|E
2500|$|Neural crest cells {{originating}} from different positions along the anterior-posterior axis develop into various tissues. [...] These regions of neural crest {{can be divided}} into four main functional domains, which include the cranial neural crest, trunk neural crest, <b>vagal</b> and sacral neural crest, and cardiac neural crest.|$|E
2500|$|There is also {{evidence}} that digoxin increases <b>vagal</b> activity, thereby decreasing heart rate by slowing depolarization of pacemaker {{cells in the}} AV node. This negative chronotropic effect would therefore be synergistic with the direct effect on cardiac pacemaker cells. [...] Digoxin is used widely {{in the treatment of}} various arrhythmias.|$|E
2500|$|The {{receptor}} for ghrelin, the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), {{is found}} on the same cells in the brain as the receptor for leptin, the satiety hormone that has opposite effects from ghrelin. Ghrelin also {{plays an important role}} in regulating reward perception in dopamine neurons that link the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (a site that plays a role in processing sexual desire, reward, and reinforcement, and in developing addictions) through its [...] receptors and interaction with dopamine and acetylcholine. and both afferent and efferent <b>vagal</b> signals.|$|E
2500|$|In {{situations}} where direct pressure and elevation are either not possible or proving ineffective, {{and there is}} a risk of exsanguination, some training protocols advocate the use of pressure points to constrict the major artery that feeds the point of the bleed. [...] This is usually performed at a place where a pulse can be found, such as in the femoral artery. [...] There are significant risks involved in performing pressure point constriction, including necrosis of the area below the constriction, and most protocols give a maximum time for constriction (often around 10 minutes). [...] There is particularly high danger if constricting the carotid artery in the neck, as the brain is sensitive to hypoxia and brain damage can result within minutes of application of pressure. Pressure on the carotid artery can also cause <b>vagal</b> tone induced bradycardia, which can eventually stop the heart. Other dangers in use of a constricting method include rhabdomyolysis, which is a buildup of toxins below the pressure point, which if released back into the main bloodstream may cause renal failure.|$|E
2500|$|The braincase {{is where}} Protoavis {{comes close to}} being as avian as Chatterjee has maintained. The otic capsule is {{allegedly}} organized in avian fashion, with three distinct foramina arranged as such: fenestra ovalis, fenestra pseudorotunda, and the caudal tympanic recess, with a bony metotic strut positioned between the fenestra pseudorotunda and caudal tympanic recess. The claim that the full complement of tympanic recesses seen in ornithurines, are similarly observed in Protoavis is questionable, as {{the preservation of the}} braincase is not adequate to permit concrete observations on the matter. [...] Chatterjee omits in his 1987 account of the braincase, the presence of a substantial post-temporal fenestra, which in all Aves (including Archaeopteryx), is reduced or absent altogether, and the lack of a pneumatic sinus on the paroccipital. Furthermore, the braincase possesses multiple characters symplesiomorphic of Coelurosauria, including an expanded cerebellar [...] auricular fossa, and a <b>vagal</b> canal opening into the occiput. What is preserved of the preorbital skull curiously lacks apomorphic characters to be expected in a specimen, which is allegedly more closely allied to Pygostylia than is Archaeopteryx lithographica. [...] Most telling is the complete absence of accessory fenestrae in the antorbital fossa, leading to maxillary sinuses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vagal</b> tone {{cannot be}} {{directly}} measured. Instead, other biological processes are measured {{that represent the}} functionality of <b>vagal</b> tone. An increase in <b>vagal</b> tone both slows the heart and makes heart rate more variable (i.e. there is more beat-to-beat change between heart beats).|$|E
50|$|The hepatic {{branches}} of anterior <b>vagal</b> trunk are {{branches of}} the anterior <b>vagal</b> trunk which supply the liver.|$|E
50|$|Wandering {{pacemaker}} {{is usually}} caused by varying <b>vagal</b> tone. With increased <b>vagal</b> tone the SA Node slows, allowing a pacemaker in the atria or AV Nodal area, which may briefly become slightly faster. After <b>vagal</b> tone decreases, the SA Node assumes its natural pace.|$|E

50|$|Note: These <b>vagal</b> fibers in the esophageal plexus {{reform to}} make the {{anterior}} <b>vagal</b> trunk (left vagus) and the posterior <b>vagal</b> trunk (right vagus). Anterior and posterior being terms {{in relation to the}} esophagus, a mnemonic for which is 'LARP': Left becomes Anterior, Right becomes Posterior.|$|E
50|$|Under resting conditions, <b>vagal</b> tone {{prevails}} {{and variations}} in heart period are largely dependent on <b>vagal</b> modulation. The <b>vagal</b> and sympathetic activity constantly interact. Because the sinus node {{is rich in}} acetylcholinesterase, the effect of any <b>vagal</b> impulse is brief because the acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed. Parasympathetic influences exceed sympathetic effects probably through two independent mechanisms: (1) a cholinergically induced reduction of norepinephrine released in response to sympathetic activity and (2) a cholinergic attenuation of the response to an adrenergic stimulus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vagal</b> nerve stimulation: {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} that <b>vagal</b> nerve stimulation may induce bradycardia or cardiac arrest, and may exacerbate sleep apnoea common in people with epilepsy.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of psychophysiological research, <b>vagal</b> tone (and {{specifically}} its influence on heart rate) represents an index for the functional state of the entire parasympathetic nervous system. Heart rate is normally controlled by multiple centers in the brainstem; one of these centers, the nucleus ambiguus, increases parasympathetic nervous system input to the heart via the vagus nerve. <b>Vagal</b> tone decreases heart rate by inhibiting the firing rate of the sinoatrial node (S-A node, the usual natural pacemaker tissue of the heart). The absolute level of cardiac <b>vagal</b> activity or <b>vagal</b> tone appears to result from the excitatory drive from peripheral baroreceptors. In animals, cardiac <b>vagal</b> activity disappears at very low pressures or if the afferent nerves are cut. [...] Thus, {{a major determinant of}} resting heart rate is the beat to beat activation of the arterial baroreflex with each cardiac cycle.Cardiac <b>vagal</b> tone has been treated as a physiologic substrate of regulation of emotion and arousal.|$|E
50|$|The dorsal {{nucleus of}} the vagus nerve (or {{posterior}} motor nucleus of vagus) is a cranial nerve nucleus for the vagus nerve in the medulla that lies ventral {{to the floor of}} the fourth ventricle.
