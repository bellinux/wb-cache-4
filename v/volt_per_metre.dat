50|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the {{electric field}} is the local gradient of the electric potential.

50|$|The {{ionization}} {{process in}} the mid-stratosphere causes this region to become an electrical conductor, a process that blocks the production of further electromagnetic signals and causes the field strength to saturate at about 50,000 <b>volts</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre.</b> The strength of the E1 pulse depends upon the number and intensity of the gamma rays and upon the rapidity of the gamma ray burst. Strength is also somewhat dependent upon altitude.|$|R

40|$|The {{electron}} energy distribution functions (EEDFs) for electropositive Ar and electronegative SiH 4 discharges {{have been studied}} {{by means of a}} one-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo (1 D PIC/MC) model and have been compared under the same discharge conditions (frequency, power and pressure). The shape of the EEDF at the plasma centre in the hr discharges varies strongly with discharge conditions: at 13. 56 MHz and 30 mTorr it is bi-Maxwellian, at 65 MHz and 30 mTorr it is Maxwellian and at 13. 56 MHz and 400 mTorr it is Druyvesteyn like. The EEDF in SiH 4 discharges, on the other hand, has {{more or less the same}} shape under the different conditions, with a strongly populated high-energy tail. This difference is attributed to the significantly different effect of the bulk field on the tail: for the Ar case the field is weak (several tens of <b>volts</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre)</b> and for the SiH 4 case the field is strong (several hundred <b>volts</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre).</b> As a result of the strong bulk field in phase with the cathode sheath field, the non-local behaviour of the EEDF in the SiH 4 discharge partly results in an EEDF with the most significant tail appearing at a position closer to the anode pre-sheath, in addition the EEDF with a strongly populated tail occurs in the middle of the plasma as in the Ar case. Consequently, electronegative discharges are more non-local than electropositive discharges under the same working conditions...|$|R

40|$|The Marco Polo {{mission has}} been {{selected}} by the European Space Agency (ESA) {{as a candidate for}} launch under the Cosmic Vision programme in - 2017. The mission ultimately aims to understand the origins of the planets and even life itself, by returning a sample of material from a primitive asteroid, representative of the early Solar System. Particles {{on the surface of the}} asteroid are readily charged by photoelectric emission. Preliminary calculations suggest that photoelectric fields of tens of <b>volts</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> are expected, and electrostatic transport, levitation, and even complete ejection from the asteroid's gravitational field seem likely for typical particles at the proposed candidate asteroids. The electrical and charged particle environment at the asteroid surface is therefore expected to be significant for sample selection and characterisation. The Asteroid Charge Experiment (ACE), comprising an electric field sensor to detect charged dust particles, and an electron spectrometer to measure both photoelectrons and electrons from the solar wind, is described here. ACE will also be able to determine the relative electrostatic potentials of the spacecraft and asteroid surface, which will quantify the electrical effects of the sampling process itself on the asteroid environment...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review and}} {{evaluate}} the recent literature on {{the health effects of}} exposure to mobile phone base station (MPBS) radiation. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomized human trials conducted in laboratory settings and of epidemiological studies that investigated the health effects of MPBS radiation in the everyday environment. FINDINGS: We included in the analysis 17 articles that met our basic quality criteria: 5 randomized human laboratory trials and 12 epidemiological studies. The majority of the papers (14) examined self-reported non-specific symptoms of ill-health. Most of the randomized trials did not detect any association between MPBS radiation and the development of acute symptoms during or shortly after exposure. The sporadically observed associations did not show a consistent pattern with regard to symptoms or types of exposure. We also found that the more sophisticated the exposure assessment, the less likely it was that an effect would be reported. Studies on health effects other than non-specific symptoms and studies on MPBS exposure in children were scarce. CONCLUSION: The evidence for a missing relationship between MPBS exposure up to 10 <b>volts</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> and acute symptom development can be considered strong because it is based on randomized, blinded human laboratory trials. At present, there is insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about health effects from long-term low-level exposure typically occurring in the everyday environmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the CGR 4 {{lightning}} sensor is based on several observed characteristics of the electric field changes caused by nearby lightning, and the radiofrequency noise bursts from lightning. The electric field signals from lightning are detected by a simple aerial, and processed {{by a combination of}} analogue and digital circuitry under microprocessor control to determine if there is a nearby lightning flash, and, if so, to assign the type of flash as negative ground flash (NGF), positive ground flash (PGF), or cloud flash (CF). These types have distinctive features in their electric field change waveforms, enabling an assignment of type of lightning to be made by obtaining several measures of the waveform characteristics and applying an appropriate set of rules. A method of estimating the sensor’s effective range and area has been developed using data for a set of nearby lightning events. This involves the recording of the variation of electric field with time, the response of a lightning sensor, and the distance to the lightning flash using thunder ranging. As the sensor is able to apply different threshold overall field changes for each type of lightning detected, a single effective range of 11. 3 km (effective area 400 km 2) for all types of lightning was achieved by using threshold field changes of 520 <b>volts</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> (V/m) for CF, 760 V/m for NGF, and 1200 V/m for PGF. The sensor responds to about 90 per cent of all flashes at 8 km, about 40 per cent at 11 km, and approaching zero above 16 km...|$|R

Measurements of point discharge currents down {{the trunk of a}} tree indicate that these are somewhat lower than those through a single point of corresponding height in similar conditions. The results are compared with those of previous workers and discrepancies are attributed to wind speed and wind direction effects, whilst good agreement is found between the present findings and the theoretical work of Chalmers and Mapleson (1955) and Chapman (1956). A reassessment of the Alti-Electrograph results of Simpson and scrase (1937) is made and suggests that the potential gradients measured by this means immediately below thunderclouds are of the earns order of magnitude as those measured by observers in aircraft (Gunnl 953) ...|$|R
