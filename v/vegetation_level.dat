50|$|Dependent {{on local}} climate, which is {{affected}} by the distance to the sea, the exposition and the latitude (from 23°N to 25°S), the altitude varies from 500 m to 4000 m above sea level. Typically, there is a relatively small band of altitude in which the atmospheric environment is suitable for cloud forest development. This is characterized by persistent fog at the <b>vegetation</b> <b>level,</b> resulting in the reduction of direct sunlight and thus of evapotranspiration. Within cloud forests, much of the moisture available to plants arrives in the form of fog drip, where fog condenses on tree leaves and then drips onto the ground below.|$|E

Of the twelve lakes studied, seven {{are in the}} montane <b>vegetation</b> <b>level</b> (600 – 1400 m), and five are subalpine (1400 – 2200 m). At each lake, species diversity and abundance was measured by taking 10 samples along the shore, for each parameter. In addition to recording of molluscs, I measured 12 environmental factors, namely, altitude, water temperature, shading, water pH, conductivity, oxygen saturation, biological oxygen demand after 5 days (BOD 5), nitrate concentration, total hardness, mean grain size of the bottom substrate, and percentage of submerged vegetation and algal cover, at each sample site. I then used multivariate statistical analysis, specifically Canonical Correspondence Analysis, to detect any relationships between these physico-chemical factors {{and the distribution of}} molluscs. The study detected a total of 13 mollusc, 8 gastropod and 5 bivalve species in the lakes, with lakes at the montane <b>vegetation</b> <b>level</b> generally exhibiting higher species diversities than lakes at the subalpine <b>vegetation</b> <b>level.</b> Pisidium casertanum, Galba truncatula, P. subtruncatum, and Radix balthica exhibited the highest species abundance, while Acroloxus lacustris and Musculium lacustre, both typical of lower altitudes, were very rare. Multivariate analysis revealed an important influence of shading, altitude, nitrate, BOD 5, oxygen saturation, substrate grain-size and submerged vegetation on the distribution patterns of most mollusc species. In contrast, the distribution patterns of P. subtruncatum and P. obtusale were highly independent of the measured environmental factors...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{soils are}} more durable than almost all {{man-made}} materials. Evapotranspiration (ET) covers use vegetated soil layers to store water {{until it is}} either evaporated from the soil surface or transpired through vegetation. ET covers rely on the water storage capacity of soil layer, rather than low permeability materials, to minimize percolation. While the use of ET covers in landfills increased over the last decade, they were mainly used in arid or semi-arid regions. At present, the use of ET covers has not been thoroughly investigated in humid areas. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the use of ET covers in humid areas where there is an annual precipitation of more than 800  mm. Numerical analyses were carried out to investigate the influences of cover thickness, soil type, <b>vegetation</b> <b>level</b> and distribution of precipitation on performance of ET covers. Performance and applicability of capillary barriers and a new-type cover were analyzed. The results show that percolation decreases with an increasing cover thickness and an increasing <b>vegetation</b> <b>level,</b> but the increasing trend becomes unclear when certain thickness or LAI (leaf area index) is reached. Cover soil with a large capability of water storage is recommended to minimize percolation. ET covers are significantly influenced by distribution of precipitation and are more effective in areas where rainy season coincides with hot season. Capillary barriers are more efficient than monolithic covers. The new cover is better than the monolithic cover in performance and the final percolation is only 0. 5 % of the annual precipitation...|$|E

30|$|These {{results can}} be {{explained}} by a peculiar characteristic of cloud forests: the presence of constant fog at the <b>vegetation</b> <b>level</b> (Aldrich et al. [1997]). It is known that in cloud forests of the Mantiqueira Mountains, Brazil, the fog occurs for about 65 to 90 % of the days (Eller et al. [2013]). At the level of 2100  m altitude, the environment presented a higher relative humidity than at 1900  m (Table  2) and the fog was possibly the most responsible factor for this increase, due to the frequency of its occurrence in cloud forests. Thus, despite the higher radiation levels at 2100  m altitude, the fog could act as a barrier against the direct penetration of solar beams in D. brasiliensis leaves at this altitude level, which would minimize the actual radiation falling upon the leaves and, in a way, it would reduce the need of protection performed by the cuticle.|$|E

Based on this principle, ground-based thermal remote sensing {{has become one of}} the most important methods for estimating evapotranspiration and drought stress and for irrigation. This paper reviews its application in agriculture. The review consists of four parts. First, the basics of thermal remote sensing are briefly reviewed. Second, the theoretical relation between Ts and the sensible and latent heat flux is elaborated. A modelling approach was used to evaluate the effect of weather conditions and leaf or vegetation properties on leaf and canopy temperature. Ts increases with increasing air temperature and incoming radiation and with decreasing wind speed and relative humidity. At the leaf level, the leaf angle and leaf dimension have a large influence on Ts; at the <b>vegetation</b> <b>level,</b> Ts is strongly impacted by the roughness length. In the third part, an overview of the different ground-based thermal remote sensing techniques and approaches used to estimate drought stress or evapotranspiration in agriculture is provided.

The theoretical models are used to evaluate the performance and sensitivity of the most important methods, corroborating the literature data.

A percentage succulence was also calculated for both species richness and cover. Comparisons of life form spectra and succulence were made across the eight vegetation associations found in the area and across three broad vegetation groups, i. e., Mountain Renosterveld, Winter Rainfall Karoo and Tanqua Karoo. Mountain Renosterveld vegetation was characterised by high chamaephyte, cryptophyte and therophyte species contributions. Compared to the other broad vegetation groups, the Mountain Renosterveld group showed phanerophyte contributions at the <b>vegetation</b> cover <b>level</b> to be highest, but the degree of succulence was low. Winter Rainfall Karoo vegetation was co-dominated by high levels of chamaephyte, cryptophyte and therophyte species with chamaephytes dominating the vegetation cover. Succulent contributions to species richness and cover values were higher than for Mountain Renosterveld vegetation. Tanqua Karoo vegetation was dominated by chamaephyte species or co-dominated by chamaephyte and cryptophyte species with therophyte species contributions lowest of all vegetation groups. Contributions by succulent species to richness and vegetation cover were high in the Tanqua Karoo. Life form spectra of the Mountain Renosterveld associations compared poorly to other sites in the Fynbos Biome.

In the present studies, a PAE was sought in vitro and in vivo for penicillin G plus gentamicin versus Enterococcus faecalis. The studies demonstrated that increasing concentrations of gentamicin caused an increased rate of bactericidal action and an increasingly prolonged PAE in vitro. The combination of penicillin and gentamicin, in addition to more rapid killing, exhibited a more prolonged PAE than did penicillin alone. However, unlike these in vitro findings, no PAE could be demonstrated in vivo in rats with experimental left-sided enterococcal endocarditis treated with penicillin plus gentamicin. This suggests that antibiotic <b>vegetation</b> <b>levels</b> should be maintained above the MIC throughout the dosing interval to prevent loss of efficacy as a result of bacterial regrowth...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of ceftazidime, administered in {{a dose of}} 100 mg/kg intramuscularly, into cardiac vegetations and subcutaneously implanted fibrin clots was compared in rabbits with experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Significant pharmacokinetic differences between the time-concentration curves for the two compartments were observed. Concentrations of ceftazidime in vegetations peaked at 30 min after dosing at a level slightly lower than that in plasma and thereafter declined in parallel with concentrations in plasma throughout the 8 -h sampling period. Concentrations in fibrin clots increased more slowly than those in plasma and vegetations, reaching a maximum at 120 min. This {{was followed by a}} slow elimination phase yielding concentrations in excess of concurrent plasma and <b>vegetation</b> <b>levels</b> and a greater area under the curve. These features were observed for both large (2 -ml volume) and small (0. 1 -ml volume) clots. Contrary to previous reports, these observations suggest that fibrin clots do not provide an accurate model for predicting antibiotic concentrations in cardiac vegetations produced in endocarditis and that concentrations of antimicrobial agents in vegetations can be predicted more accurately from concomitant plasma levels...|$|R
40|$|The Cao Lan are a Tai-speaking {{ethnic group}} {{living in the}} Midlands of Northern Vietnam. Homegardens are an {{important}} component of their agroecosystem. The ecological structures of each homegarden of 17 households of the Cao Ngoi village in Tuyen Quang province were described and modal patterns identified. Most homegardens have organically shaped planting areas with indeterminate boundaries, polycentric planting patterns, and contain multiple species within the same bed or planting area. All of the gardens have multiple <b>vegetation</b> <b>levels,</b> with the largest share having 5 levels and a majority having more than 50 % of their planting area covered by overlapping vegetation layers. Biodiversity is high with a total of 113 species recorded. Most plant species are used for food, but smaller numbers have ornamental, medicinal, and construction uses or are used for animal fodder, as stimulants, or for other purposes. Comparison of the modal structure of the Cao Lan homegardens with several Tai minority groups in Northeast Thailand, shows that, although the Cao Lan have been geographically isolated from other Tai groups for many centuries, thei...|$|R
