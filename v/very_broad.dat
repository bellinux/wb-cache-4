They are also known to eat freshwater crayfish and slugs, and other frogs, {{even of the}} same species. They have a strong tendency for cannibalism, and frequently these in the same enclosure devour each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown cannibalism also occurs in the wild.|$|E
5|$|A frontal trough moved eastward off {{the southeastern}} United States on September30, {{becoming}} stationary north of Haiti. The trough developed {{an area of}} disturbed weather that interacted with an upper-level low pressure area, resulting {{in the development of}} a subtropical depression on October7. Upon formation, the system consisted of a <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> subtropical low, as well as a poorly defined surface circulation. As the subtropical depression drifted westward, it became further organized. By midday on October8, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the subtropical depression intensified and acquired enough tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center named the storm Josephine.|$|E
5|$|The French tanks had heavier armour and {{armament}} {{than the}} Panzers. The Panzer IV had 30mm of armour, while the Hotchkiss had 45mm, and the Char B1 had 60mm of protection. Moreover, its main armament, one 47mm and one 75mm gun, outmatched all the German tanks. In {{an open field}} engagement, Guderian's armour stood little chance. Two-thirds of his units were equipped with Panzer I and IIs. Just 30 of the Panzer IVs were on his order of battle. However, one crucial disadvantage of the French tanks, considered as a <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> whole, was their low endurance. They needed refuelling after just two hours. They were also slow in speed, complicating high tempo operations.|$|E

5|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} {{long and}} made up {{nearly half of the}} body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500kilograms (3,300lb).|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Midwestern cities its age, Dayton has <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> and {{straight}} downtown streets (generally {{two or three}} full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning; streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around. In addition, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E

Thus, it referred to economic or industrial sabotage in the <b>very</b> <b>broadest</b> sense. The definition of sabotage was interpreted dialectically and indirectly, so any form of non-compliance with Party directives could have been considered a 'sabotage'.|$|R
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators {{throughout}} their global distribution, and {{can have a}} profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species. Their diet is <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.|$|E
5|$|Late on July29, the JTWC {{estimated}} that Komen attained peak 1minute sustained winds of 75km/h (45mph), based on estimates from satellite imagery. As the storm approached Bangladesh, the circulation remained <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> {{with most of}} the convection in the southern periphery, although radar imagery from the coast indicated there was a formative eye feature in the storm's center. At 06:00UTC on July30, the IMD estimated peak 3minute winds of 75km/h (45mph). Between 14:0015:00UTC that day, Komen made landfall on Bangladesh just west of Chittagong, and the JTWC discontinued advisories once the storm was ashore. Komen quickly weakened as it turned to the northwest through Bangladesh, steered by a ridge over Tibet to the north. On July31, the system crossed into the Indian state of West Bengal as a weakened depression. The track shifted to the west-southwest until Komen weakened into a remnant low on August2 over Jharkhand.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of {{the neck}} had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs {{of the last four}} back vertebrae were fused to them, and the ribcage was <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> {{in this part of the}} body. The ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The caudal vertebrae of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) of the caudal vertebrae formed a U-shape when seen from above, instead of the more usual V-shape.|$|E

In the narrowest usage, as a New Orleans City Planning neighborhood, Uptown refers to an area of only some dozen blocks centering on the intersection of Jefferson and St. Charles Avenues. Neither of these is what most New Orleanians of recent generations usually mean by uptown. While some may quibble about the exact boundaries, Uptown broadly refers to the areas of the city closer to the River (river side of South Claiborne Avenue) and upriver from the Pontchartrain Expressway and the modern CBD/Warehouse District neighborhood.|$|R
5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the northwest, and intensified into Tropical Storm Grace six hours after forming. Despite the increase in winds the center of circulation remained <b>very</b> <b>broad,</b> with Reconnaissance Aircraft having difficulty pinpointing the center. In addition, an upper level low located over Brownsville, Texas produced shear over the western portion of the system, which limited outflow to the east side. Forecasters predicted the upper level low to weaken, allowing {{for the possibility of}} Grace to intensify to a 65mph (100km/h) tropical storm over warm waters. However, the upper level low remained in place and continued to produce shear across the system. A new center of circulation reformed 115miles (185km) north of the original center, and made landfall near San Luis Pass on the southwestern portion of Galveston Island on August 31 as a minimal tropical storm. Grace quickly weakened to a tropical depression over land, and after turning northeastward into Oklahoma the depression was absorbed by a cold front.|$|E

The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} January, a broad low persisted {{south of}} the Chagos archipelago, {{becoming}} a tropical disturbance on January30 about 650km (400mi) south of Diego Garcia. The convection gradually organized as the system moved to the south-southwest, steered by {{a break in the}} ridge to the south caused by the remnants of Cyclone Charly. Initially the circulation was <b>very</b> <b>broad,</b> and due to its involvement with the monsoon, it resembled a monsoon depression. Early on February1, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression while turning more to the south. Around that time, it passed about 500km (310mi) east of Rodrigues. The system became extratropical on February3, after increased wind shear weakened the convection. The former depression intensified as an extratropical storm, attaining gale force winds while accelerating its forward motion due to an approaching trough. The system was no longer tracked after February6 as it approached the polar latitudes.|$|E

5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the dorsal side of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal {{side of the body}} is a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Gordon {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, which developed a circulation north of Panama early on November6. It gradually organized, becoming Tropical Depression Twelve on November8 offshore eastern Nicaragua. Proximity to land prevented strengthening, and early on November10 it made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough turned the depression to the northeast, and late on November10 it intensified into Tropical Storm Gordon after reaching open waters. The circulation of the cyclone was initially <b>very</b> <b>broad,</b> covering much of the western Caribbean Sea, and wind shear prevented significant strengthening. Early on November 13, Gordon struck Jamaica near Kingston as a minimal tropical storm, and later that day made landfall near Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Around the time of Gordon crossing Jamaica, an upper-level trough spawned a low-level disturbance over the central Bahamas. From surface synoptic reports, the National Hurricane Center estimates Tropical Storm Gordon rapidly crossed Cuba and became the dominant system between Cuba and the Bahamas, but other meteorologists believe Gordon dissipated and that a second cyclone became the dominant system. The resultant storm north of Cuba became much larger, spreading rain across much of Florida.|$|E
5|$|The scapula (shoulder blade) {{was longer}} than the humerus (upper arm bone); its blade was slender and narrow, and {{slightly}} twisted, following the contour of the ribs. The scapula did not expand at the upper end but was very expanded at the base. The coracoid was mainly thin and plate-like. The humerus had a slender shaft, was slightly twisted along its length, and was slightly bowed. The deltopectoral crest (where the deltoid and pectoral muscles attach) was weakly developed. The ends of the ulna were expanded, and ridges extended along the shaft. The radius was more robust than the ulna, which is unusual. When seen from above, the pelvic girdle was <b>very</b> <b>broad</b> for a bipedal archosaur, and became wider towards the hind part. The broadness of the pelvic region may have accommodated a rear extension of the gut. The ilium was elongated and the ischium was long and slender. Though the pubis is not known, it was probably reduced in size like that of Homalocephale. The femur (thigh bone) was slender and inwards curved, the tibia was slender and twisted, and the fibula was slender and wide at the upper end. The metatarsus of the foot {{appears to have been}} narrow, and the single known ungual (claw bone) of a toe was slender and slightly curved. Though the limbs of Stegoceras are not completely known, other pachycephalosaurs show that they had five-fingered hands and four toes.|$|E
