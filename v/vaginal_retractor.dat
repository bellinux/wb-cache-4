25|$|According to Burou, the {{operation}} {{began with an}} incision from the anal area through the scrotal raphe. After dissecting of the bulbus urethrae and both corpora cavernosa, the rectum and the prostate were separated by cutting all the ligaments between the bulb and the rectum. Burou {{made a point of}} barring, but not damaging, the posterior aspect of the prostate so that the penile skin flap after invagination would immediately overlie this aspect, which he felt optimized the possibility of postoperative orgasm. The separation was extended digitally and was considered complete as soon as two fingers or a <b>vaginal</b> <b>retractor</b> could be admitted easily. Burou considered this first part of {{the operation}} to be the most important, but most risky, and stressed the importance of repeated intrarectal inspection to determine that there was no lesion to the rectal wall.|$|E
30|$|Video content: The video {{shows the}} {{intraoperative}} setup, the instruments used, {{the position of}} the surgical team, the specially designed <b>vaginal</b> <b>retractor</b> and the surgical technique we used as a standard for the prospective study described above. Especially the posterior dissection to the levator any muscle where the posterior mesh was attached and the anterior sub-vesical dissection where the anterior mesh was attached are well illustrated. The video also shows the technique of laparoscopic suturing in the deep pelvis or the promontory as all fixations were performed with laparoscopic sutures, without using any tackers or staplers.|$|E
30|$|In both groups, a sacrospinous colpopexy was {{performed}} as previously described [11]. Briefly, a midline incision {{was performed}} in the posterior vaginal wall starting from the hymenal ring to the vault to expose the rectovaginal space. The vaginal skin was dissected laterally to expose the pararectal fat. Using the index finger, a window was created between the rectovaginal space and the ischial spine through the right rectal pillar to expose the sacrospinous ligament. A Miya hook ligature carrier was used to insert a triple No. 0 delayed absorbable polydioxanone suture (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) into the right sacrospinous ligament 2  cm medial to the ischial spine. The rectum was retracted medially using a Breisky–Navratil <b>vaginal</b> <b>retractor,</b> and the sutures were retrieved using a nerve hook. Pulley sutures were created using a no. 4 Mayo needle to ensure good contact between the vaginal skin and the sacrospinous ligament when the sutures were tied. The rectovaginal fascia was plicated in continuity with the perineum, and the vaginal incision was closed as previously described [12]. The PDS sutures were tied, pulling the vault to the sacrospinous ligament. A concomitant TVT-O™ (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) procedure was performed using a separate incision for patients with urodynamic stress urinary incontinence. Postoperatively, a vaginal pack was placed for 24  h, and a Foley catheter was kept in situ for 24  h. All participants received a preoperative intravenous antibiotic (cefuroxime 1  g) and low-molecular weight heparin as antithrombotic prophylaxis which we routinely give to all patients who underwent pelvic surgery according to the guidelines in our hospital. All procedures were performed under regional or general anaesthesia.|$|E
50|$|Cusco's self {{retaining}} bivalved speculum is {{a surgical}} instrument used for vaginal and cervical examination. It has a jaw which opens {{up like a}} duck bill. It comes in three models : side scew, centre screw and in special narrow virgin size. The Cusco's speculum is usually 80mm long and 22 mm broad. However, smaller and larger sizes are available. Cusco's speculum is used for introducing an intrauterine contraceptive device, taking a Pap smear, cauterization of vaginal erosion and for colposcopic examination. It is preferred in cryosurgery because it protects the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. The advantage of Cusco's speculum {{is that it is}} self-retaining. Therefore, an assistant's help is not needed to keep the speculum in place. It also acts as the <b>vaginal</b> wall <b>retractor.</b> However, it reduces the space in the vaginal cavity and therefore is not a preferred instrument for vaginal surgery. Since it covers most of the vaginal wall, small lesions on the vaginal wall may be masked by the blades of the device.|$|R
