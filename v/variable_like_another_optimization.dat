Somehow, level of dependence and stress along with other psychological <b>variables</b> <b>like</b> anxiety and depression play key roles in smoking in the hospital premises. Methodology: Present study aimed to know the level of dependence and other psychological <b>variables</b> <b>like</b> depression, anxiety, and stress in the caregivers of patients of casualty and outpatients departments. Seventy five participants were recruited purposively from the hospital premises. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) - Hindi were administered. Result: Participants reported nicotine dependence was associated with psychological <b>variables</b> <b>like</b> mild to moderate level of depression, anxiety, and stress. Caregivers of casualty patients were having high level of stress than caregivers of outpatients. Conclusion: It can be concluded that psychological variables {{play a significant role in}} nicotine dependence...|$|R
