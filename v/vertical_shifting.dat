40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{thermodynamic}} {{approach is}} presented to model coupled fluid transport, heat transfer, long-term deformation and damage in polymeric materials. The well-known Gibbs free energy is expressed as a functional of stress, temperature and fluid concentration with damage being introduced as an internal state variable. Constitutive equations for nonlinear viscoelastic materials in hygrothermal environments are derived in memory functional forms. The kinetics of damage evolution induced by stress, temperature and fluid is described by a damage function with thermodynamic driving force. Governing equations for mass and heat transfer are obtained from transport laws relating fluid and heat fluxes to gradients of chemical potential difference and temperature. A superposition principle of time, temperature, fluid concentration, stress, and aging is proposed so that long-term property functions may be derived from momentary master curves by horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>shifting.</b> The approach provides a theoretical framework for evaluating long-term behavior of polymeric materials in hygrothermal environments from short-term experiments...|$|E

The proposed algorithm is intended for imaging modalities depicting primarily morphology of objects i. e. tumors, bones, cysts and lesions that are characterized by translation, scaling and rotation. An efficient deterministic algorithm is used in order to decouple these effects by transforming images into the log-polar Fourier domain. Then, the correlation coefficient function criterion is employed and the corresponding values of scaling and rotation are detected. Due to the non-linearity of the correlation coefficient function criterion and the heavy computational effort required for its full enumeration, this optimization problem is solved using an efficient simulated annealing algorithm. After the images alignment in scaling and rotation, the simulated annealing algorithm is employed again, in order to detect the remaining values of the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>shifting.</b> The proposed algorithm was tested using different initialization schemes and resulted in fast convergence to the optimal solutions independently of the initial points...|$|E

40|$|The mesospheric OH Meinel {{emissions}} are subject of many theoretical and observational studies devoted {{to this part}} of the atmosphere. Depending on the initial vibrational level of excitation the altitude of the considered OH Meinel emission is systematically shifted, which has important implications for the intercomparison of different studies considering different transition bands. Previous model studies suggest that these <b>vertical</b> <b>shifts</b> are essentially caused by the process of collisional quenching with atomic oxygen. Following this hypothesis, a recent study found experimental evidence of a coherent seasonality at tropical latitudes between <b>vertical</b> <b>shifts</b> of different OH Meinel bands and changes in atomic oxygen concentrations. Despite the consistent finding of the above mentioned hypothesis, it cannot be excluded that the actual temporal variability of the <b>vertical</b> <b>shifts</b> between different OH Meinel bands may in addition be controlled or even dominated by other processes. It remains an open question whether the observed temporal evolution is indeed mainly controlled by the modulation of the collisional quenching process with atomic oxygen. By means of a sensitivity study which employs a quenching model to simulations made with the SD-WACCM 4 chemistry climate model, we aim at assessing this question. From this study we find that the observed seasonality of <b>vertical</b> OH Meinel <b>shifts</b> is only partially controlled by temporal changes in atomic oxygen concentrations, while molecular oxygen has another noticeable impact on the <b>vertical</b> OH Meinel <b>shifts.</b> This in particular becomes evident for the diurnal variability of <b>vertical</b> OH Meinel <b>shifts,</b> which reveal only a poor correlation with the atomic oxygen species. Furthermore, changes in the H + O 3 source gases provide another mechanism that can potentially affect the diurnal variability in addition. By comparison with limb radiance observations from the SABER/TIMED satellite this provides an explanation for the less evident diurnal response between changes in O concentrations and <b>vertical</b> OH Meinel <b>shifts.</b> On the other hand, at seasonal timescales the coherency between both quantities is again evident in SABER/TIMED but less pronounced compared to our model simulations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Synthetic biology may {{be viewed}} as an effort to establish, formalize, and develop an {{engineering}} discipline in the context of biological systems. The ability to tune the properties of individual components is central to the process of system design in all fields of engineering, and synthetic biology is no exception. A large and growing number of approaches have been developed for tuning the responses of cellular systems, and here we address specifically the issue of tuning the rate of response of a system: given a system where an input affects the rate of change of an output, how can the shape of the response curve be altered experimentally? This affects a system’s dynamics as well as its steady-state properties, both of which are critical in the design of systems in synthetic biology, particularly those with multiple components. We begin by reviewing a mathematical formulation that captures a broad class of biological response curves and use this to define a standard set of varieties of tuning: <b>vertical</b> <b>shifting,</b> horizontal scaling, and the like. We then survey the experimental literature, classifying the results into our defined categories, and organizing them by regulatory level: transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational...|$|E

We use i. i. d. potentials ξ: Z d → R in the third universality class, namely the class of almost bounded potentials, in the classification of van der Hofstad, König and Mörters [HKM 06]. This class consists of potentials whose logarithmic moment generating function is regularly varying with parameter γ = 1, but {{do not belong to}} the class of so-called double-exponentially distributed potentials studied by Gärtner and Molchanov [GM 98]. In [HKM 06] the asymptotics of the expected total mass was identified in terms of a variational problem that is closely connected to the well-known logarithmic Sobolev inequality and whose solution, unique up to spatial shifts, is a perfect parabola. In the present paper we show that those potentials whose shape (after appropriate <b>vertical</b> <b>shifting</b> and spatial rescaling) is away from that parabola contribute only negligibly to the total mass. The topology used is the strong L 1 -topology on compacts for the exponentials of the potential.

Changes in salinity are mainly controlled by seasonal conditions and by location with respect to fresh water influx. No clear differences between values obtained under A. germinans and R. mangle. In contrast, {{a significant difference between the}} two species is shown by the depth distribution of redox potentials which values are remarkably high under Avicennia stands, so highlighting the ability of Avicennia to oxidize the sediment thanks to its radial cable roots. This phenomenon takes place uniquely the organic content is low. Conversely, in the older stages of Avicennia mangrove forests, the oxygen released by roots is probably insufficient to produce the decay of the large quantity of available organic matter. The low Eh values associated with the high sulphide concentrations denote sulphate-reducing processes similar to those observed under R. mangle stands. Nevertheless, the <b>vertical</b> <b>shifting</b> of water table produced by climatic influences modifies these processes. These results demonstrate that the sulphur content depends on the decay processes, which in turn depend on both the vegetal species and the sedimentary organic content.

40|$|With the {{increase}} in structural applications of bio-based composites, the study of long-term creep behavior of these materials turns into a significant issue. Because of their bond type and structure, natural fibers and thermoset resins exhibit nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. Time-temperature superposition (TTS) provides a useful tool to overcome {{the challenge of the}} long time required to perform the tests. The TTS principle assumes that the effect of temperature and time are equivalent when considering the creep behavior, therefore creep tests performed at elevated temperatures may be converted to tests performed at longer times. In this study, flax fiber composites were processed with a novel liquid molding methacrylated epoxidized sucrose soyate (MESS) resin. Frequency scans of flax/MESS composites were obtained at different temperatures and storage modulus and loss modulus were recorded and the application of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>shift</b> factors to these viscoelastic functions were studied.

30|$|An {{impact of}} interplanetary (IP) shock or {{tangential}} discontinuity onto the magnetosphere, observed by ground magnetometers as storm sudden commencement (SC), is a convenient probing signal {{for the experimental}} study of near-Earth space. Most SC events are associated with IP shocks (Smith et al. 1986), and, therefore, we will use both terms interchangeably. During {{a relatively short time}} period (< 10  min), significant energy and momentum is pumped into the magnetosphere from the solar wind. Modelers often use a SC event to validate the numerical models of the solar wind–magnetosphere–ionosphere interaction (Fujita et al. 2003; Sun et al. 2015). Despite the simplicity of such an impact, the complexity of impulsive and quasiperiodic phenomena stimulated by an IP shock in the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) band (timescales from few seconds to tens of minutes) turns out to be surprisingly large. An observed response to an IP shock or discontinuity may be rather complicated due to the nearly simultaneous excitation of several transient processes. The IP shock is known to stimulate a global compression of the magnetosphere (Araki 1994), with excitation of transient field-aligned current systems (Fujita et al. 2005), generation of transient ULF waves in a wide frequency band from Pc 1 (Parkhomov 1990) to Pc 5 – 6 (Yumoto et al. 1994), triggering of VLF wave activity and enhancement of energetic electron precipitation (Gail et al. 1990), brightening of the dayside aurora (“shock aurora”) at auroral (Spann et al. 1998; Vorobiev et al. 2008) and sub-auroral (Liou et al. 2003) latitudes, sudden <b>vertical</b> <b>shifting</b> of the ionospheric plasma (Yumoto et al. 1989), prompt injection and energization up to MeV energies of magnetospheric particles (Blake et al. 1992), and triggering of a nightside “compression” magnetic bay or even a substorm (Lyons 1996; Liou et al. 2003). In addition, a SC pulse serves as an indicator of the onset of a more intense solar wind driving and buffeting the magnetosphere.|$|E

In the figure of the Discussion the creep curves have been vertically shifted, which gives the appearance of a better agreement with test data, but implies a very strong age-dependence of the associated (not the actual) elastic modulus E. By deleting the time range from 0. 01 day to 1 day, the associated values of liE have been obscured. In Fig. 7 the curves of the discussers are extended to 0. 01 day and the liE-values obtained by taking the strain at 0. 01 day are also plotted. It is claimed in the Discussion that the disagreement for loadings of duration of less than 1 day "is of no value to the engineering practice". However, this is not true. To be sure. for long-time structural creep effects the detailed shape of creep curves up to 1 day (Fig. 8). as well as the strain increment from 0. 01 day to 1 day, is indeed un~portant when the concrete is more than 7 days old at loading. For long-time predictions it does not matter much when only the short-tUne strain, liE, is arbitrarily distorted (see shifts a or b in Fig. 8, yielding curves 423 or 723).

We carried out the first measurements of spatial frequency (SF) tuning for judgments of eye gaze, and compared SF tuning for judgments of facial identity and eye gaze. In Experiment 1, participants discriminated between leftward and rightward shifts of gaze, or between two male faces or two female faces. Faces were masked with visual noise that blocked one of 10 SF bands. For each task and masking SF, we measured contrast thresholds for human observers, and used an ideal observer to measure the amount of visual information available to perform the task. As in previous research, low to mid SFs were most important for judgments of facial identity. Mid to high SFs were most important for judgments of eye gaze, and the highest SF important for these judgments was higher than that for identity. In Experiment 2, participants discriminated horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>shifts</b> of gaze.

40|$|Elastomers or {{rubber-like}} polymers {{are known}} to exhibit rich nonlinear and rate dependent mechanical response. When compounded with particulate fillers, their mechanical properties are reinforced and additional nonlinear effects such as the Payne effect (softening of the modulus with strain amplitude) and the Mullins effect (stress softening observed at large strains on subsequent deformation cycles) occur. It is generally assumed that elastomer response could be modeled as a sum of elastic (possibly with damage) and viscoelastic contributions. However, {{due to lack of}} a comprehensive experimental data set obtained for a single material, this constitutive assumption has not yet been critically examined for its ability to describe the full range of response features of this class of materials. To bridge that gap, an extensive set of linear and nonlinear mechanical experiments, including stress-strain behavior, stress relaxation and creep/recovery, was carried out on unfilled and carbon black (CB) filled lightly cross-linked Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR) under a wide range of temperatures and deformation rates. The key findings were: ^ Linear deformations: ^ (i) For unfilled systems ^ The linear viscoelastic response of a series of unfilled elastomers with varying degree of cross-linking was studied. Unexpectedly, to achieve time-temperature superposition (TTS) in the uncross-linked and lightly cross-linked SBR systems, a non-standard <b>vertical</b> <b>shifting</b> was required in a relatively narrow temperature region where the shift factor was not proportional to temperature in contrast to the predictions of standard elasticity theory. This unusual temperature dependence of the shear modulus disappeared with increase in degree of cross-linking in the unfilled SBR. In case of the Polybutadiene and EPDM elastomers the temperature dependence was observed to be standard. The anomalous behavior specific to SBR elastomers was explained {{on the basis of the}} formation of micro-heterogeneities (phenyl ring stacks). ^ (ii) Filled systems ^ With careful measurements in the linear viscoelastic regime of filled elastomers, TTS was demonstrated to be valid for filled elastomers which has until now been a controversial topic in the literature owing to insufficient sensitivity of dynamic measurements at very low strains. This was established for all types of CB with the exception of the highest structure/ highest surface area CB. From the TTS it was found that the glass transition behavior as manifested in the horizontal shift factor aT is not affected by the presence of filler. The departure of the temperature dependence of the modulus from the predictions of standard elasticity theory in a narrow temperature range was also observed for filled and lightly cross-linked SBR, where the deviation increased with filler structure/surface area. ^ Nonlinear deformations: ^ Nonlinear mechanical experiments, including stress-strain behavior, stress relaxation and creep/recovery were conducted on an unfilled lightly cross-linked SBR. The viscoelastic relaxation modulus obtained for the same material from the linear viscoelastic measurements was used to describe the behavior in the nonlinear regime for validating the class of the additive constitutive models. The limitations of the additive model were clearly revealed. Specifically, the rate dependence and the hysteresis could not be simultaneously described even under moderate deformations. This is a first demonstration that some essential physics is not captured by the additive model even for the unfilled elastomers. ^ However, this study was able to show that from an engineering perspective the additive model did provide a fair description of the nonlinear response at close to ambient temperatures usually encountered during the service life of rubber components. ...|$|E

Interestingly, although such functions have essential singularities, infinitely many of their zeros lie on the critical line. We also generalize some integral identities associated with the theta transformation formula and some formulae of G. H. Hardy and W. L. Ferrar {{in the context of}} a pair of functions reciprocal in Fourier cosine transform...|$|R
5000|$|The {{repetition}} of the major-thirds tuning enables notes and chords to be raised one octave by being vertically shifted by three strings. Notes and chords may be shifted diagonally in major-thirds tuning, by combining a <b>vertical</b> <b>shift</b> of one string with a horizontal shift of four frets: [...] "Like all regular tunings, chords in the majorthird tuning can be moved across the fretboard (ascending or descending a major third for eachstring)...." ...|$|R
