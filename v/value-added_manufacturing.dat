40|$|Although {{increasing}} globalizations spurred rapid industrialization in Malaysia, {{this article}} {{shows that the}} lack of significant technological upgrading and structural change has caused the premature plateauing of manufacturing, stemming from failures to coordinate policies, enforce standards, sustain high productivity growth and stimulate transition to higher <b>value-added</b> activities. <b>Manufacturing</b> as a whole has registered slow wage growth since the late 1990 s, with labour markets characterized by heavy presence of low-skilled foreign workers, increased contract labour and outsourcing and declining worker organization. The focus on perspiration-based low-skilled foreign labour rather than on expanding professional and skilled labour has driven Malaysia down the low industrialization road. The Malaysian experience reflects a case of manufacturing’s importance and direct contribution to the economy contracting before recording high levels of value added and sustained productivity growth, and with labour market practices constraining instead of facilitating positive change...|$|R

The Future Growth Scenario is aimed towards strengthening the economy internally and internationally by such factors as improvements in global transportation and developing manufacturing and service clusters.

The remarkable importance {{is known to}} be strongly associated with the development of service-oriented economy in the period in which China transfers the traditional equipment manufacturing industry to the service-oriented manufacturing.
