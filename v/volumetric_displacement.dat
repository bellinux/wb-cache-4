40|$|International audienceThe use of {{a finite}} {{elements}} based Digital Volume Correlation (FE-DVC) leads to lower measurement uncertainties in comparison to subset-based approaches.

To overcome this limitation, a PGD solver was recently applied to 2 D digital image correlation. In this paper, this method is extended to measure <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacements</b> from 3 D digital images. In addition, a multigrid PGD algorithm is developed, which allows to use different discretizations in each term of the decomposition. Associated to a coarse graining of the digital images, this allows to avoid local minima, especially in presence of large displacements. Synthetic and practical cases are analyzed with the present approach and measurement uncertainties are compared with standard FE-DVC. Results show that such an approach reduces the computational cost (when compared to FE-DVC) while maintaining lower measurement uncertainties than standard subset-based DVC...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Image-guided {{neurosurgery}} {{relies on}} accurate registration of the patient, the preoperative image series, and the surgical {{instruments in the}} same coordinate space. Recent clinical reports have documented the magnitude of gravity-induced brain deformation {{in the operating room}} and suggest these levels of tissue motion may compromise the integrity of such systems. We are investigating a model-based strategy which exploits the wealth of readily-available preoperative information in conjunction with intraoperatively acquired data to construct and drive a three dimensional (3 -D) computational model which estimates <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacements</b> in order to update the neuronavigational image set. Using model calculations, the preoperative image database can be deformed to generate a more accurate representation of the surgical focus during an operation. In this paper, we present a preliminary study of four patients that experienced substantial brain deformation from gravity and correlate cortical shift measurements with model predictions. Additionally, we illustrate our image deforming algorithm and demonstrate that preoperative image resolution is maintained. Results over the four cases show that the brain shifted, on average, 5. 7 mm in the direction of gravity and that model predictions could reduce this misregistration error to an average of 1. 2 mm.

This con-sists of two different numerical approaches capable of captur-ing the bubble dynamics at different scales depending upon the relative size of the bubbles compared to the grid resolution: (i) fully resolved simulations (FRS) wherein the bubble dynamics and deformation are completely resolved, and (ii) subgrid, dis-crete bubble model where the bubbles are not resolved by the computational grid. For fully resolved simulations, a novel ap-proach combining a particle-based, mesh-free technique with a finite-volume flow solver, is developed. The approach uses marker points around the interface and advects the signed dis-tance to the interface in a Lagrangian frame. Interpolation kernel based derivative calculations typical of particle methods are used to extract the interface normal and curvature from un-ordered marker points.

This study uses the previously developed comprehensive compressor model for the rotating spool compressor developed by Bradshaw and Groll (2013). Using this model a {{study of the}} influence of the compressor <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacement</b> is performed. This study relies on a set of scaling rules to determine the size of the compressor features as the compressor displacement changes. The study finds that as the <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacement</b> increases, the volumetric efficiency asymptotically increases. It is also found that there is an optimum in overall isentropic efficiency as the <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacement</b> increases which suggests a trade-off between sealing and port restrictions.

It is found that for a given eccentricity ratio, there exists an optimum aspect ratio that maximizes sealing. Additionally, the eccentricity ratio shows a high level of sensitivity to the overall performance of the compressor. As the eccentricity ratio decreases, the overall isentropic efficiency of the compressor increases until an eccentricity ratio of 0. 85.

Right ventricular (RV) longitudinal function is impaired {{in patients with}} free pulmonary regurgitation (PR) following corrective surgery for Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). It remains unclear {{whether this is a}} consequence of the surgical repair, or whether it is inherent to PR. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between longitudinal, lateral and septal pumping in a porcine model of isolated PR. Methods: Piglets were divided into a control (n = 8) group and a treatment (n = 12) group, which received a stent in the pulmonary valve orifice, inducing PR. After 2 - 3 months, animals were subjected to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A subset of animals (n = 6) then underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement (PPVR) with follow-up 1 month later. Longitudinal, lateral and septal contributions to stroke volume (SV) were quantified by measuring <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacements</b> from end-diastole to end-systole in the cardiac short axis and long axis. Results: PR resulted in a lower longitudinal contribution to RV stroke volume, compared to controls (60. 0 ± 2. 6 % vs. 73. 6 ± 3. 8 %; P = 0. 012). Furthermore, a compensatory increase in septal contribution to RVSV was observed (11. 0 ± 1. 6 % vs. - 3. 1 ± 1. 5 %; P < 0. 0001). The left ventricle (LV) showed counter-regulation with an increased longitudinal LVSV. Changes in RV longitudinal function were reversed by PPVR.

40|$|Faulting {{can result}} from either of two {{different}} mechanisms. These involve fundamentally different energetics. In elastic rebound, locked-in elastic strain energy is transformed into the earthquake (seismic waves plus work done in the fault zone). In force-driven faulting, the forces that create the stress on the fault supply work or energy to the faulting process. Half of this energy is transformed into the earthquake and half goes into an increase in locked-in elastic strain. In elastic rebound the locked-in elastic strain drives slip on the fault. In force-driven faulting it stops slip on the fault. Tectonic stress is reasonably attributed to gravity acting on topography and the Earth's lateral density variations. This includes the thermal convection that ultimately drives plate tectonics. Mechanical analysis has shown {{the intensity of the}} gravitational tectonic stress that is associated with the regional topography and lateral density variations that actually exist is comparable with the stress drops that are commonly associated with tectonic earthquakes; both are in the range of tens of bar to several hundred bar. The gravity collapse seismic mechanism assumes the fault fails and slips in direct response to the gravitational tectonic stress. Gravity collapse is an example of force-driven faulting. In the simplest case, energy that is released from the gravitational potential of the stress-causing topography and lateral density variations is equally split between the earthquake and the increase in locked-in elastic strain. The release of gravitational potential energy requires a change in the Earth's density distribution. Gravitational body forces are solely dependent on density so a change in the density distribution requires a change in the body forces. This implies the existence of <b>volumetric</b> body-force <b>displacements.</b> The <b>volumetric</b> body-force <b>displacements</b> are in addition to displacements generated by slip on the fault. They must exist if gravity participates in the energetics of the faulting process. From the perspective of gravitational tectonics, the gravity collapse mechanism is direct and simple.

This study tests whether the radial and brachial waveforms are influenced by changes in properties of the peripheral vasculature of the hand, such an influence potentially compromising central aortic pressure estimation. Design and method: In 15 subjects (37  ±  15 years, 7 female), brachial waveform acquired by <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacement</b> (cuff-based) and radial waveform acquired by tonometry were simultaneously measured whilst a cuff around the hand on the same arm was inflated to pressures of 30, 15, 0, - 15, - 30, - 60  mmHg with respect to mean arterial pressure to alter peripheral resistance and compliance. Aortic parameters were compared to measurements at baseline (no hand cuff pressure) using repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc, Bonferroni-corrected, paired t-tests. Results: Altering peripheral resistance and compliance significantly changed computed mean arterial pressure (MAP), aortic systolic pressure (aSP), pulse pressure (aPP), augmentation pressure (aAP), augmentation index (aAIx) and pulse pressure amplification (PPA) relative to baseline conditions when using tonometric radial waveforms (Table, describing maximum change). Parameters derived from the cuff-based waveform assessment did not change with alterations in the peripheral vasculature. There was no significant change in brachial systolic and diastolic values throughout the experiment. (Figure is included in full-text article.) Conclusions: Localised changes in peripheral resistance and compliance affect the radial waveform (tonometer-based acquisition) but not the brachial pressure waveform (cuff-based acquisition) as judged by significant effects on the computed central aortic parameters from radial but not brachial waveforms, the largest discrepancies occurring in aAIx and in PPA. This suggests that estimation of central aortic pressure from brachial cuff waveforms is less sensitive to disturbances in the peripheral vasculature of the upper limb that alter the peripheral arterial pulse morphology. 2 page(s...|$|E

Our experiments show that using a moderate <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacement</b> of the chamber (0. 033 [*]s− 1) is beneficial for obtaining a relative uniform {{temperature distribution}} of the leaf part...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the laboratory modelling of gelifluction processes using the geotechnical centrifuge technique. Thirteen 1 / 10 scale planar slope models were frozen {{from the surface}} downwards on the laboratory floor and thawed, also from the surface downwards, under gravitational acceleration of 10 gravities (approximately 98. 1 ms' 2). A natural sandy silt soil from Quaternary periglacial slope deposits collected in SW England formed the base test material and slope models at gradients 4, 8, 12 and 16 were constructed using this soil. 10 % and 20 % by weight increments of glaciolacustrine silt and Kaolinite clay {{were added to the}} natural soil and a series of slope models were constructed at gradients of 4, 8, and 12 using these soils. Each slope model was subjected to four cycles of freezing and thawing except for the four slope models that underwent rapid slope failure. During thaw, soil temperatures and pore water pressures were recorded continuously, together with soil thaw settlement and surface displacement. Following each experiment, models were sectioned to observe displacement columns that showed the profiles of soil movement and allowed <b>volumetric</b> <b>displacements</b> to be calculated. It was shown that thaw settlement and slope gradient strongly affected the rate of surface movement and the subsurface profile of movement. Increasing slope gradient generated greater amounts of subsurface and surface movement as a function of increased gravitational shear stress. Thawing ice lenses inclined parallel to the slope gradient provided localised zones of microshearing in response to localised low frictional resistance. Rates of movement increased between the 4 and 8 models, but a greater increase occurred between the 8 and 12 models. A slope failure was initiated within the 16 slope model. Rates of gelifluction were dominantly influenced by increasing silt content impacting upon the distribution of segregated ice and the reduction of frictional shear strength. Increasing silt content generated high positive porewater pressures commonly in excess of hydrostatic and consequently greater amounts of pre-failure strain. A clear behavioural threshold was identified between the 10 % and 20 % silt soils, with far greater gelifluction in the latter than the former. Increasing clay content had a less pronounced impact upon rates of gelifluction when compared to increasing silt due to cohesion. Rates of movement increased between the 10 % and 20 % clay in response to lower shear strength. A sawtooth style of pore pressure response caused by water escape events within the 20 % clay prevented maximum potential pressures being achieved and possibly impacted upon the overall rate of gelifluction. A successful simulation of both landsliding and slow mass wasting processes was undertaken and future applications for the technique have been outlined.

40|$|Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is a {{mechanical}} disorder of the vestibular {{system in which}} calcite particles called otoconia interfere with the mechanical functioning of the fluid-filled semicircular canals normally used to sense rotation. Using hydrodynamic models, we examine the two mechanisms proposed by the medical community for BPPV: cupulolithiasis, in which otoconia attach directly to the cupula (a sensory membrane), and canalithiasis, in which otoconia settle through the canals and exert a fluid pressure across the cupula. We utilize known hydrodynamic calculations and make reasonable geometric and physical approximations to derive an expression for the transcupular pressure ∆Pc exerted by a settling solid particle in canalithiasis. By tracking settling otoconia in a two-dimensional model geometry, the cupular volume displacement and associated eye response (nystagmus) can be calculated quantitatively. Several important features emerge: 1) A pressure amplification occurs as otoconia enter a narrowing duct; 2) An averagesized otoconium requires approximately five seconds to settle through the wide ampulla, where ∆Pc is not amplified, which suggests a mechanism for the observed latency of BPPV; and 3) An average-sized otoconium beginning below {{the center of the}} cupula can cause a <b>volumetric</b> cupular <b>displacement</b> on the order of 30 pL, with nystagmus of order 2 ◦ /s, which is approximately the threshold for sensation. Larger cupular volume displacement and nystagmus could result from larger and/or multiple otoconia. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDigital {{volumetric}} correlation (DVC) method can {{be employed}} for evaluation of full-volume displacement and strain fields in deformed material with clearly recognizable microstructure. This microstructure can be defined by complex inner geometrical topography, as trabecular bone and metal foam have for instance, or/and by significant variations of chemical composition, as aluminum grainy alloys have for instance. Volumetric image data were acquired using time lapse X-ray micro-CT during gradually specimen loading. Tetrahedral FE mesh was generated describing related <b>volumetric</b> data. The <b>displacement</b> fields were measured in set of control points by DVC utilizing vertices of this tetrahedral FE mesh. The advantage of the approach is that the resulting strain can be directly compared with FE simulation of the experiment. Problems of accuracy, especially in evaluation of the strain field from the noisy measured displacements and problems of computational efficiency of the method are discussed...|$|R
