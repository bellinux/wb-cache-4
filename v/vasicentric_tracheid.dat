40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for wood {{anatomy of the}} seven species of Cercidium (including two subspecies of C. floridum {{as well as the}} hybrid C. x sonorae) currently recognized. Data on wood of Parkinsonia are presented for purposes of comparison. Vessel walls of Cercidium show unusual sculpture: coarse excrescences termed verrucae here, crateriform pits, and grooves interconnecting pit apertures. These plus crystal distribution, presence of septa in fibers, pit diameter, presence of vasicentric tracheids, and presence of diagonal vessel aggregations are probably species distinctions to various degrees. The crystal-bearing fibers of Cercidium, some of which have very thin walls, exemplify fiber dimorphism. Wood of Parkinsonia aculeata is amply distinct from that of Cercidium. Vessel element dimensions and density in Cercidium do not indicate exceptional xeromorphy for woods, perhaps because some species grow in desert washes, perhaps because other features (leaflessness, thick cuticle on stems) reduce transpiration. Vessel wall sculpture, <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheid</b> presence, and degree of vessel grouping are considered likely indicators of wood xeromorphy within the genus, however...|$|E
40|$|The list of {{families}} with diagonal (2 ̆ 2 dendritic 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 flamelike 2 ̆ 2 of other authors) patterns of vessel aggregation {{is similar to the}} list {{of families}} that have vasicentric tracheids. This paper attempts to deal with apparent exceptions. Because of recent reports of vasicentric tracheids, the families with diagonal vessel aggregations are all also on the list {{of families with}} vasicentric tracheids with the exception of four families. Genera of those four families are studied to see if a relationship between vasicentric tracheids and diagonal vessel aggregations does hold. Of the families not on both lists, Leitneriaceae (Leitneria), Melastomataceae (Mouriri), and Moraceae (Madura) do prove to have vasicentric tracheids in appreciable numbers. Small numbers of vasicentric tracheids and small degrees of vessel aggregation occur in Asimina (Annonaceae), Morus (Moraceae), and various Araliaceae. Vessels may not appear diagonally grouped if libriform fibers accompanying them are few, or if vessels are separated by large numbers of vasicentric tracheids. Diagonal grouping appears most marked in woods from drier and colder localities. Extensive diagonal vessel aggregations are apparently a reliable indication ofvasicentric tracheid presence, but only a portion of the woods with vasicentric tracheids have diagonal vessel aggregations. By having few, large, and intersecting aggregations of vessels mixed with vasicentric tracheids, a wood has greater potential safety (failure of fewer water columns by air embolisms) in space (within wood) and time than a wood with smaller, more numerous vessel groupings. Vessel grouping and <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheid</b> presence are considered additive in their safety effects...|$|E
40|$|Three Iowa-grown {{black oak}} (Quercus velutina Lam.) trees, 16. 5, 16. 5, and 18. 0 cm (6. 5, 6. 5, and 7. 1 inches) {{diameter}} at breast height (1. 37 meters or 4. 5 feet) were harvested by excavating the central stump/root {{system to a}} 91. 4 cm (3 -foot) radius. The first two trees were stand-grown, and the third was open-grown. All roots greater than 1. 27 cm (0. 5 inch) diameter were collected. Green biomass and moisture content of leaf, twig, branch, stem, and stump/root components were measured. Complete-tree biomass was 245. 18, 243. 32, and 316. 7 Kg for the three trees. The stump/root comprised 27 percent of oven-dry complete-tree biomass. Moisture content decreased from roots to twigs;There {{was no significant difference}} in wood plus bark or wood specific gravity (SG) between the three trees. Locations within trees were significantly different. Wood specific gravity decreased from branch to stem to oblique root to lateral root;Fibers were longest in the lower stem (1. 04 mm), followed by lateral (1. 01) and oblique (0. 99) roots (statistically equal), upper stem (0. 96), and branches (0. 76 mm). Fiber radial diameter was greatest in lateral and oblique roots, followed by stem and branch. Oblique roots had the largest fiber lumen diameter, followed by lateral roots, stem, and branch. Fiber double tangential wall thickness was ranked as lateral root, oblique root, stem, and branch;Branches had the highest vessel volume followed by stem, oblique roots, and lateral roots. Ray percentage was greatest in lateral roots, followed by oblique roots, with stem and branch smallest. Branches and stems had the largest fiber proportion; oblique and lateral roots had less. Axial parenchyma and <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheid</b> percentages were greatest in the stem with oblique root, branch, and lateral root components lower;Rather than having a ring porous structure, root wood had a semi-ring porous structure with pores often arranged in radial streams, clusters, or dendritic patterns. One other important difference was that vessel-parenchyma pitting was scalariform in the root. Anatomical features are illustrated with 125 light and scanning electron micrographs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> {{are defined}} as tracheids present {{adjacent}} to vessels in a wood which also possesses libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids as imperforate tracheary elements. Vasculartracheids would correspond with this definition, but {{are defined as}} occurring only in latewood, whereas <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> occur throughout a growth ring or in wood of a diffuse-porous species. V asicentric tracheids offer a subsidiary conducting system which can supply stems and leaves when the vessels to which <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> are adjacent fail because of air embolisms. True tracheids (present as the sole imperforate tracheary element type in the woods in which they occur) have much the same physiological effect, maximizing potential safety in conduction. <b>Vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids,</b> vascular tracheids, and true tracheids are alike in being imperforate tracheary elements bearing relatively large bordered pits approximately like those on lateral walls of vessels in density. Libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids also occur in woods in which <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> or vascular tracheids are present. Vascular tracheids, by virtue of occurrence {{only at the end}} of a growth ring (where they grade into narrow vessel elements), maintain water columns in stems, which thereby persist through dry seasons, but may not adequately supply leaves, which may wilt as drought progresses. <b>Vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids,</b> by safeguarding the conduction of all parts of a growth ring, seem related to the evergreen habit which many shrubs possessing <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> have. Phylads with true tracheids are relatively few in dicotyledons, and only a small part ofthese groups have evidently succeeded in adapting to dry climates. The numerous phylads which instead have libriform fibers or fiber-tracheids have developed comparable safety by evolving <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids.</b> Therefore genera with <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> bulk large in the floras of areas in which evergreen drought-tolerant shrubs are adaptive, the Mediterranean-type areas of the world. In southern California, 26 families (17 reported for the first time) have vasicentric tracheids; notable genera include Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Prunus, Quercus, and Salvia. Desert shrubs have <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> to a somewhat lesser degree. Other Mediterranean-type areas are surveyed for both <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> and true tracheids. The regions so analyzed are central Chile, southern Australia, the lands adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, and southern Mrica. Genera in these areas with <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> include Banksia, Carissa, Eucalyptus, Grevillea, Hakea, Protea, Quercus, Rosmarinus, etc. New Zealand and Japan are wetter and have fewer genera with <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> but more with true tracheids. Many drought-tolerant evergreen shrubs have <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids.</b> A new listing of families and genera with <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> is provided for the world flora, with new reports documented and pertinent literature cited. This new listing includes 68 families (33 newly reported in this paper), which represents a considerable advance on the 32 families listed by Metcalfe and Chalk in their compendia of 1950 and 1983, and includes some large and diverse families for the first time (e. g., Ericaceae, Pittosporaceae, Rosaceae). The lack of reports on occurrence of <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> may in part relate to difficulty in identifying these cells; suggestions for analysis are given...|$|R
40|$|The volumetrie {{proportions}} of vessel elements, fibres, rays, and axial parenchyma plus <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> were determined for the stern, branch and root wood of threc black oak (Quercus velutina Lam.) trees.

40|$|Types of xylem {{histology}} in vines, {{rather than}} types of cambial activity and xylem conformation, form {{the focus of}} this survey. Scandent plants are high in conductive capability, but therefore have highly vulnerable hydrosystems; this survey attempts to see what kinds of adaptations exist for safety and in which taxa. A review of scandent dicotyledons reveals that a high proportion possesses <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> (22 families) or true tracheids (24 families); the majority of scandent families falls in these categories. Other features for which listings are given include vascular tracheids, fibriform vessel elements, helical sculpture in vessels, starch-rich parenchyma adjacent to vessels, and other parenchyma distributions. The high vulnerability of wide vessels is held to be countered by various mechanisms. True <b>tracheids</b> and <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> potentially safeguard the hydrosystem by serving when large vessels are embolized. Many vines and lianas have many narrow vessel elements (often fibriform vessel elements) in addition to wide vessel elements. The narrow vessel elements are held to increase safety. In comparing scandent with nonscandent genera within a family, one finds in some cases that tracheids occur in the scandent species, whereas fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers occur in the nonscandent ones. The same is true of <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> in vining species as compared to nonvining relatives; <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> are so abundant in some families (Passifloraceae) that libriform fibers have been lost partially or wholly. New familial records for presence of <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> include Cucurbitaceae and Polygonaceae, and new generic records include Antigonon, Lycopersicon, and Mandevilla. Various xylem features suggest presence of auxiliary conductive capabilities when main vessels fail. Parenchyma distributions in vines, especially those in which parenchyma surrounds fiber-sheathed vessels, may offer mechanical flexibility in vines, just as presence of wide rays does. However, starch-rich axial parenchyma adjacent to vessels may provide not merely a means of storing to facilitate growth events but, additionally, a way in which hydrolysis of starch could result in movement of sugar into vessels, permitting osmotic entry of water into given areas. Adaptations which seem to lend safety to the hydrosystem are much less in vines and lianas of perpetually moist tropical regions than they are in taxa subject to periods of drought or frost...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 44 collections representing 42 species in 27 genera. Lamiaceae basically have: vessels with simple perforation plates; vessel-to-vessel pitting alternate; imperforate tracheary elements all libriform fibers, fibers commonly septate; axial parenchyma scanty vasicentric; rays Heterogeneous Type IIB. These features ally Lamiaceae closely with Verbenaceae. In {{addition to the}} Mesomorphy ratio (based on vessel element dimensions), features that indicate wood xeromorphy in Lamiaceae, in probable increasing order of importance are: presence of indistinct to marked growth rings; presence of helical thickenings in vessels; presence of vasicentric or vascular tracheids; presence of vessel groups averaging three or more vessels per group. More mesomorphic woods in Lamiaceae occur in species that are arborescent to shrubby, and that occur in areas that have no prolonged drought. Helical sculpture in vessels is expressed not only as thickenings, but also as grooves interconnecting pit apertures (coalesced pit apertures), and inconspicuous thickenings in pairs along the grooves. Vascular tracheids (at ends of growth rings) occur in several genera. Where growth rings are very narrow (Salvia, Trichostema), vessels and tracheids are intermixed, thereby justifying description as <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> of what may have originated phylogenetically as vascular tracheids. This may represent one pathway for origin of <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids.</b> Wide bands of axial parenchyma in Cuminia and Leptosceptrum have originated {{as a result of}} fiber dimorphism. Abundance of upright cells in numerous Lamiaceae is indicative ofpaedomorphosis, and may point to secondary woodiness in some instances; the family as a whole appears ancestrally moderately woody. The ratio between libriform fiber length and vessel element length marks Lamiaceae as specialized. Crystal presence and cambial variants are newly reported for the family...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} features are reported for five Hawaiian and one New Guinean species of Tetramolopium. Tetramolopium humile {{differs from the}} other Hawaiian species in its numerous narrow vessels, numerous <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids,</b> and wide rays. Although these features are adaptive in the dry alpine localities of T. humile, they would be adaptive also in the remaining species, which are from dry to moderately dry lowland localities. Thus, one can consider these features of T. humile as systematic indicators. The wood of T. pumilum (New Guinea) has distinctive wide, tall rays that {{may be related to}} the short stems in this species; T. pumilum has wood more mesomorphic than that of any of the Hawaiian species. Within Hawaiian Tetramolopium, wood anatomy correlates with dryness of habitat.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{description}} of the wood anatomy of Blepharocalyx salicifolius (H. B. K.) Berg (Myrtaceae). There were collected 6 samples of wood, three from Serra do Sudeste and the others from Campos de Cima da Serra - RS. The wood microtechnique followed the standard procedures used in the Wood Anatomy Laboratory of the Federal University of Paraná. For the maceration of wood sticks, the Jeffrey method was used. The wood anatomy agrees, in general lines, with the typical standard of this family, congregating a large number of narrow and solitary vessels, with simple perforation plates, besides diffuse apotracheal parenchyma, heterogeneous rays and bordered pit fibres. The presence of rhomboid chrystals and the absence of <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> permit to discriminate the studied species from other previously described myrtacean woods, that are native of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. </p...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} wood features are presented and analyzed for seven species of subfamily Rivinoideae {{and four of}} subfamily Phytolaccoideae. All species have nonbordered perforations plates, as elsewhere in suborder Phylocaccineae. Libriform fibers characterize both subfamilies, but <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> occur in two rivinoid species. Axial parenchyma is vasicentric scanty (apotracheal bands and patches in one species). Rays are mostly multiseriate, with procumbent cells infrequent in most species. Rivinoids and phytolaccoids differ {{from each other in}} ray height and width and in crystal types. The xeromorphic wood of Petiveria and Rivina is related to their short duration (woody herbs) in disturbed soil that dries readily. Woods of other genera are moderately mesomorphic, correlating with seasonally tropic habitats. Genera of Phytolaccaceae studied here have the same ontogenetic features leading to successive cambia as Stegnosperma. Phytolacca dioica has amphivasal pith bundles in which secondary growth occurs. Vessel restriction patterns are newly reported for the family...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{of seven}} {{collections}} of six species of Nolana, a genus (18 spp.) {{of the central}} western coast of South America was studied for quantitative and qualitative features. The wood is ring porous, with moderately wide vessels bearing simple perforation plates and alternate pits with some grooves interconnecting slitlike pit apertures. Imperforate tracheary elements are fiber-tracheids with vestigial borders on pits or libriform fibers; <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> (reported for Nolanaceae for the first time) are present in varying numbers. Axial parenchyma is vasicentric scanty (sometimes absent), sometimes with tangential bands that may be terminal in part. Rays are both multiseriate and uniseriate; ray cells are mostly erect. Crystal sand occurs in some ray cells and some axial parenchyma. The sum of features mark Nolanaceae as very close to Solanaceae. Wood of Nolana varies in xeromorphy; lower degrees of xeromorphy {{may be explained by}} succulence related to maritime habitat or to ephemeral nature of stems. The erect nature of ray cells and a decrease in vessel element length are indicators of paedomorphosis and thereby herbaceous ness of Nolanaceae...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Shorea mujongensis P. S. Ashton was {{investigated}} {{in order to ensure}} this species belongs to yellow meranti group. Such study is very important since this species is already listed in the red list of IUCN and classified as critically endangered species. The microscopic slides were prepared according to the Johansen 2 ̆ 7 s method, while the anatomical features observed according to the IAWA List. The results show that S. mujongensis wood exhibit brown heartwood, light brown sapwood, rough texture, straight grain sometimes interlocked and somewhat rough. The main microscopic characters are growth rings indistinct; vessel diffuse, mostly solitary, rounded to oval; simple perforation plate and alternate intervessel pits; parenchyma scanty paratracheal to thin vasicentric; axial intercellular canals in long tangential line, radial intercellular canal and <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> present; rays uniseriate and multiseriate, prismatic crystal in procumbent cells; fiber length 1, 294 µm, diameter 26 µm and wall thickness 4 µm. Macroscopic and microscopic observation of S. mujongensis wood confirms the species belongs to yellow meranti group. The assesment on fiber dimensions and derived values of the wood fibers classified the wood into class quality II. It indicates that this species is moderately favorable as raw material for pulp and paper manufacture...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for 21 collections of Berberis and one each of Epimedium, Jeffersonia, and Nandina. Most species of Berberis have {{large numbers of}} narrow vessels ~ixed with <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids.</b> Scalariform perforation plates are reported here only for Epimedium, m wh 1 ch they are occasional. Berberidaceae have living fibers (Berberis), fiber-tracheids plus living fibers (Nandina), or tracheids (Jeffersonia) as imperforate tracheary elements. Axial parenchyma is reported here for Jeffersonia and one species of Berberis. Previous reports of axial parenchyma in Berberis and Nandina likely refer to undivided living fibers, mostly intermixed with vessels, which are slightly shorter and with thinner walls and larger pit apertures than living fibers elsewhere in the wood. Woods of Berberis and other Berberidaceae are remarkably xeromorphic. The wide, tall rays of Berbendaceae, other than Jeffersonia, resemble rays of Clematis (Ranunculaceae) and other Ranunculiflorae. In dimensions, these rays suggest herbaceousness, but abundance of procumbent cells in these rays is not juvenilistic. No consistent differences in wood separate the subgenera Berberis and Mahonia of Berberis: although the two subgenera differ modally in several respects. Wood anatomy of Nandma IS {{very similar to that}} of Berberis, and segregation of Nandinaceae is unwarranted on the basis of wood anatomy...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood features are reported for 38 species representing 22 genera, including the scandent genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia. Woods of Acanthaceae {{are characterized by}} relatively narrow vessels with simple perforation plates and alternate lateral wall pitting, septate libriform fibers, scanty vasicentric axial parenchyma, rays both multiseriate and uniseriate, erect ray cells abundant in rays (some species rayless or near-rayless), numerous small crystals or cystoliths in ray cells in a few genera (first documented reports of both characters in woods of Acanthaceae), and nonstoried structure. This constellation of features is very closely matched by woods of Gesneriaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Pedaliaceae, Martyniaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Myoporaceae (families listed in order ofdecreasing resemblance). Narrowness ofvessels in tropical Acanthaceae appears related to understory ecology. A few species in warm and seasonally dry areas have narrow, short vessel elements numerous per unit transection. <b>Vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> occur in two nonscandent genera in dry areas. Vessel grouping is roughly proportional to dryness of habitat. Thunbergia alata, T. laurifolia, and all collections of Mendoncia have interxylary phloem (first report for Mendoncia). That feature, plus presence of occasional acicular crystals in rays and axial parenchyma and presence of large gelatinous fibers in phloem ally Mendoncia closely with Thunbergia, and Mendonciaceae is not justified for this and other reasons. Species of Thunbergia differ among themselves, and T. erecta and T. holstii resemble shrubby Acanthaceae {{more than they do}} Mendoncia in wood features. Thunbergia thus should not be segregated from Acanthaceae...|$|R
40|$|Features {{in which}} Agdestis differs from Phytolaccaceae s. s. include {{presence}} of both libriform fibers and <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> (rather {{than one or}} the other); bands and strands of thin-walled apotracheal parenchyma (in addition to paratracheal scanty parenchyma, and raylessness (also reported for Bougainvillea of Nyctaginaceae, a family close to Phytolaccaceae). Dimorphism in vessel diameter in Agdestis (narrow vessels like libriform fibers in diameter) is attributable to the lianoid habit. Packets of crystals coarser than typical for raphides occur idioblastically in Agdestis, as do raphides in Phytolacca. ln Phytolacca and in other Phytolaccaceae, one finds an unusual feature that occurs in Agdestis: nonbordered simple perforation plates. Anatomical data support Agdestis as forming a mono- generic subfamily within Phytolaccaceae s. l. The nature of successive cambia in Agdestis is compared with those in other Phytolaccaceae and in Nyctaginaceae. A common pattern is probably present, although differences in terminology and observations obscure the pattern. The term 2 ̆ 2 interxylary phloem 2 ̆ 2 is a misnomer because conjunctive tissue is not secondary xylem as generally understood. After cessation of the cambium in the first cylinder, radial rows of cells form outside the phloem and inside the cortex; this activity may constitute a lateral meristem. Apparently within the radial rows of cells, successive cambia form; each of these cambia produce secondary phloem externally and secondary xylem internally. There {{is little or no}} cambial activity in interfascicular areas...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for wood of all species of Fouquieriaceae, the samples selected {{so as to}} cover important variables with respect to organography and age. Wood contains fibertracheids (plus a few <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids).</b> Diffuse axial parenchyma is mostly grouped as diffuse-in-aggregates or diffuse clusters (new term), with transitions to pervasive axial parenchyma in some species. Rays are Heterogeneous Type II. These wood features are relatively unspecialized and are consistent with placement {{of the family in}} Ericales s. 1. as defined in recent DNA-based cladograms. Xeromorphic wood in nonsucculent species occurs only in Fouquieria shrevei; the lateral branches of F. columnaris also have xeromorphic wood. If the preceding two instances and proliferated parenchyma of the three succulent species (F. columnaris, F. fasciculata, and F. purpusii) are excluded from quantitative studies, wood of Fouquieriaceae is rather mesomorphic, despite the habitats occupied by the family. This paradox is explained by the very sensitive drought deciduousness. Also, the succulent species produce water-storage parenchyma by means of expansion of rays and axial parenchyma bands. Details of these two types of meristems, as well as three other types of meristems within wood (not including vascular cambium) and four bark meristems (other than phellogen) are described; five of these meristems are newly reported for the family. Wood data permit recognition of both the three succulent and eight nonsucculent species within a single genus, in agreement with Henrickson (1972), but few wood features offer species characters. Most wood features, including the abundant reaction wood, are closely related to habit, organography, and ecology...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} wood data are given for 13 species of 10 genera of Portulacaceae (secondary xylem from additional species of Anacampseros and Lewisia were studied but not quantitatively analyzed). Most Portulacaceae show modifications {{that can be}} related to the succulent habit, including wide, tall rays mostly composed of thin-walled cells; total or partial substitution of axial parenchyma for libriform fibers; and modified patterns of pitting on lateral walls of vessels. Pseudoscalariform pitting is more common in Portulacaceae than in other dicotyledon families. In vessels of Anacampseros wood, wide helical bands of secondary wall materi al are present. Similar helices (but without the unusual width) occur in the wood of Lewisia and Heclorella. Woods of Portulacaceae as a whole are markedly xeromorphic with respect to vessel e lement dimensions, vessel density, and vessel grouping; wood of Lewisia and Hectorella is especi ally xeromorphic. Xeromorphism is not so pronounced in succulent dicotyledons at large. Woods of species of Portulacaceae with less marked adaptation to succulence show close resemblance to woods of Didiereaceae and woodier Cactaceae, suggesting the validity of the suborder Portulacineae, which includes these three families plus Hectorellaceae and Basellaceae. The wood of Heclorella is very similar to that of Lewisia rediviva and contains no features not also observed in Portulacaceae. Tracheidlike idioblasts in rays of Anacampseros are likely not homologous with wide-band vascular (or <b>vasicentric)</b> <b>tracheids</b> in fascicular secondary xylem of globular cacti. Dark-colored mucilage idioblasts in Portulacaceae are likely to be a homoplasy; they occur in a scattering of Caryophyllales...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Canacomyrica (hitherto not studied) shows that it belongs in Myricaceae, {{although}} it differs from other genera in several respects (axial parenchyma grouped in bands or columns as well as diffuse; Heterogeneous Type I rays; more numerous bars per perforation plate). The latter two features are primitive for the family. The four genera (Canacomyrica. Comptonia, Morella, and Myrica s. s.) differ from each other not only by qualitative features but by quantitative features (feature means in genera mostly non- overl apping). Wood of Comptonia and Myri ca s. s. lacks chambered crystals in axial parenchyma and ray crystals. Wood of Myrica s. s. has tracheids in latewood but fiber-tracheids in earl ywood. Diagnostic generic summaries are presented. Features of Myricaceae such as scalarifom perforation plates, presence of (true) tracheids, ray types, chambered encapsulated crystals in axial parenchyma, and bark anatomy correspond with character states and expressions in Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Corylaceae, Juglandaceae (including Rhoipteleaceae), Ticodendraceae and, to a lesser extent, Fagaceae and Nothofagaceae. This grouping of families can be found as Fagales in recent DNA trees. The predominance of tracheids in basal Fagales such as Myricaceae and Ticodendraceae suggests that origin of <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> which occur in combination with libriform fibers in Fagaceae {{is the product of}} tracheid dimorphism. Low imperforate tracheid length to vessel element length ratios (FN ratios) in Myricaceae are a probable indication of wood primitiveness. Quantitative vessel features of Myricaceae, as combined in Mesomorphy Ratio values, characterize wood of Myricaceae as a whole, but at the species level such values correspond to respective habitats; notably high vessel density in Comptonia may represent greater conductive safety appropriate to relatively dry habitats...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for woods of 37 species representing 11 genera; most species included represent a maximal degree of woodiness for the family, and herbaceous groups are mostly omitted. Growth rings are absent or nearly so. Vessel elements have simple perforation plates (except for Kohleria elegans) and alternate circular or oval pits {{of various sizes}} on vessel-vessel walls (often laterally elongate, often with gaping apertures, on vessel-parenchyma and vessel-septate fiber interfaces). Grooves interconnect pit apertures in vessels of four genera. Vessels are grouped, usually in radial chains, to a moderate extent. Tyloses are present. Imperforate tracheary elements are libriform fibers or (Coronanthera) fiber tracheids with vestigial borders on pits. Septa are present in imperforate tracheary elements of most species, but in most species of Cyrtandra, septate fibers occur only near vessels. Uniseriate rays are present in some species, but in most species rays are muItiseriate only or are absent altogether. Vascular and <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> are absent. In Cyrtandra, wood with multiseriate rays can be demonstrated to be rayless earlier in ontogeny. Crystals are present in rays and in septate fibers of a few species. Storying is present in a few species. All features of wood reflect the mesic habitats characteristic of Gesneriaceae, but moderate degrees of xeromorphy are illustrated by species in which narrow vessels, grouped vessels, and grooves in vessel walls occur. The wood anatomy of Drymonia reflects its vining habit. Raylessness may indicate secondary woodiness in Besleria and Cyrtandra. Wood anatomy of Gesneriaceae is consonant with a hypothesis that the family {{is closely related to}} Acanthaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and other families of Scrophulariales...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} 14 species of Clematis and one species each of Delphinium, Helleborus, Thalictrum, and Xanthorhiza (Ranunculaceae) is {{compared}} to that of Glaucidium palma tum (Glaucidiaceae) and Hydrastis canadensis (Ranunculaceae, or Hydrastidaceae of some authors). Clematis wood has features typical of wood of vines and lianas: wide (earlywood) vessels, abundant axial parenchyma (earlywood, some species), high vessel density, low proportion of fibrous tissue in wood, wide rays composed of thin-walled cells, and abrupt origin of multiseriate rays. Superimposed on these features are expressions indicative of xeromorphy in the species of cold or dry areas: numerous narrow latewood vessels, presence of <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids,</b> shorter vessel elements, and strongly marked growth rings. Wood of Xanthorhiza is like that of a (small) shrub. Wood of Delphinium, Helleborus, and Thalictrum is characteristic of herbs that become woodier: limited amounts of secondary xylem, parenchymatization of wood, partial conversion of ray areas to libriform fibers (partial raylessness). Wood of Ranunculaceae other than Clematis has numerous narrow vessels, probably an adaptation to cold more than drought. Glaucidium has occasional scalariform perforation plates like those almost universally present in Paeonia, but the two genera differ strongly in other wood features. Wood of Hydrastis (scalariform perforation plates occasional in primary xylem, rare in secondary xylem) accords with the idea that Hydrastis is a lineage that separated from the base of Ranunculaceae. Features that ally Ranunculaceae with other families of Ranunculiflorae include presence of wide multiseriate rays (without accompanying uniseriate rays), vessel restriction patterns, and storied structure. Woodiness in Ranunculaceae is probably secondary, at least to some extent; the woodiness of Xanthorhiza, thought by some to represent a primitive genus in the family, could be either primary or secondary...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 28 collections of three genera (Bontia, Eremophila, Myoporum); data on Oftia are also included {{since it is}} sometimes referred to Myoporaceae. Wood of all Myoporaceae represents variation on a basic plan: woods diffuse porous or semi-ringporous; vessels with simple perforation plates; lateral wall pits of vessels alternate and circular, with grooves interconnecting some pit apertures; vessels grouped to various degrees into radial multiples; imperforate tracheary elements all fiber-tracheids with pit cavities 1 - 5 μm in diameter (wider on contacts with ray cells), nonseptate; axial parenchyma vasicentric scanty plus, in some species, tangential para tracheal bands (sometimes terminal); rays multi seriate plus uniseriate (uniseriate almost exclusively in two species of Eremophila); ray cells procumbent exclusively, upright and square in uniseriate rays and in tips of multiseriate rays; rays storied in some species of Eremophila, axial parenchyma variously storied; crystals present in ray cells of some species of Eremophila and in fibers of E. polyclada; amorphous deposits and starch often present in parenchyma. Ofiia differs from Myoporaceae by having: septate libriform fibers rather than fiber-tracheids; large pits on vessel walls; axial parenchyma nearly absent; and erect cells predominant in rays. Oftia may be placed in Scrophulariaceae. Leucophyllum differs from Myoporaceae by having: helical thickenings in vessels; <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> transitional from vascular tracheids; scarce axial parenchyma; and erect cells predominant in rays. Leucophyllum may be excluded from Myoporaceae. Wood anatomy ofMyoporaceae shows relationship between Myoporaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Gesneriaceae, and is also indicative of derivation from woody ancestors. Wood of Myoporaceae reflects xeromorphy, especially in Eremophila, but the foliar apparatus may partially preempt the role of wood in promoting safety, which is connoted by growth rings, narrow and numerous vessels, and grouped vessels...|$|R
40|$|A {{hitherto}} unappreciated correlation {{exists between}} nature of vessel grouping {{and nature of}} imperforate tracheary elements in wood of dicotyledons at large: families and genera with true tracheids (large fully bordered pits common on both radial and tangential walls) have solitary vessels. Presence of true tracheids as a subsidiary conductive system is hypothesized to render vessel grouping a superfluous adaptation. Vessel grouping does occur to various degrees in taxa with fiber-tracheids or libriform fibers; the degree of grouping is related to likelihood or seriousness of vessel failure by air embolisms because of either drought or frost. Grouping of vessels {{is regarded as a}} way of providing alternate conduits whereby water can be carried in the same pathways in case one or several vessels in a group are incapacitated by air embolisms. Presence of vascular tracheids, if sufficiently abundant, is held to be correlated with smaller degree of vessel grouping because vascular tracheids can form a subsidiary conductive system; small numbers of vascular tracheids do not affect vessel grouping patterns. Species which possess <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> possess a subsidiary conductive system ideally located around vessels and have solitary vessels or else (ifvasicentric tracheids are less common) a low degree of vessel grouping. Species with very large vessels at the beginning of growth rings tend to have little grouping in the earlywood vessels but more grouping in latewood vessels; this dimorphism is held to relate to enhanced safety oflatewood vessels, since earlywood vessels have little safety and the latewood is thereby the wood portion where safety mechanisms are concentrated. Fiber-tracheids do not have sufficient conductive capabilities to form a subsidiary conductive system; borders on pits of fiber-tracheids are rapidly lost during evolution, and such loss generally pr~cedes appearance of septate or nucleated conditions or is simultaneous with it. Relative selective value of the various vessel grouping types (clusters, radial multiples, diagonal bands, tangential bands) as well as of larger aggregations remains a topic for more investigation, as does significance of grouping of primary xylem vessels...|$|R

The lianoid habit is found in 125 extant plant families and is most diverse and abundant in structurally complex forests, such as tropical forests. A stem with lianoid anatomy is described from Cretaceous sediments of Hornby Island, British Columbia. Methodology. The stem segment, 2. 5 cm in diameter and 2. 8 cm long, was studied using the cellulose acetate peel technique and SEM. Anatomy was documented and compared to fossil and modern taxa. Pivotal results. The stem lacks distinct growth increments, and the fibrous wood is dissected by large (> 10 cells wide) rays. Wood is diffuse porous with mostly solitary vessels, rarely in tangential multiples (2 - 4). Vessel elements have a mean tangential diameter of 198 mm and mean length of 527 mu m, bearing medium to large, crowded, elliptical to flat-elliptical alternate pits. Axial parenchyma is diffuse and vessels are surrounded by <b>vasicentric</b> <b>tracheids</b> with alternate bordered pitting. Rays are homocellular and > 2 cm tall. Phloem rays are dilated, protruding into the xylem rays; thick-walled ray cells contain prismatic crystals. Periderm is composed of thin-walled cells interspersed with sclerotic nests. Wood anatomy of the fossil shows the most similarity to that of lianas in the Menispermaceae, Lardizabalaceae, and Ranunculaceae. Conclusions. The Hornby Island stem represents a new taxon, Atli morinii gen. et sp. nov. (Ranunculales). This liana specimen expands our knowledge of Cretaceous biodiversity and points to the presence of structurally complex forests on Hornby Island in the Campanian. Anatomy of Atli and other Cretaceous liana stems combines characteristics of several families in Ranunculales, documenting past anatomical diversity and possible stem lineage mosaicism. The most diverse lianoid lineages currently known from the Cretaceous and Paleogene are early-divergent eudicots, particularly Ranunculales and Vitales that account for more than 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} 56 wood samples {{representing}} 11 native species of Eugenia s. str. was studied. Wood structure {{is described in}} detail with emphasis on the taxonomic value of qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Features observed in most samples include: wood diffuseporous; pores solitary; perforation plates simple; vestured pits in vessel elements of Van Vliet’s type B; vascular and <b>vasicentric</b> tracheids; fibre <b>tracheids</b> with vestured pits; axial parenchyma apotracheal; rays heterogeneous type I and II; ray-vessel pitting small and rounded; chambered axial parenchyma cells with prismatic crystals enclosed by a thick lignified sheath; intracellular deposits of tanniniferous substances; starch grains hollow; no visual distinction between heartwood and sapwood. Pith flecks were occasionally present and limited gummosis of pith fleck parenchyma resulted {{in the formation of}} gum veins. Crystalliferous chains in pith flecks resemble those of the secondary phloem. The wood anatomy of the species studied largely resembles that of Eugenia {{in other parts of the}} world and is quite distinct from that of Syzygium. No single characteristic or combination of characteristics could be found to be diagnostic at species level. Features that might be useful to distinguish between some species are average pore diameter and lack of tannin in ray cells...|$|R
40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the roles that}} radial and axial parenchyma (RAP) plays against fungal pathogens in the secondary xylem of wood {{within the context of}} the CODIT model (Compartmentalization of Decay in Trees), a defense concept first conceived in the early 1970 s by Alex Shigo. This model, simplistic in its design, shows how a large woody perennial is highly compartmented. Anatomical divisions in place at the time of infection or damage, (physical defense) alongside the ‘active’ response by the RAP during and after wounding work together in forming boundaries that function to restrict air or decay spread. The living parenchyma cells play a critical role in all of the four walls (differing anatomical constructs) that the model comprises. To understand how living cells in each of the walls of CODIT cooperate, we must have a clear vision of their complex interconnectivity from a three-dimensional perspective, along with knowledge of the huge variation in ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) abundance and patterns. Crucial patterns for defense encompass the symplastic continuum between both RP and AP and the dead tissues, with the latter including the vessel elements, libriform fibers, and imperforate tracheary elements (i. e., <b>vasicentric</b> and vascular <b>tracheids).</b> Also, the heartwood, a chemically altered antimicrobial non-living substance that forms the core of many trees, provides an integral part of the defense system. In the heartwood, dead RAP can play an important role in defense, depending on the genetic constitution of the species. Considering the array of functions that RAP are associated with, from capacitance, through to storage, and long-distance water transport, deciding how their role in defense fits into this suite of functions is a challenge for plant scientists, and likely depends on a range of factors. Here, we explore the important role of RAP in defense against fungal pathogens and the trade-offs involved from a viewpoint for structure-function relations, while also examining how fungi can breach the defense system using an array of enzymes in conjunction with the physically intrusive hyphae...|$|R
