40|$|Speed-dependent {{automatic}} zooming (SDAZ) {{has been}} proposed for standard desktop displays {{as a means of}} overcoming problems associated with the navigation of large information spaces. SDAZ combines zooming and panning facilities into a single operation, with the magnitude of both factors dependent on simple user interaction. Previous research indicated dramatic user performance improvements when using the technique for document and map tasks. In this paper we propose algorithmic extensions to the technique for application on small-screen devices and present a comparative experimental evaluation of user performance with the system and a normative scroll-zoom-pan interface. Users responded positively to the system, particularly in relation to reduced physical navigational workload. However, the reduced screen space reduced the impact of SDAZ in comparison to that reported in previous studies. In fact, for one-dimensional <b>navigation</b> (<b>vertical</b> document <b>navigation)</b> the normative interface out-performed SDAZ. For navigation in two dimensions (map browsing) SDAZ supports more accurate target location, but also produces longer task completion times. Some SDAZ users became lost within the information space and were unable to recover navigational context. We discuss the reasons for these observations and suggest ways in which limitations of SDAZ in the small-screen context may be overcome...|$|R

40|$|The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) in {{differential}} mode (DGPS) {{has been shown}} to be least accurate in the vertical axis. The vertical axis also has the most stringent accuracy requirements for aircraft precision approach and landing. A series of flight tests were conducted to evaluate a concept for improving the DGPS <b>vertical</b> axis <b>navigation</b> performance. These tests incorporated augmentation sensors to aid the DGPS navigation solution during terminal approach operations. A GPS receiver was installed on board a NASA helicopter and interfaced with a real-time digital computer system. A reconfigurable navigation filter programmed in the digital computer provided an augmented DGPS solution, with selectable inputs from a low-cost vertical accelerometer, a barometric altimeter, and the aircraft attitude gyros. The reference aircraft position was determined by a laser tracker. Extensive post-test analysis was done to optimize the filter performance during the terminal approach operation.

40|$|In the {{interest}} of enhancing the capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles US Naval Operations, controlling vehicle position to follow depth contours presents exciting potential for navigation. Use of a contour tracking control algorithm in lieu of preprogrammed waypoint navigation offers distinct advantages within new challenges. The difficult nature of this problem lies in the non-trivial connection between the necessary corrective action and the feedback error used in traditional control methods. Stated simply, modern vehicle control algorithms separate horizontal and <b>vertical</b> plane <b>navigation.</b> The autonomous vehicle senses heading error and applies rudder to steer the vehicle to a desired heading. Simultaneously, the vehicle might sense altitude and apply stern plane angles to maintain a safe height above ground. This thesis research examines the new problem of sensing depth and altitude in the vertical plane while steering the vehicle horizontally to find a specified bathymetry contour. While more remains to understand, this research proves {{the existence of a}} solution and suggests similar approaches may facilitate tying vehicle navigation to other indirect sensors. This thesis presents two contour tracking control algorithms and examines the performance of each by simulating the response of the REMUS underwater vehicle to ideal and real-world bathymetry models...|$|R

40|$|Strong ionospheric {{scintillation}} due to electron density irregularities inside the ionosphere is commonly {{observed in the}} equatorial region during solar maxima. Strong amplitude scintillation causes deep and frequent Global Positioning System (GPS) signal fading. Since GPS receivers lose carrier tracking lock at deep signal fading and the lost channel cannot {{be used for the}} position solution until reacquired, {{ionospheric scintillation}} is a major concern for GPS aviation in the equatorial area. Frequent signal fading also causes frequent reset of the carrier smoothing filter in aviation receivers. This leads to higher noise levels on the pseudo-range measurements. Aviation availability during a severe scintillation period observed using data from the previous solar maximum is analyzed. The effects from satellite loss due to deep fading and shortened carrier smoothing time are considered. Availability results for both <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>navigation</b> during the severe scintillation are illustrated.

40|$|Route guiding {{has become}} {{increasingly}} essential in pedestrian navigation within the urban space. Large buildings of multi-stories (such as hotel, hospital, and airport complexes) dominate the urban setting. When set against an uneven terrain like the case of Hong Kong, wayfinding in the urban space {{is not an easy}} task. The aim of this research is to identify elements in the urban space on which a traveler on foot needs route guidance. The proposed method adopts an aggregated approach in defining a behavioral space within a physical environment. By categorizing the types of urban travelers, the audience of the route guiding system can be targeted. An analysis of the diversity and demand of wayfinding can help sort out the connections among data, people and environment. Various approaches to find optimal paths are assessed against the consideration of vertical movements within built structures and over natural landscapes in the urban space. Vertical movements are considered in terms of walking distance, journey time and climbing effort.

40|$|Introduction: This website is a multi-dimensional {{approach}} of the locomotor system in domestic animals. The first objective of this anatomical presentation is to establish relation between systemic anatomy and topographic anatomy. The second objective is to teach a practical anatomy that must be adapted to the clinician work. Methods: From the dissection of equine, bovine and canine specimens, osteology, arthrology and myology (OAM) were photographed and filmed. All photos and movies were captioned and designed using Fireworks (Adobe CS 4, USA), AVS video converter 6 (MediaTechnologies Ltd, UK) and Divx Author (Divx Inc, USA). The website was designed using Dreamweaver (Adobe CS 4, USA). Results: Compared anatomy site consists on dichotomously organised web pages. Each page is transversally and vertically connected with others, and always surmounted by a navigation barr. From the navigation barr we can travel through different drop-down menus (DDM). The first DDM corresponds to the lesson menu (it sends to general OAM); {{the second and third}} DDMs correspond to the equine picture menu and the bovine/canine picture menu (from them we can navigate in OAM per species and per system using clickable captioned photos and movies, the functional aspects being explained). For practical reasons, equine species is used as animal reference. Indeed only anatomical differences of the other species are detailed and compared. Finally the button Index corresponds to the surgeon view (all of the body is transversally cut, the clickable anatomical structures are sent back to their specific topic web page). Conclusions: Because of the numerous photos and movies, the three-dimensional view is better understood. Because of the transversal and <b>vertical</b> links, the <b>navigation,</b> in whatever level per species or per system or per anatomical cut, strengthens the cognitive process. This website is a fabulous multi-scale tool to teach and to learn the veterinary anatomy. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Morpheus Project {{began in}} late 2009 as an ambitious e ort code-named Project M to {{integrate}} three ongoing multi-center NASA technology developments: humanoid robotics, liquid oxygen/liquid methane (LOX/LCH 4) propulsion and Autonomous Precision Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) {{into a single}} engineering demonstration mission to be own to the Moon by 2013. The humanoid robot e ort was redirected to a deploy- ment of Robonaut 2 on the International Space Station in February of 2011 while Morpheus continued as a terrestrial eld test project integrating the existing ALHAT Project's tech- nologies into a sub-orbital ight system using the world's rst LOX/LCH 4 main propulsion and reaction control system fed from the same blowdown tanks. A series of 33 tethered tests with the Morpheus 1. 0 vehicle and Morpheus 1. 5 vehicle were conducted from April 2011 - December 2013 before successful, sustained free ights with the primary <b>Vertical</b> Testbed (VTB) <b>navigation</b> con guration began with Free Flight 3 on December 10, 2013. Over {{the course of the}} following 12 free ights and 3 tethered ights, components of the ALHAT navigation system were integrated into the Morpheus vehicle, operations, and ight control loop. The ALHAT navigation system was integrated and run concurrently with the VTB navigation system as a reference and fail-safe option in ight (see touchdown position esti- mate comparisons in Fig. 1). Flight testing completed with Free Flight 15 on December 15, 2014 with a completely autonomous Hazard Detection and Avoidance (HDA), integration of surface relative and Hazard Relative Navigation (HRN) measurements into the onboard dual-state inertial estimator Kalman lter software, and landing within 2 meters of the VTB GPS-based navigation solution at the safe landing site target.

50|$|Voice {{communications}} {{contribute to}} operational errors due to miscommunication, stolen clearances (an {{air traffic control}} clearance for one aircraft is heard and erroneously accepted by another aircraft) and delayed message transfers due to radio frequency congestion. Data communications will enable air traffic controller productivity improvements and will permit capacity growth without requisite growth in costs associated with infrastructure equipment, maintenance, labor and training. As a result, the resources required to provide air traffic management service per aircraft operation will decrease. The use of real-time aircraft data by ground systems to plot 4-dimensional trajectories (lateral and <b>vertical</b> <b>navigation,</b> ground speed and longitudinal navigation), and perform conformance management, will shift air traffic operations from minute-by-minute tactical control, to more predictable and planned strategic traffic management.|$|E
40|$|The {{navigation}} filter architecture successfully deployed on the Morpheus flight {{vehicle is}} presented. The filter was {{developed as a}} key element of the NASA Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) project and over the course of 15 free fights was integrated into the Morpheus vehicle, operations, and flight control loop. Flight testing completed by demonstrating autonomous hazard detection and avoidance, integration of an altimeter, surface relative velocity (velocimeter) and hazard relative navigation (HRN) measurements into the onboard dual-state inertial estimator Kalman flter software, and landing within 2 meters of the <b>vertical</b> testbed GPS-based <b>navigation</b> solution at the safe landing site target. Morpheus followed a trajectory that included an ascent phase followed by a partial descent-to-landing, although the proposed filter architecture is applicable to more general planetary precision entry, descent, and landings. The main new contribution is the incorporation of a sophisticated hazard relative navigation sensor-originally intended to locate safe landing sites-into the navigation system and employed as a navigation sensor. The formulation of a dual-state inertial extended Kalman filter was designed to address the precision planetary landing problem when viewed as a rendezvous problem with an intended landing site. For the required precision navigation system that is capable of navigating along a descent-to-landing trajectory to a precise landing, the impact of attitude errors on the translational state estimation are included in a fully integrated navigation structure in which translation state estimation is combined with attitude state estimation. The map tie errors are estimated as part of the process, thereby creating a dual-state filter implementation. Also, the filter is implemented using inertial states rather than states relative to the target. External measurements include altimeter, velocimeter, star camera, terrain relative navigation sensor, and a hazard relative navigation sensor providing information regarding hazards on a map generated on-the-fly...|$|R
40|$|This fall I {{worked in}} EV 3 within NASA's Johnson Space Center in The HIVE (Human Integrated Vehicles & Environments). The HIVE is {{responsible}} for human in the loop testing, getting new technologies in front of astronauts, operators, and users early in the development cycle to make the interfaces more human friendly. Some projects the HIVE is working on includes user interfaces for future spacecraft, wearables to alert astronauts about important information, and test beds to simulate mock missions. During my internship I created a prototype for T- 38 aircraft displays using LabVIEW, learned how to use microcontrollers, and helped out with other small tasks in the HIVE. The purpose of developing a prototype for T- 38 Displays in LabVIEW is to analyze functions of the display such as navigation in a cost and time effective manner. The LabVIEW prototypes allow Ellington Field AOD to easily make adjustments to the display before hardcoding the final product. LabVIEW was {{used to create a}} user interface for simulation almost identical to the real aircraft display. Goals to begin the T- 38 PFD (Primary Flight Display) prototype included creating a T- 38 PFD hardware display in a software environment, designing navigation for the menu's, incorporating <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>navigation</b> bars, and to add a heading bug for compass controls connected to the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator). To get started with the project, measurements of the entire display were taken. This enabled an accurate model of the hardware display to be created. Navigation of menu's required some exploration of different buttons on the display. The T- 38 simulator and aircraft were used for examining the display. After one piece of the prototype was finished, another trip of to the simulator took place. This was done until all goals for the prototype were complete. Some possible integration ideas for displays in the near future are autopilot selection, touch screen displays, and crew member preferences. Complete navigation, control, and function customization will be achievable once a display is fully developed. Other than the T- 38 prototyping, I spent time learning how to design small circuits and write code for them to function. This was done by adding electronic circuit components to breadboard and microcontroller then writing code to speak to those components through the microcontroller. I went through an Arduino starter kit to build circuits and code software that allowed the hardware to act. This work was planned to assist in a lighting project this fall but another solution was discovered for the lighting project. Other tasks that I assisted with, included hands on work such as mock-up construction/removal, logic analyzer repairs, and soldering with circuits. The unique opportunity to be involved work with NASA has significantly changed my educational and career goals. This opportunity has only opened the door to my career with engineering. I have learned over the span of this internship that I am fascinated by the type of work that NASA does. My desire to work in the aerospace industry has increased immensely. I hope to return to NASA to be more involved in the advancement of science, engineering, and spaceflight. My interests for my future education and career lie in NASAs work - pioneering the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research...|$|R
