Some of BR's Mk1 coaches were built with dual brakes (all had vacuum as standard) and {{much of the rest of}} the fleet was dual fitted by the 1980s, so they could be worked by air or vacuum fitted locomotives as the changeover from vacuum to air took place between 1970 and the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Inventor William M. Folberth {{applied for}} a patent for an {{automatic}} windscreen wiper apparatus in 1919, which was granted in 1922. It was the first automatic mechanism. Trico later settled a patent dispute with Folberth and purchased Folberth's Cleveland company, the Folberth Auto Specialty Co. The new vacuum-powered system quickly became standard equipment on automobiles, and the vacuum principle was in use until about 1960. In the late 1950s, a feature common on modern vehicles first appeared, operating the wipers automatically {{for two or three}} passes when the windshield washer button was pressed, making it unnecessary to manually turn the wipers on as well. Today, an electronic timer is used, but originally a small <b>vacuum</b> <b>cylinder</b> mechanically linked to a switch provided the delay as the vacuum leaked off.|$|E

The Silver is an aircraft designed to overcome some of the difficulties that the present tilt rotor aircraft have to face. The Silver has an external structure based on the famous tilt rotor, the V- 22 Osprey. The Silver incorporates 2 modified turbofan engines for propulsion. The engine has a fan followed by a set of axial compressors and turbines. The engine has incorporated a mechanism where a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cylinder</b> is incorporated into the principal shaft of the engine. Due to the heat developed by the combustion of fuel, thermal emission takes place from the cathode. The electrons thus emitted travel towards the positive anode with high velocities. Due to the high velocity of the electron current, a large current is created. Because of this current, a mechanical force is experienced by the shaft by virtue of the electron interaction with the magnetic engine case. Due to this the shaft experiences rotational motion which drives the propeller fan. This technology is used as a starting mechanism for the engine and also for thrust augmentation. It is also used as a powe...|$|E
30|$|The low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) manufactured by “UfaOrgSynthesis” (Russia) with 918.5 [*]±[*] 1.5  kg/m 3 density and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) {{were used for}} the sample preparation. The nanotubes were made by the CVD method in a rotating reactor [9]. Powder of the Al 2 O 3 –MoO 3 –Fe 2 O 3 mixture was applied as catalyst. The propylene was just used as a source of carbon. The samples were prepared via multistage procedure. First, starting components, the LDPE and MWCNT powders, were mixed in the revolver-type rotational mixer. The rotation conditions were rotation rate 120  rev/min and rotation time 4  h. The isotropic mixtures were being taken after mixing. The mixture was loaded into a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cylinder</b> of extruder and heated up to 120  °C during 40  min at 103  Pa pressure. After that, the mixture had been pushed through a die. The made cylinders of the composites were of 3 mm in diameter, and their high was near 5 mm. When measurements were carried on, the direction along the axis of the cylinder was observed as “longitudinal”, while the direction along a diameter of the cylinder had been denoted as “radial.” Two samples from each type {{were used for the}} dilatometric tests; one was placed along the longitudinal direction and the other along the radial direction.|$|E

50|$|The {{rationale}} behind the design was that, if the tender frame could {{be carried on}} more points, represented by the rigidly mounted and Bissel wheels, instead of on only two bogie pivot centres, the frame could be made lighter. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>cylinders</b> which actuated brake blocks on the rigidly mounted wheels were mounted {{on top of the}} tank behind the coal bunker since the wheel arrangement left insufficient room to mount them under the frame as usual.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact <b>vacuum</b> <b>cylinder</b> has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic fluid seal for linear motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic fluid seals have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic fluid seal is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic fluid from the seal clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with oil repellent layer. The proposed magnetic fluid seal performance has been evaluated. As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic fluid seal is useful as a linear motion seal, and the oil repellent layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|E
40|$|An {{existing}} {{low temperature}} diffractometer was extended with a CCD area detector. This enables electron density determinations at 20 K within one weak, if crystals with excellent quality are available. A Huber 4 -circle goniometer {{equipped with a}} closed cycle cryostat (APD) was used. The extension with a Bruker-Apex detector was possible through DFG funding. This required a new goniometer control, that is now completely included in the Bruker software. The obtainable data quality was not sufficient with former used Beryllium cylinder, because of its highly structured scattering. To obtain the required data quality for electron density determinations, a Kapton <b>vacuum</b> <b>cylinder</b> was constructed {{at the beginning of}} reconstruction. This cylinder is built by 0. 125 mm Kapton film only. This result in strongly reduced background. In addition Kapton film produces nearly unstructured scattering. Till now only Mo-K&# 945; radiation was used for electron density determinations. Ag radiation would also be possible, but is problematic because of the lower intensity. Graphite is used in the monochromator. To enhance the primary intensity a focusing collimator from XOS was installed short ago. In scope of this work the electron densities of Strychnine, a [1. 1. 1]-Propellane-derivate, Adenosinmonophosphat and a Dithiolate-Zink-complex were experimentally evaluated. The comparative study on Strychnine shows, that four different measurements with different instruments can give well reproducible electron densities. These measurements show a small deviation to theoretical calculations. The experimental electron density determination of a [1. 1. 1]-Propellane-derivate was only possible at 100 K using synchrotron. All bonds of this highly strained system could be characterised. A bond between the bridgehead atoms was located, what justifies the description as an inverted carbon atom. This bond was predicted by theoretical calculations since a while, but is characterised in detail experimentally first. The electron density determination of Adenosinmonophosphat shows problems in the multipol model for phosphorus atoms. In comparison to a 100 K measurement the lower temperature of 25 K seems to be of great advantage for changing of the model. Only the 25 K measurement together with modified models to roughly compares with theoretical calculations. The modelling of phosphorus atom remains problematic an further improvement would be helpful. Hydrogen parameters obtained by a neutron diffraction experiment from Dr. Kloosters could be used in the refinement of the Dithiolat-Zink-complex. The Zink atom shows a remarkable deformation of the 3 d and 4 s shell, that could not be deducted easily by the coordination geometry. In addition the deformation is structured in a too complicated way for the available multipolar model. Measurements of numerous substances were performed {{in the last two years}} to determine their experimental electron densities with the new developed instrument. This includes some amino acid formiates, Tripeptides, Opiods, as well as Strychnine, Thymidine, Adenosinmonophosphate and one metal complex at temperatures around 20 K. In addition DL-Serin was measured at three different temperatures (298, 100 and 25 K) ...|$|E

5000|$|How hit-and-miss engines work: The {{intake valve}} on hit-and-miss engines has no actuator; instead, a light spring holds the intake valve closed unless a <b>vacuum</b> in the <b>cylinder</b> draws it open.
