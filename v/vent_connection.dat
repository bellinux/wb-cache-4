50|$|These waterboxes on {{inlet side}} {{will also have}} flanged {{connections}} for cooling water inlet butterfly valves, small vent pipe with hand valve for air venting at higher level, and hand operated drain valve at bottom to drain the waterbox for maintenance. Similarly on the outlet waterbox the cooling water connection will have large flanges, butterfly valves, <b>vent</b> <b>connection</b> also at higher level and drain connections at lower level. Similarly thermometer pockets are located at inlet and outlet pipes for local measurements of cooling water temperature.|$|E
50|$|Under {{many older}} {{building}} codes, a vent stack (a pipe {{leading to the}} main roof vent) is required to be within a 5 ft radius of the draining fixture it serves (sink, toilet, shower stall, etc.). To allow only one vent stack, and thus one roof penetration as permitted by local building code, sub-vents may be tied together inside the building and exit via a common vent stack. One additional requirement for a vent stack connection occurs when there are very long horizontal drain runs with very little slope to the run. Adding a <b>vent</b> <b>connection</b> within the run will aid flow, and when used with a cleanout allows for better serviceability of the long run.|$|E
40|$|Air vent {{systems are}} {{designed}} to protect hydropower penstocks and reservoir outlets under various operating conditions. During an emergency closure of an upstream gate the hydraulic jump that forms downstream of the gate is not stationary and may advance downstream potentially increasing the total air demand. A lab-scale physical model of a general outlet works piping configuration was constructed at Reclamationâ€™s Hydraulics Laboratory in Denver, CO to observe hydraulic jump behavior during emergency gate closures. Parameters including gate discharge, gate closure rate, air vent size, and downstream pipe pressure were tested at two different pipe slopes. Results indicate that the hydraulic jump travel speed is dependent on air vent size as well as gate closure rate, both of which affect the internal pressure in the pipe near the <b>vent</b> <b>connection.</b> For a shallow-sloped pipe, the jump speed remains steady throughout the entire pipe length if the air supply is sufficient. However, if air flow is significantly reduced due to an undersized air vent, unsteady travel speeds and pressure surges were observed. This {{was not the case}} for a steep-sloped pipe which produced steady jump speeds for all vent sizes. Once completed, these results are expected to be applicable for prediction of hydraulic jump travel speed and its effects on air demand for vent sizing considerations based on hydraulic operating conditions...|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, <b>venting</b> the <b>connection</b> and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|R
25|$|The {{launch date}} of 24 February 2011 was officially set after the Flight Readiness Review meeting on 18 February 2011. Reviews of {{previous}} problems, including the GUP <b>vent</b> line <b>connection,</b> external tank foam and external tank stringer cracks, {{were found to}} be positive. Additionally, flight rules which required a 72-hour separation between dockings at the International Space Station threatened to delay the launch by at least a day due to the delayed launch of the ESA's unmanned Johannes Kepler ATV supply craft. Managers instead decided to press ahead with the countdown allowing for a possible standdown; had docking issues arisen with the ATV, STS-133 would have stood down for 48 hours. The Kepler ATV docked successfully at 10:59 UTC, 24 February 2011.|$|R
5000|$|UFAD systems rely on air {{handling}} units to filter and condition air to the appropriate supply conditions {{so it can be}} delivered to the occupied zone. While overhead systems typically use ducts to distribute the air, UFAD systems use the underfloor plenum formed by installation of a raised floor. The plenum generally sits 0.3 and 0.46 m above the structural concrete slab, although lower heights are possible. Specially designed floor diffusers are used as the supply outlets. [...] The most common UFAD configuration consists of a central {{air handling}} unit delivering air through a pressurized plenum and into the space through floor diffusers. Other approaches may incorporate fan powered terminal units at the outlets, underfloor ducts, desktop <b>vents</b> or <b>connections</b> to Personal Environmental Control Systems.|$|R
40|$|Operators {{of natural}} gas {{pipeline}} systems routinely reduce line pressure and discharge gas from pipeline sections to ensure safe working conditions during maintenance and repair activities. Typically, operators block the smallest possible linear section of the pipeline and depressurize it by venting gas to the atmosphere. In 2004, an estimated 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of methane was vented to the atmosphere during routine maintenance and pipeline upsets. Using pump-down techniques to lower gas line pressure before performing maintenance and repair activities is {{an effective way to}} reduce emissions and yield significant economic savings. Pipeline pump-down techniques involve using in-line compressors either alone or in sequence with portable compressors. Using in-line compressors is almost always justifiable because there are no capital costs, and payback is immediate. The cost-effectiveness of also using a portable compressor to increase gas recovery, however, depends greatly on site-specific factors and operating costs. Another alternative is to install an ejector. An ejector is a venturi nozzle that uses high-pressure gas as motive fluid to draw suction on a lower pressure gas source, discharging into an intermediate pressure gas stream. The ejector can be installed on <b>vent</b> <b>connections</b> up and down stream of a partly closed valve, or between the discharge and suction of a compressor which creates the necessary pressure differential. Regardless of the pump-down technique selected, emission reductions are directly proportional to how much pipeline pressure is reduced before venting occurs. On average, up to 90 percent of the gas in the pipeline can be recovered for sale instead of being emitted. Pipeline pump-down techniques are most economical for larger volume, higher pressure gas lines and work most effectively for planned maintenance activities and cases in which sufficient manifolding exists to connect a portable compressor. Many Natural Gas STAR Partners have realized significant economic savings by using pump-dow...|$|R
50|$|As the ET is filled, excess gaseous {{hydrogen}} is <b>vented</b> through umbilical <b>connections</b> {{over a large}} diameter pipe on an arm extended from the fixed service structure. The connection for this pipe between the ET and service structure is made at the ground umbilical carrier plate (GUCP). Sensors are also installed at the GUCP to measure Hydrogen levels. Countdowns of STS-80, STS-119, STS-127 and STS-133 have been halted and resulted in several week delays in the later cases due to hydrogen leaks at this connection. This requires complete draining of the tanks and removal of all hydrogen via helium gas purge, a 20-hour process, before technicians can inspect and repair problems.|$|R
