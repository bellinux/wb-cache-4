50|$|Known as compromising emanations or TEMPEST radiation, a {{code word}} for a U.S. {{government}} programme aimed at attacking the problem, the electromagnetic broadcast of data {{has been a significant}} concern in sensitive computer applications. Eavesdroppers can reconstruct video screen content from radio frequency emanations. Each (radiated) harmonic of the video signal shows a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the picture displayed on the <b>video</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> from the radiated emission by means of a normal television receiver. If no preventive measures are taken, eavesdropping on a <b>video</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> is possible at distances up to several hundreds of meters, using only a normal black-and-white TV receiver, a directional antenna and an antenna amplifier. It is even possible to pick up information from some types of video display units at a distance of over 1 kilometer.

40|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} fields (EMFs) are invisible {{lines of force}} that surround any electrical device, including power lines, electrical wiring, and electrical equipment. Electric fields are produced by voltage and increase in strength as the voltage increases. Magnetic fields result from the flow of current through wires and or electrical devices and increase in strength as the current increases. Most electrical equipment has to be turned on for a magnetic field to be produced, but electric fields are present even when equipment is switched off {{as long as it}} is connected to an electric power source. Electric fields are weakened or shielded by materials that conduct electricity (including human skin). Magnetic fields, on the other hand, pass through most materials and are therefore more difficult to shield and of greater concern.

40|$|To discuss {{videotex}} in {{a comparative}} context {{we need some}} agreed meaning of the term, yet it becomes evident after a little investigation {{that there is no}} clearly delineated or universally accepted meaning. Some authors see the videotex as a generic term for &quot;disseminating information electronically for display on terminals or modified TV receivers.

The connotation 'video' seems to derive from the reference to the terminal as a <b>video</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit,</b> or VDU, since the use of video-tape is not strictly necessary in either broadcast (Teletext) or datacoms (Viewdata) or data transmitted by a telecommunications medium such as a telephone line or a cable which connects computers.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} save energy and improve the performance, various {{electrical}} apparatus are equipped with power electronics. Normally power electronic equipment produce harmonics and high frequency noise. To handle noise emission, power electronic equipment uses EMC filters and are tested according to EMC standards.

The levels of electrical fields in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 30 MHz in office buildings and homes are rather unknown. One reason is lack of civil standards, another is lack of and difficulties in measurements.

40|$|Poor posture {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as one of the}} main factors contributing to the high prevalence of neck pain in <b>video</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> (VDU) users, but no clear association between pain and any particular resting neck posture has been found. Postural awareness of the neck, as indicated by the repositioning accuracy, may therefore be an appropriate measure and potentially useful assessment tool. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether posture and fatigue affect the head repositioning ability in typical VDU usage. A group of 20 healthy participants reproduced a normal comfortable posture for forward, upright and backward chair back inclinations in random order both before and after fatigue of the upper trapezius muscles. Ten repetitions of the posture were recorded for 2 s each, and the angular and translational deviations from the original head position were measured with regard to the external environment (head in space repositioning) and with regard to the trunk (head on trunk repositioning). Analysis by repeated measures ANOVA showed significant effects and interactions of fatigue and chair back inclination on the repositioning errors in the sagittal plane, which typically showed systematic trends towards certain postures rather than random errors around a mean position. While further work is required to examine the ergonomic impact of impaired repositioning ability, head repositioning is sensitive to ergonomic factors such as seating configuration and fatigue, and may therefore be a useful tool for evaluation of static working postures. © 2006 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Because cardiac {{transplantation}} entails neuronal decentralization, cardiac {{responses to}} a psychological stressor in transplant patients {{would be expected to}} rely on circulating hormonal factors and therefore to be delayed and prolonged. We tested this prediction by comparing stress responses after transplantation with those in patients with coronary artery bypass grafts (to control for experience of surgery) or heart failure (to control for heart disease). Methods: Fifty-six transplantation patients, 66 bypass patients, and 40 patients with heart failure underwent a 10 -minute, computer-generated, Stroop color-word conflict test. Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pres-sures were recorded continuously for 1 minute before, during, and 12 minutes after the stressor. Emotional state was measured periodically by questionnaires. Results: All hemodynamic variables were increased by the Stroop test. There was a pattern of blunted response to the Stroop test after cardiac transplantation, particularly in comparison with bypass patients, and slower recovery in comparison with both control groups. Emotional stress responses were similar in each group. Conclusions: This pattern cannot be attributed to the experience of major heart surgery or to cardiac disease. Nor can it be explained by differences in central processing of stress. Correspondingly the changed hemodynamic response to the Stroop test after cardiac transplantation evidently does not affect patients ’ emotional responses. The hemodynamic findings are consistent with an increased reliance on hormonal rather than neuronal hemodynamic regulation after cardiac transplantation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{assessment}} of work-related stress {{it is crucial to}} find the factors that generate and increase it in order to identify categories of individuals at risk, to plan interventions for prevention, elimination or reduction of risk. The aim of the study is to assess the subjective stress in 68 workers of a large Italian company dealing with human health, {{through the use of a}} questionnaire-indicating tool, elaborated by the Italian National Institute for insurance against accidents at work (INAIL) and developed by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). METHODS: We studied a final sample of 68 individuals (34 drivers/rescuers and 34 <b>video</b> <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> (VDU) operators). The questionnaire consists of 35 items (divided into six areas) with five possible answers each, that cover working conditions considered potential causes of stress. RESULTS: The drivers/rescuers had a better performance than the VDU operators, especially in the areas "demand", "relationships" and "role". We compared men and women in the two groups, finding that, in VDU operators, women had a better performance than men in all areas, except "role" and "changes", in which the overall scores were the same in men and women. In the drivers/rescuers women showed more critical scores in the items "relationships" and "change". CONCLUSION: The results show that: the questionnaire-indicating tool is useful, with a demonstrated effectiveness for the occupational physician during the visits and proven validity; additional future efforts should focus on understanding the psycho-social, organizational and individual problems related to stress and the consequent implementation of preventive measures.
