40|$|In rangelands, unlike {{cultivated}} fields, {{soil surface}} conditions and vegetation cover {{are far from}} uniform. Field measurements taken within rangeland environments show that the shape of <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles can vary significantly between wind erosion events. Regression fits used to analyze <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles are therefore better for some events than others. Such variability has usually been explained as experimental error (or noise) or {{as a result of}} the nonuniformity of surface conditions. A computer simulation model (DSism) is used to examine this variability in terms of wind erosion processes. Analysis of these simulation results together with field observations shows that nonuniformity in surface conditions alone cannot explain variations observed in the <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variations in vegetation and soil surface conditions of rangelands add {{a level of}} complexity to wind erosion processes which {{is often difficult to}} model or measure. Butler and colleagues have developed a methodology which combines computer simulation and experimental measurement to analyse how spatial {{and temporal}} changes in dust source area emission rates and atmospheric conditions affect <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles during wind erosion events in the Queensland Channel Country. This methodology has not, however, taken into account how variations in dust source area particle-size can affect <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles. The present paper examines how the particle-size characteristics of dust source soils affect both <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles and the vertical distribution of particle-sizes in two contrasting wind erosion events in the Queensland Channel Country. Comparisons are made between computer simulations of these events and the results of field measurements (of <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles) and laboratory measurements (of dust particle-size). Computer simulations of the particle-size emissions from the different dust source areas during the two events produce vertical distributions of dust particle-sizes which are similar to the measured dust particle-sizes for these events. These results indicate that erodibility-induced spatial and temporal variations in particle-size emissions of dust source areas have important influences upon: dust fluxes, <b>vertical</b> dust <b>concentration</b> profiles and the vertical distribution of dust particle-sizes within these profile...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of nearshore waves and currents are the dominant forcing to cross-shore sand transport on sandy beaches. In the nearshore surf zone, suspended sediment transport attributes {{a significant amount}} of the total transport. The distribution of suspended sand concentration depends on the complex interactions between waves and currents. A good understanding of the time-averaged <b>vertical</b> suspended sediment <b>concentration</b> profile is important in sediment transport calculations. In this study, the influence of hydrodynamics and bedforms on <b>vertical</b> suspended sand <b>concentrations</b> profiles under field conditions is analyzed. Measurements of time-averaged <b>vertical</b> suspended sediment <b>concentration</b> profiles with associated hydrodynamics and bedforms were made in the surf zone near Egmond aan Zee in October 2013. The <b>vertical</b> suspended sediment <b>concentration</b> profiles were measured with 7 optical backscatter sensors placed on top of each other. The bedform configuration was measured using a 3 D ripple scanner. Conflicting to models from literature, results show that the shape of the <b>vertical</b> suspended sand <b>concentration</b> in the surfzone was independent on neither hydrodynamics nor bedform type. All <b>vertical</b> suspended sand <b>concentration</b> profiles, reference concentrations and eddy diffusivities showed similar values for all types of bedforms and hydrodynamic conditions. This may be caused due to the time lag effects in bedform development. Under calm weather conditions, when environmental conditions were not dynamic enough, bedforms can not adjust instantaneously with the hydrodynamic changes. This provides higher sediment concentrations than expected. This tidal asymmetry may have major effects for modelling suspended sand transport in the surf zone...|$|R

50|$|Two {{different}} magneto-aerotactic mechanisms—known as polar and axial—are {{found in}} different MTB strains. Some strains that swim persistently {{in one direction}} along the magnetic field (either north-seeking NS or south-seeking SS)—mainly the magnetotactic cocci—are polar magneto-aerotactic. These magnetotactic bacteria will travel {{along the lines of}} the earth's magnetic field according to their orientation, but will swerve as a group and reverse direction if exposed to a local, more powerful and oppositely-oriented magnetic field. In this way, they continue to travel in the same magnetic direction, but relative instead to the local field. Those MTB that swim in either direction along magnetic field lines with frequent, spontaneous reversals of swimming direction without turning around—for example, freshwater spirilla—are axial magneto-aerotactic and the distinction between NS and SS does not apply to these bacteria. The magnetic field provides both an axis and a direction of motility for polar magneto-aerotactic bacteria, whereas it only provides an axis of motility for axial types of bacteria. In both cases, magnetotaxis increases the efficiency of aerotaxis in <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> gradients by reducing a three-dimensional search to a single dimension.|$|E
40|$|This is {{an essay}} {{concerning}} {{the density of}} the city. An increasing amount of today’s cities have a shortage of space available for the erection of new buildings and settlements, especially in areas close to the city-centre. New buildings and settlements are therefore often found in the outskirts of the city, resulting in long distances between work and living for many people. These long distances are a waste of limited resources and are inconsistent with the vision of the sustainable city. The challenge for the future is to insert new buildings and settlements in the existing city-structure and in this way reduce the distances between different city-functions. The density of the city can be increased in two different ways; by inserting new buildings between existing ones or by extension existing buildings, for example by an additional floor. The subject of this essay is to examine the latter way of increasing the city’s density, that is through extensions of existing buildings by building on rooftops, so called “vertical concentration”. <b>Vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> lacks tradition in Sweden, but is quite common on the European continent, especially in the Netherlands. This essay therefore aims to examine the conditions for <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> to be applied in the city-planning of Sweden, with the city of Norrköping as a case-study. A circumstance which has greatly simplified the implementation of <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> in Sweden came with the introduction of a new regulation concerning “three-dimensional property formation” in 2004. For example, this regulation enables a floor in a building to become a property of its own, separated {{from the rest of the}} building. <b>Vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> gives new opportunities to obtain a mix between spaces for living and working in the same building. For instance it enables a floor of apartments to be put on top of a building consisting of offices. An important aspect to keep in mind when applying <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> is to avoid an impoverishment of city-functions, for example by adding a floor of apartments on top of a dwelling complex. An analysis was carried out of Norrköping and its buildings in order to investigate the town’s suitability for <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration.</b> For a building to be used for <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> it had to pass a number of restrictions formulated in different rules and regulations concerning city-planning.

The <b>vertical</b> <b>concentrations</b> of radioactive Cs in the sediment core varied little from the surface to 9 cm depth: 20 - 30 Bq/g for 137 Cs.

X-ray diffraction analyses of the size-fractionated sample revealed that the contribution of clay minerals (14 Å minerals, kaolin mineral and mica) increased concomitantly with the decrease of particle size, implying a close relation between radioactive Cs concentration and clay mineralogical compositions. Periodical airborne monitoring showed that the 137 Cs inventory in the reservoir catchment area decreased significantly with time after the accident.

However, we show that <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in lake sediments can be higher in the upper, most recently deposited sediment strata, driven largely by natural diagenetic processes and not eutrophication alone. We examined sediment cores from 14 different lakes in New Zealand and China ranging from oligotrophic to highly eutrophic and shallow to deep, {{and found that the}} shape of vertical profiles of total P, a key nutrient for lake productivity, can be similar in sediments across gradients of widely differing trophic status. We derived and applied empirical and mechanistic diagenesis steady state profile models to describe the vertical distribution of C, N and P in the sediments. These models, which focus on large scale temporal (decades) and spatial (up to 35 cm in the vertical) processes, revealed that density-differentiated burial and biodiffusive mixing, were strongly correlated with <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> gradients of sediment C, N and P content, whereas lake trophic status was not. A sensitivity analysis of parameters included in the diagenetic model further showed that the processes including flux of organic matter to the sediment-water interface, burial (net sedimentation), breakdown of organic matter and biodiffusion all significantly can influence the vertical distribution of sediment P content. We conclude that geochemical studies attempting to evaluate drivers of the vertical distribution of sediment C, N, and P content in lake sediments should also account for the natural diagenetic drivers of <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> gradients, assisted with application of similar models to those presented in this study.

Measurements of <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration,</b> χ, profiles of NH 3 concentration were coupled with turbulent diffusivities to determine fluxes, Fg deposition velocities, and canopy resistances, Rc to uptake by the ground. Consistent with published measurements for this site, NH 3 was generally found to deposit efficiently to the vegetation canopy, with mean Rc of 5 and 27 s m− for example days shown. However, short periods of NH 3 emission from the moorland were also observed at small χ (< 0. 3 μgm− 3). Under these conditions of bidirectional exchange, the Rc model does not adequately describe the exchange process, and an alternative model was applied, which treats both the resistance for deposition to leaf cuticles, Rw, and exchange with a “stomatal compensation point,” ξs. This link between y and direction of Fg may result in an important effect of cloud processing: depletion of χ by in-cloud reaction would be expected to favour NH 3 emission from down-wind agricultural land and moorland, though emission from the hill itself during immersion in cloud is unlikely. Comparison of two measurement techniques to determine air concentrations (batch wet rotating denuder, inlet 0. 5 m height; continuous wet denuder, inlets 0. 3, 2 m heights) showed acceptable agreement, although because <b>vertical</b> <b>concentration</b> gradients were large (small Rc) the height of sampling had a substantial effect.

Since the Raman backscatter coefficient was connected with the Raman backscatter differential cross section and the number density of quartz molecules, the mass concentration of quartz in the atmosphere can be estimated from the quartz backscatter coefficient.

The former were more important with the bolus method in both lateral decubitus positions and the latter with the N 2 method in the prone and supine positions. Phases IV and V were mainly gravity dependent. The difference in gravity dependence between the He and N 2 methods appeared to be correlated with the <b>vertical</b> interregional <b>concentration</b> gradients of both gases; indeed the vertical gradient was larger for the 133 Xe bolus inhaled at residual volume (which {{is comparable to the}} He-bolus distribution) than for the 133 Xe residual volume-to-total lung capacity ratio (which is comparable to the N 2 -resident gas distribution). The greater gravity dependence in the lateral decubitus positions than in the supine or prone postures was related to the larger <b>vertical</b> interregional <b>concentration</b> difference {{as well as to the}} more pronounced sequential ventilation in the former positions. Finally the negligible effect of gravity on phase IIIa, its moderate effect on phase IIIb, and its predominant effect on phases IV and V were in agreement with the increased sequential filling and emptying due to gravity near residual volume. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Very large {{vertical}} and longitudinal gradients in the ion concentrations are observed below the F peak near the magnetic equator with the retarding potential analyzer on Ogo 6. Ion concentration 'bite outs' {{of up to}} a factor of 1000 are observed above 400 km. They appear {{to be associated with}} the bottomside of the nighttime F layer. The ion composition in the minima may contain large fractions of ions heavier than O(+) (e. g., NO(+) and Fe(+)).
