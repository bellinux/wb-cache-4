500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of movable type, highly <b>variable</b> <b>spacing</b> was created that could create spaces of any size, and allowed for perfectly even justification. Early American, English, and other European typesetters' style guides (also known as printers' rules) specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. [...] These guides—e.g., Jacobi in the UK (1890) and MacKellar, Harpel, and De Vinne (1866–1901) in the U.S.—indicated that sentences should be em-spaced, and that words should be 1/3 or 1/2 em-spaced. [...] The relative size of the sentence spacing would {{vary depending on the}} size of the word spaces and the justification needs. [...] For most countries, this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century. [...] Yet, even in this period, there were publishing houses (notably in France) that used a standard word space between sentences—a technique called French spacing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{number of}} multi-objective genetic {{algorithms}} (MOGAs) {{have been developed}} to obtain Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization problems. However, as these methods involve probabilistic algorithms, {{there is no guarantee that}} the global search will be conducted in the design <b>variable</b> <b>space.</b> In such cases, there are unsearched areas in the design <b>variable</b> <b>space,</b> and the obtained Pareto solutions may not be truly optimal. In this paper, we propose an optimization method called NSDIRECT-GA to conduct a global search over as much as possible of the design <b>variable</b> <b>space,</b> which improves the reliability of the obtained Pareto solutions. The effectiveness of NSDIRECT-GA was examined through numerical experiments. By NSDIRECT-GA, not only the optimal solutions but also the information of the landscape can be determined, and it is possible to obtain Pareto solutions with higher reliability than with normal MOGAs.
