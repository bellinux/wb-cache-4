25|$|Centered {{above the}} Sanctuary {{on the east}} side of the church is a copper clad cupola {{surrounded}} by twelve ornate gothic arched windows. This feature is reminiscent of the cupolas of the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice. While the lantern provides a striking <b>visual</b> <b>presence</b> it was also built with function in mind. In the days before mechanical fans and air conditioning a series of mechanically operated louvers allowed for window panels to be opened to help cool the sanctuary inside.|$|E
25|$|These {{two parts}} of the church {{represent}} the zenith of the Late Gothic craft of masonry and are perhaps the best examples of the late Flamboyant style in northern France (c. 1480-1525). Its magisterial and arresting <b>visual</b> <b>presence</b> offered visual proof of Louviers’ stability, power, and wealth. Stylistically, the projecting porch and façade created a visual link between Louviers and Rouen, home to very similar Late Gothic monuments and the seat of the powerful archbishop. A veritable lacework of intricately carved stone, the completion of the façade and south porch in 1510 effectively reoriented the entire church. Subsequently, the south porch and portal became the main point of entry and, ultimately, {{the focal point of the}} entire town. Indeed, upon entering Louviers from the south, one witnesses the impressive effect of the alignment of the porch and portal with the “Grand-Rue.” The architecture draws viewers closer, overwhelming them with its visual complexity. Sinuous Flamboyant window tracery, tall ogee gables, an openwork balustrade, spiky pinnacles, and countless sculptures nestled in richly-carved nodding niches give the façade an unmatched quality of richness, visual complexity, and dynamism that was never replicated. Within decades of its completion, the great era of medieval Gothic construction in France drew to a close.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Jumping Flash! 2 {{received}} mostly positive reviews. A reviewer for Next Generation {{commented that}} [...] "While it's nearly impossible for any sequel {{to have the}} same impact as an original, JF2 does an excellent job of recreating the magic of the first game, yet still adds creative details and fresh ideas throughout." [...] He found that like the original, the game is far too easy, and in particular that the impressive <b>visual</b> <b>presence</b> of the bosses is lost when the player defeats them in a matter of seconds. However, he noted that the levels are much larger than the original's and include hidden bonuses, giving it greater longevity. Dan Hsu and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized that the game is more of an expansion pack of the original Jumping Flash! than a new game, while Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer applauded it for having much better graphics and larger levels than the original. IGN staff were impressed by the game's newly expanded worlds and the inclusion of bonus worlds, and noted that despite not significantly differing from the first Jumping Flash!, the game [...] "still delivers". Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu awarded the game as among the top 120 games reviewed by the publication in 2000.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his <b>visual</b> <b>presence</b> yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E

2500|$|Skyhooks {{formed in}} March 1973 in Melbourne with Steve Hill on vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Ingliss on guitar (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band), Macainsh on bass guitar and backing vocals, Peter Starkie on guitar and backing vocals (Lipp & the Double Dekker Brothers) and Strauks on drums and backing vocals. The name, Skyhooks, {{came from a}} fictional {{organisation}} in the 1956 film Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Their first gig was on 16 April 1973 at St Jude's Church hall in Carlton. At a later gig, former Daddy Cool frontman, Ross Wilson was playing in his group Mighty Kong with Skyhooks as a support act. Wilson {{was impressed with the}} fledgling band and signed Macainsh to a publishing deal. In August, Bob [...] "Bongo" [...] Starkie (Mary Jane Union) on guitar replaced his older brother Peter (later in Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons) and Ingliss was replaced by Red Symons (Scumbag) on guitar, vocals and keyboards. The two new members added a touch of theatre and humour to the band's <b>visual</b> <b>presence.</b> By late 1973, Wilson had convinced Michael Gudinski to sign the band to his booking agency, Australian Entertainment Exchange, and eventually to Gudinski's label, Mushroom Records.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rapid {{increase}} in the development of 3 D contents and technologies, such as 3 D movies and virtual/augmented reality [32]. As interest in the use of 3 D technology increases, researchers have paid more attention to the effect of 3 D contents on user experiences.

30|$|The bone healing {{assessment}} on plain X-ray {{is highly}} subjective, with wide inter- and intra-observer variation; the bone mineralization is better assessed {{in terms of}} pixel value ratio (PVR: ratio of pixel value of regenerate to adjacent bone) on picture archiving and communication system (PACS) digitized radiographs, providing objective assessment of callus formation [8].

30|$|In prior work, it {{is known}} that 3 D convey a higher sense of {{presence}} or realism but also increases visual fatigue. A recent study found that 3 D movies have little effect on viewers’ emotional responses as compared to 2 D movies [11], except for a thrilling scene from The Polar Express. This particular scene had a great influence on user emotion, with greater 3 D effects than used in other films. While there are many studies comparing 2 D and 3 D on user experience, such as <b>visual</b> fatigue, <b>presence,</b> and emotion [5 – 7], {{little is known about the}} effect of emotional movie.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} foveal microstructural {{changes and}} to determine its association with visual outcomes after reattachment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRDs) by scleral buckling (SB) or pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Methods: Using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), foveal microstructure in eyes with macula-off RRD were studied 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months after PPV or SB and correlated with visual outcomes. Results: Forty-two eyes {{were included in the}} final analysis. Even with improved microstructural changes and normalization of retinal structures on OCT, final visual acuity was not correlated with microstructural changes in eyes undergoing PPV. In the SB group, final visual acuity was significantly correlated with an intact inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction (P = 0. 013). There was no significant correlation between final <b>visual</b> acuity and <b>presence</b> of subretinal fluid (SRF) in either group. Conclusion: After SB, eyes with an intact IS/OS junction had better final visual acuity. In the PPV group, there was no significant correlation between microstructural changes and <b>visual</b> acuity. The <b>presence</b> of SRF did not influence final visual acuity in both groups...|$|R

40|$|While {{the museum}} {{profession}} has long engaged {{with issues of}} education and access in managing and displaying its collections, modes of cultural representation in museums are being challenged {{in the twenty-first century}} by social and technological changes, particularly by the global extent of digital information and the development of social media using internet and web-based technologies. The Virtual Museum of the Pacific (VMP) is a social media platform for a Digital Ecosystem which is designed to enable a variety of user communities to engage with the Pacific Collection of the Australian Museum. While museums worldwide increasingly have a virtual presence, the VMP facilitates the development of culturally relevant folksonomies and provides user groups with invidualised ontological relationships for object discovery and annotation. Each user community may create its own specific annotations and may, in turn, be influenced by the annotations of other user communities. The aim is to facilitate on-line community interaction using social-media technologies to extend the annotation of objects to suit the stakeholder 2 ̆ 7 s own needs. The success of the system depends on leveraging the diffusion of language and encouraging a conversation between on-line communities. This will enable the development of new <b>visual</b> <b>presences</b> and the creation of cultural knowledge via the contribution of creator communities. In this paper, we outline a preliminary evaluation of the potential impact of this Digital Ecosystem on modes of knowledge creation and cultural representation for museums. We define the scope for the social tagging component of the information model and discuss how users might interact with objects in terms of their knowledge base as well as contribute to ongoing taxonomic definitions. Given its capacity to facilitate multi-directional E-learning using new technology, we demonstrate that the Virtual Museum of the Pacific is a significant model for online community interaction and learning in the contemporary museum environment...|$|R

We examine the role of one’s body in collaborative work and how it affects presence disparity, articulating four design implications for embodiments in mixed presence groupware to mitigate the effects of presence disparity: embodiments should provide local feedback; they should visually portray people’s interaction with the work surface using direct input mechanisms; they should display fine-grain movement and postures of hand gestures, and they should be positioned within the workspace.
