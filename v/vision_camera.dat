25|$|In August 2010, {{with the}} release of the WM Series II range, Holden {{announced}} the Statesman model had been discontinued, with the Caprice being split into two models and reduced in price. This was due to the lesser sales of the Statesman. In 2013, Holden updated the WM II to become the WN Caprice. This involved the fitment of the VF Commodore Calais V interior and alloy wheels. This update also includes the Caprice PPV which gets the interior from the VF Commodore Evoke which also includes a column gear change leaving the 9C3 version to be discontinued for 2014. In 2015 the Caprice PPV like the WN & Middle Eastern Counterparts gets the same rear <b>vision</b> <b>camera</b> as a new feature. In 2014 the base Caprice was discontinued leaving the Caprice V as the only model in the Holden range. The final, WN series II of 2015 dropped the V6 engine option and was solely available with the LS3 V8; minor external changes included new wheels.|$|E
25|$|The Caprice was updated for 2011 {{to include}} the {{features}} that Holden included the Holden Caprice. The Caprice lettering engraved on the chrome trim which was on the car from 2000 until 2010 on the trim was dropped & replaced by a Caprice nameplate badge which is below the chrome trim on the left end of the rear fascia on the trunk. The V6 engines were dropped in the LS & LTZ leaving the V8 as the standard engine while the LS got the rims that were previously on the LTZ from 2007-2010 as well as previously seen on the VE Commodore V based on the Omega Series I model, while the LTZ & Royale get the rims seen on the VE Commodore Calais V Series II & the 2010-2011 Chevrolet Omega Fittipaldi Edition and the SS now gains the rims that the WM Caprice V Series II has. The LS, LTZ, & Royale still retain the Statesman front bumper, while the SS still retains the Caprice/Caprice V front bumper. The Royale also gains a rear <b>vision</b> <b>camera</b> in the chrome trim on the trunk which is absent on the LS, LTZ, & SS like the Holden Caprice & Caprice V. For the 2013 model year for the Caprice SS the Impala badge on the trunk was dropped {{in favor of the}} traditional Chevrolet bowtie.|$|E
500|$|Atop the {{previous}} formula {{is a new}} plot, a cooperative multiplayer mode, Xbox Live <b>Vision</b> <b>Camera</b> support, 32 new types of piñata creatures, and two separate areas to trap piñatas. These latter areas—the Dessert Desert and Piñarctic—let the player set traps for wandering piñatas to bait, capture, {{and return to the}} garden. At a later player experience level, the player can add sand and ice to their main garden for the piñatas. In the new plot, the player must repopulate a database of piñata information that has been maliciously erased. Trouble in Paradise includes new challenges in which the player finds and indulges a specific piñata with actions it likes such that the piñata can be sent happily to a party somewhere around the world. The game also adds fashion show and side-scrolling racing minigames. A new [...] "Trick Stick" [...] lets players teach piñatas to perform new tricks. Up to four players can join together on Xbox Live to garden in the same plot. The plot's owner can set restrictions on what other players can access. Up to two players can join together locally on the same Xbox 360. The game's additional [...] "Just for Fun" [...] mode is designed for younger children by eliminating monetary restrictions, evil piñatas, and ruffian characters that might otherwise frustrate the player. These malicious [...] "sour" [...] piñatas, who try to poison the other piñatas, can be tamed to peaceably join the player's garden. Players can use the Xbox Live <b>Vision</b> <b>Camera</b> to scan collectible cards and unlock piñatas and items. New controls were added to streamline the player's interface interactions, and a leaderboard added for players to compare their progress.|$|E

40|$|In {{this project}} the {{investigators}} propose {{to design and}} implement a gyro stabilized multisensory system, which will accommodate a spherical manipulator platform equipped with commercially available laser range finder sensor, an orientation and sensors and <b>vision</b> <b>cameras.</b> Combining these technologies will allow creating a 3 D map of the surrounding environment...|$|R
500|$|Reviewers {{considered}} some of {{the smaller}} additions useful and others gimmicky. Critics appreciated the release's time-saving interface tweaks and overall pacing, but thought, for instance, that the <b>vision</b> <b>camera</b> integration added little to the game. While Electronic Gaming Monthly had wanted more development of the story, Mc Shea (GameSpot) was grateful that the story remained in the background of the game. [...] While Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that loading times had been improved, Geddes (IGN) considered them [...] "frustratingly long". Considering the previous game's slow start, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) thought that Trouble in Paradise did a better job of introducing the player to the world by pre-loading player gardens with animals, plants, and decorations, and offering a tutorial. He wondered whether the game went too far, from too slow to hyperactive.|$|E
2500|$|... is a {{video game}} of the party genre {{released}} worldwide in 2008 & 2009 for the Xbox 360 console that is bundled with the Xbox Live <b>Vision</b> <b>Camera,</b> developed by Zoë Mode. It was released by Codemasters in North America and the PAL territories in 2008, and in Australia and Japan in 2009. The game {{is a process of}} filming a movie on one of the 30 scenarios that can involve up to four people. Actions include the application of make-up, jogging in place, driving a car and playing volleyball. Previous video can be stored on the console, as well as to send to friends via e-mail. The game was first previewed at Microsoft's Press Conference at E3 2008 in July 2008. It was later shown at the Games Convention one month later. The game has met with mixed reviews, receiving criticism for the Xbox Live <b>Vision</b> <b>Camera</b> bundled with the game.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{praised the}} {{addition}} of online multiplayer, stating that it [...] "has some neat ideas that keep things interesting a bit longer." [...] Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead was more critical, stating use of the Xbox Live <b>Vision</b> <b>camera</b> was [...] "an oddly remote and distant way of playing." [...] GameZone's reviewer disagreed, noting that use of the camera set the game apart from other titles. [...] The reviewer further praised the game's sound effects, saying that they [...] "carried the game forward." ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike RADAR which {{relies on}} doppler shifts to {{directly}} measure speed or LIDAR which {{relies on the}} principle of time-of-flight to calculate speed, VIDAR measures the speed of vehicles by means of tracking an object through <b>vision</b> <b>cameras.</b> High precision speed measurement can be achieved if stereoscopic vision techniques are used.|$|R

40|$|One {{goal of the}} "Demo III" {{unmanned}} {{ground vehicle}} program is to enable autonomous nighttime navigation at speeds of up to 10 m. p. h. To perform obstacle detection at night with stereo vision will require night <b>vision</b> <b>cameras</b> that produce adequate image quality for the driving speeds, vehicle dynamics, obstacle sizes, and scene conditions that will be encountered. This paper analyzes the suitability of four classes of night <b>vision</b> <b>cameras</b> (3 - 5 micrometer cooled FLIR, 8 - 12 micrometer cooled FLIR, 8 - 12 micrometer uncooled FLIR, and image intensifiers) for night stereo vision, using criteria based on stereo matching quality, image signal to noise ratio, motion blur and synchronization capability. We find that only cooled FLIRs will enable stereo vision performance that meets {{the goals of the}} Demo III program for nighttime autonomous mobility...|$|R
2500|$|The game allows {{use of the}} Xbox Live <b>Vision</b> <b>camera</b> {{to operate}} the {{flippers}} and to video chat with Xbox Live opponents. [...] It also features leaderboards and online multiplayer for up to four players. [...] Multiplayer games are won by being the first to achieve the set high score, which can be adjusted from 10 to 100 million points. Penalties can also be set for losing a ball with players losing anywhere from 5 to 25 percent of their score when a ball is lost.|$|E
2500|$|Video game reviewers from gaming {{websites}} {{and magazines}} mainly criticized {{the game for}} the Xbox Live <b>Vision</b> <b>Camera</b> bundled with the game. Even before the game's release, EyeToy's Sandy Spangler {{thought there would be}} some technical difficulties with players; he stated, [...] "They're using some technical elements that are not reliable, at least not according to our experience. They're using background subtraction to put you in the movie, and it's not very robust, that's why we haven't done it in any of our games." ...|$|E
2500|$|The OFC (Optical Fire Control) -3 {{electro-optical}} {{fire control}} {{system is a}} modular design that consists of a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can {{be replaced by a}} laser designator (for the laser beam riding SAM), the TV camera can be replaced by a night <b>vision</b> <b>camera,</b> and the IR camera can be replaced by an ImIR, at higher cost. Development to incorporate the dual band IR, night <b>vision</b> <b>camera,</b> and the color TV camera has been successfully completed, but it is unclear if these newly developed versions will be [...] installed on any of the ships. [...] The OFC-3 optronics is designed by the Central China Optronic (electro-optical) Research Institute. [...] Although the advanced versions have been [...] successfully tested, only the most basic version have been installed on board Type 052C class, as acknowledged by the developer, and domestic Chinese media rumored the main reason was to reduce the cost. [...] However, the adaptation of the most basic version of OFC-3 results in great decrease in the performance and effectiveness of the main gun, because without the laser designator needed, laser beam riding and semi-active laser guided projectiles can not be deployed for the Type 210 100 mm naval gun.|$|E
