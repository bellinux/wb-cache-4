Dissidents left to form the U Chit Hlaing Faction, which subsequently splintered into the Home Rule Party and the Hlaing-Myat-Paw GCBA. The rump of the GCBA became known as the <b>Soe</b> <b>Thein</b> GCBA, named after its leader U <b>Soe</b> <b>Thein.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{transition}} Saya San {{made from}} a medical man to a political activist is not very clear. People {{tend to believe that}} he joined the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) led by U <b>Soe</b> <b>Thein</b> in 1920s. He began his political career as a representative of his village and soon progressed to lead his township and district branch of Moulmein. In 1924, at the annual congress of the GCBA, 45-year-old Saya San was elected to chair a commission to survey the living conditions of the Burmese peasantry.|$|R

50|$|On 28 June 2015, he {{resigned}} from the USDP, along with the Kayah State ministers for transportation, electric power, industry, and Bamar ethnic affairs. On 13 July 2015, the USDP released a statement that Khin Maung Oo had in fact been sacked for “disturbing party unity” and violating the party’s policy for the Burmese general election, 2015. The conflict was related to disagreements with the national headquarters of USDP regarding the permission for 2 government ministers, Aung Min and <b>Soe</b> <b>Thein,</b> to contest safe seats in Kayah State for the elections. The seats they had contested in the Burmese general election, 2010 were now occupied {{by members of the}} National League for Democracy and considered more challenging to win.|$|R
5000|$|Myanmar barred foreign {{observers}} {{and the international}} media from the election. The election commission chief, <b>Thein</b> <b>Soe,</b> did add, however, that diplomats and representatives from UN organisations in {{the country would be}} allowed to observe the election. He justified the decision saying [...] "We are holding the election for this country. It's not for other countries ... We will have credibility after holding the election in front of all the people." ...|$|R
