40|$|This paper fully {{describes}} the working principle of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> in single-screw expanders (SSEs). A geometric analysis of suction and volume ratio <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{is presented to}} determine the relations between volume ratio, suction closure volume, discharge opening volume and <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) thermodynamic model with SSE integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> is developed to analyze the power output of SSE and the net power output of ORC system and variation law of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> displacement. Analysis of a typical ORC system under changing operating conditions shows that the power output of the expander and the net output power of the ORC system with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> are much better than those without <b>slide</b> <b>valves.</b> When the condensing temperature is 40 Â°C and the waste availability is 80 kW, the increase in output power and net output power are approximately 3. 4 kW and 5 kW, respectively. The presented geometric analysis of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and the thermodynamic model integrated with <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> {{can be used to}} provide a theoretical and technical basis for designing the <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> of SSEs and the control strategies of <b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> under varied operating conditions...|$|R

50|$|Brass {{instruments}} with valves have {{an inherent}} intonation defect in that valve combinations {{tend to be}} sharp. This is because the open horn is in a pitch of (for example) B, so depressing the first valve lowers the pitch to Ab. Depressing the second valve in isolation lowers the pitch to A natural. But together, these two valves produce a sharp G natural, because the second <b>valve</b> <b>slide,</b> which is long enough to lengthen a B horn to A natural, is slightly too short to lower the longer A horn to G. Combinations using all three valves have even worse intonation, so instruments need some means to compensate. Trumpets and flugelhorns commonly have saddles or triggers on the first and/or third valve slides to allow lengthening of the valve slides, while on larger instruments like the euphonium and tuba, such devices are impractical. Instead, better-quality tubas and euphoniums are provided a fourth valve, which {{takes the place of}} the 1-3 valve combination and allows use of 2-4 in place of 1-2-3. Better manufacturers of three-valve instruments such as Sousaphones often make the third <b>valve</b> <b>slide</b> long enough to partially address this deficiency. Also, many tuba models place the first <b>valve</b> <b>slide</b> in a position where it may be manipulated by the musician with the left hand during playing, which allows tuning for the always-flat 5th partial harmonic at the C below middle C.|$|E

This article has only considered inside-admission piston valves until now, but outside-admission <b>valves</b> (<b>slide</b> <b>valves</b> and some piston valves) can use Walschaerts valve gear. If the valves have outside admission the radius bar connects to the combination lever below the valve stem rather than above.|$|R

50|$|The {{pitch of}} a brass {{instrument}} {{is determined by}} its vibratory length, which determines the fundamental frequency of the open instrument and the frequencies of its overtones. Additional pitches are achieved by varying the length using the instrument's <b>valve,</b> <b>slide,</b> key or crook system. The fundamental frequency is not playable on some brass instruments. The table provides the pitch of the second overtone (an octave above the fundamental frequency) and length for some common brass instruments in descending order of pitch. This pitch is notated transpositionally as middle C {{for many of these}} brass instruments.|$|E

5000|$|B basso - not {{possible}} on F horn, unless you pull all the <b>valve</b> <b>slides</b> and tuning slide out {{as far as}} they will go (without detaching) and then use the 123 fingering.

5000|$|The {{models with}} reduced bell and bore size design {{originate}} in 19th century pocket cornet design and regularly suffer from poor intonation and severely hindered dynamic and timbral range. As the bell {{is not the}} standard size, no standard mute can be applied. The models with standard bell and bore size design originally appeared in the USA in as late as 1968, mostly following the design of trumpet builder Louis Duda (one-piece hand-hammered [...] "5X" [...] bell, cornet-wound lead pipe, straight-back first <b>valve</b> <b>slide</b> with thumb-throw, fold-back third slide), and manufactured by the Benge Trumpet company. [...] It has been claimed to be [...] "the 'gold standard' by which other professional pocket trumpets are measured".|$|E
5000|$|The {{fingering}} schema {{arises from}} the length of each valve's tubing (a longer tube produces a lower pitch). Valve [...] "1" [...] increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step, valve [...] "2" [...] by one half step, and valve [...] "3" [...] by {{one and a half}} steps. This scheme {{and the nature of the}} overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes. For example, third-space [...] "C" [...] can be produced with no valves engaged (standard fingering) or with valves 2-3. Also, any note produced with 1-2 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 - each drops the pitch by [...] steps. Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages, or to aid in intonation. Extending the third <b>valve</b> <b>slide</b> when using the fingerings 1-3 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{solution}} for euphonium or tuba {{is called a}} compensating system, and these {{have been made in}} both three- and four-valve versions. In a compensating system, the tubing from the final valve is routed back to the first valve, and each of the valves before the final one is fitted with a short <b>valve</b> <b>slide</b> in addition to the normal ones. When the third or fourth valve, as applicable, is depressed in combination with any of the other valves, the additional tubing brings the pitch into tune. This has the primary effect of making the lowest octave playable including B natural (unplayable on non-compensating horns), and a secondary effect of putting low B natural and C natural into tune. Compensating systems add weight and [...] "stuffiness" [...] to a horn, so they are not commonly fitted to tubas. They find principal use in euphoniums, in which virtually all professional models are compensating. Some French horns have an altogether different system: they have a complete set of slides on each valve in B, parallel to the F slides. Pressing a separate trigger routes the air through the B slides vice the F slides, and via shorter tubing to the bell. Intonation is less of a problem in French horn, because it usually plays using higher harmonics where use of the 1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations is not needed.|$|E

An analysis of stability and transparency of the closed-loop teleoperation system is carried out.
