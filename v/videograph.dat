This also motivates to provide readability to blind. With this backdrop in this paper we have devised a microcontroller based mechanised <b>videographing</b> of text. It is also proposed to voice text the <b>videographed</b> text in real time.

After a series of events, the couple decides to commit suicide. At this juncture, here arrives Advocate Sukran (Vijay), the Protagonist who advices them to face all troubles boldly. They start living in a small house and one day when she is in her nightdress they forces her again the couple gets harassed by the police and Sandhya gets arrested on false charges of prostitution. All efforts by Ravi to get her out on bail is futile. An agitated Ravi shoots the inspector, the judge, and the Minister's son who raped his girlfriend and escapes with her from the court.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose <b>VideoGraph,</b> a {{graphical}} object-based model for representing and querying video data. We capture the temporal relationships among individual video events {{in addition to their}} semantics. These inter-event relationships allow us to deduce implicit video information. In this model, uncertainty can be handled by associating the video event with a temporal Boolean-like expression, which enables exploitation of incomplete information. The above features make <b>VideoGraph</b> very flexible in representing various metadata types extracted from diverse information sources. To facilitate video retrieval, we also introduce a query language based on path expressions...|$|E

40|$|The essay {{raises the}} {{question}} of what it actually means to work with concepts of intermediality in literary studies. It uses as an example a Ph. D project which compares story-telling in literary texts and <b>videographed</b> testimonies by Shoah survivors. It soon becomes clear that that a strictly "intermedial" approach does not fully serve the purpose. Instead, one should try to maintain a literary studies perspective even on other forms of media. To illustrate this, the essay presents an analysis of <b>videographed</b> testimonies using categories taken from literary narratology. It thereby shows the problems as well as the merits of such an approach, at the limits of the discipline...|$|R

40|$|Modeling {{video data}} poses a great {{challenge}} since {{they do not have}} as clear an underlying structure as traditional databases do. We propose a graphical object-based model, called <b>VideoGraph,</b> in this paper. This scheme has the following advantages: (1) In addition to semantics of video individual events, we capture their temporal relationships as well. (2) The inter-event relationships allow us to deduce implicit video information. (3) Uncertainty can also be handled by associating the video event with a temporal Boolean-like expression. This also allows us to exploit incomplete information. The above features make <b>VideoGraph</b> very flexible in representing various metadata types extracted from diverse information sources. To facilitate video retrieval, we also introduce a formalism for the query language based on path expressions. Query processing involves only simple traversal of the video graphs. 1 Introduction We deal with the modeling aspect of video database manageme [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Physics {{education}} {{research has shown}} that students tend to struggle when trying to use mathematics in a meaningful way in physics (e. g., mathematizing a physical situation or making sense of equations). Concerning the possible reasons for these difficulties, little {{attention has been paid to}} the way mathematics is treated in physics instruction. Starting from an overall distinction between a technical approach, which involves an instrumental (tool-like) use of mathematics, and a structural one, focused on reasoning about the physical world mathematically, the goal of this study is to characterize the development of the latter in didactic contexts. For this purpose, a case study was conducted on the electromagnetism course given by a distinguished physics professor. The analysis of selected teaching episodes with the software <b>Videograph</b> led to the identification of a set of categories that describe different strategies used by the professor to emphasize the structural role of mathematics in his lectures. As a consequence of this research, an analytic tool to enable future comparative studies between didactic approaches regarding the way mathematics is treated in physics teaching is provided...|$|E
40|$|A Routine is {{described}} {{which is a}} collection of computer-programed techniques designed for the interpretation of meteorological satellite <b>videograph</b> observations. From the inferred evolution of the mass-structure distribution, the Routine diagnoses the horizontal velocity distribution for one or more isentropic surfaces. Using the horizontal velocity distribution as input, the Routine further derives net horizontal and net vertical, parcel-displacements (in the synoptic range of scale) for specified regions and periods of time. This permits pattern configurations of layer-cloudiness to be remapped to later positions which are consistent with the mass-motion evolutions. The use of the Routine for interpreting satellite cloud observations is illustrated by the presentation of two case studies. The layer-cloudiness distributions for the initial and terminal times of each case are analyzed primarily from the TIROS operational nephanalysis. The initial distribution of layer-cloudiness is rembpped in accordance with the net horizontal displacement field. The cloud evolutions are shown and comparisons are made between the joint 24 -hr. cloud displacement and net vertical, parcel-displacement patterns and the verifying layer-cloudiness distributions. A close correspondence is found between the terminal position of the displaced cloudiness and the verifying cloudiness distributions. The patterns evolved in the hoiizontally displaced cloudiness are realistic reflections of the stages of development associated with vortex cloud patterns. Net vertical, parcel-displacement fields are generated which are consistent with conventional synoptic desiderata and the observed cloudiness. The results indicate that the major portion of layer-cloudiness distributions in the synoptic range of scale in extratropical latitudes can be accounted for by the time-integrated, horizontal and vertical parcel-displacements. The implications of these results to the objective use of satellite data are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Treatment {{of asthma}} {{does not always}} comply with asthma {{guidelines}} (AG). This may be rooted in direct or indirect resistance on the doctors 2 ̆ 019 and/or patients 2 ̆ 019 side or be caused by the healthcare system. To assess whether patients 2 ̆ 019 concepts and attitudes are really an implementation barrier for AG, we analysed the patients 2 ̆ 019 perspective of a 2 ̆ 01 cgood asthma therapy 2 ̆ 01 d and contrasted their wishes with current recommendations. Methods Using a qualitative exploratory design, topic centred focus group (FG) discussions were performed until theoretical saturation was reached. Inclusion criteria were an asthma diagnosis and age above 18. FG sessions were recorded audio-visually and analysed via a mapping technique and content analysis performed according to Mayring (supported by MAXQDA). Participants 2 ̆ 019 speech times {{and the proportion of}} time devoted to different themes were calculated using the <b>Videograph</b> System and related to the content analysis. Results Thirteen men and 24 women aged between 20 and 77 from rural and urban areas attended five FG. Some patients had been recently diagnosed with asthma, others years previously or in childhood. The following topics were addressed: (a) concern about or rejection of therapy components, particularly corticosteroids, which sometimes resulted in autonomous uncommunicated medication changes, (b) lack of time or money for optimal treatment, (c) insufficient involvement in therapy choices and (d) a desire for greater empowerment, (e) suboptimal communication between healthcare professionals and (f) difficulties with recommendations conflicting with daily life. Primarily, (g) participants wanted more time with doctors to discuss difficulties and (h) all aspects of living with an impairing condition. Conclusions We identified some important patient driven barriers to implementing AG recommendations. In order to advance AG implementation and improve asthma treatment, the patients 2 ̆ 019 perspective needs to be considered before drafting new versions of AG. These issues should be addressed at the planning stage. Trial registration DRKS 00000562 (German Clinical Trials Registry) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how administrators’ {{perceived}} the campus and administrative cultures found on a single campus of a multicampus community college system. A review of the literature revealed that the culture found in higher education institutions contains a high degree of human interactions, has a myriad of cultures, and that individuals play a significant role in the maintenance or the evolution of the cultures present. The study site was Neighborhood Campus which is one campus of a large urban community college system containing a total of eight campuses, Urban College. Kuh’s conventional organizational models served to identify the model on Neighborhood Campus, Levin’s cultural definitions described the campus culture, and cultural definitions from Bergquist and Pawlak formed the framework for the administrative culture. The study was guided by the following research questions: What are the administrators’ perspectives of the campus culture on a community college campus and what are the administrators’ perspectives of the administrative culture on a community college campus? A qualitative case study method was used, data collection included interviews, document and <b>videograph</b> reviews, and observations of administrative meetings. The participants for the interview portion of the study included 10 individuals defined as administrators. ^ The study revealed that administrators’ perspectives of these cultures demonstrated five themes (student-centered, size, location, Hispanics, and family) served as contributors to the campus culture. The administrative culture was supported by six themes (size, team, collaboration, open, Inclusion, and rewards and recognition). ^ The findings revealed three of Kuh’s conventional organizational models (rational, bureaucratic, and collegial models) were seen as being in place at Neighborhood Campus. Levin’s traditional and service cultures were seen in the campus culture with the service culture demonstrating dominance. Using Bergquist and Pawlak’s definitions, components of the collegial, managerial, and developmental cultures appear to be present in the administrative culture with the collegial culture serving as the dominant administrative culture. ^ Through an understanding of these cultures and themes, administrators can provide leadership that is sensitive to these cultures, especially if institutional change is required. ...|$|E
