40|$|Bleeding of {{epoxy resin}} around {{surfaces}} undergoing bonding during electronic packaging assembly has long caused sporadic yield loss. Previously, {{it was thought}} that <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking</b> reduced the yield loss resulting from surface contaminants. Although <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking</b> inhibits epoxy resin bleeding, it also produces coatings of hydrocarbons, which affect surface wettability and surface energy. Surfactant coating results in a surface chemistry similar to vacuum-baked substrates but is a better alternative because of its controllability. Epoxy bleeding is commonly observed in electronic packages around silicon chips attached with epoxy resin to substrates having gold or other metal surfaces. In severe cases, the bleeding contaminates the wire bond pads, causing failure. The effects of bleeding are often critical in advanced packaging components such as ceramic pin grid array (CPGA) substrates. In particular, when there is very little clearance between a bond finger tier and the die, minor resin bleedout can interfere with wire bondability. During the time that CPGA technology has been used here at HP’s Integrated Circuit Business Division in Singapore, we have experienced sporadic yield loss caused by epoxy bleeding. This is known to be an industry-wide problem. For several years the cause of the yield loss was unresolved. With increasing pin count and decreasing clearance between the die and the substrate cavity, resolving the problem has become more urgent. Earlier studies 1 led us to resort to countermeasures like <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking</b> to reduce yield losses. However, the studies were not comprehensive enough to verify the effectiveness of <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking,</b> and yield losses have continued to occur from time to time for no apparent reason. We had not yet investigated the possibility that surface contamination, resulting from <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking,</b> can hav...|$|E

We reveal that the residual resistance decreases with field at B_rf≲ 40 mT and strongly increases in chemically treated niobium at B_rf > 80 mT. We find that BCS surface resistance is weakly dependent on field in the clean limit, whereas a strong and peculiar field dependence emerges after 120 ^∘C <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking...</b>|$|E

40|$|The DIII-D tokamak <b>vacuum</b> vessel <b>baking</b> {{system is}} used to heat the vessel walls and {{internal}} hardware to an average temperature of 350 C to allow rapid conditioning of the vacuum surfaces. The system combines inductive heating and a circulating hot air system to provide rapid heating with temperature uniformity required by stress considerations. In recent years, the time to reach 350 C had increased from 9 hrs to 14 hrs. To understand and remedy this sluggish heating rate, {{an evaluation of the}} baking system was recently performed. The evaluation indicated that the mass of additional in-vessel hardware (50 % increase in mass) was primarily responsible.

The improvements are directly attributable to reduced impurity levels and reduced plasma recycling losses.

After the {{successful}} accomplishment of vacuum commissioning assisted by <b>vacuum</b> vessel <b>baking</b> and glow discharge cleaning, KSTAR had {{shifted to the}} cool-down phase in April 2, 2008 and completed cooling of all superconducting coils and structures down to the operation temperature of 4. 5 K {{for about a month}} by the helium refrigerator system with 9 KW cooling capacity. For the next a month, all superconducting coils were tested individually and conjunctively to investigate the controllability of coil current and field configuration for plasma discharge. Finally, we achieved the plasma with the current up to 130 mA and pulse width over 800 msec. For the surveillance and operation of KSTAR for Day-I campaign, 11 plant measurement & control systems were implemented, and also diagnostic DAQ systems for gathering the plasma physics data. Furthermore, machine interlock system and personal safety system worked to prevent KSTAR from serious damages and to protect personnel from hazardous events, respectively. The peculiar feature of KSTAR integrated control system is to has introduced EPICS(Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) as the middleware to integrate whole above heterogeneous local control systems. Therefore, it was highly demanded to verify the adaptability of EPICS and the performance of our control system to meet the requirements of Tokamak operation in the continuous plant operation and the pulse-related experiment.

40|$|For {{production}} of fabricated potato chips, two potato- cultivars namely, Agria and Marfona, {{were obtained from}} Daran region of Isfahan Province and stored in cool storage at a proper and constant conditions (T = 9 °C and RH= 85 %). Specific gravity, dry matter and reducing sugars were determined at the time. Potato granule was prepared from both the cultivars by the Add-back procedure. To prepare a sheetable dough, potato granule, corn flour, emulsifier, shortening, water, starch, salt and wheat flour were used. After formulation of a non- adhesive dough, it was sheeted to thickness of mm and formed into slices of 3 cm diameter.

40|$|Inadequacy of {{mass loss}} {{cleanliness}} criteria for {{selection of materials}} for contamination sensitive uses, and processing of flight hardware for contamination sensitive instruments is discussed. Materials selection for flight hardware is usually based on mass loss (ASTM E- 595). However, flight hardware cleanliness (MIL 1246 A) is a surface cleanliness assessment. It is possible for materials (e. g. Sil-Pad 2000) to pass ASTM E- 595 and fail MIL 1246 A class A by orders of magnitude. Conversely, {{it is possible for}} small amounts of nonconforming material (Huma-Seal conformal coating) to not present significant cleanliness problems to an optical flight instrument. Effective cleaning (precleaning, precision cleaning, and ultra cleaning) and cleanliness verification are essential for contamination sensitive flight instruments. Polish cleaning of hardware, e. g. <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking</b> for vacuum applications, and storage of clean hardware, e. g. laser optics, is discussed.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{characteristics}} of microwave <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking</b> and drying of oolong and analyzes the influence of microwave power and vacuum degree in the drying process on the moisture in the tea. According to the variation law of moisture, it explores the relationship between time and wet base moisture contents under different microwave powers and vacuum degrees, {{as well as the}} kinetic mathematical model of vacuum drying for oolong using the microwave. Based on the energy balance between the sensible heat, latent heat and the absorptive microwave energy, this model builds verification test by a large number of experimental data and the results indicate that within certain range of radiation power and thickness, the temperature and moisture content of oolong are uniformly distributed, even more uniform especially in the drying period; generally, the temperature distribution within the oolong fails to show integrity. The free water and water vapor may flow as permeate stream in the internal part of oolong under the action of pressure gradient. The migration intensity mainly depends on the intensity of microwave radiation and initial moisture content; the mathematical model established on this basis could better simulate the microwave vacuum drying process of oolong. Due to its high simulation accuracy, {{it can be used to}} describe the variation of moisture content with the drying time and power. The test results provide a technical basis for the controllable industrial production of oolong baking...|$|E
40|$|Additive Manufacturing of {{metallic}} {{components for}} aerospace applications offers many advantages over traditional manufacturing techniques. As a new technology, {{many aspects of}} its widespread utilization remain open to investigation. Among these are the cleaning processes {{that can be used}} for post finishing of parts and measurements to verify effectiveness of the cleaning processes. Many cleaning and drying processes and measurement methods that have been used for parts manufactured using conventional techniques are candidates that may be considered for cleaning and verification of additively manufactured parts. Among these are vapor degreasing, ultrasonic immersion and spray cleaning, followed by hot air drying, <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking</b> and solvent displacement drying. Differences in porosity, density, and surface finish of additively manufactured versus conventionally manufactured parts may introduce new considerations in the selection of cleaning and drying processes or the method used to verify their effectiveness. This presentation will review the relative strengths and weaknesses of different candidate cleaning and drying processes as they may apply to additively manufactured metal parts for aerospace applications. An ultrasonic cleaning technique for exploring the cleanability of parts will be presented along with an example using additively manufactured Inconel 718 test specimens to illustrate its use. The data analysis shows that this ultrasonic cleaning approach results in a well-behaved ultrasonic cleaning/extraction behavior. That is, it does not show signs of accelerated cavitation erosion of the base material, which was later confirmed by neutron imaging. In addition, the analysis indicated that complete cleaning would be achieved by ultrasonic immersion cleaning at approximately 5 minutes, which was verified by subsequent cleaning of additional parts...|$|E
40|$|The near-surface {{nanostructure}} of niobium {{determines the}} performance of superconducting microwave cavities. Subtle variations in surface nanostructure lead to yet unexplained phenomena such as the dependence of the quality factor of these resonating structures on the magnitude of rf fields—an effect known as the “Q slopes”. Understanding and controlling the Q slopes is of great practical importance for particle accelerators. Here we investigate the mild baking effect— 120 °C <b>vacuum</b> <b>baking</b> for 48  hours—which strongly affects the Q slopes. We used a hydrofluoric acid rinse alternating with oxidation in water {{as a tool for}} stepwise material removal of about 2 [*][*]nanometers/step from the surface of superconducting niobium cavities. Applying removal cycles on mild baked cavities and measuring the quality factor dependence on the rf fields after one or several such cycles allowed us to explore the distribution of lossy layers within the first several tens of nanometers from the surface. We found that a single HF rinse results in the increase of the cavity quality factor. The low field Q slope was shown to be mostly controlled by the material structure within the first six nanometers from the surface. The medium field Q slope evolution was fitted using linear (∝B peak surface magnetic field) and quadratic (∝B^{ 2 }) terms in the surface resistance and it was found that best fits do not require the quadratic term. We found that about 10  nanometers of material removal are required to bring back the high field Q slope and about 20 – 50  nanometers to restore the onset field to the prebaking value...|$|E
