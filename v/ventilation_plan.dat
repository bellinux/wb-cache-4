40|$|The study {{addresses}} Hydrogen Sulphide (H 2 S) in coal seams. The {{objectives of}} the project were to undertake a comprehensive series of interrelated studies to gain {{a full understanding of}} this complex mine production problem. The goal was to understand how, where and why high concentration zones of H 2 S occur, how does gas release from the coal mass occur, can concentrations be diluted or neutralised through improved ventilation, water, chemical or microbiological infusion, chemical solution sprays and can mining approaches be modified to contain the problem. A multidisciplined approach has been used for related investigations. Systems and the output streams available for H 2 S detection and monitoring have been examined. The large variations in H 2 S concentration measurements from different face sources and the physical differences in the longwall face, <b>ventilation</b> <b>plan,</b> and operating procedures make the interpretation of gas concentration data difficult. Respiratory filters represent a cost-effective and short-term safe way to protect miners from potentially lethal environment. A selection of cartridge and Racal airstream helmet filters has been described and some tests into filter life and efficiency undertaken. The mine ventilation system can be modified to allow safe production through H 2 S affected zones.

40|$|Effective <b>ventilation</b> <b>planning</b> {{is vital}} to {{underground}} mining. To ensure stable operation of the ventilation system and to avoid airflow disorder, mine ventilation network (MVN) models {{have been widely used}} in simulating and optimizing the mine ventilation system. However, one of the challenges for MVN model simulation is that the simulated airflow distribution results do not match the measured data. To solve this problem, a simple and effective calibration method is proposed based on the non-linear optimization algorithm. The calibrated model not only makes simulated airflow distribution results in accordance with the on-site measured data, but also controls the errors of other parameters within a minimum range. The proposed method was then applied to calibrate an MVN model in a real case, which is built based on ventilation survey results and Ventsim software. Finally, airflow simulation experiments are carried out respectively using data before and after calibration, whose results were compared and analyzed. This showed that the simulated airflows in the calibrated model agreed much better to the ventilation survey data, which verifies the effectiveness of calibrating method...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{awareness}} {{of a healthy}} work environment is common to all industries and the stone industry is no exception. The presence of operating diesel equipment, welding, stone production blasting, and silica dust in a working environment all contribute to air quality issues in underground stone mines. Particularly recognized is the exposure of workers to diesel particulate matter (DPM). Recent regulations call for a DPM standard of 160 TC ug/m 3 (TC = Total Carbon). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has conducted research to improve the ventilation of these mines and consequently reduce the exposure of workers to harmful airborne contaminants. The results {{have shown that the}} ventilation of underground stone mines can be significantly enhanced using improved ventilation controls and techniques. Large-opening stone mines present specialized ventilation challenges because their entries are much larger than in other types of mines. Most stone mines have entries about 40 feet wide and up to 30 feet high, with bench areas that may extend even higher. These large entries present the positive opportunity to move large air quantities at relatively low mine fan pressures resulting in lower fan horsepower and reduced operating costs. However, the difficulty in ventilating large-opening mines is that even with large air volumes, the air velocity is often less than 100 feet/minute. Higher ventilation velocities more quickly dilute and remove contaminants from the face areas. Higher ventilation airflow velocities can be achieved by effective <b>ventilation</b> <b>planning</b> and proper choice of ventilation fans...|$|R
