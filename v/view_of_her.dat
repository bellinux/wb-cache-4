There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> subjects. Her eldest son, later King João VI, was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.|$|E

5|$|Senator Kelly is {{abducted}} by two more of Magneto's minions, Toad and Mystique, and {{is brought to}} their hideout on the uncharted island of Genosha. There, Magneto uses Kelly as a test subject for a machine powered by his magnetic abilities that generates a field of radiation, inducing mutation in normal humans. Kelly later escapes {{by taking advantage of}} his newfound mutation. When Rogue uses her power on Wolverine in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> classmates, she is convinced by Mystique, disguised as classmate Bobby Drake, that Xavier is angry with her and she should leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant-locating machine Cerebro to find Rogue at a train station, and the X-Men go to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mystique enters Cerebro and sabotages it.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached between Elizabeth's and Polish delegates in Sieradz on 26 February 1383. The queen dowager thereby proposed her youngest daughter Hedwig as Louis' successor in Poland, and absolved the Polish nobles from their 1382 oaths to Mary and Sigismund. She agreed to send Hedwig to be crowned in Kraków but requested that, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> age, she spend three more years in Buda following the ceremony. The Poles, entangled in a bloody civil war, initially conceded to the requirement, but soon found it unacceptable for their monarch to reside abroad for so long. At the second meeting in Sieradz, held on 28 March, they contemplated offering the crown to Hedwig's distant relative, Duke SiemowitIV of Masovia. They eventually opted against it, but at the third Sieradz meeting, on 16 June, Siemowit himself decided to lay claim to the crown. Elizabeth reacted by having an army of 12,000 men devastate Masovia in August, forcing him to drop his pretensions. Meanwhile, {{she realized that she}} could not expect the nobles to accept her request and instead resolved to delay Hedwig's departure. Despite continuous Polish demands to expedite her arrival, Hedwig did not move to Kraków until the end of August 1384. She was crowned on 16 October 1384. No regent was appointed, and the 10-year-old exercised her authority according to the advice of Kraków magnates. Elizabeth never saw her again.|$|E

Head's deeply personal poems also could be said to suggest that Ruth had at some point been pregnant (maybe more than once) and perhaps even to term.|$|E
25|$|Baroness Thatcher died of {{a stroke}} in London on 8 April 2013 {{at the age of}} 87. On 17 April, the former Prime Minister was honoured with a {{ceremonial}} funeral. Due to the polarised <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> achievements and legacy, reaction to her death was mixed throughout the United Kingdom, with her memory evoking both intense praise and criticism. The funeral, including a formal procession through Central London, followed by a church service at St Paul's Cathedral, cost around £3.6million including £3.1million for security. The funeral was notable for the attendance of Queen Elizabeth II. All four of her successors as Prime Minister paid homage at the funeral. Her body was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium following the funeral.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1970s, three film {{accounts}} of the White Rose resistance were produced. The first was a film financed by the Bavarian state government entitled Das Versprechen (The Promise) and released in the 1970s. The film is not well known outside Germany, {{and to some extent}} even within the country. It was particularly notable in that unlike most films, it showed the White Rose from its inception and how it progressed. In 1982, Percy Adlon's Fünf letzte Tage (The Last Five Days) presented Lena Stolze as Sophie in her last days from the point of <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cellmate Else Gebel. In the same year, Stolze repeated the role in Michael Verhoeven's Die Weiße Rose (The White Rose).|$|E
25|$|The equestrian {{statue of}} Peter the Great is {{situated}} in the Senate Square (formerly the Decembrists Square), in Saint Petersburg. Catherine the Great, a German princess who married into the Romanov line, was anxious to connect herself to Peter the Great to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the people. She ordered its construction, and had it inscribed with the phrase Petro Primo Catharina Secunda MDCCLXXXII in Latin and Петру перьвому Екатерина вторая, лѣта 1782 in Russian, both meaning 'Catherine the Second to Peter the First, 1782', an expression of her admiration for her predecessor and her <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own place in the line of great Russian rulers. Having gained her position through a palace coup, Catherine had no legal claim to the throne and wanted to represent herself as Peter's rightful heir.|$|E
25|$|In the Italian mini series, , Julia {{was portrayed}} by Vittoria Belvedere {{as a very}} tragic character, a victim of {{domestic}} abuse and rape.

The character in question has lost her husband and both of her two boys (inaccurately) to illness. She is at first innocent, loving, and beloved deeply by her father, but she gets mixed up in an affair with her father's enemy as the result of depression brought on by Tiberius' cruelty towards her. The series took a more modern <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> affairs, that among her lovers, she had only one true love: Iullus Antonius.|$|E

25|$|Through her back-story {{we learn}} that her {{religious}} vows didn't stop her physical urges, {{and she had a}} relationship with an evil aristocrat, Egidio, who pushed her to become his accomplice in the murder of a nun: this is her tormenting secret. The principal female characters, Agnese and Lucia, meet Gertrude (The Nun of Monza) while escaping from the villain Don Rodrigo. They shelter in her convent, looking for hospitality. Gertrude becomes close to Lucia. Egidio asks her to help him to kidnap Lucia on behalf of the bandit Innominato, who is working for Rodrigo. She at first refuses, then gives in, and later confesses her crimes. Her decision is difficult for her, emphasizing Manzoni's <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> as a weak tool of evil, unable to resist threats and temptations, but basically not cruel. Later in the novel, at the end of Chapter 37, Lucia learns of Gertrude's repentance, confession of guilt, and consequent sentence.|$|E
25|$|From 1 May 1948 until 1 January 1963, Zadoks {{worked as}} {{part-time}} conservator of ancient coins and cut gems at the Koninklijk Penningkabinet, then located in The Hague. She {{then became a}} lecturer in classical archaeology at the University of Groningen. Prior to this appointment she had been lector in archaeology for many years, following the retirement of archaeologist G. van Hoorn in 1951 and the departure of his replacement G. H. Beyen soon after. Her initial appointment as a lecturer was for a fixed term of five years, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> background as an archaeologist and art historian rather than the more traditional foundation of classical philology. She published ten books and {{more than two hundred}} articles, and is credited with changing the face of classical archaeology in the Netherlands. She is also credited with stimulating the still nascent discipline of formal numismatic study in the Netherlands, particularly the work of Wim van Es. Her work inspired the publication of a Festschrift on the occasion of her 70th birthday, with a foreword and praise of Zadoks' work by Elizabeth Visser (1908–1987), the first female professor of ancient history in the Netherlands.|$|E
