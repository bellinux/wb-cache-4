40|$|Substantial {{surficial}} {{deposits of}} many tropical climate regions {{are covered by}} tropical residual soils. The weathering process forms a layered sloping soil of Grade VI and Grade <b>V</b> <b>soil</b> mantle with variable hydraulic conductivities, ksat which creates capillary barrier effect at the interface of Grade VI and Grade <b>V</b> <b>soil</b> layers. Although the capillary barrier effect impedes downward water infiltration, the water diversion capacity is limited and the moisture content increases at the interface {{that can lead to}} potential slope failure. Hence, this study investigates the effects of employing transport layer to increase the diversion capacity at the interface of Grade VI and Grade <b>V</b> <b>soil</b> layers via laboratory experiments, field monitoring and numerical modelling. A laboratory physical slope model was developed to perform infiltration tests with five (5) configuration schemes of Grade V and Grade VI soils sandwiched by four (4) different types of transport layer, i. e. Gravel, Drainage Cell (DC) +Gravel, Sand and DC+Sand, and without transport layer. A total of thirty two (32) infiltration tests were performed in this study. Three research plots i. e. a control plot without transport layer and two (2) plots with sand transport layer as well as with gravel transport layer were constructed and instrumented to monitor rainfall, runoff, amount of diverted water and matric suction distribution. The monitoring was performed during wet period from September 2014 to January 2015 where the soil experienced high water content but low matric suction. Subsequently, the two-layered slope with and without the transport layers was numerically simulated using a finite element method to validate the field data and to determine the best modelling scheme to represent the residual soil slope model with transport layers. The results of the laboratory experiments clearly shows that the transport layer sandwiched between the Grade VI and Grade <b>V</b> <b>soil</b> layers was capable of diverting the infiltrating water above the interface. There was a significant increase of matric suction measured at the interface of soil layers with DC + Gravel transport layer as compared to that without the transport layer especially for 2 -hr and 24 -hr rainfall intensities while the effect was insignificant for 7 -day rainfall intensity. Field monitoring also indicates that the initial matric suction value in the control plot responded to the infiltration and reached a matric suction value that corresponds to the breakthrough suction of 5. 0 kPa after series of rainfalls. However, the initial matric suction values were relatively maintained in the plots with transport layers to indicate that the transport layer played the role of increasing the amount of diverted water at the interface. The finding was supported by the results of amount of diverted water collected at the research plots. Continuum model is capable of modelling the effects of employing transport layer at the interface by subdividing the layer into multiple isolated zones with different average ksat. The results of the analysis demonstrated that the capability of transport layer to maintain the matric suction and to divert water was governed by the contrast in the ksat where the higher ksat of gravel shows a better performance as compared to sand. A combination of initial suction at 30 kPa, 0. 5 m thickness of sandy silt (Grade VI), 0. 3 m thickness of gravel transport layer and 21 ° slope angle resulted in a diversion length of more than 15 m. However, the lower initial suction value due to rainfall infiltration during wet period yielded a shorter diversion length...|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} describing the factors and processes which determine the measured C- 14 ages of soil calcium carbonate. Pedogenic carbonate forms in isotopic equilium with soil CO 2. Carbon dioxide in soils {{is a mixture}} of CO 2 derived from two biological sources: respiration by living plant roots and respiration of microorganisms decomposing soil humus. The relative proportion of these two CO 2 sources can greatly affect the initial C- 14 content of pedogenic carbonate: the greater the contribution of humus-derived CO 2, the greater the initial C- 14 age of the carbonate mineral. For any given mixture of CO 2 sources, the steady-state (14) CO 2 distribution <b>vs.</b> <b>soil</b> depth can be described by a production/diffusion model. As a soil ages, the C- 14 age of soil humus increases, as does the steady-state C- 14 age of soil CO 2 and the initial C- 14 age of any pedogenic carbonate which forms. The mean C- 14 age of a complete pedogenic carbonate coating or nodule will underestimate the true age of the soil carbonate. This discrepancy increases the older a soil becomes. Partial removal of outer (and younger) carbonate coatings greatly improves the relationship between measured C- 14 age and true age.

Also a freshly treated, 1. 50 m long wooden log section was suspended outside in a large cylinder to collect runoff. The Cu:As:Cr (molar) ratios of the average metal contents in the soil samples collected at a distance of 0 m, and in the runoff from the pole segment, were 100 : 46 : 56 and 100 : 44 : 57, respectively.

Soil test calibration relationships were developed for relative grain yield <b>v.</b> <b>soil</b> test using (i) all soils, (ii) Calcarosols, and (iii) all ‘soils other than Calcarosols’. Colwell-P and DGT-P calibration relationships were also derived for Calcarosols and Vertosols containing measureable CaCO 3. The effect of soil P buffer capacity (measured as the single-point P buffer index corrected for Colwell-P, PBICol) on critical Colwell-P values was assessed by segregating field sites based on their PBICol class: very very low (15 – 35), very low (36 – 70), low (71 – 140), and moderate (141 – 280). All soil P tests, except Mehlich 3 -P, showed moderate correlations with relative grain yield (R-value ≥ 0. 43, P 0. 45 decreased in the order: DGT-P (r = 0. 55), Colwell-P (r = 0. 49), CaCl 2 -P (r = 0. 48), and BSES-P (r = 0. 46). These results support the potential of DGT-P as a predictive soil P test, but indicate that Mehlich 3 -P has little predictive use in these soils. Colwell-P had tighter critical confidence intervals than any other soil test for all calibrations except for soils classified as Calcarosols. Critical Colwell-P values, and confidence intervals, for the very very low, very low, and low P buffer capacity categories were within the range of other published data that indicate critical Colwell-P value increases as PBICol increases. Colwell-P is the current benchmark soil P test used in Australia and for the field trials in this study. With the exception of Calcarosols, no alternative soil P testing method was shown to provide a statistically superior prediction of response by wheat. Although having slightly lower R-values (i. e. < 0. 1 difference) for some calibration relationships, Colwell-P yielded tighter confidence intervals than did any of the other soil tests. The apparent advantage of DGT-P over Colwell-P on soils classified as Calcarosols was not due to the effects of calcium carbonate content of the analysed surface soils. Simon D. Speirs, Brendan J.

40|$|Cosmogenic {{radionuclides}} {{are commonly}} used to determine local surface lowering rates e. g., erosion rates of outcrops, {{and can be used}} to infer soil production rates by sampling saprolite and using the saprolite lowering rate as the conversion rate of saprolite to soil (Wilkinson and Humphreys, 2005). Among the various cosmic ray scaling considerations, inferring soil production rates requires an account of saprolite shielding by soil, and situations where time-invariable soil depth applies are commonly sought. However, invariable local soil depth over {{tens of thousands of years}} is unrealistic at many sites, especially where the last glacial period may have been accompanied by different rates of erosion than those observed today. Testing the constant soil depth assumption has been accomplished in two ways: morphometric analysis and slope process modelling (Heimsath et al., 1997; Heimsath et al., 2000) and, the emergence of tors from the surrounding soil (Heimsath et al., 2001). A further method involves measuring erosion rates from various parts of the catchment. For instance, in the Blue Mountains (33 °S and ~ 1000 m. a. s. l. in the southeastern highlands of Australia), the erosion rate of a small catchment, determined from the 10 Be concentration of stream sediment, is greater than all soil production rates from within that catchment. This casts doubt on the veracity of the apparent soil production rates since calculations of catchment erosion rates are not dependent upon a constant soil depth assumption. Apparent soil production rates may be artificially low if the modern soil depth, used in surface lowering calculations, was thinner for the bulk of the 10 Be accumulation time. Considering the site was above the treeline during the LGP (Hesse et al., 2003), soil production rates are recalculated using a soil cover 30 cm thinner than that observed; this revision corresponds with the absence (and probable erosion) of saprolite below soils less than ~ 30 cm deep, and the presence of saprolite under deeper soil. Revised soil production rates overlap the catchment average; furthermore, the revised soil production function (plot of soil production rate <b>v.</b> <b>soil</b> depth) accords with models from the literature. This TCN data set adds to mounting evidence that the Blue Mountains were dramatically affected by the last glacial period. Not only was aeolian transport and sand dune formation active, but generally, soils were probably ~ 30 cm thinner on plateaux surfaces, and ~ 10 % of surfaces likely experienced total soil and saprolite erosion. These phenomena were probably a result of sparse, treeless vegetation (Hesse et al., 2003) which contrasts with heath and forest that currently covers the entire plateau surface. 1 page(s...|$|E

Experiments were conducted in Ou Reang 0 v district during two years with contrasting rainfall. Peanut was the most reliable crop with successful establishment in both EWS and MWS, and harvestable yield at 80 % of sites. Consistently high peanut yields were obtained on Koinpong Siem soils (2. 1 - 3. 4 t/ha), but MWS yields were depressed on average by 0. 5 t/ha, possibly due to greater waterlogging. On Ou Reang 0 v and Labansiek soils, peanut yields varied with site and season, but were generally higher in 2005 than 2004, again possibly due to lower waterlogging prevalence. By contrast, soybean failed on all occasions in the EWS either due to lack of crop establishment or yields that were too low to justify growing this crop. In the MWS, soybean yields of up to 3. 3 t/ha were attained on Kompong Siem soils. Like peanut, soybean yields in the MWS were inconsistent on the Ou Reang 0 v and Labansiek soils. Mungbean failed to produce harvestable yield on 63 % of EWS sites, but on Kompong Sieni and Ou Reang 0 <b>v</b> <b>soil,</b> if establishment was successful, mungbean produced grain yield of 0. 9 - 1. 3 t/ha. On the same soils in the MWS, mungbean yields were 0. 2 - 1. 5 t/ha. Mungbean failure on Labansick soils, in both EWS and MWS in 2004 and 2005 was attributed to soil acidity. Maize was inconsistent in its performance. Over 50 % of sowings in 2005 failed due to drought which caused poor crop emergence and establishment. Yields up to 4. 5 t/ha were obtained on Labansiek soils in 2004, but no yield was obtained in the same soil type in 2005. Drought, soil acidity and inadequate N fertilizer are suggested to be the main factors accounting for the unreliable performance of maize. High yields of all crops except sesame were achievable but actual yields were variable among soils, sites and season.

40|$|As {{study area}} we {{selected}} the glacier foreland of Morteratsch (approx. 1900 – 2100 m a. s. l.) near Pontresina {{northwest of the}} Bernina pass, Upper Engadine, Grisons (Switzerland). The {{aim of this study}} is a multimethodological approach using floristic inventories, vegetation and soil mapping of the pro-glacial area in order to detect crucial parameters controlling plant resettlement in recently deglaciated areas as related to time, local microtopography and soil development. The following methodological approaches were included in this study: (i) floristic relevees along a chronosequence covering 134 years (1857 – 1990); (ii) dendrochronological data on tree establishment, collected on a grid with a mesh width of 40 m in the area, which became ice-free between 1857 and 1980; (iii) vegetation mapping; (iv) soil analyses including physical and chemical properties of 11 typical profiles; (<b>v)</b> <b>soil</b> mapping and (vi) data evaluation using GIS. Retreating glaciers successively expose mineral substrates that are colonised within a few years by vascular plants, mosses, lichens and soil biota. With increasing plant cover, also the abundance of soil organic matter increases. At first sight, the large-scale patterns of vegetation and soil seem to be driven by the time since deglaciation, whereas the small scale patterns may appear chaotic since they depend on local site conditions, which may change dramatically over short distances. The large-scale pattern seems to develop as follows. About 7 years after deglaciation the first pioneer plants establish themselves and form after an additional 20 years period the Epilobietum fleischeri community, which today dominates the recently deglaciated areas, but may be found in patches more or less on the whole pro-glacial area. By contrast, the first elements of the short living Oxyrietum digynae community appear approximately 10 years after deglaciation and persist for only about 30 years. Dendrochronology showed that the first European larch and Swiss stone pine trees established themselves 15 and 31 years, respectively, after deglaciation. Surprisingly, on the study area, Swiss stone pine is about twice as frequent as the typical pioneer species European larch (88 stems per ha vs. 45 stems per ha), despite the fact that larch starts earlier and grows faster than Swiss stone pine (annual height increment: 21 cm vs. 8 cm). Up-to-now, however, nowhere in the 150 -year-old glacier foreland a near-to-mature larch-Swiss stone pine forest can be found. Besides large-scale factors such as time since deglaciation, topography and disturbance (floods, rockfalls, avalanches), also small-scale factors such as grain size and water content of the substrate, micro-relief and micro-climate seem to be crucial for the development of both vegetation and soil. Time since deglaciation and a straightforward single-pathway succession model are clearly not sufficient for understanding the small-scale patterns of succession. A non-linear succession model with different starting points and different pathways of potential primary successions for the different ecological niches is more promising for describing accurately the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics of the pro-glacial area of Morteratsch...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{developing}} {{a clear understanding}} of the impacts and benefits of the two most common types of agriculture, traditional tillage agriculture (TA) and Conservation Agriculture (CA), a no-till system, with respect to their effects on soil carbon pools. It is based on a meta analysis of scientificliterature, attempting to reduce the existing uncertainty about the impact of soil management practices on soil carbon pools. The results from literature review on carbon sequestration in TA are compared with CA, a broader agro-ecosystem management concept thatrequires compliance with three interrelated criteria, namely minimum or no mechanical soil disturbance, permanent organic soil cover, and diversifiedcrop associations and rotations. The review shows that CA permits higherrates of carbon sequestration in the soil compared with TA. When no carbon sequestration or carbon loss is reported in agricultural systems, this is most frequently associated with any one or a combination of the following reasons:i) soil disturbance, ii) monocropping, iii) specific crop rotations, iv) poormanagement of crop residues, and <b>v)</b> <b>soil</b> sampling extended deeper than 30 cm. Most of the world’s agricultural soils have become depleted in organic matter and soil health over the years under TA, compared with their state under natural vegetation. This degradation process has proved to be reversible and the main ways to increase soil organic matter content and improve soil health seem to be: i) keeping the disturbance impact and interactions betweenmechanical implements and soil to an absolute minimum, ii) using effective crop rotations and associations, and iii) leaving crop residues as carbon source on the soil surface. The implementation of these practices can help restore a degraded agro-ecosystem to a sustainable and productive state. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is generally non-linear over time and theeffectiveness of conversion of a farming system from TA to CA depends on a number of variables: for example, soil carbon sink strength increases most rapidly soon after a carbon-enhancing change in land management has beenimplemented, and reduces with time as the stable SOC stock approaches a new equilibrium which in agricultural soils in Europe for example can takeapproximately 100 years after a carbon-enhancing land use change has been introduced. Even though some authors report significant increase in microbial activity soon after transition to CA, fuller advantages of CA in terms of soil health and its productive capacity can usually be observed only in the mediumtolonger-term, when CA practices and soil biological processes become well established within the farming system. The study discusses the effectiveness of using average rates of soil carbon content for estimating sequestration at the global level. In reality, thereare different carbon pools in the soil undergoing transformation from theundecomposed form to decomposing unstable form to decomposed stable form. The carbon sequestration potential of any soil, for the carbon pool considered,depends on the vegetation it supports (which influences the amount and chemical omposition of organic matter being added), soil moisture availability, soil mineralogical composition and texture, depth, porosity and temperature. Therefore, when addressing carbon sequestration, rates should always be referred to specific carbon pools, as each carbon category has highly differentturnover rates. Another aspect of CA in relation to carbon budgets are the reduced powerand energy requirements as a result of not tilling the soil. This translates intoless fuel consumption, lower working time and slower depreciation rates ofequipment per unit area per unit of output, all leading to emission redu[ [...] . ...|$|E

Hydroponics has the main {{advantage}} of providing easy access to the root system and is therefore commonly used for gene expression analyses in molecular studies of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the impact of root substrate on plant growth remains poorly documented. Here we show that hydroponics accelerates both shoot growth and developmental phases as compared with culture on soil. In order to identify molecular changes in the roots that could account for these medium effects, a transcriptomic comparison was performed by microarray analysis. This experiment revealed that more than 20 % of the genes were differentially expressed in hydroponics <b>vs</b> <b>soil.</b> Among them, the flowering time gene FLOWERING LOCUS C and two clades of microRNA targeted genes.

40|$|Soils contain {{about three}} {{times the amount of}} carbon {{globally}} available in vegetation, and about twice the amount in the atmosphere. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) has been reduced in many areas, while an increase in atmospheric CO 2 has been detected. Recent research works have shown that it is likely that past changes in land use history and land management were the main reasons for the loss of carbon rather than higher temperatures and changes of precipitation resulting from climate change. The primary scope of this work was to estimate soil organic carbon stock (CS) variations in Italy during the last three decades and to relate them to land use changes. The study was also aimed at finding relationships between SOC and factors of pedogenesis, namely pedoclimate, morphology, lithology, and land use, but also at verifying the possible bias on SOC estimation caused by the use of data coming from different sources and laboratories. The soil database of Italy was the main source of information in this study. In the national soil database is stored information for 20, 702 georeferentiated and dated observations (soil pro- files and minipits) analysed for routine soil parameters. Although the observations were collected from different sources, soil description and analysis were similar, because all the sources made reference to the Soil Taxonomy and WRB classification systems, and soil analyses followed the Italian official methods. Besides horizon description and analysis, soil observations had a set of site information including topography, lithology, and land use. The SOC and bulk density referred to the first 50 cm, thus CS was calculated {{on the basis of the}} weighted percentage of SOC, rock fragments volume, and bulk density. A set of geographic attributes were considered to spatialize point information, in particular, DEM (100 m) and derived SOTER morphological classification, soil regions (reference scale 1 : 5, 000, 000) and soil systems lithological groups (reference scale 1 : 500, 000), soil moisture and temperature regimes (raster maps of 1 km pixel size), land cover (CORINE project, reference scale 1 : 100, 000) at three reference dates: years 1990 and 2000, and an originalupdate to 2008, obtained with field point observations. The interpolation methodology used a multiple linear regression (MLR). CS was the target variable, while predictive variables were the geographic attributes. Basic statistical analysis was performed first, to find the predictive variables statistically related to CS and to verify the bias caused by different laboratories and surveys. After excluding the biased datasets, the best predictors were selected using a step-wise regression method with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as selection and stop criterion. The obtained MLR model made use of the following categorical attributes: (i) decade, (ii) land use, (iii) SOTER morphological class, (iv) soil region, (<b>v)</b> <b>soil</b> temperature regime, (vi) soil moisture regime, (vii) soil system lithology, (viii) soil temperature, (ix) soil aridity index (dry days per year), and, (x) elevation. The interaction between decade and land use variables was also considered in the model. Results indicated that CS was highly correlated with the kind of main type of land use (forest, meadow, arable land), soil moisture and temperature regimes, lithology, as well as morphological classes, and decreased notably in the second decade but slightly increased in the third one, passing form 3. 32 Pg, to 2. 74 Pg and 2. 93 Pg respectively.

40|$|The total uptake {{of carbon}} dioxide by {{ecosystems}} via photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP) is the largest flux in the global carbon cycle. A key ecosystem functional property determining GPP is the photosynthetic capacity at light saturation (GPPsat), and its interannual variability (IAV) is propagated to the net land–atmosphere exchange of CO 2. Given the importance of understanding the IAV in CO 2 fluxes for improving the predictability of the global carbon cycle, we have tested a range of alternative hypotheses to identify potential drivers {{of the magnitude of}} IAV in GPPsat in forest ecosystems. Our results show that while the IAV in GPPsat within sites is closely related to air temperature and soil water availability fluctuations, the magnitude of IAV in GPPsat is related to stand age and biodiversity (R 2 = 0. 55, P < 0. 0001). We find that the IAV of GPPsat is greatly reduced in older and more diverse forests, and is higher in younger forests with few dominant species. Older and more diverse forests seem to dampen the effect of climate variability on the carbon cycle irrespective of forest type. Preserving old forests and their diversity would therefore be beneficial in reducing the effect of climate variability on Earth's forest ecosystems. Interannual variability (IAV) of the net carbon dioxide exchange over land is globally the main determinant of the variability of atmospheric CO 2 growth rate 1, 2. So understanding the factors controlling the IAV in CO 2 fluxes is essential to improve the predictability of the global carbon cycle 3. Ecosystem biotic properties — such as soil and canopy nutrient status, rates of change in physiological properties of the vegetation, or the sensitivity of these properties to environmental factors — influence ecosystem CO 2 exchange. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} IAV of the carbon budget can be better explained by variation in biotic properties of ecosystems such as photosynthetic capacity (GPPsat) than directly by environmental and climatic drivers 4,​ 5,​ 6. GPPsat is defined as the value of gross primary productivity (GPP) at saturating light under non-stressed conditions, minimizing the influence of anomalous hydrometeorological conditions (for example, droughts and heatwaves), which potentially affect photosynthesis. A robustly retrieved characterization of GPPsat can be regarded as an ecosystem functional property reflecting the physiological response of the ecosystem to the environment. Given that IAV of GPPsat must propagate to observed GPP, this quantity is thought to be a key variable in understanding IAV of carbon fluxes 7. In fact, recent studies demonstrated that GPPsat correlates more strongly than any climatic variable with annual GPP 8, but also correlates with net ecosystem CO 2 exchange 5. The magnitude of IAV in GPPsat has been shown to exhibit considerable variation across ecosystems 9, yet no obvious explanation for this pattern has been reported in the literature. However, the consequences are important: a low IAV in GPPsat would suggest that ecosystem functioning is not very sensitive to climatic variability, and that it preserves its functionality under the influence of that variability — and, likewise, high IAV is a consequence of high sensitivity. The capability of an ecosystem to preserve its functioning and structure over time (after external disturbances or climate extremes), is often defined as ecosystem stability and is linked to ecosystem resilience 10. Using this terminology, low values of IAV in GPPsat can be understood as a characterization of high ecosystem functional stability. The relation of ecosystem functionality, structure and stability has been a matter of debate for many decades in the field of ecology. In particular, the diversity of vascular plants has been investigated as a stabilizing factor with respect to variations in productivity, for example by buffering the ecosystem’s sensitivity to climate extremes 11. However, it is also well known that plant diversity is co-limited by soil properties 12, ecosystem management, and climate conditions. Another variable to consider is stand age (the mean age of the forest stand or the number of years after a major stand replacement after disturbance), which may affect ecosystem stability through adaptation, particularly of trees to their environment — hence increasing ecosystem resilience to climate variability 13. Moreover, structural parameters such as canopy cover, rooting depth, canopy height or leaf area index (LAI), which also depend on tree species diversity and stand age 14, have an important effect on the ecosystem response to variation in environmental drivers since they define the capacity of trees to access resources such as water and light 15. For instance, a regional study in the Amazon basin has shown that GPP, derived from the remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index, is less sensitive to environmental influences in regions with high canopy cover 16. Despite this growing body of ecological knowledge, it remains largely uncertain which factors stabilize ecosystem functional properties at the global scale. In particular, we do not understand the causes of variability of specific ecosystem functional properties, such as photosynthetic capacity across ecosystem types, which ultimately controls ecosystem productivity. Here we hypothesize that stand age and species diversity play an important role in stabilizing ecosystem photosynthetic capacity. We test this hypothesis while also considering other factors related to climate, water availability, forest structure and soil properties that might have direct or indirect effects on ecosystem photosynthetic capacity. In this study, we used measurements of ecosystem-level fluxes, and climate variables (temperature, precipitation, and water availability), species richness, stand age, forest structure (canopy cover, height, and LAI), and soil properties (nutrient availability 17) derived from satellite data, in situ observations and the literature (see the Methods). We used half-hourly ecosystem-level GPP fluxes estimated by the means of the eddy-covariance technique at 50 FLUXNET sites 18 with at least 4 years of measured fluxes, and with different vegetation types across different climatic regions. We included data from evergreen forest (EF) as well as deciduous broadleaved and mixed forest (DBMF) located in temperate, boreal, mediterranean, tropical and dry climate regions (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Table 1). All 50 sites have information on stand age (referred to simply as ‘age’ in Figs 1 – 3) and species richness in addition to the CO 2 flux data. Species richness (‘sp. no. ’ in Figs 1 – 3) is the number of dominant plant species (for example tree or herb) that account for a cumulative abundance of 90 percent at a given site. We collected additional information on (i) canopy cover, (ii) canopy height, (iii) LAI, (iv) temperature and precipitation, and (<b>v)</b> <b>soil</b> water availability index (WAI) for a subset of 44 sites; and (vi) an index of nutrient availability for 36 sites compiled from the literature 17 (see Methods) ...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how {{communities}} assemble is {{a central}} goal of ecology. This is particularly relevant for communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), because the community composition of these beneficial plant symbionts influences important ecosystem processes. Moreover, AMF {{may be used as}} sensitive indicators of ecological soil quality if they respond to environmental variation in a predictable way. Here, we use a molecular profiling technique (T-RFLP of 25 S rRNA gene fragments) to test which factors determine AM fungal community composition in 40 agricultural soils in the Netherlands. In particular, we test whether species richness, dominance structure and community nestedness are influenced by management type (in pairs of organically and conventionally farmed fields), and we examine the contribution of crop species (maize <b>vs.</b> potato), <b>soil</b> type (sand <b>vs.</b> clay-textured <b>soils)</b> and habitat (plant root <b>vs.</b> bulk <b>soil)</b> on AMF community characteristics. AMF richness varied from 1 to 11 taxa per field. Communities from species-poor fields were found to be subsets of those in richer fields, indicating nestedness and a progressive ‘loss’ from the species pool. AMF taxa richness and occurrence in soil and plant roots were highly correlated, and richness was related to management intensity (phosphate availability and grass-cropping history together explained 32 % and 50 % of richness in roots and soils). Soil type together with soil chemical parameters explained only 17 % of variance in AMF community structure. We synthesize these results by discussing the potential contribution of a ‘bottleneck effect’ on AMF communities through increased stochastic effects under environmental stress. ...|$|R

These changes include the lowering of soil redox potential (Eh) leading to increasing demand for oxygen within the soil profile as well as production of soil phytotoxins that are by-products of soil reduction and thus, imposing potentially severe stress on plant roots. Various methods are utilized for quantifying plant responses to reducing soil conditions that include measurement of radial oxygen transport, plant enzymatic responses, and assessment of anatomical/morphological changes.
