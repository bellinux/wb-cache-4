40|$|Abstract—The Automobile Braking System has {{a crucial}} role for safety of the {{passenger}} and riding quality of the vehicle. The <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> mainly depends on normal reaction on the wheel and the co-efficient of friction between the tire and the road surface. Whenever a vehicle is loaded, the normal reaction on the rear wheel is increased. Thus the amount of <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> required to halt the vehicle with minimum stopping distance, {{is based on the}} pillion load on the vehicle. In this work, in order to vary the <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> in two wheelers, the mechanical leverage which operates the master cylinder is varied based on the pillion load. Thus the amount of <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> developed between ground and tire is varied. This optimum <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> on the disc brake helps in attaining the minimum vehicle stopping distance. In addition to that, it also helps in preventing sliding. Thus the system results in reducing the stopping distance of the two wheelers and providing a better braking efficiency than the conventional <b>braking</b> system.
