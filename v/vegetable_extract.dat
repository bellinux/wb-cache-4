40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of ethanol extracts of some organically and conventionally grown leafy vegetables. Methods: The ethanol extracts of kailan (Brassica alboglabra), bayam (Amaranthus spp.) and sawi (Brassica parachinensis) were tested for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total anthocyanin content (TAC) and the antioxidant {{capacity of the}} extracts measured using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay. Results: In TPC test, sawi extract showed the highest phenolic content while bayam contained the least phenolic content for both organically and conventionally grown types. In TFC test, organically grown sawi extract showed the highest flavonoid content, while organically grown kailan extract showed the least flavonoid content among all types of vegetables. The flavonoid content of the conventionally grown types of <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> was the highest in kalian and the least in sawi. For 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, the activity increased with the increasing concentration of each extract. All conventionally grown <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> showed higher antioxidant activity compared to their organically grown counterparts. Extracts of conventionally grown sawi showed the highest percentage inhibition followed by conventionally grown kailan and organically grown sawi. There were no correlation between TPC, TFC, TAC and IC 25 of both organically and conventionally grown vegetables. However, there was a correlation between TAC and IC 25 of conventionally grown <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> The results showed relatively similar polyphenol content between organically and conventionally grown <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts.</b> However, the conventionally grown <b>vegetables</b> <b>extracts</b> generally have higher antioxidant activity compared to the organically grown extracts.

40|$|The {{current study}} compares {{antioxidant}} activities, total phenolic content (TPC), vitamin C content, and antiglycemic properties of Momordica charantia (small bitter gourd) and Moringa oleifera (drumstick leaves) {{before and after}} subjecting to boiling and microwave heating for different durations. Both cooking methods enhanced the antioxidant activity and vitamin C content in the vegetables studied when cooked for five minutes and these properties declined when the cooking time was prolonged to 20 minutes. Cooking also retained or slightly improved the α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition activity of the vegetables; however, it reduced {{the ability of the}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> to inhibit α-amylase enzyme activity. The antioxidant activities were positively correlated with the TPC and vitamin C content in the <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> tested. The present study also evaluated the insulin-like properties (stimulation of adipogenesis) of selected <b>vegetable</b> <b>extracts</b> (five minutes microwaved). 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes treated with small bitter gourd extract significantly stimulated lipogenesis (in the absence of insulin) compared to drumstick leaves.

40|$|SilvaFeed ENC (S-ENC) is {{a natural}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>extract</b> used in the animal feed {{industry}} that provides the animal diet with natural elements. Avian reoviruses (ARV) are RNA viruses members of the Orthoreovirus genus, Reoviridae family. ARVs are important causes of disease in poultry, in particular viral arthritis.

Evidenced interferences were analyzed by studying specific and unspecific inhibitors of cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase coupled reaction. Cholesterol was also quantified by LC/MS. We found a significant interference of diverse (cocoa and tea-derived) extracts over this method. The interference was strongly dependent on model matrix: while as in phosphate buffered saline, the development of unspecific fluorescence was inhibitable by catalase (but not by heat denaturation), suggesting <b>vegetable</b> <b>extract</b> derived H 2 O 2 production, in bile-containing model systems, this interference also comprised cholesterol-oxidase inhibition.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{consumption}} of fresh fruit & vegetable in concentrate form (FVC) have recently become {{an alternative approach}} to combating excessive renal acid loads often associated with Western Diets. Additionally, these FVC's have been purported to induce metabolic alkalosis, which perhaps may enhance the blood buffering capacity of an individual. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} preliminary study was to profile the acid-base response after ingestion of an acute dose of fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>extract</b> (Energised Greens™ (EG), Nottingham, UK) and compare it to a standard, low dose (0. 1 g·kg - 1) of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3). Findings As part of a randomized, cross over design participants consumed 750 mL of water with either 9 g of EG (manufacturer recommendations), 0. 1 g·kg - 1 of NaHCO 3 or a placebo (plain flour) in opaque encapsulated pills following an overnight fast. Capillary samples were obtained and analyzed every 15 min for a period of 120 min following ingestion. Significant interactions (p 3 -, BE). Interactions indicated significant elevation in blood alkalosis for only the NaHCO 3 condition when compared to both placebo and EG from 15 to 120 minutes.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effects of the drug lovastatin and a liquid <b>vegetable</b> <b>extract</b> (dill) on blood plasma lipid levels of rats. Methods: In this experimental study, 32 mouse vistar rats weighing 250 ± 30 grams were included and maintained at 23 ± 1 degrees Celsius. The rats were divided into 4 groups of 8 rats each. Groups I and II were given normal and high cholesterol diet, while groups III and IV were given high cholesterol diet with either lovastatin or seed dill extract for a period of 3 weeks, respectively. At the end of study, blood samples were taken and plasma lipid levels determined by the manual method. (It is worth mentioning that ultimately 26 rats were included in the study groups). Results: Results showed that both administration of lovastatin and the seed dill extract led to a significant reduction in plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and LDL/HDL, TG/HDL ratios. There was a significant reduction in the levels of LDL (P< 0. 001) and also a significant increase in levels of HDL (P< 0. 001) in both the groups. The effects on plasma triglycerides levels, LDL/HDL and TG/HDL ratios were not significant.
