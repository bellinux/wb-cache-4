40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a dynamic adaptation algorithm of joint source-channel code rate for enhancing <b>voice</b> transmission <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> network. In {{order to assess}} the speech quality, we use the Wideband (WB) E-model. In this model, both end-to-end delay and packet loss are taken into account. The goal {{of this paper is}} to find out the best suboptimal solution for improving <b>voice</b> traffic <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> network with some constraints on allowed maximum end-to-end delay, allowed maximum packet loss and minimum required bandwidth. The best suboptimal choice is channel code rate corresponding to each mode of the AMR-WB codec that minimizes redundant bits generated by channel coding with an acceptable MOS reduction. Besides, this algorithm can be integrated with rate control in AMR-WB codec to offer the required mode of LTE network. Our results show that the MOS degradation is not significant, but the percent of reduced redundant bits to be very considerable. This will requires less bandwidth, thus, more mobile users can be served. The algorithm has simple computational operations, it can be applied to real-time voice communications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite {{the fact}} that Long Term Evolution (LTE) {{supports}} high-speed data transmission and supports different packet sizes by using Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC), LTE is not yet optimized for low bit rate voice communication, especially in case of using LTE in Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) context. In LTE, one pair of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) is the smallest User Assignment Unit. However, the smallest LTE packet size is still too large in case that low bit rate voice communication is transmitted in high Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS). This reduces the <b>voice</b> capacity <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> in PMR context. Therefore, we propose a new Multi-users Multiplexing Radio Voice Transmission method for enhancing <b>voice</b> capacity <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> in PMR context. In this method, voice packets from different users are multiplexed into one LTE packet in the downlink transmission. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling method {{that can be used}} to transmit the multiplexed packets to corresponding users. This paper gives also a novel algorithm for classifying and grouping voice packets of mobile users having different MCS values. In case of low and medium number of users, the results show that the average voice capacity gain of the proposed method can rise up to 89. 6 %. In case of high number of users, the proposed method can improve the voice capacity by factor of 6. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of LTE 1 another {{technology}} is gaining momentum in mobile communication, viz. Voice-over-IP (VoIP). While LTE provides state-of-the-art security features such as confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, non-repudiation of <b>voice</b> communication <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> is not addressed. At {{the same time the}} utilization of mobile phone devices for business communication is already common practice. However, applications supporting specific business requirements, such as the confirmability of statements made in a phone call, are missing. VoIP Signatures is a recognized concept to achieve both non-repudiation for VoIP calls as well as integrity protection against the manipulation of recorded conversations. We present the integration of this concept with a VoIP client running on a mobile device. The implementation concept has been optimized for applicability on standard smart-phones with regard to given characteristics such as processing power limitations.

40|$|International audienceRecently {{there has}} been a great {{interest}} in how to apply Long Term Evolution (LTE) in Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) context, which is used for public safety work. However, LTE is not yet optimized for low bit rate voice communication. The smallest LTE packet size is still too large in case that low bit rate voice communication is transmitted in high quality channel. This {{is one of the main}} challenges for effectively applying LTE in PMR context. Therefore, this paper presents a new architecture for Multi-users Multiplexing Radio Voice Transmission for enhancing <b>voice</b> capacity <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> in PMR Context. This architecture allows reducing the difference between the LTE packet size and voice payload by multiplexing voice packets from different users into one same LTE packet in the downlink transmission. In this architecture, the multiplexing size can be modified according to the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), the payload of users and the LTE bandwidth. Our simulation results show that in the best case, our proposed method can achieve a gain up to 650 % in the voice capacity gain as compared to the standard LT...|$|R
40|$|As {{wireless}} access networks evolve towards an all-IP architecture, {{the principles of}} operations of communication services (specifically voice services), which have hitherto been circuit switched are being revisited. <b>Voice</b> <b>over</b> Internet Protocol (VoIP) {{has been identified as}} a solution and is potentially capable of completely replacing existing phone networks. However, as opposed to circuit switching technology, the call quality obtained via packet switching through IP has not been encouraging due to certain issues. The increasing demands on data rates, mobility, coverage and better service quality, led to the evolution in Radio Access Technologies (RATs) to an era of last-mile fourth generation (4 G) access technologies among which is Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE is an all-IP network initially meant for carrying data only, while carriers would be able to support voice traffic either by utilizing 2 G or 3 G systems or by using VoIP.

40|$|International audienceEfficient radio {{resource}} usage {{and quality of}} service (QoS) provision are important criterions in order to choose the right QoS policy for the LTE operators. In our previous work, we have proposed to add a new database named as BSLRC (Base Station Load and Radio Conditions) to optimize the operator policy {{with regard to the}} radio efficiency [1]. Some concrete voice capacity estimations were also proposed. In this paper, we extend our earlier work by addressing some novel concerns. As a first step, we start by calculating the signaling load due to the use of BSLRC. Then, for voice services the BSLRC method is compared with the explicit congestion notification (already proposed for LTE systems). Both BSLRC and explicit congestion notification (ECN) share the same objective to optimize the choice of codec rate with regard to radio use efficiency. We also propose some capacity estimates for video services as an extension to our previously proposed <b>voice</b> capacity estimations <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a {{high data}} rates and fully All-IP network. It is {{developed}} to support well to multimedia services such as Video, VoIP, Gaming, etc. So that, the real-time services such as VoIP, video, etc. need to be optimized. Nevertheless, the deployment of such live stream services having many challenges. Scheduling and allocating radio resource are very important in LTE network, especially with multimedia services such as VoIP. When <b>voice</b> service transmitted <b>over</b> <b>LTE</b> network, it is affected by many network impairments where there are three main factors including packet loss, delay, and jitter. This study proposes a new scheduler {{which is based on}} VoIP priority mode, Wideband (WB) E-model, QoS-and Channel-Aware (called WE-MQS-VoIP Priority scheduler) for voice services in LTE downlink direction. The proposed scheduling scheme is built based on the WB E-model and Maximum Queue Size (MQS). In addition, we integrate the VoIP priority mode into our scheduling scheme. Since the proposed scheduler considers the VoIP priority mode and user perception, thus, it improves significantly the system performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduler not only meets QoS demands of voice calls but also outperforms Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) in terms of delay, Packet Loss Rate (PLR) for all number of user (NU) and excepting NU equals 30, respectively. For Fairness Index (FI), cell throughput, and Spectral Efficiency (SE), the difference among the packet schedulers is not significant. The performance evaluation is compared in terms of Delay, PLR, Throughput, FI, and SE...|$|R
