5|$|Maxinquaye was {{released}} on 20 February 1995 and reached number three on the United Kingdom's albums chart while selling over 100,000 copies in its first few months. 4th & B'way marketed the album by relying on independent record promoters and Tricky's appearances in media, including publicity photographs and music <b>videos</b> <b>that</b> portrayed him and Topley-Bird in gender-bending fashion.
