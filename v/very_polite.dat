He said “the customer’s psychology always favors a busy place,” because the sight of a busy firm will make people trust it and claimed that the aim of The Shanghai Bank was to serve society and not just make a profit.

500|$|From the 1980s, the {{distribution}} {{rights to the}} ITC productions belonged to PolyGram Television. Subsequent sales were made to Carlton International in the late 1990s and finally Granada International which, through a merger with Carlton International in 2004, now forms ITV Global Entertainment, a division of ITV plc. During the 1990s, {{the possibility of a}} live-action film adaptation of Joe 90 was mooted by PolyGram. The idea re-emerged in the 2000s, when in 2003 the magazine Variety reported that a film version was in the planning stages, to be produced by Disney. However, to date, the film proposal remains to be developed. In 2005, Anderson said of negotiations with Granada, [...] "We have regular meetings and although they are <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> and very nice, nothing ever happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Hay {{spent part}} of the {{spring and early summer}} of 1896 in the United Kingdom, and {{elsewhere}} in Europe. There was a border dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana, and Cleveland's Secretary of State, Richard Olney, supported the Venezuelan position, announcing the Olney interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. [...] Hay told British politicians that McKinley, if elected, would be unlikely to change course. McKinley was nominated in June 1896; still, many Britons were minded to support whoever became the Democratic candidate. [...] This changed when the 1896 Democratic National Convention nominated former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan on a [...] "free silver" [...] platform; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech. Hay reported to McKinley when he returned to Britain after a brief stay on the Continent during which Bryan was nominated in Chicago: [...] "they were all scared out of their wits for fear Bryan would be elected, and <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> in their references to you." ...|$|E
500|$|Still, the United States made a push to {{have the}} orders placed in an American shipyard. The American {{government}} sent Henry Prather Fletcher {{to be the new}} minister to Chile in September 1910. Fletcher had successfully implemented President William Howard Taft's [...] "Dollar Diplomacy" [...] policy in China. He met with resistance, which he attributed to lingering sentiment from the 1891 Baltimore Crisis: [...] "My advances in the matter have not been met with frankness or encouragement and I feel a spirit of covert opposition. Under a <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> and courteous exterior there still exists a feeling of soreness towards us." [...] The US naval attaché opined that, barring anything short of a revolution, the contracts would be given to the British. Indeed, the bidding process specified ships very close to the armament and armor mounted on recent British warships. Fletcher asked for an extension to the bidding process so that American shipbuilding firms could tailor proposals to these requirements, and this was granted.|$|E

[...] and [...] "FLAVIN" [...] and impulsively shouting other words that have no relevance to the situation at hand. He also occasionally refers to the importance of remembering to [...] "carry the one" [...] in various mathematical calculations. When he rambles he often speaks incoherently in run-on sentences without pauses. Frink also has a tendency to over-complicate simple matters and/or invent scientific terminology while expressing various concepts, e.g. [...] "Father and I got along like positrons and antineutrinos!" [...] or, [...] "microcalifragilistics".|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} media have provided commentary on Lee's character. IGN's A.E. Sparrow called Lee {{one of his favorite}} characters in the series and compared his personality to that of Bruce Lee and Noel Gallagher. Fellow editor Ramsey Isler ranked him as the eight best character on the series and said he [...] "was the true underdog of the series." [...] Isler added, [...] "Perhaps a little too intense, but always fiercely devoted to his cause, Rock Lee added all sorts of flavor to the series." [...] However, Rock Lee's profile on IGN describes him as [...] "kind of stiff" [...] because of his <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> demeanor. Active Anime celebrated Lee's introduction in the series as a comedic relief to the growing tension of the story at that point. Anime Insider listed him in their top five list for [...] "pure-hearted heroes" [...] from anime and manga publications, ranking at number five. Insider praised him for [...] "never [...] up, {{even in the face of}} people with actual ninja powers." ...|$|E

Brin and Page note that: [...] "... running a crawler which connects to {{more than half a}} million servers (...) generates a fair amount of e-mail and phone calls.

2500|$|During that time, Coleridge {{became a}} friend of Charles Lamb. Unlike Lamb, Coleridge did not have family in London to spend his {{vacation}} with, which caused the young Coleridge strain. Over the nine years that he attended the school, he only returned home 3 or 4 times. He experienced loneliness throughout the time until two of his brothers, Luke and George, came to London. He wrote many letters to his brothers, but only one to his mother during his time in London. Luke was important to Coleridge and Luke's moving to Devon affected the schoolboy. Coleridge made other friends, including Charles Le Grice, but this could not keep Coleridge from missing Luke, to whom Coleridge would write often. [...] In one letter, Coleridge wrote: [...] "Legrice, and I, are <b>very</b> <b>polite,</b> very civil, and very cold. So that I doubly lament your absence, as I have now no one, to whom I can open my heart in full confidence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fraser-Simson is {{also known}} for his many {{settings}} of children's verse by A. A. Milne and Kenneth Grahame, including the music for a children's play based on the latter's The Wind in the Willows entitled Toad of Toad Hall (1929), which was successful and enjoyed many revivals. [...] His settings of Milne's verse include a children's song cycle The Hums of Pooh, based on verses from Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner. This was included in Julian Slade's 1970 adaptation of Winnie-the-Pooh. He published six volumes of songs setting verses from Milne's When We Were Very Young. They were first recorded for the gramophone by George Baker accompanied by Gerald Moore in 1930. His other songs included the collection Teddy Bear and Other Songs and songs from Alice in Wonderland which were published in 1932 and recorded by Baker and Moore the same year. Baker later recalled the composer as [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>polite,</b> retiring man, looking more like a businessman than a composer of successful musicals." ...|$|E

[...] She is <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> and ladylike with a motherly demeanour, not wanting to intrude on others' private life (including Hisao's reasons for being at Yamaku). It is also noted that she had previously attended a strict all-girls school. In contrast to Misha's fast-paced attitude to Hisao's transfer, Lilly takes things at her own relaxed pace, helping Hisao to adjust to school life {{in the midst of a}} busy festival. She is Hanako's closest and initially only friend; she regularly has lunch and tea with her, and accompanies her grocery shopping. She is also on a friendly basis with Yuuko. Shizune and Lilly have been seen to not get along, perhaps due to the fact that direct communication between her and Shizune is not feasible (she cannot see Shizune's sign language and Shizune cannot hear her or speak to her).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the famous}} diary of her sister-in-law, Princess Charlotte, Sophia Magdalena is {{described}} as beautiful, cold, silent and haughty, <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> and formal, reserved and unsociable. When she performed her duties as Queen, her sister-in-law, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, described her as [...] "Forced to meet people". She preferred to spend her days in solitude whenever she could. She had two very intimate friends, Maria Aurora Uggla and Baroness Virginia Charlotta Manderström, but otherwise rarely participated in any social life outside of what was absolutely necessary to perform her representational duties. She frequently visited the theater, and {{she also had a}} great interest for fashion. As a result of this, she was somewhat criticized for being too vain: even when she had no representational duties to dress up for and spend her days alone in her rooms, she is said to have changed costumes several times daily, and according her chamberlain Adolf Ludvig Hamilton, she never passed a mirror without studying herself in it. She was also interested in literature, and educated herself in various subjects: her library contained works about geography, genealogy and history, she educated herself in Swedish, English, German and Italian and regularly read French magazines. According to Augusta von Fersen, Sophia Magdalena was quite educated, but she was not perceived as such because she rarely engaged in conversation.|$|E
2500|$|Itagaki {{suggested}} to Puyi {{that in a}} few years time Manchukuo might become a monarchy and stated that Manchuria was just the beginning, as Japan had ambitions to take all of China; the obvious implication was that Puyi would become the Great Qing Emperor again. When Puyi objected to Itagaki's plans, he was told that he was in no position to negotiate as Itagaki had no interest in his opinions on these issues. Unlike Doihara, who was always <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> and constantly stroked Puyi's ego, Itagaki was brutally rude and brusque, addressing Puyi like he was barking out orders to a particularly dim-witted common soldier. Puyi's chief adviser Zheng Xiaoxu had been promised by Itagaki that he would be the Manchukuo prime minister, an offer that appealed to his vanity sufficiently enough that he persuaded Puyi to accept the Japanese terms, telling him that Manchukuo would soon become a monarchy and history would repeat itself, as Puyi would conquer the rest of China from his Manchurian base just as the Qing did in 1644. In Japanese propaganda, Puyi was always celebrated both in traditionalist terms as a Confucian [...] "Sage King" [...] out to restore virtue and as a revolutionary who was going to end the oppression of the common people by a program of wholesale modernization.|$|E
2500|$|Lunafreya's {{place in}} XV was {{originally}} {{held by the}} similarly-named , the main female protagonist of Versus XIII. The relationship between Stella and Noctis was originally designed to be platonic rather than romantic, as Nomura felt a preference towards portraying {{a different kind of}} relationship between male and female protagonists. He also wanted to make her the first female character to [...] "stand out from all previous [...] ". A key scene for Stella was the meeting and conversation with Noctis during the game's opening. While Nomura deliberately designed her against his usual tastes, he grew fond of her design over the years. Stella's design underwent alterations between 2011 and 2013, mainly to make her more beautiful. She was intended to be a <b>very</b> <b>polite</b> person, with that politeness conveyed through specific dialogue traits in her speech. During the transition from Versus XIII to XV, the developers envisioned a different type of heroine which did not fit with Stella's original role, but Stella was already known to and expected by fans who had followed the game's development. Stella was initially redesigned to play {{a more active role in}} the story, but Tabata was uncomfortable about this. Faced with the scenario of fans being disappointed if Stella's personality or role were changed, the developers instead opted to replace her entirely.|$|E
