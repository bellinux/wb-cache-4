40|$|Diverse {{evidence}} suggests that gas-venting rates at sites of hydrate crystallization are variable in space and time, but the magnitude of these variations {{has been difficult to}} quantify. The hydrate crystallization model of Chen and Cathles [J. Geophys. Res. (Solid Earth) 108 (2003) ] is used here to analyze 10 years of vent gas chemistry measurements at the Bush Hill hydrate mound and gas-venting site, Green Canyon 185, offshore Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico. The analysis suggests that, at any instant of time, gas vents at variable rates in different gas channels at the same site, and that the compositional differences in these <b>vent</b> <b>gases</b> are nearly as large as can be produced by hydrate crystallization. Almost two orders of magnitude differences in venting rate between individual gas channelways are suggested. Changes in the average vent gas composition over the last 10 years suggest the average venting rate varied by a factor of similar to 2 or more over a few years. The average C- 3 + C- 4 composition of Bush Hill hydrates are leaner than could be crystallized from <b>vent</b> <b>gases</b> sampled over the last decade, indicating that the venting gas flux was slower in the past by a factor of similar to 2. This is compatible with geologic generalizations that venting evolves from fast (mud volcano), to intermediate (hydrate crystallization), to slow (carbonate precipitation) if venting organized into more discrete vents with time.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of utilizing a biological process to reduce methane emissions from coal mines and to produce valuable {{single cell protein}} (SCP) and/or methanol as a product has been demonstrated. The quantities of coal mine methane from vent gas, gob wells, premining wells and abandoned mines have been determined in order to define the potential for utilizing mine gases as a resource. It is estimated that 300 MMCFD of methane is produced in the United States at a typical concentration of 0. 2 - 0. 6 percent in ventilation air. Of this total, almost 20 percent is produced from the four Jim Walter Resources (JWR) mines, which are located in very gassy coal seams. Worldwide vent gas production is estimated at 1 BCFD. Gob gas methane production in the U. S. {{is estimated to be}} 38 MMCFD. Very little gob gas is produced outside the U. S. In addition, it is estimated that abandoned mines may generate as much as 90 MMCFD of methane. In order to make a significant impact on coal mine methane emissions, technology which is able to utilize dilute <b>vent</b> <b>gases</b> as a resource must be developed. Purification of the methane from the <b>vent</b> <b>gases</b> would be very expensive and impractical. Therefore, the process application must be able to use a dilute methane stream. Biological conversion of this dilute methane (as well as the more concentrated gob gases) to produce single cell protein (SCP) and/or methanol has been demonstrated in the Bioengineering Resources, Inc.

40|$|Chlorine is {{the most}} {{economical}} biocide widely used in SWCC sea water MSF desalination plants to prevent biofouling in the intake and flow through systems. However, chlorine has a negative contribution towards the corrosion aspect of the plant. Excess of chlorine when present in sea water oxidizes its higher homologues in the periodic table such as bromide present in sea water to bromine which finds its way in the venting system causing corrosion damage to the materials in the venting system of the MSF plants. Evolution of bromine is influenced by several parameters such as residual chlorine, pH and temperature of the sea water streams. It is deemed necessary to study the magnitude of their influence {{on the evolution of}} bromine in order to reduce its production to the minimum levels thereby keeping the corrosion probability to the lowest possible extent. This paper summarises the results of detailed studies carried out in the Research and Development Center on the evolution of bromine in sea water containing bromide as a function of several parameters such as residual chlorine, pH, temperature, contact time etc. These shtdies were carried out using a laboratory scale set up. Several water samples from an operating MSF plant in Al-Jubail Phase-II area were also analysed for bromide contents in order to assess the extent of bromine conversion in various process streams. A new analytical method was developed during the course of these studies to determine bromide in sea water samples containing complex matrix. Finally, <b>vent</b> <b>gases</b> from various stages of a MSF plant also were collected for evaluating the bromine contents. The results indicate that significant amounts of bromine evolution occur even at high pH (8. 3 - 9. 0) and low levels of residual chlorine normally present in an additive based MSF plant. Further, sea water used in barometric condensers was found to be inefficient in stripping bromine completely from the <b>vent</b> <b>gases</b> thereby creating a potential corrosion problem to the materials down stream of the condensers.

When seafloor temperature, vent rate, or <b>vent</b> <b>gas</b> composition changes, these hydrates may become unstable and decompose.
