25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E

Banks later stated, [...] "Pete was also getting {{too big for the}} group. He was being portrayed as if he was 'the man' and it really wasn't like that.

In 2003, the church published the Eternal Marriage Student Manual, which uses the same quote.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yorke, [...] "Creep" [...] {{tells the}} tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the {{attention}} of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about [...] "Creep" [...] in 1993, Yorke said: [...] "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> to do... It comes back to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance.

5000|$|Tied with Plushenko artistically (both scored 82.80 {{for program}} components), the win for Lysacek became {{possible}} due to higher marks he received on {{the execution of}} such technical elements as jumps, spins and footwork. Commenting on Lysacek receiving higher technical marks than Plushenko, Frank Carroll, Lysacek's coach, said: [...] "Plushenko was brilliant in the jumping. He did some brilliant, <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things.</b> But {{if you think of}} his skating, he was very brilliant, then down. And very brilliant, then down. It was going in waves. Evan just sort of stayed in a straight line and kept going at a certain level from the start to the finish." [...] Lysacek agreed with Carroll's assessment as to why he was able to prevail over the three- time Olympic medalist, whose technical prowess had always been his trademark: [...] "If it was a jumping competition, they'd give you 10 seconds to go do your best jump. But it's about 4 minutes and 40 seconds of skating and performing from start to finish. That was my challenge tonight, and I feel like I did quite well." ...|$|R

40|$|This phenomenological study {{describes}} the lived experience of mothering a child hospitalised with acute illness or injury. Seven mothers {{who had experienced}} this crisis within twelve months of our first interview agreed to share their stories with me. The resulting data were analysed and interpreted using van Manen's interpretation of Heideggerian phenomenology. Four phenomenological themes emerged from this study. Mothers have {{a special kind of}} knowing. They have a need to do with and for their child. Handing over to or leaving their child in the care of strangers and waiting for their child to be returned to their care are <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> for mothers to do. Their constant vigilance is enabled by their special kind of knowing and their need to do. The difficulty of handing over, leaving and waiting is emphasised by mothers' constant vigilance. Personal experiences during the course of my study presented significant challenges to my ability to offer an effective phenomenological description of the phenomenon under study. Continuous reflection aided by dialogue with fellow phenomenological researchers has resulted in a meaningful narrative. This description of mothering in a context of crisis is useful in the potential contribution it makes to nurses' understanding of mothers' experience of the hospitalisation of their children. It supports the philosophy of family-centered care and highlights the ability of individual nurses to make a positive difference to a very stressful experience...|$|R
40|$|Presentation {{skills is}} very {{important}} nowadays. Using slideshow as medium to deliver the main point in a presentation {{is one of the}} standard used by a presenter. It is widely used in learning, business, and open talk. In order to attract audience, presenter must have a good presentation skills. But presenting by using manual controller such as mouse and keyboard will affect the presentation flows. Presenter need to control their own slideshow yet they need to communicate with the audience. Presenter need to move freely while doing a presentation otherwise the audience will get bored with the presentation or even worse the presenter will lose their attention. Controlling the slideshow without effecting their presentation skill is a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> to do. Based on the observation and research, to solve this problem, presenter need something that they can use to control their slideshow remotely while reducing the interruption with their presentation flows. Developing a mobile application that can control the slideshow with various type of controlling option {{is the best way to}} solve this problem. Mobile application is suitable for current daily activity. Because people nowadays used smartphone and bring their smartphone everywhere even at working space. Therefore, mobile application is the best solution to what medium user need to use to control their slideshow remotely. Testing the finished product to a group of target user will help improve any bug or error before it will released as a finished product. It is the best way to identify any problem or improvement by testing the product using the target user. The finished product will help improve the presentation flows of the presenter that used this slideshow remote control. Further improvement of this product will involve in new development of a new mobile application or new version of the current product...|$|R

Even Gibbs might object to such harshness upon grounds which might seem to him vague and insufficient.

You kindly ask my opinion on vers de societe in general. Well, I think them a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> sort of <b>thing</b> to write well, as one may infer from this, that the ancients, our masters, could hardly write them at all. In Greek poetry of the great ages I only {{remember}} one piece which can be called a model--the AEolic verses that Theocritus wrote to accompany {{the gift of the}} ivory distaff. It was a present, you remember, to the wife of his friend Nicias, the physician of Miletus. The Greeks of that age kept their women in almost Oriental reserve. One may doubt whether Nicias would have liked it if Theocritus had sent, instead of a distaff, a fan or a jewel. But there is safety in a spinning instrument, and all the compliments to the lady, [...] "the dainty-ankled Theugenis," [...] turn on her skill, and industry, and housewifery.

Faith is a weird thing, it in a sense {{it is all about}} waiting. It’s not actually about getting anything, you know, faith is about the wait, because once you get something there is no need anymore. So a lot about faith is just the willingness to sort of throw yourself on a fence and hang there for a while. That’s a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> and bitter <b>thing,</b> you know. In this song, I keep saying the main character, *I*, I said, “All my sins, I would pay for them if I could come back to you.” It’s not just about finding things to believe in, it’s about wanting to be able to believe in anything too. And it’s about all the voices that get inside your head and whisper for you to do it or not to do it as well. And it’s called “Angels of the Silences.” ...|$|R

Horses have naturally a strong and instinctive terror for such beasts, and this terror it was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> to overcome.
