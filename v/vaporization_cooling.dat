40|$|The net flux of vapour from a solid {{surface in}} an ambient gas is {{analysed}} {{with the aim}} to estimate the effect of <b>vaporization</b> <b>cooling</b> on the energy balance of an arc cathode under conditions typical for a high-power current breaker. If {{the ratio of the}} equilibrium vapour pressure pv to the ambient pressure p ∞ is smaller than unity, the removal of vapour from the surface is due to diffusion into the bulk of the gas. As a consequence, the net flux of the vapour from the surface is much smaller than the emitted flux. An estimate of the diffusion rate under conditions typical for a high-power current breaker indicates that <b>vaporization</b> <b>cooling</b> plays a minor role in the energy balance of the cathode in this case. If ratio pv/p ∞ is above unity, the flow of the vapour from the surface appears and the net flux is comparable to the emitted flux. A simple analytical solution has been obtained for this case, which is in a good agreement with results of the Monte Carlo modelling of preceding authors. If pv/p ∞ exceeds approximately 4. 5, vaporization occurs as into vacuum and the net flux is about 0. 82 of the emitted flux. 1...|$|E

40|$|Ethanol is {{receiving}} great interest {{as an alternative}} fuel. Methanol is another alcohol fuel {{that could serve as}} a replacement for gasoline. Although it is currently receiving much less attention, {{it has the potential to}} play an important role. Like ethanol, methanol also has the advantage of being a liquid fuel and it can be produced from gasification of a variety of feedstocks using well established thermal chemical technology. These feedstocks include coal, natural gas, biomass and various types of waste. This paper discusses the high effective octane number and efficiency advantages of methanol and ethanol when used in direct injection engines. Octane number represents the resistance of a spark ignition engine to knock (unwanted detonation which can damage the engine). The high intrinsic octane numbers of ethanol and methanol are well known. However, a much greater effective octane number can be effectively realized through the knock resistance provided by the high level of <b>vaporization</b> <b>cooling</b> that occurs when methanol or ethanol is directly injected into the engine cylinders. A computational model is used in this paper to determine the knock resistance and effective octane number of these alcohol fuels when they are directly injected. The model indicates that the effective octane numbers are around 160 for ethanol and 180 for methanol. The high compression ratio, high degree of turbocharging and aggressive engine downsizing enabled by the high effective octane number of methanol could provide an efficiency gain of 30 – 35 % (for combined city-highway driving) relative to conventional port fueled gasoline engines. An additional gain of around 10 % can be obtained by using reforming of methanol to enable ultra lean operation at low loads. The combination of these gains could thus potentially provide an efficiency gain of 40 – 45 % for direct injection methanol engines. This efficiency gain is significantly greater than the typical 25 – 30 % gain of turbocharged diesel engines. 3 I...|$|E

50|$|During and {{immediately}} after World War II, alcohols (primarily ethanol, occasionally methanol) were the most common fuels for large liquid-fueled rockets. Their high heat of <b>vaporization</b> kept regeneratively <b>cooled</b> engines from melting, especially considering that alcohols would typically contain several percent water. However, it was recognized that hydrocarbon fuels would increase engine efficiency, due to a slightly higher density, {{the lack of an}} oxygen atom in the fuel molecule, and negligible water content.

40|$|The {{potential}} of water-based eggshell powder (agitated) as a quenching medium for hardening {{medium carbon steel}} (SAE-AISI 1045) was investigated. Addition of 25 wt % eggshell powder to water was used to form the water-based eggshell powder quenchant. The water-based eggshell powder quenchant was used in unagitated and agitated conditions in hardening medium carbon steel. Scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffractometer were used to characterize the crystallinity of eggshell powder. The chemistry, specific latent heat of <b>vaporization</b> and <b>cooling</b> rates of the water-based eggshell powder quenchant were determined. The cooling rate of the medium carbon steel quenched in the water-based eggshell powder quenchant was compared to the cooling rates of samples quenched in water and engine oil (SAE 40) quenchants.

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{describes}} how the DEVAP air conditioner was invented, explains how the technology works, and why it won an R&D 100 Award. Desiccant-enhanced evaporative (DEVAP) air-conditioning will provide superior comfort for commercial buildings in any climate at {{a small fraction of}} the electricity costs of conventional air-conditioning equipment, releasing far less carbon dioxide and cutting costly peak electrical demand by an estimated 80 %. Air conditioning currently consumes about 15 % of the electricity generated in the United States and is a major contributor to peak electrical demand on hot summer days, which can lead to escalating power costs, brownouts, and rolling blackouts. DEVAP employs an innovative combination of air-cooling technologies to reduce energy use by up to 81 %. DEVAP also shifts most of the energy needs to thermal energy sources, reducing annual electricity use by up to 90 %. In doing so, DEVAP is estimated to cut peak electrical demand by nearly 80 % in all climates. Widespread use of this cooling cycle would dramatically cut peak electrical loads throughout the country, saving billions of dollars in investments and operating costs for our nation's electrical utilities. Water is already used as a refrigerant in evaporative coolers, a common and widely used energy-saving technology for arid regions. The technology cools incoming hot, dry air by evaporating water into it. The energy absorbed by the water as it evaporates, known as the latent heat of <b>vaporization,</b> <b>cools</b> the air while humidifying it. However, evaporative coolers only function when the air is dry, and they deliver humid air that can lower the comfort level for building occupants. And even many dry climates like Phoenix, Arizona, have a humid season when evaporative cooling won't work well. DEVAP extends the applicability of evaporative cooling by first using a liquid desiccant-a water-absorbing material-to dry the air. The dry air is then passed to an indirect evaporative cooling stage, in which the incoming air is in thermal contact with a moistened surface that evaporates the water into a separate air stream. As the evaporation cools the moistened surface, it draws heat from the incoming air without adding humidity to it. A number of cooling cycles have been developed that employ indirect evaporative cooling, but DEVAP achieves a superior efficiency relative to its technological siblings...|$|R

In this paper, a numerical simulation method is introduced to investigate the effect of water mist size, velocity and flow rateon the fire suppressionefficiencyin microgravity. The fire extinguishing efficiency is better for the finer water mist in microgravity due to better heat transfer and more rapid <b>vaporization.</b> The evaporation <b>cooling</b> is the dominant mechanism of fire suppression in microgravity. As for the water mist velocity, the performance of fire suppression is affected slightly in microgravity.

40|$|The use of {{biofuels}} {{for internal}} combustion engines has several well published advantages. The biofuels, made from biological {{sources such as}} corn or sugar cane, are renewable resources that reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Fuels from agricultural sources can therefore reduce a countries energy dependency on other nations. Biofuels also {{have been shown to}} reduce CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere compared to traditional fossil based fuels. Because of these benefits several countries have set targets for the use of biofuels, especially ethanol, in their transportation fuels. Small percentages of ethanol are common place in gasoline but are typically limited to 5 to 8 % by volume. Greater benefits are possible from higher concentrations and some countries such as the US and Sweden have encouraged the production of vehicles capable of operating on E 85 (85 % denatured ethanol and 15 % gasoline). E 85 capable vehicles are normally equipped to run the higher levels of ethanol by employing modified fuel delivery systems that can withstand the highly corrosive nature of the alcohol. These vehicles are not however equipped {{to take full advantage of}} ethanol's properties during the combustion process. Ethanol has a much higher blend research octane number than gasoline. This allows the use of higher engine compression ratios and spark advance which result in more efficient engine operation. Ethanol's latent heat of vaporization is also much higher that gasoline. This higher heat of <b>vaporization</b> <b>cools</b> the engine intake charge which also allows the engine compression ratio to be increased even further. An engine that is optimized for operation on high concentrations of ethanol therefore will have compression ratios that are too high to avoid spark knock (pre-ignition) if run on gasoline or a gasoline/ethanol blend that has a low percentage alcohol. An engine was developed during this project to leverage the improved evaporative cooling and high octane of E 85 to improve fuel economy and offset E 85 's lower energy content. A 2. 0 L production Direct Injection gasoline, (DIg) engine employing Dual Independent Cam Phasing, (DICP) and turbo charging was used as the base engine. Modified pistons were used to increase the geometric compression ratio from 9. 2 : 1 to 11. 85 : 1 by modifying the pistons and adding advanced valvetrain to proved control of displacement and effective compression ratio through valve timing control. The advanced valvetrain utilized Delphi's two step valvetrain hardware and intake cam phaser with increased phasing authority of 80 crank angle degrees. Using this hardware the engine was capable of operating knock free on all fuels tested from E 0 -E 85 by controlling effective compression ratio using a Late Intake Valve Closing, (LIVC) strategy. The LIVC strategy results in changes in the trapped displacement such that knock limited torque for gasoline is significantly lower than E 85. The use of spark retard to control knock enables higher peak torque for knock limited fuels, however a loss in efficiency results. For gasoline and E 10 fuels, full effective displacement could not be reached before spark retard produced a net loss in torque. The use of an Early Intake Valve Closing, (EIVC) strategy resulted in an improvement of engine efficiency at low to mid loads for all fuels tested from E 0 - E 85. Further the use of valve deactivation, to a single intake valve, improved combustion stability and enabled throttle-less operation down to less than 2 bar BMEP. Slight throttling to trap internal residual provided additional reductions in fuel consumption. To fully leverage the benefits of E 85, or ethanol blends above E 10, would require a vehicle level approach that would take advantage of the improved low end torque that is possible with E 85. Operating the engine at reduced speeds and using advanced transmissions (6 speeds or higher) would provide a responsive efficient driving experience to the customer. The vehicle shift and torque converter lockup points for high ethanol blends could take advantage of the significant efficiency advantage of down-speeding and operating at higher loads to deliver the required power...|$|R
50|$|The Automatic {{depressurization}} {{system is}} {{not a part of}} the cooling system proper, but is an essential adjunct to the ECCS. It is designed to activate in the event that there is either a loss of high-pressure cooling to the vessel or if the high-pressure cooling systems cannot maintain the RPV water level. ADS can be manually or automatically initiated. When ADS receives an auto-start signal when water reaches the Low-Low-Low Water Level Alarm setpoint. ADS then confirms with the Low Alarm Water Level, verifies at least 1 low-pressure cooling pump is operating, and starts a 105-second timer. When the timer expires, or when the manual ADS initiate buttons are pressed, the system rapidly releases pressure from the RPV in the form of steam through pipes that are piped to below the water level in the suppression pool (the torus/wetwell), which is designed to condense the steam released by ADS or other safety valve activation into water), bringing the reactor vessel below 32 atm (3200 kPa, 465 psi), allowing the low-pressure cooling systems (LPCS/LPCI/LPCF/GDCS) to restore reactor water level. During an ADS blowdown, the steam being removed from the reactor is sufficient to ensure adequate core cooling even if the core is uncovered. The water in the reactor will rapidly flash to steam as reactor pressure drops, carrying away the latent heat of <b>vaporization</b> and providing <b>cooling</b> for the entire reactor. Low pressure ECCS systems will re-flood the core prior to the end of the emergency blowdown, ensuring that the core retains adequate cooling during the entire event.|$|R
40|$|Space {{weathering}} (SW) is {{an ensemble}} of processes that act on a body {{exposed to the}} space environment. Typically, the exposure to SW results in the accumulation, at the surface, of nanoparticles, that {{are thought to be}} produced through a <b>vaporization</b> and subsequent <b>cooling</b> of the metallo-silicaceous components exposed to the space environment. The presence of such nanoparticles is responsible for the so-called reddening of the asteroids' reflectance spectra (i. e., the increase in Vis-NIR reflectance with increase in wavelength) observed by remote-sensing measurements. To investigate the mechanism of formation of these nanoparticles, we have employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) to morphologically and optically characterize ordinary chondrites (OC), the most abundant class of meteorites collected on Earth and whose parent bodies are the S-type asteroids. The AFM study reveals the occurrence of a diffuse nanophase (martensite) in the meteorite's metal inclusions. Since the same areas show a reddening of the reflectivity spectra, this suggests that such spectral modification is based on a shock-induced phase transformation of the metal components of the extraterrestrial body. To gain more insight into this nanophase and on its role in the SW of the asteroids, an optical characterization by SNOM has been performed on OCs. In this work we exploited the peculiarity of this technique to search for a correlation between the topography on the nanoscale and the spectral characteristics, at different wavelengths in the red-NIR range, of the observed nanophase. Indeed, a high-resolution mapping of the optical properties of the meteorite provides an interesting method to discriminate between martensite-based and Fe-silicaceous nanoparticles.
