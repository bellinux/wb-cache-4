50|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the vineyard}} {{is that the}} vines grow in slightly argillaceous sand soil. This sandy soil produces mild wines with low acidity. In 1991, the vineyard was affiliated as a single vineyard site ("großlagenfreie Einzellage") by the wine growing region of Saale-Unstrut and thus recognized by the EU. The Wachtelberg is now a classified German vineyard {{and can be found}} under the registration 11.1.5.-017 in the <b>vineyard</b> <b>register</b> (Weinbergrolle). All Werderaner wines are pressed and vinificated at the Landesweingut Kloster Pforta in Saxony-Anhalt.|$|E
5000|$|Notable for {{producing}} Shiraz, the grape {{is by far}} the most important variety for the region, accounting for about 50% of the total crush. The area's thin soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz’s natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale wines are distinguished by their ripeness, elegance, structure, power and complexity. McLaren Vale has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha—much of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines.

40|$|The {{wine sector}} in EU {{is one of}} the most {{complicated}} regarding the legislation and preparations for the wine reform have been long and comprehensive. The wide-ranging EU wine reform was implemented in two phases. The first phase implied retrieval of balance on the wine market and casted out market intervention measures allowing enhanced budget use. The second phase included rules regarding protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indications (PGI), wine making practices and the <b>vineyard</b> <b>register.</b> The primary aim of this paper is contribution to the understanding of the EU wine reform and the next aim is to investigate the impact on Croatia. Using descriptive analysis approach, the quality analysis of the legislation in the European and Croatian wine sector has been conducted. The wine reform in the EU was necessary because of: (i) the structural surplus on the European market, (ii) the steady decline in wine consumption in the EU and (iii) slower growth in EU exports since 1996. Croatia is obligated to harmonize the legislation in the wine sector as one of the preconditions of the EU accession. The adoption of the new EU legislation in Croatian legal framework started in 2010. The most of EU regulations have been adopted in 2010. The rest of it has to be adopted in 2011. Croatia has implemented several regulations concerning wine sector into national law framework. Still, the most challenging part of the EU reform, the system of PDO and PGI is waiting to be revised and adjusted to Croatian circumstances. The implementation should support interests of all parties (producers, government, institutions) ...|$|E
25|$|Chianti Superiore is an Italian DOCG wine {{produced}} in the provinces of Arezzo, Florence, Pisa, Pistoia, Prato and Siena, in Tuscany. Superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other Chianti wines. Chianti Superiore has been authorised since 1996.

The sphere of agriculture does not stand apart. The Department of Agriculture of the Czech Republic is the central authority of the state administration for agriculture, water resources management, food processing industry, forestry, hunting and fishery. In its administration it has a range of departmental registers. For example: Register of farmland, Register of animals, <b>Register</b> of <b>vineyards,</b> <b>Register</b> of hop-gardens, Register of intensive plantations, Register of agricultural subjects etc. The electronic data exchange between these registers and agricultural entrepreneurs; which will be faster, more effective and more economical than the paper forms; is a big call appeal for the development of eGovernment in the department of agriculture. The current valid legistature obliges the agricultural subjects to hand in the whole range of declarations and announcements to the resort registers. In paper form this means a big ration of duplicate notations which an agricultural company has to fill in, and with this corresponding error rate and work difficulty. Agricultural subjects need also to know data from resort registers; above all, while processing the grants applications.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of the development perspectives of the new grape varieties, resistant to fungal diseases, promoting therefore the reduction or the suppression of phytosanitary treatments. Based on a direct survey with researchers, stakeholders, a synthesis of the scientific literature and edited research programs, we propose an overview of {{the current state of the}} art of the supply of technology, and a presentation of the main stakeholders strategy involved in the innovation chain, a synthesis of the current scientific and technical controversies, and an analysis of the undertaking of the institutions and of the legislation. Further, we provide an evaluation of the previous research program on new grape varieties of the French National Institute for Research in Agronomy (INRA) and the results of the diffusion achieved in Languedoc-Roussillon. This analysis will allow us to discuss the conditions for the success of this innovation as a competitiveness factor. Obtaining a new grape variety is a long term process that can last up to 20 or 30 years. According to the evolutionary approach (Nelson and Winter, 1982), it is the technological paradigm of the research programs intending to improve the proprieties of the plant that defines the technological trajectory. In relation with this delay for the obtaining new grape varieties, the success of the diffusion of the new varieties faces three main difficulties: (1) Professionals need to agree on the relevance of the paradigm, In other words on the characteristics of the research program; (2) A gap appears between the characteristics of new varieties proposed for diffusion and the new perception of the needs of those professionals or their market, broadly different 25 years later, and (3) the rhythm of the diffusion of these innovations, approximately 2. 5 %/year, related to the life-cycle of the vine plant. In France, the awareness of obtaining grape varieties resistant to diseases emerged quite late, except in the case of the work of one research director from INRA, starting the improvement of the varieties in that direction in the 1980 s. His work was merely recently resumed. Since World War II, those working in Europe on the new grape varieties have been mainly public researchers. However, the contractual relationships with stakeholders in charge of spreading those varieties – the nurseries -vary considerably according to the countries, the size and the strategy of the grape nurseries. The issues related to licenses and royalties are an essential matter. The industry is therefore characterized by the presence of various resistant grape varieties created in several countries in Europe by researchers or grape nurseries. In each country where the new varieties were created, new varieties were registered in every national catalogue, but registration of those foreign varieties were not, until today, extended to the French national catalogue. Therefore, it excludes those varieties from potential CAP subsidies. Some innovative grape growers anticipated the social demand and adopted those resistant varieties without the support of public subsidies. In addition, those grape growers processed the grapes and established a label to highlight this environmental advantage. A scientific controversy adds to the environmental and social issues, which deals with the ‘stability of the resistance’ over time. In short, the first varieties obtained featured a ‘monogenic’ resistance, considered by some researchers as easily circumvented. These researchers block or try to slow down the availability of new resistant varieties, waiting for the registration at the French national catalogue of a ‘new wave’ of grape varieties whose resistance would be ‘polygenic’. This scientific controversy creates uncertainty for public officers and a standby position criticized by those wishing a faster diffusion of those innovations in the wine chain. Further, the wine production in Europe is traditionally characterized by quality designations of origin - PGI and PDO – which base their reputation on the main traditional grape varieties and therefore exclude new grape varieties. In France, those quality designations account for approximately 85 percent of the wine production and create most of the value in the wine chain. This exclusion inhibits significant extension. Finally, the issues allowing the rapid diffusion of resistant grape varieties excluding pesticides might include: fostering the rate of renewing <b>vineyards,</b> the <b>register</b> of new European grape varieties in the French national catalogue, the full or partial acceptation of the new grape varieties in PDO areas, the increase of the political pressure from ecologists and the civil society about the reduction of phytosanitary inputs, the integration of those varieties in the national endowment of the wine CMO for the restructuring of vineyards or, finally, the insertion of resistance genes in traditional varieties through faster means than classic genetics. However, the strategy consisting in the creation of new varieties through GMO methods seems not adapted to the Society, including at the research level...|$|R
