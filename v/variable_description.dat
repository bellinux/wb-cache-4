30|$|While {{the complex}} random <b>variable</b> <b>description</b> of a {{wireless}} channel as Rayleigh, Rician, etc., forms {{one aspect of}} characterization, another one involves taking the time-variations of the channel filter taps into consideration. A common assumption on the random process that drive the time-variations of the channel filter taps is its wide-sense stationarity. In other words, the mean and the auto-correlation functions of each filter tap {{are assumed to be}} independent of time, with the latter being a function of the time-difference alone. Further, each tap at a given time instant is assumed to be independent of every other tap at any time instant. Together these two assumptions give rise to the wide-sense stationary, uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) model.|$|E
