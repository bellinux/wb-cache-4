Should be there no frequency received (such as on an uncoded track in a maintenance depot or {{in case of an}} equipment failure), the driver may proceed at a low speed while holding a vigilance pedal.|$|E
5000|$|All CityRail trains {{now have}} an {{additional}} safety feature, which has been fitted since the accident. In addition to the deadman handle and foot pedal, the trains are fitted with [...] "task linked vigilance" [...] - which resets a timer every time the driver activates certain controls. If there is no change in control, a flashing lamp and then buzzer sound and the driver is required to acknowledge a <b>vigilance</b> <b>button.</b> If the train's driver does not use the controls and does not acknowledge the vigilance alarm, the vigilance system is activated and makes an emergency brake application. All trains have also been fitted with data loggers to record the driver's and guard's actions as they work the train, {{as well as the}} train's speed. Such a system had been fitted to G7, but was in the early stage of fleet roll-out, and hence had not been commissioned and switched on {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|E
