The {{abrasive}} wear resistance of ruthenium aluminide intermetallic and ferritic steel containing an iron-chrome sigma intermetallic phase {{have been investigated}} in this study. A medium carbon wear resistant steel (MCV) {{was used in the}} study to facilitate comparison between wear resistances in the materials of interest. Specimens of ruthenium aluminide, MCV and ferritic stainless steels containing a sigma phase were produced. The MCV steel was quenched and tempered to match the bulk hardness of the as-received ruthenium aluminide. Five different grades of thermomechanically worked ferritic steels specimens were heat treated to produce different volume fractions of sigma phase. The mechanical properties of the specimens were investigated by compression testing and microhardness measurements. Abrasion testing was carried out on a pin on belt abrasion apparatus. The surface response of the specimens to {{abrasive wear}} was characterised by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Microhardness of the specimens were measured with a digital <b>microhardness</b> <b>machine.</b> The wear resistance of ruthenium aluminide was found to be higher than all materials tested in this project. The wear resistance in some of the ferritic steels containing sigma phase was comparable to that of the wear resistant medium carbon steel.

The experiments of hardness testing {{were performed on}} a <b>microhardness</b> indentation <b>machine</b> under different loading conditions. Images of indentation impressions were obtained using an environmental scanning electron microscope. Geometrical shapes of hardness indentations were visualized in three-dimensional space using computer graphics.

Aluminium 6061 {{was used as}} a test material. Furthermore, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) is used for deformation analysis of strips to check the level of deformation along their thickness. Microhardness testing was done using Vickers <b>microhardness</b> testing <b>machine.</b> Microstructure characterization of bulk aluminium and chips (as strips) was done by electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD). For in-depth deformation analysis thickness of strips was reduced in steps up to 100 μm by abrasive papers. After each step of reducing thickness of strips by 100 μm, X- ray scan and microhardness testing of strips were performed. The results show that microstrain in strips was increased and crystallite size was decreased. Moreover, hardness of the strips was ∼ 40 - 44 % more than the bulk material. Higher hardness in strips may be attributed to their ultrafine microstructure resulted from high deformation observed in strips.

In this study, the effects of cutting conditions and tool wear on the surface integrity of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy after high-speed dry end milling were investigated. Different cutting speeds (100 – 300 m/min) and feeds (0. 03 and 0. 06 mm/tooth) as well as TiAlN + TiN physical vapor deposition (PVD) -coated carbide tool were employed during the machining trials. Surface roughness value and sub-surface <b>microhardness</b> of the <b>machined</b> surfaces were measured, and the corresponding alterations beneath the surface were characterized through electron microscopy. Results showed that surface roughness values at different cutting speeds directly depends on the tool conditions. The use of a new tool contributed to a higher surface quality of 185 nm compared to 320 nm for the used tool at the highest investigated cutting speed. It was found that operating the end milling with the new tool at a higher feed rate significantly decreased the surface roughness of the machined surface from 415 to 225 nm at a lower cutting speed. Feed marks and material redeposition defects were detected on the surface, while plastic deformation was observed in the sub-surface of the <b>machined</b> surface. <b>Microhardness</b> measurement revealed that no significant alterations occurred at the sub-surface when lower cutting speed and feed were employed.

40|$|Aim: This {{in vitro}} study was {{conducted}} on enamel blocks of human premolars {{with the aim of}} evaluating the remineralization potential of fluoride and ACP-CPP and the combination of ACP-CPP and fluoride on early enamel lesions. Materials and Methods: Fifteen intact carious free human premolars were selected. The coronal part of each tooth was sectioned into four parts to make 4 enamel blocks. The baseline SMH (surface microhardness) was measured for all the enamel specimens using Vickers <b>microhardness</b> (VHN) testing <b>machine.</b> Artificial enamel carious lesions were created by inserting the specimens in demineralization solution for 3 consecutive days. The SMH of the demineralised specimens was evaluated. Then the four enamel sections of each tooth were subjected to various surface treatments, i. e. Group 1 - Fluoride varnish, Group 2 - ACP-CPP cream, Group 3 - Fluoride &#x 002 B; ACP-CPP &#x 0026; Group 4 - Control (No surface treatment). A caries progression test (pH cycling) was carried out, which consisted of alternative demineralization (3 hours) and remineralization with artificial saliva (21 hours) for five consecutive days. After pH cycling again SMH of each specimen was assessed to evaluate the remineralization potential of each surface treatment agent. Then, to asses the remineralization potential of various surface treatments at the subsurface level, each enamel specimen was longitudinally sectioned through the centre to expose the subsurface enamel area. Cross-sectional microhardness (CSMH) was evaluated to assess any subsurface remineralization Results: Statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons test was applied to detect significant differences at P &# 8804; 0. 05 levels between various surface treatments at different phases. Conclusions: With in the limits, the present study concludes that; ACP-CPP cream is effective, but to a lesser extent than fluoride in remineralizing early enamel caries at surface level. Combination of fluoride and ACP-CPP does not provide any additive remineralization potential compared to fluoride alone. Fluoride, ACP-CPP and their combination are not effective in remineralizing the early enamel caries at the subsurface level...|$|R
40|$|Nickel base alloys are {{frequently}} used in aerospace industries, marine, biomedical application and other demanding industries {{due to their}} high strength, high hardness, resistant to corrosion and ability to withstand at elevated temperature. But machining of these materials in conventional way impairs severely their machinability due to certain inherent properties like low thermal conductivity, high chemical affinity and presence of hard particles in the microstructure etc. Therefore, tool life is reduced, due to the abrasion wear from the hard particles and high temperature of the tool-chip interface due to diffusion wear during machining of nickel base alloys. In this work, hot machining is introduced for processing of nickel base alloys like Inconel 718, Inconel 625, and Monel 400. In this technique, heating on the workpiece is combined with conventional turning process was used to enhanced machinability of nickel base alloy without compromise quality and productive. The study revealed that {{the influence of the}} workpiece temperature on the workpiece surface enhanced machining performance in terms of better surface finish, MRR, and reduction of forces, wear compared to conventional turning process. The surface integrity has been studied in terms of surface roughness, and <b>microhardness</b> beneath the <b>machined</b> surface in hot machining operation. Finite element modeling was also employed to prediction of cutting force, temperature distribution, stress, in hot turning of Inconel 718. The finite element results were compared with the experimental value and close agreement was found. In any industries production of parts along with tool life, surface finish is the major concern. In order to optimize the machining of nickel base alloys, optimization technique was performed using desirability and principal component analysis. Finally, machinability comparison was made between three materials, in order to understand effect of machining parameters along with workpiece temperature. In the literature, no research studies were found on flame heat machining of nickel base alloys (Inconel 625, Inconel 718 and Monel 400). The research led to various contributions to finding in terms of experimental investigation, optimization and FEM modeling.

40|$|Stellites are cobalt (Co) -based {{superalloys}} {{available in}} two main combinations: (a) a Tungsten (W) group with composition of Co-Cr-W-C, and (b) a Molybdenum (Mo) group containing Co-Cr-Mo-C. Stellites possess outstanding corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, wear resistance, heat resistance, and low magnetic permeability. Components made of stellites {{work well in}} highly corrosive environments and maintain these advantageous properties at elevated temperatures. Components made of stellites are widely used in the oil and gas, automotive, nuclear power, paper and pulp, chemical and petrochemical, refineries, automobile, aerospace and aircraft industries. By virtue of their nonmagnetic, anticorrosive and non-reactivity to human body-fluid properties, stellites are used in medical surgery and in surgical tools, tooth and bone implants and replacements, heart valves, and in heart pacemakers. The hardness range of stellites is from 32 to 55 HRC, which makes stellites brittle materials {{but they have a}} low Young’s modulus. Due to their high hardness, dense but non-homogeneous molecular structure and lower thermal conductivity, machining operations for parts made of stellites are extremely difficult, categorising stellites as difficult-to-machine materials like Ti-alloys, inconels, composites and stainless steels. Usually, machine components made of stellites are produced by a deposition method onto steel substrates instead of expensive solid stellite bars. The rough surfaces of deposited stellites are then finished by grinding, rather than some other economic machining process, which is costly and time-consuming, making stellite products very expensive.
