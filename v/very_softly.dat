25|$|Unintentional small jumps are {{ubiquitous}} to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue {{is slightly}} elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, {{no matter how}} slight, occurs. An oft-used way to illustrate this principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an inch {{in front of the}} cue ball. When shot <b>very</b> <b>softly,</b> the player will audibly hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed with any degree of speed no sound or collision is evident, and {{it is clear that the}} coin is being jumped.|$|E

[...] Attack hits are also frequently made with a poking motion with the knuckles or stiff straight fingers.|$|E

2500|$|One very {{important}} point was that when Hitler attacked Russia, he did so with his entire military might. Practically everyone who lived through it remembered the event as an instantaneous shock of tremendous power. None of this comes out in the symphony. The [...] "invasion" [...] theme begins <b>very</b> <b>softly</b> in the strings, pianissimo. It eventually becomes a howling monster, but only gradually. If this music portrays an invasion, it is not depicting a sudden one. It is an incremental takeover, one which could easily seem to come from within.|$|E

2500|$|As to {{the manner}} in which the hazzan (cantor) is to recite the Kol Nidrei, the Mahzor Vitry (early 12th century) gives the {{following}} directions: [...] "The first time he must utter it <b>very</b> <b>softly</b> like one who hesitates to enter the palace of the king to ask a gift of him whom he fears to approach; the second time he may speak somewhat louder; and the third time more loudly still, as one who is accustomed to dwell at court and to approach his sovereign as a friend." [...] However, Rabbi Meier ben Yitzchak of Worms (11th century), author of Akdamut, would sing it only twice, the Aleppo community would sing it seven times, and Rabbi Jacob Molin (of Mainz, the [...] "Maharil", died 1427) would sing it repeatedly in various tunes to ensure that latecomers would hear it.|$|E

2500|$|In 1923, Mussolini sent Italian {{forces to}} invade Corfu during the Corfu incident. In the end, the League of Nations proved powerless, and Greece {{was forced to}} comply with Italian demands. Writing of Mussolini's foreign policy, the American {{historian}} Gerhard Weinberg said: If the new regime Benito Mussolini installed in 1922 on {{the ruins of the}} old glorified war as a sign of vitality and repudiated pacifism as a form of decay, the lesson drawn from the terrible battles against Austria on the Isonzo river—in which the Italians fought far better than popular imagination often allows—was that the tremendous material and technical preparations needed for modern war were simply beyond the contemporary capacity of the country. This was almost certainly a correct perception, but, given the ideology of Fascism with its emphasis on the moral benefits of war, it did not lead to the conclusion that an Italy without a big stick had best speak very, <b>very</b> <b>softly.</b> On the contrary, the new regime drew the opposite conclusion. Noisy eloquence and rabid journalism might be substituted for serious preparations for war, a procedure that was harmless enough if no one took any of it seriously, but a certain road to disaster once some outside and Mussolini inside the country came to believe that the [...] "eight million bayonets" [...] of the Duce's imagination actually existed.|$|E
2500|$|Velvet worms {{literally}} {{creep up}} on their prey, with their smooth, gradual and fluid movement escaping detection by predators. Once they reach their prey, they touch it <b>very</b> <b>softly</b> with their antennae to assess its size and nutritional value. After each poke, the antenna is hastily retracted to avoid detection by the prey individual. This investigation may last anywhere upwards of ten seconds, until the velvet worm makes a {{decision as to whether}} to attack it, or until it disturbs the prey and the prey flees. Hungry Onychophora spend less time investigating their prey and are quicker to apply their slime. Once slime has been squirted, Onychophora are determined to pursue and devour their prey, in order to recoup the energetic investment. They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it. In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to use slime at all. Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion. While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied interior of its prey. [...] The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure. The pharynx is specially adapted for sucking, to extract the liquefied tissue; the arrangement of the jaws about the tongue and lip papillae ensures a tight seal and the establishment of suction. In social groups, the dominant female is the first to feed, not permitting competitors access to the prey item for the first hour of feeding. Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed. The number of males reaches a peak after females start to leave the prey item. After feeding, individuals clean their antennae and mouth parts before re-joining the rest of their group.|$|E

60|$|Joan was a slight, blossom-like girl in white, looking {{much like}} the pale, sweet-scented house rose she wore in her dark hair.

He had leaped forward, caught the young man by the breast of his shimmering doublet, leaped back to shelter beyond mademoiselle, hurled Marius to the ground, and planted his foot, shod as it was in his thickly mudded riding-boot, full upon the boy's long, shapely neck.|$|R

'Thank'ee, Sir,' and 'good-bye, Sir,' {{were said}} {{a good many}} times {{in a variety of}} voices, and the boys went out <b>very</b> slowly and <b>softly.</b> But there was the sun shining and there were the birds singing, as the sun only shines and the birds only sing on {{holidays}} and half-holidays; there were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among their leafy branches; the hay, entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air; the green corn, gently beckoning towards wood and stream; the smooth ground, rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows, inviting to runs and leaps, and long walks God knows whither. It was more than boy could bear, and with a joyous whoop the whole cluster took to their heels and spread themselves about, shouting and laughing as they went.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nanostructured {{semiconductor}} {{metal oxides}} {{have played a}} central role in the gas sensing research field, because of their high sensitivity, selectivity and low response time. Among all the processes, developed for the synthesis of nanostructured metal oxides, gel combustion seems to be the most promising route due to low-cost precursors and simplicity of the process. It combines chemical gelation and combustion, involving the formation of a gel from an acqueous solution and an exothermic redox reaction, yielding to <b>very</b> porous and <b>softly</b> agglomerated nanopowders. In this work, nanostructured tin oxide, SnO 2, and titanium oxide, TiO 2, have been synthesized through gel combustion. Powders showed nanometric particle size and high specific surface area. The so-obtained TiO 2 and SnO 2 nanopowders have been used as sensitive element of resistive λ sensor and ethanol sensor respectively, realized depositing films of nanopowders dispersed in water onto alumina substrates provided with Pt contacts and heater. TiO 2 -based sensors showed at high temperature good response, fast response time, linearity in a wide range of O 2 concentration and long-term stability. SnO 2 -based sensors have shown high sensitivity to low concentrations of ethanol at moderate temperature...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Pardon, as Olive observed, was {{a little}} out of this combination; but he was not a person to allow himself to droop. He came and seated himself by Miss Chancellor and {{broached}} a literary subject; he asked her if she were following any of the current [...] "serials" [...] in the magazines. On her telling him that she never followed anything of that sort, he undertook a defence of the serial system, which she presently reminded him that she had not attacked. He was not discouraged by this retort, but glided gracefully off to the question of Mount Desert; conversation on some subject or other being evidently a necessity of his nature. He talked <b>very</b> quickly and <b>softly,</b> with words, and even sentences, imperfectly formed; there was a certain amiable flatness in his tone, and he abounded in exclamations--"Goodness gracious!" [...] and [...] "Mercy on us!"--not much in use among the sex whose profanity is apt to be coarse. He had small, fair features, remarkably neat, and pretty eyes, and a moustache that he caressed, and an air of juvenility much at variance with his grizzled locks, and the free familiar reference in which he was apt to indulge to his career as a journalist. His friends knew that in spite of his delicacy and his prattle he was what they called a live man; his appearance was perfectly reconcilable with a large degree of literary enterprise. It should be explained {{that for the most part}} they attached to this idea the same meaning as Selah Tarrant--a state of intimacy with the newspapers, the cultivation of the great arts of publicity. For this ingenuous son of his age all distinction between the person and the artist had ceased to exist; the writer was personal, the person food for newsboys, and everything and every one were every one's business. All things, with him, referred themselves to print, and print meant simply infinite reporting, a promptitude of announcement, abusive when necessary, or even when not, about his fellow-citizens. He poured contumely on their private life, on their personal appearance, with the best conscience in the world. His faith, again, was the faith of Selah Tarrant--that being in the newspapers is a condition of bliss, and that it would be fastidious to question the terms of the privilege. He was an enfant de la balle, as the French say; he had begun his career, at the age of fourteen, by going the rounds of the hotels, to cull flowers from the big, greasy registers which lie on the marble counters; and he might flatter himself that he had contributed in his measure, and on behalf of a vigilant public opinion, the pride of a democratic State, to the great end of preventing the American citizen from attempting clandestine journeys. Since then he had ascended other steps of the same ladder; he was the most brilliant young interviewer on the Boston press. He was particularly successful in drawing out the ladies; he had condensed into shorthand many of the most celebrated women of his time--some of these daughters of fame were very voluminous--and he was supposed to have a remarkably insinuating way of waiting upon prime donne and actresses the morning after their arrival, or sometimes the very evening, while their luggage was being brought up. He was only twenty-eight years old, and, with his hoary head, was a thoroughly modern young man; he had no idea of not taking advantage of all the modern conveniences. He regarded the mission of mankind upon earth as a perpetual evolution of telegrams; everything to him was very much the same, he had no sense of proportion or quality; but the newest thing was what came nearest exciting in his mind the sentiment of respect. He was an object of extreme admiration to Selah Tarrant, who believed that he had mastered all the secrets of success, and who, when Mrs. Tarrant remarked (as she had done more than once) that it looked as if Mr. Pardon was really coming after Verena, declared that if he was, he was one of the few young men he should want to see in that connexion, one of the few he should be willing to allow to handle her. It was Tarrant's conviction that if Matthias Pardon should seek Verena in marriage, it would be with a view to producing her in public; and the advantage for the girl of having a husband who was at the same time reporter, interviewer, manager, agent, who had the command of the principal [...] "dailies," [...] would write her up and work her, as it were, scientifically--the attraction of all this was too obvious to be insisted on. Matthias had a mean opinion of Tarrant, thought him quite second-rate, a votary of played-out causes. It was his impression that he himself was in love with Verena, but his passion was not a jealous one, and included a remarkable disposition to share the object of his affection with the American people.|$|R
