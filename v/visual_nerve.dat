60|$|I can't {{leave this}} subject without noticing (by the way) {{what you say}} of the {{likeness}} to the catastrophe of 'Jane Eyre.' I have sent to the library here for 'Jane Eyre' (but haven't got it yet) in order to refresh my memory on this point; but, as far as I do recall the facts, the hero was monstrously disfigured and blinded in a fire the particulars of which escape me, and the circumstance of his being hideously scarred is the thing impressed chiefly on the reader's mind; certainly it remains innermost in mine. Now if you read over again those pages of my poem, {{you will find that}} the only injury received by Romney in the fire was from a blow and from the emotion produced by the circumstances of the fire. Not only did he not lose his eyes in the fire, but he describes the ruin of his house as no blind man could. He was standing there, a spectator. Afterwards he had a fever, and the eyes, the <b>visual</b> <b>nerve,</b> perished, showing no external stain--perished as Milton's did. I believe that a great shock on the nerves might produce such an effect in certain constitutions, and the reader on referring as far back as Marian's letter (when she avoided the marriage) may observe that his eyes had never been strong, that her desire had been to read his notes at night, and save them. For it was necessary, I thought, to the bringing-out of my thought, that Romney should be mulcted in his natural sight. The 'Examiner' saw that. Tell me if, on looking into the book again, you modify your feeling at all.|$|E

[...] "It was ordained," [...] said he {146b}, [...] "some few days before the creation, that my nose and this very post should have a rencounter, and therefore Providence thought fit to send us both into the world in the same age, and to make us countrymen and fellow-citizens. Now, had my eyes been open, it is very likely the business might have been a great deal worse, for how many a confounded slip is daily got by man with all his foresight about him. Besides, the eyes of the understanding see best when those of the senses are out of the way, and therefore blind men are observed to tread their steps with much more caution, and conduct, and judgment than those who rely with too much confidence upon the virtue of the <b>visual</b> <b>nerve,</b> which every little accident shakes out of order, and a drop or a film can wholly disconcert; like a lanthorn among a pack of roaring bullies when they scour the streets, exposing its owner and itself to outward kicks and buffets, which both might have escaped if the vanity of appearing would have suffered them to walk in the dark. But further, if we examine the conduct of these boasted lights, it will prove yet a great deal worse than their fortune. It is true I have broke my nose against this post, because Providence either forgot, or did not think it convenient, to twitch me by the elbow and give me notice to avoid it. But let not this encourage either the present age of posterity to trust their noses unto the keeping of their eyes, which may prove the fairest way of losing them for good and all. For, O ye eyes, ye blind guides, miserable guardians are ye of our frail noses; ye, I say, who fasten upon the first precipice in view, and then tow our wretched willing bodies after you to the very brink of destruction. But alas! that brink is rotten, our feet slip, and we tumble down prone into a gulf, without one hospitable shrub in the way to break the fall--a fall to which not any nose of mortal make is equal, except that of the giant Laurcalco {147a}, who was Lord of the Silver Bridge.

[...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.

No differences between the distribution patterns of the two products are detected; disco is expressed in many tissues including both neural and non-neural cells. Many of the cells which express disco undergo extensive movement during development as they participate in major morphogenetic movements. Antibody staining shows that the protein is found in the cell nucleus. Products of the disco gene are detected in cells near the terminus of the growing Bolwig's nerve. In embryos homozygous for either of two mutant alleles of disco, the disco protein is absent near the nerve terminus, although protein distribution elsewhere is indistinguishable from wild type...|$|E

The aim of this two-year study was to train the volunteer to localize a given object in nine different positions, to discriminate the object within a choice of six, and then to grasp it. METHODS: In a closed-loop protocol including a head worn video camera, the nerve was stimulated whenever {{a part of the}} processed image of the object being scrutinized matched the center of an elicitable phosphene. The accessible visual field included 109 phosphenes in a 14 degrees x 41 degrees area. RESULTS: Results showed that training was required to succeed in the localization and discrimination tasks, but practically no training was required for grasping the object. The volunteer was able to successfully complete all tasks after training. The volunteer systematically performed several left-right and bottom-up scanning movements during the discrimination task. Discrimination strategies included stimulation phases and no-stimulation phases of roughly similar duration.

The moderate heaviness of the medico-social burden (the middle duration of coming lif associated with disablement less than 20 years) is characteristic for diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and uveitis and the high degree of heaviness (the middle duration of coming life associated with disablement more than 30 years) for disease of eyeball, <b>visual</b> <b>nerve,</b> eye traumas, myopia and anophthalmia. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to evaluate the ability of intraoperative neuromonitoring to predict the postoperative functional outcome {{and its role in}} reducing the postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy rate during thyroidectomy for thyroid malignancy. MethodsBetween June 2007 and March 2013, 656 consecutive patients with thyroid cancer underwent thyroidectomy by a single surgical team. We compared 357 patients who have had neuromonitoring (Group A) to 299 patients who have undergone surgery with nerve visualization alone (group B). ResultsIn group A 7 recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis were observed (1. 96 %), 6 (1. 68 %) transient and 1 (0. 28 %) permanent; a bilateral recurrent laryngeal palsy was observed in 1 of the 7 cases (0. 28 %). In group B 6 recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis were observed (2. 01 %), 5 (2. 01 %) transient and 1 permanent (0. 33 %); bilateral palsy was observed in 1 of the 6 cases (0. 33 %). Differences were not statistically significative. ConclusionsRoutine <b>visual</b> <b>nerve</b> identification remains the gold standard of recurrent laryngeal nerve management in surgery for thyroid cancer. Intraoperative neuromonitoring is safe, effective, reliable, and easy to perform in excluding postoperative recurrent laryngeal palsy. It helps to identify the nerve in thyroid cancer, but it did not decrease the injuries compared with visualization alone in this study; however, its use can change the operative strategy in order to prevent the risk of bilateral damage in case of signal loss. Future studies are needed to evaluate the benefit of intraoperative neuromonitoring in thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) with CyberKnife for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. From October 2000 to March 2009, 100 patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma were treated with hypofractionated SRT. Forty-three patients were male, and 57 were female. The patient’s ages ranged from 16 to 82 years (median, 59 years). Five patients were medically inoperable, and 1 refused surgery; the remain-ing 94 were recurrent cases or those receiving postopera-tive adjuvant SRT. No patients {{had a history of}} previous cranial radiotherapy. Tumor volume ranged from 0. 7 to 64. 3 mL (median, 5. 1 mL). The marginal doses were 17. 0 to 21. 0 Gy for the 3 -fraction schedule and 22. 0 to 25. 0 Gy for the 5 -fraction schedule. Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. 0. The median follow-up period for living patients was 33 months (range, 18 – 118. 5 months). The 3 -year overall survival and local control rates were 98 % and 98 %, respectively. In-field and out-field tumor regrowth were observed in 3 and 2 patients, respectively. Transient cyst enlargement occurred in 3 cases. A post-SRT grade 2 visual disorder occurred in 1 patient. Symptomatic post-SRT hypopitui-tarism was observed in 3 of 74 patients who had not received hormone replacement therapy after surgery. CyberKnife SRT involving 21 Gy in 3 fractions or 25 Gy in 5 fractions is safe and effective for surgical treatment of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. Hypofractionated SRT appears useful for protecting the <b>visual</b> <b>nerve</b> and neuroendocrine function, especially for tumors located near the optic pathways and large tumors...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} genes {{necessary for}} establishing {{connections in the}} Drosophila sensory nervous system, we designed a screen for mutations affecting development of the larval visual system. The larval visual system has a simple and stereotypic morphology, can be recognized histologically {{by a variety of}} techniques, and is unnecessary for viability. Therefore, it provides an opportunity to identify genes involved in all stages of development of a simple, specific neuronal connection. By direct observation of the larval visual system in mutant embryos, we identified 24 mutations affecting its development; 13 of these are larval visual system-specific. These 13 mutations can be grouped phenotypically into five classes based on their effects on location, path or morphology of the larval <b>visual</b> system <b>nerves</b> and organs. These mutants and phenotypic classifications provide a context for further analysis of neuronal development, pathfinding and target recognition...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} visual evoked {{potentials}} (VEP) and electroretinograms (ERG) generated during electrical {{stimulation of the}} human optic nerve using the optic <b>nerve</b> <b>visual</b> prosthesis (ONVP). Methods. Two volunteers, both blind with no light perception from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), were chronically implanted with the optic <b>nerve</b> <b>visual</b> prosthesis. Cortical evoked potentials were recorded using 16 scalp electrodes and antidromic ERGs were obtained using DTL electrodes whilst electrically stimulating the optic nerve. The results were compared with flash and eye surface electrical stimulation results in normal sighted control subjects. Results. The VEPs obtained in our two implanted volunteers have a similar waveshape to those obtained in normal sighted volunteers during flash stimulation but latency is reduced by about 25 ms. The VEP recorded during surface eye stimulation are similar in both normal sighted and RP volunteers. The VEPs were compared at sub- and supra-threshold stimulation strength and with different electrode configurations. Finally, the antidromic ERG recordings obtained in our implanted volunteers show a unique inner retinal potential generated by retrograde stimulation of the eye from the optic nerve. Conclusion. Evoked potentials {{can be used to}} examine how a visual prosthesis generates visual sensations. This provides an objective means to investigate various aspects of the visual prostheses...|$|R
40|$|Current biophysical {{studies of}} {{membrane}} proteins are {{centered on the}} relation of their structures to key biological functions of membranes in terms of lipid-protein interactions. The conformational transition of rhodopsin from Metarhodopsin I to Metarhodopsin II (Meta I-Meta II) is the triggering event for the visual process. Meta II is the activated form of the visual receptor and binds a signal transducing G protein (transducin), followed by two amplification stages which lead to generation of a <b>visual</b> <b>nerve</b> impulse. Herein, flash photolysis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy techniques {{have been used to}} monitor the Meta I-Meta II transition of rhodopsin in various membrane recombinants. The flash photolysis experiments clearly show a substantial shift {{to the left of the}} Meta I-Meta II equilibrium for rhodopsin in egg phosphatidylcholine recombinant membranes. Investigation of the influences on rhodopsin function by non-lamellar forming lipids reveals a characteristic relationship between the Gibbs free energy change for the Meta I-Meta II equilibrium of rhodopsin and the intrinsic curvature of the lipid bilayer. Complementary SPR studies suggest a protrusion of the protein at the activated Meta II state which may be associated with exposure of recognition sites for the signal transducing G protein on the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin. All the experimental results obtained here are consistent with the hypothesis of a new flexible surface biomembrane model. The Meta II state is favored by a negative spontaneous curvature of the bilayer, corresponding to an imbalance of the lateral forces within the polar head groups and acyl chains. The mean curvature of membrane bilayer in the Meta II state reflects the small spontaneous curvature of the lipid bilayer in the vicinity of protein. Relief of the lipid curvature frustration in the Meta II state energetically couples the lipids to the photoexcitation of rhodopsin. Consideration of the various energetic contributions suggests the bilayer curvature free energy provides a reservoir of work in the modulation of rhodopsin function in the visual process. These studies that biophysical properties of the liquid-crystalline lipid bilayer are important in relation to protein function and may be relevant to the biomedical investigations of visual dysfunction...|$|E

Antes de iniciar o tratamento, foram avaliados os Ãndices antropomÃtricos e a pressÃo arterial. TambÃm foram realizadas as dosagens em jejum de triglicerÃdeos, colesterol total, colesterol de alta densidade (HDL), gama glutamil transferase, aspartato amino transferase, alanina amino transferase, proteÃna C reativa, microalbuminÃria, Ãxido nÃtrico, glicose, hemoglobina glicada (A 1 C), peptÃdeo C, insulina e glucagon. ApÃs um estÃmulo alimentar de 566 Kcal foram feitas coletas de sangue seriadas durante 3 horas nos tempos de 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 e 180 minutos para a dosagem de glicose, insulina e glucagon com a construÃÃo da Ãrea sob a curva (AUC) destes analitos. Um subgrupo de 20 pacientes realizou ainda, anÃlises seriadas das incretinas (GLP- 1 ativo e GIP total) apÃs estÃmulo alimentar e, tambÃm, exames eletroneurofisiolÃgicos (potenciais evocados somato-sensitivos â PESS, e visuais - PEV). ApÃs estas avaliaÃÃes, os pacientes receberam sitagliptina 100 mg (1 comprimido/dia) por um perÃodo de 3 meses, apÃs o qual, eles retornaram para avaliaÃÃo clÃnica e para realizar todas as dosagens bioquÃmicas e os exames de PESS e PEV que haviam realizado no inÃcio do estudo. Dos 41 pacientes avaliados, 28 eram do sexo feminino e 13 do sexo masculino, idade mÃdia de 53, 2 Â 9, 43 anos, em mÃdia obesos e 50 % deles eram hipertensos. ApÃs o tratamento, observou-se a melhora dos Ãndices antropomÃtricos, de todos os parÃmetros laboratoriais com Ãnfase na glicose em jejum (prÃ: 174, 43 Â 67, 18 e pÃs: 129, 07 Â 29, 19 mg/dL), A 1 C (prÃ: 8, 76 Â 2, 68 e pÃs: 6, 64 Â 1, 11 %) e Ãxido nÃtrico (prÃ: 85, 21 Â 44, 02 e pÃs: 39, 91 Â 20, 99 ÂM), todos com P< 0, 0001 e ainda, aumento da concentraÃÃo da AUC de GLP- 1 ativo (P= 0, 003) e diminuiÃÃo da AUC de GIP total (P= 0, 001), bem como diminuiÃÃo das latÃncias N 9 D (P< 0, 0001), N 13 E (P= 0, 036), N 20 D (P= 0, 028) e dos tempos de conduÃÃo central N 13 -N 9 E (P= 0, 045), N 20 -N 13 D (P= 0, 044), alÃm de correlaÃÃes com significÃncia estatÃstica entre parÃmetros bioquÃmicos e eletroneurofisiolÃgicos. Este estudo concluiu que houve melhora clÃnica, metabÃlica e nas vias de conduÃÃo do impulso nervoso somato-sensitivo e visual dos pacientes tratados com sitagliptina. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a syndrome associated with deficient insulin secretion, resistance to insulin action or {{the combination of}} both. It is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia that {{in a long term}} can cause retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy. The present interventional, prospective and open study was designed to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of sitagliptin in metabolic control of diabetes mellitus type 2 recently diagnosed (less than 6 months) and in pathways of visual and somatosensory nerve conduction. Blood pressure and anthropometric data were colected before treatment. Measures of fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, microalbumin, nitric oxide, glucose, glycated hemoglobin (A 1 C), C-peptide, insulin and glucagon were also collected. Also during the pre-study, after a feeding stimulus of 566 Kcal, biochemical evaluations were conducted of the metabolism in fasting and during 3 hours, in standard intervals of 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes for glucose, insulin and glucagon for design of the area under curve (AUC) of these analytes. In a subgroup of 20 patients were performed dosages in pre-fixed times of incretins (active Glucagon Like Peptide - 1, GLP- 1, and total Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic polypeptide, GIP) after feeding stimulus and electroneurophysiological tests (somatosensory evoked potentials - SEP, and visual - VEP). After these evaluations, the patients received sitagliptin 100 mg (1 tablet a day) for 3 months and then returned for clinical evaluation and to repeat all the biochemical dosages, SEP and VEP exams. From 41 patients evaluated, 28 were female and 13 male, the average age was 53. 2 Â 9. 43 years, in average obese and 50 % were hypertensive. After treatment, improvement was observed in all anthropometric and laboratory parameters, specially fasting glucose (pre: 174, 43 Â 67, 18 mg/dL and post: 129, 07 Â 29, 19 mg/dL), A 1 c (pre: 8, 76 Â 2, 68 and post: 6, 64 Â 1, 11 %), and nitric oxide (pre: 85, 21 Â 44, 02 and post: 39, 91 Â 20, 99 ÂM), all with P< 0. 0001, and also increase in the concentration of the AUC of active GLP- 1 (P= 0. 003), decrease of the AUC of total GIP (P= 0. 001), and decrease of the N 9 D (P< 0. 0001), N 13 E (P= 0. 036), N 20 D (P= 0. 028) latencies and of the central conduction time N 13 -N 9 E (P= 0. 045), N 20 -N 13 D (P= 0. 044).
