All manifolds and maps {{are assumed to}} be of class C∞. A definition of foliations can be found in [2]. Let Folm,n be the category of foliated m + n-dimensional manifolds with n-dimensional foliations and their foliation respecting local diffeomorphisms. Let (M,F) be a Folm,n-object. Then we have an adapted r-th order frame bundle P r(M,F) = {jr 0 ϕ | ϕ: (Rm+n,Fm,n) → (M,F) is a Folm,n-map} overM of (M,F) with the target projection, where Fm,n = {{a}×Rn} a∈Rm is the n-dimensional canonical foliation on Rm+n. We see that P r(M,F) is a principal bundle with the standard Lie group Grm,n = P r(Rm+n,Fm,n) 0 (with the multipli-cation given by the composition of jets) acting on the right on P r(M,F) by the com-position of jets.

In this paper we consider markets modeled by Itô-Lévy processes. In the first part we use the maximum principle in stochastic control theory to extend the above relation to a dynamic relation, valid for all t ∈ [0,T]. We prove in particular that the optimal adjoint process for the primal problem coincides with the optimal density process, and that the optimal adjoint process for the dual problem coincides with the optimal wealth process; 0 < t < T. In the terminal time case t=T we recover the classical duality connection above. We get moreover an explicit relation between the optimal portfolio φ ^* and the optimal measure Q^*.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{prerequisite}} to accurate interpretation of RQ-PCR data is robust data normalization. A commonly used {{method is to}} compare the cycle threshold (CT) of target miRNAs with those of a stably expressed endogenous (EC) miRNA(s) from the same sample. Despite {{the large number of}} studies reporting miRNA expression patterns, comparatively few appropriate ECs have been reported thus far. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify stably expressed miRNAs with which to normalize RQ-PCR data derived from human blood specimens. METHODS: MiRNA profiling of approximately 380 miRNAs was performed on RNA derived from blood specimens from 10 women with breast cancer and 10 matched controls. Analysis of mean expression values across the dataset (GME) identified stably expressed candidates. Additional candidates were selected from the literature and analyzed by the geNorm algorithm. Further validation of three candidate ECs by RQ-PCR was performed in a larger cohort (n = 40 cancer, n = 20 control) was performed, including analysis by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. RESULTS: Microarray screening identified 10 candidate ECs with expression patterns closest to the global mean. Geometric averaging of candidate ECs from the literature using geNorm identified miR- 425 as the most stably expressed miRNA. MiR- 425 and miR- 16 were the best combination, achieving the lowest <b>V-value</b> of 0. 185. Further validation by RQ-PCR confirmed that miR- 16 and miR- 425 were the most stably expressed ECs overall. Their combined use to normalize expression data enabled the detection of altered target miRNA expression that reliably differentiated between cancers and controls in human blood specimens. CONCLUSION: This study identified that the combined use of 2 miRNAs, (miR- 16 and miR- 425) to normalize RQ-PCR data generated more reliable results than using either miRNA alone, or use of U 6. Further investigation into suitable ECs for use in miRNA RQ-PCR studies is warranted...|$|E

The large number of phenotype description by prakriti determination {{is based on the}} knowledge and experience of the assessor, and hence subject to inherent variations and interpretations. Objective: In this study we have attempted to relate dominant prakriti attribute to body mass index (BMI) of individuals by assessing an acceptable tool to provide the quantitative measure to the currently qualitative ayurvedic prakriti determination. Materials and Methods: The study is cross sectional, multicentered, and prakriti assessment of a total of 3416 subjects was undertaken. Healthy male, nonsmoking, nonalcoholic volunteers between the age group of 20 - 30 were screened for their prakriti after obtaining written consent to participate in the study. The prakriti was determined on the phenotype description of ayurvedic texts and simultaneously by the use of a computer-aided prakriti assessment tool. Kappa statistical analysis was employed to validate the prakriti assessment and Chi-square, Cramer′s V test to determine the relatedness in the dominant prakriti to various attributes. Results: We found 80 % concordance between ayurvedic physician and software in predicting the prakriti {{of an individual}}. The kappa value of 0. 77 showed moderate agreement in prakriti assessment.

Equivalent Step Index (ESI) and Mode Field Diameter (MFD) are still causing confusion and no real standard procedure has won the confidence of laboratory users. In a previous paper we have shown that in principle, a self For consistent method can unify both the ESI and MFD approaches. instance, {{it has been shown}} that the two parameter of the ESI approximation as derived from the moment theory of single-mode optical fibres can be determined independently from either measurement of the Petermann MFD or from measurements of the refractive index profile. This duality feature makes the moments description of single-mode fibres unique amongst a whole range of experimental and theoretical characterization methods. In this paper we implement and critically assess our new approach using three independent measurement procedures. The ESI parameters as obtained from (i) MFD measurements, (ii) preform profile measurements and (iii) fibre profile measurements are compared for a nominally step index fibre fabricated by the MCVD process. A statistical approach is adopted in analysing the measurement data, thereby reducing the influence of measurement error and other inherent uncertainties. Results show that while the preform and the fibre profile measurements produce essentially the same equivalent core radius and the same equivalent numerical aperture (with allowance for diffusion effects) the ESI parameters produced by the MFD are substantially different. The discrepancy arises from the use of the "effective" cut-off wavelength, as derived from the MFD measurements, instead of the "theoretical" cut-off wavelength (corresponding to a <b>V-value</b> of 2. 405) in the evaluation of the ESI parameters. However, it is found that if the cut-off wavelength as derived from the profile measurements, is used in the interpretation of the MFD data then, the three measurement approaches predict very similar ESI parameters.
