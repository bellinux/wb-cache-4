5|$|Although in {{operational}} use the <b>Vulcan</b> typically carried various nuclear armaments, {{the type}} {{also had a}} secondary conventional role. While performing conventional combat missions, the <b>Vulcan</b> could carry up to 21 bombs inside its bomb bay. From the 1960s, the various <b>Vulcan</b> squadrons would routinely conduct conventional training missions; the aircrews {{were expected to be}} able to perform conventional bombing missions in addition to the critical nuclear strike mission the <b>Vulcan</b> normally performed.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, Enterprise attempts to avert a war, and is caught in a crossfire between <b>Vulcan</b> and Andorian starships. Meanwhile. Captain Archer, Commander T'Pol, and T'Pau aim to take the Kir'Shara to the <b>Vulcan</b> capital, {{and use it to}} reveal Administrator V'Las' plot {{to the rest of the}} <b>Vulcan</b> High Command.|$|E
5|$|The Avro <b>Vulcan</b> (later Hawker Siddeley <b>Vulcan</b> from July 1963) is a jet-powered {{tailless}} {{delta wing}} high-altitude strategic bomber, which was {{operated by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the <b>Vulcan</b> in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the <b>Vulcan</b> was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option. Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the Andorians were rivals {{with the}} <b>Vulcans.</b> The <b>Vulcans</b> annexed the Andorian planet Weytahn, which the <b>Vulcans</b> call Paan Mokar. By the 22nd century, {{the two had}} entered a cold war of sorts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vulcans</b> are {{typically}} depicted as stronger, faster, and longer-lived than humans (although discrepancies have occurred—and {{although not as}} long as <b>Vulcans,</b> humans have been shown to live longer in the Star Trek universe than today—presumably as the result of advances in medical science). <b>Vulcans</b> are about three times as strong as an average human because of their home planet's higher gravity, although their durability is equal to humans. There are instances of them living over two hundred and twenty years. Having evolved on a desert world, <b>Vulcans</b> can survive without water for longer periods than humans. <b>Vulcans</b> can also go without sleep for as long as two weeks. Romulans are similar in appearance to <b>Vulcans,</b> with whom they share a common ancestry.|$|R

The winning city was Columbus, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use of a mind meld. Since the act is widely considered to be criminal by the <b>Vulcan</b> authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two disagree about the tenets of the group — the <b>Vulcan</b> authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old <b>Vulcan,</b> and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
5000|$|In {{their first}} season, the <b>Vulcans</b> {{proved to be}} an instant powerhouse. With an undefeated 21-0-1 record in the TBMJHL regular season, the <b>Vulcans</b> also posted an overall record of 33-2-3 with {{combined}} regular season record and exhibition schedule versus the local NCAA loop (including the Lakehead Nor'Westers) and the semi-pro United States Hockey League. The <b>Vulcans</b> easily won the league title and moved on to the 1972 Centennial Cup National playdowns. In the first round they drew the Central Junior A Hockey League champion Smiths Falls Bears. The <b>Vulcans</b> masterfully defeated the Bears 4-games-to-1 and outscored them 36-19, including a 15-4 blowout win to clinch the series. In the National quarter-final, the <b>Vulcans</b> drew the Southern Ontario Junior A Hockey League's Guelph CMC's. Guelph edged out a pair of 5-4 victories to open the series. Game three was a 7-3 win for the <b>Vulcans,</b> and Game four was won 7-0. The CMC's rebounded in Game five with a 6-2 to take a 3-2 series lead. In Game six, the <b>Vulcans</b> defaulted the game only 1:42 into the first period. [...] The coach of the <b>Vulcans</b> was unhappy about a series of calls the referee made and pulled the <b>Vulcans</b> off of the ice in front of 4,200 Guelph fans. The ref awarded the game to Guelph {{when it became clear that}} the <b>Vulcans</b> would not return. Guelph went on to easily win the Centennial Cup, leaving the boys on the <b>Vulcans,</b> who were far from down and out, wondering what could have been.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 the Junior Warriors again {{competed in}} the Toyota Cup while senior players who were not {{required}} for the first team play with the Auckland <b>Vulcans</b> in the NSW Cup.

50|$|California of Pennsylvania {{eliminated}} Bloomsburg University, 27-24, {{to advance}} to the semifinals. The <b>Vulcans</b> scored two third-quarter touchdowns to take a 27-17 lead, but Bloomsburg scored on a 1-yard run by quarterback Dan Latorre to close the gap to 27-24. The Huskies were attempting a game-winning drive, but the <b>Vulcans</b> linebacker Darren Burns forced a fumble by Latorre on a 28-yard quarterback draw and Brandon Gordon recovered the fumble for the <b>Vulcans.</b> The <b>Vulcans</b> then ran out the clock.|$|R
5|$|Filming {{started on}} September 23, 2004, and {{concentrated}} on Enterprise ship scenes on the standing sets {{for the first two}} days. After that production moved to the cave sets, which were dressed with <b>Vulcan</b> artifacts. On the fourth day of production, those artifacts were removed so that the same sets could use used to film the visions that Archer has of Surak. All exterior scenes in the <b>Vulcan</b> desert-like Forge were shot on a soundstage. The final day of filming took place on October 1, when all the scenes set in the <b>Vulcan</b> High Command were filmed. These involved only Foxworth, Graham and Rubinstein as well as a handful of extras.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG <b>Vulcan</b> for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how <b>Vulcan</b> would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected <b>Vulcan</b> again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for <b>Vulcan</b> to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E

50|$|The Cal U {{football}} team has won five consecutive PSAC championships, beginning in 2005. The <b>Vulcans</b> also won in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The <b>Vulcans</b> {{football team}} ended the 2007 season ranked #4 in the NCAA Division II, won the PSAC Championship, and captured their first NCAA Regional title, Defeating Shepherd University by {{a score of}} 58-38. With that victory, Cal U advanced to the National Semifinal game, which was played at Hepner-Bailey Field at Adamson Stadium. The <b>Vulcans</b> lost in their first attempt to advance to a National Championship, falling to Valdosta State (Georgia), 28-24. In 2008, the <b>Vulcans</b> again advanced won the Regional title, this time traveling to Bloomsburg and defeating the Huskies 27-24. Once again the <b>Vulcans</b> were rewarded with hosting rights for the National Semifinal.

After being grounded it was later restored to flight by the <b>Vulcan</b> To The Sky Trust and displayed as a civilian aircraft from 2008 until 2015, before being retired a second time for engineering reasons. In retirement, XH558 is to be retained at its base at Doncaster Sheffield Airport as a taxi-able aircraft, a role already performed by two other survivors, XL426 (G-VJET) based at Southend Airport, and XM655 (G-VULC), based at Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield.|$|E
5|$|The Avro 732 was a 1956 {{proposal}} for a supersonic development of the <b>Vulcan</b> {{and would have been}} powered by 8 de Havilland Gyron Junior engines. Unlike the proposed Avro 721 low-level bomber of 1952 or the Avro 730 supersonic stainless steel canard bomber dating from 1954 (cancelled in 1957 before completion of the prototype), the Type 732 showed its <b>Vulcan</b> heritage.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Kuwait by neighbouring Iraq in 1991, a total of eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War. RAF strike aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado would frequently {{make use of the}} tanker to refuel prior to launching cross-border strikes inside of Iraq. Shortly after the Gulf War, the remaining Victor fleet was quickly retired in 1993, at which point it had been the last of the three V-bombers in operational service; retiring nine years after the last <b>Vulcan,</b> although the <b>Vulcan</b> had survived longer in its original role as a bomber.|$|E
