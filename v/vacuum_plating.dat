The effect of two kinds of braced pillars on stress distribution of <b>vacuum</b> <b>plate</b> glass was analyzed by electrometric method, and was in comparison. The stress distribution of their important sides was obtained such as sealing side, supporting side and braced pillar. The experimental result showed that maximal stress of braced pillar for vacuum glass occurred in the end side of each braced pillar. Controlling high precision of the brace height and good flatness of the glass sheet considerably improve <b>vacuum</b> <b>plate</b> glass quality, such as its strength, its dependability and service life...|$|R

Two separate investigations: cell-contact integrity (metal-to-silicon adherence), and cracked cells identified with fracture-strength-reducing flaws are discussed. In the cell-contact-integrity investigation, analysis of contact pull-strength data shows that cell types made with different metallization technologies, i. e., <b>vacuum,</b> <b>plated,</b> screen-printed and soldered, have appreciably different reliability attributes. In the second investigation, fracture strength was measured using Czochralski wafers and cells taken at various stages of processing and differences were noted.

This arises from the decreased polarizability of the <b>vacuum</b> between the <b>plates</b> via virtual electron–positron pair production, suggesting the possibility in principle of faster–than–c signal propagation. Along these lines one could also conceive of a decreased polarizability in the presence of nuclei with charges above the critical charge (Z ≥ Zcr 164 – 172), associated with the charged vacuum as ground state [5].

40|$|Although blast {{mitigation}} is {{most often}} achieved with solid shielding, ambient gas pressure can also affect the coupling of shock waves to solid targets. In this work the role of air as an energy transfer medium was examined experimentally by subjecting identical large-area rectangular witness plates to short-range blast effects in air and vacuum ({approx} 50 mtorr) at 25 C. The expanding reactant front of 3 kg C 4 charges was observed by fast camera to be cylindrically symmetric in both air and vacuum. The horizontal component of the reactant cloud velocity (perpendicular to the witness plates) was constant in both cases, with values of 3. 0 and 5. 9 km/s for air and vacuum, respectively. As {{a result of the}} blast, witness plates were plastically deformed into a shallow dish geometry, with local maxima 30 and 20 mm deep for air and vacuum, respectively. The average plate deflection from the air blast was 11 mm, {approx} 10 % deeper than the average <b>vacuum</b> <b>plate</b> deflection. Shock pressure estimates were made with a simple impedance-matching model, and indicate peak values in the 30 - 50 MPa range are consistent with the reactant cloud density and velocity.

40|$|WLCSP bumps have {{traditionally}} been produced by dropping preformed solder spheres through a metal template onto silicon wafers using modified surface mount stencil printers [1]. The squeegee blades associated with these printers have been retrofitted with a special fixture in which spheres are gravity feed down through a narrow slot. This same stencil printer {{is often used to}} apply the flux to the wafer just prior to sphere dropping. Several issues are associated with this technology that limit its widespread use in high volume and high yield applications. These limitations include: 1) there is a practical lower limit to the size of sphere that can be dropped, 2) the seal between the slotted fixturing and the wafer can fail, causing a release of all the spheres into the tool (often referred to as bursts or escapes), and 3) the yields are statistically low. One new WLCSP technology that is showing high promise toward eliminating these issues, is Wafer Level Solder Sphere Transfer (also called Gang Ball Placement) [2]. This technology uses a patterned <b>vacuum</b> <b>plate</b> to simultaneous pick up all of the preformed solder spheres, optically inspect for yield, and then transfer them over to the wafer. This paper will discuss this technology and the process parameters for producing WLCSP bumps. Throughput levels of 25 to 30 wafers per hour were measured. Yield losses of less than 10 ppm were realized for placing 300 µm spheres onto 200 mm wafers with ~ 80, 000 I/Os. Similar yields have been observed for placing 60 µm flip chip sized spheres onto semiconductor wafers...|$|R
