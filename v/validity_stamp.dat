40|$|Background and aims: A child's {{nutritional}} status may deteriorate {{over the course}} of a hospital admission. No universally accepted paediatric nutritional screening tool exists. This study aimed to evaluate validity and ease of use of two new instruments, STAMP and STRONGKIDS, for the assessment of nutritional risk of paediatric inpatients. Methods: In a cross-sectional study two trained investigators applied STAMP and STRONGKIDS to eligible inpatients. Demographic data, clinical information and anthropometric measurements were recorded. Correlation of assessed risk and two factors predictive of nutritional risk, anthropometric {{nutritional status}} and presence of nutritional intervention, were used to evaluate validity of the instruments. Results: The 43 children assessed by STAMP and STRONGKIDS, were assessed as: STAMP: 44 % high risk, 28 % medium risk and 28 % low risk and STRONGKIDS: 27 % high risk, 49 % medium risk and 24 % low risk. STAMP scores correlated to anthropometric measures of chronic undernutrition (height-for-age) but not measures of acute undernutrition (BMI). STRONGKIDS correlated to all anthropometric measures. For STAMP and STRONGKIDS, 57 % and 83 % of high risk children respectively, received nutritional intervention. Conclusions: In terms of <b>validity,</b> <b>STAMP</b> correlates less closely to anthropometric assessment of nutritional status and identifies considerably more children receiving no nutritional intervention as high risk than STRONGKIDS. Our results suggest that STRONGKIDS may be a more useful paediatric nutritional screening tool but further comparative studies are required. © 2011 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism...|$|E

The Caicos are not {{politically}} independent of the Turks and there remainssome controversy about the <b>validity</b> of the <b>stamps,</b> although they have been accepted for postaluse.|$|R
50|$|The People's Republic of Tannu Tuva issued {{postage stamps}} between 1926 and 1936. They were popular with young stamp {{collectors}} in the Western {{world in the}} mid-twentieth century because of the obscurity and exoticism of Tannu Tuva and the stamps' quirky, colorful designs. The <b>validity</b> of many <b>stamps</b> purportedly issued by Tannu Tuva has been questioned by philatelists.|$|R
50|$|With {{the reunification}} of Germany on 3 October 1990, the DP {{became part of the}} Deutsche Bundespost, which in turn later became the privatized Deutsche Post AG on 1 January 1995. As part of the reunification process, the DP's stamps became valid also for the FRG and West Berlin, {{beginning}} on 2 July 1990, and vice versa, until their eventual expiration.The dates regarding the expiration of the <b>validity</b> of GDR <b>stamps</b> were established as follows: for stamps Mi #1004-#3343, they were invalid as of 1 October 1990, while for Mi #3344-#3365, they were invalid as of 12 December 1991.|$|R
5000|$|On 31 July 1886 Gabon {{issued its}} first stamps, which were {{surcharges}} {{on the existing}} stock, to cover shortages of the most-used values. The overprint consisted of [...] "GAB" [...] in dots, plus the new value. Additional surcharges in 1888 were just the numeral, while in 1889 the postage due stamps were overprinted [...] "GABON / TIMBRE" [...] {{in addition to the}} new value, to indicate their <b>validity</b> as regular <b>stamps.</b> Also in 1889 15c and 25c stamps were locally typeset; they were inscribed [...] "Gabon-Congo / POSTES" [...] in one corner, the value in the opposite corner, and a diagonal [...] "Republique Française" [...] across the middle. All of these early issues were produced in small numbers, and not often seen.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study concerning the macroscale deformation of soft stamps for nanoimprint lithography. Composite stamps {{consisting of two}} or three layers were prepared with varying process parameters, and the bow of the stamps was investigated with an optical profilometer. Deflection measurements were compared with results from a mechanical model in order to prove its <b>validity.</b> The composite <b>stamps</b> were prepared from polydimethylsiloxane (S-PDMS) and OrmoStamp layers on different substrate materials (silicon or AF- 32 -glass). The influence of selected preparation parameters on the deformation was investigated, such as layer thickness, curing, and hardbake temperatures, as well as UV-exposure intensities. It is discussed how an appropriate choice of preparation parameters can reduce the deformation, too. By decreasing the curing intensity of a thin OrmoStamp layer, coated on top of a silicon wafer, from 200 mW/cm² to 2 mW/cm², the deformation was reduced from 6 µm to 0. It is shown that the mechanical model is capable of predicting the deformation of composite stamps consisting of OrmoStamp layers on top of a silicon substrate. Further on, deformation results for S-PDMS top layers are presented and discussed. As a promising process option for the reduction of stamp deformations, a new, room temperature curable PDMS recipe is introduced. For composite stamps prepared with this material, the deformation value was reduced below 10 lm, compared to values ranging from 10 µm up to 127 µm for thermally cured S-PDMS (50 °C or 70 °C). Finally, different two-layer stamps were coated with an additional third layer and measured again, in order to investigate the deflection for tri-layered cases. The research is of high relevance for the fabrication and application of substrate conformal imprint lithography stamps with minimized deflection...|$|R
