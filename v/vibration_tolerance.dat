While arachnoiditis may not yet be curable and can be significantly life-altering, management of the condition, including with medication, physical therapy, and if appropriate, psychotherapy, can help patients cope with the difficulties it presents. Surgical intervention generally has a poor outcome and may only provide temporary relief, but some cases of surgical success have been reported. Epidural steroid injections to treat sciatic pain have been linked {{as a cause of}} the disease by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as in other research, and are therefore discouraged as a treatment for Arachnoiditis as they will most likely worsen the condition.

40|$|PaperPg. 113 - 129. Rotor {{unbalance}} {{remains one}} of the leading causes of deterioration and vibration of rotating machinery; but, if physical weight corrections can be made, many machines can be successfully balanced in-place with considerable savings in downtime and labor costs. In-place balancing can, however, pose some unique problems, and a prime concern is the time, expense, and wear and tear to simply start and stop the machine for trial data. Therefore, this paper is presented to provide guidelines for recognizing and overcoming some of the more common in-place balancing problems so that the number of balance runs can be kept to a minimum. Vibration analysis techniques are presented as the first step to verify that the problem is truly unbalance and not looseness, weakness, distortion, resonance, misalignment, eccentricity, or other problems which could be mistaken for unbalance. Problems such as repeatability, rotor sag, stratification, thermal distortion, load effects, rotor speed and other variables which can influence rotor balance are discussed. Measurement techniques and common sources of measurement error are also presented. The importance of identifying the type of rotor unbalance (static, couple, quasi-static, or dynamic) is presented along with a review of common single- and two-plane balancing procedures with emphasis on their suitability for in-place balancing. Methods are presented for determining suitable trial weights - both amount and position - to achieve the desired results. Finally, guidelines are presented for establishing realistic balance and <b>vibration</b> <b>tolerances</b> for rotors balanced in-place...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} fiber lasers and fiber optic devices has {{experienced}} a sustained rapid growth despite witnessing the infamous 'telecom bubble burst'. All-fiber optic devices have inherent advantages of relatively low cost, compact design, light weight, low maintenance, and increased <b>vibration</b> <b>tolerances.</b> In this research, various new fiber lasers operating in Q-switching and mode-locking modes are proposed and demonstrated. At first, Q-switched Erbium-doped fiber lasers are demonstrated using a homemade passive saturable absorber (SA) based on singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene oxide films. For instance, {{with the use of}} a SWCNTs-Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) SA, the laser has a multi-wavelength output at 1533. 5 nm region with a repetition rate of 13. 1 kHz, pulse width of 7. 2 IlS and pulse energy of 21 nJ at the pump power of 64 mW. Two mode-locked EDFLs are also demonstrated using a homemade SA based on SWCNTs. For instance, a stable mode-locked EDFL is demonstrated using SWCNTs-PVA SA to generate a dissipative soliton pulse train operating in 1533. 6 nm region. At pump power above the threshold value of 35. 2 mW, the EDFL generates a self-starting pulse train with duration of 1. 8 ps and repetition rate of 15. 3 MHz. Besides showing good Qswitching and mode-locking performances, the proposed new saturable absorbers are easy to fabricate and cheap. Finally, we explore a new technique based on nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) to demonstrate both Q-switched and modelocked fiber lasers. For instance, a stable passive Q-switched EDFL operating at 1534. 5 nm region is demonstrated by employing a polarization dependent isolator and a highly nonlinear Erbium-doped fiber (EDF) to induce intensity dependent loss in a sufficiently-high lossy ring cavity. A simple NPR based EDFL with three switchable operation states have also been successfully demonstrated by employing a 6. 9 km long dispersion shifted fiber (DSF) in the ring cavity. It firstly generates a square dissipative soliton pulse with a repetition rate of 87 kHz. Then, the laser produces a fundamental repetition rate of 29 kHz with a fixed pulse width of 8. 5 JlS with the maximum pulse energy of 131. 5 nJ is achieved at the pump power of 116. 7 mW. Finally, the EDFL produces a fixed pulse width of 2. 8 IJ,S and harmonic pulse repetition rate of 58 kHz. Q-switched and mode-locked EDFLs have wide and important applications in many fields such as optical communications, laser micromachining, optical sensors and laser ablation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Vibration {{caused by}} mass {{imbalance}} in rotating machinery {{is an important}} engineering problem. The objective of balancing is to reduce rotor vibration to a practical minimum. Reducing rotor vibrations generally increases the service life of the rotating machinery.

Due to the unbalance in the impeller, vibration occurs and leads to decrease in fluid velocity and local pressure which may cause an undesirable turbulence and possible cavitation. Hence, to remove the unbalance in rotor is necessary. In this paper the focus is given on dynamic balancing of centrifugal pump impeller.

The third case study, a 10 kW axial flux motor, is used to demonstrate {{the flexibility of the}} design methods. A variety of ways to predict the motor constant, which relates torque to current and speed to voltage, are presented. The predictions range from first-order DC estimates to full dynamic simulations, yielding increasingly accurate results. Ways to predict winding resistance, as well as other sources of loss in motors, are discussed {{in the context of the}} motor's overall power rating. Rapid prototyping methods for brushless motors prove to be useful in the fabrication of the case study motors. Simple no-load evaluation techniques confirm the predicted motor constants without large, expensive test equipment. Methods for brushless motor controller design and prototyping are also presented. The case study, a two channel, 1 kW per channel brushless motor controller, is fully developed and used to illustrate these methods. The electrical requirements of the controller (voltage, current, frequency) influence the selection of components, such as power transistors and bus capacitors. Mechanical requirements, such as overall dimensions, heat transfer, and <b>vibration</b> <b>tolerance,</b> also play a large role in the design. With full-system prototyping in mind, the controller integrates wireless data acquisition for debugging. Field-oriented AC control is implemented on low-cost hardware using a novel modification of the standard synchronous current regulator.

The Rupprecht & Patashnick tapered element oscillating microbalance can accurately measure both mass flux and mass distribution of particulates {{over a wide}} range of particle sizes and loadings. Individual particles of milligram size down to a few picograms can be resolved and counted, and the accumulation of smaller particles or molecular deposition can be accurately measured using the sensors perfected and toughened under this contract. No other sensor has the dynamic range or sensitivity attained by these picogram direct mass measurement sensors. The purpose of this contract was to develop and implement reliable and repeatable manufacturing methods; build and test prototype sensors; and outline a quality control program. A dust 'thrower' was to be designed and built, and used to verify performance. Characterization and improvement of the optical motion detection system and drive feedback circuitry was to be undertaken, with emphasis on reliability, low noise, and low power consumption. All the goals of the contract were met or exceeded. An automated glass puller was built and used to make repeatable tapered elements. Materials and assembly methods were standardized, and controllers and calibrated fixtures were developed and used in all phases of preparing, coating and assembling the sensors. Quality control and reliability resulted from the use of calibrated manufacturing equipment with measurable working parameters. Thermal and vibration testing of completed prototypes showed low temperature sensitivity and high <b>vibration</b> <b>tolerance.</b> An electrostatic dust thrower was used in vacuum to throw particles from 2 x 10 (exp 6) g to 7 x 10 (exp - 12) g in size.

Laboratory tests for a 50 hp fan retrofit showed electronic VFD savings at 62 %, the MagnaDrive Coupling at 39 % and PAYBACK Drive at 46 %. At $ 0. 06 /kWh and list prices, the simple payback for the VFD is 2. 4 years, the MagnaDrive is 4. 6 years and the PAYBACK is 1. 9 years. MagnaDrive has models from 25 to 500 hp while PAYBACK has models from 3 to 200 hp. Contractors to the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance have helped to install VFDs for about 300 evaporator fans in over two dozen refrigerated warehouses and to install fixed-magnet MC-ASDs in about 50 applications with about half of these controlling wastewater pumps.

Margins are then applied to these values (temperature extremes, <b>vibration</b> extremes, radiation <b>tolerances,</b> etc,) and a new set of conditions is generalized for design requirements.

The recently developed integral squeeze film dampers (ISFDS) offer several advantages over conventional SFDS such as reduced overall weight and length of the damper structure with less number of parts, accuracy of positioning (centering), and a split segment construction allowing easier assembly, inspection, and retrofit than with any other type of damper. The objective of the experimental program is the identification of the damping coefficients of sealed ISFDS from measurements of the imbalance response of a massive rotor supported on two (identical) integral dampers. Experiments are conducted on dampers with end plate seals of known clearance. The amplitudes of synchronous rotor response at the first critical speed, for increasing levels of imbalance, allow the determination of system amplification factors and the Measurements of oil flow rates, impact tests and imbalance response tests demonstrate that end gap seals render a substantial increase in the ISFD viscous damping coefficients and with only a small reduction on the flow through the dampers. The sealed integral dampers genemte viscous damping coefficients larger than two times the test values obtained earlier for open ended dampers. Conventional (cylindrical) sealed SFDS restrict substantially the lubricant through flow and determine minimal increments in the damping coefficients because the lubricant viscosity decreases as the operating film temperature raises. The experiments further demonstrate that the amplitudes of rotor synchronous response at the first and second critical speeds are proportional to the imbalance displacements. No subsynchronous frequencies or (nonlinear) jump phenomenon are ever observed in any of the tests. FEM predictions of the viscous damping coefficients for the end sealed ISFDS agree favorably with the identified damping coefficients when accounting for the effect of air entrainment in the squeeze film. The experimental verification and theoretical validation of the damping capability of sealed ISFDS demonstrates the benefit of this novel technology of application in high performance turbomachinery...|$|R
