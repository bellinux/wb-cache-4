25|$|Writers have {{described}} Mommsen's history as transformative of prior works on ancient Rome. He employed new sources, e.g., ancient inscriptions, {{in order to}} gain new insights.

The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is [...] high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There {{is a group of}} figures {{at each end of the}} front wall, next to the base of the steps. The Breaking of the Sword is located at the southern corner of the front wall while Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are The Defenders and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In Breaking of the Sword, three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless, one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vantage</b> <b>Point</b> is a 2008 American thriller film {{directed}} by Pete Travis; it {{was adapted from}} a screenplay written by Barry L. Levy. The story focuses on an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, {{as seen from the}} various <b>vantage</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> different characters. Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver star in principal roles. The film is often compared, unfavorably, to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, which also employed storytelling through multiple perspectives. Rashomon used the multiple perspectives to question the possibility of truth, in a process called the Rashomon effect; in contrast, <b>Vantage</b> <b>Point</b> recounts a series of events which are re-enacted from several different perspectives and viewpoints in order to reveal a truthful account <b>of</b> what happened. <b>Vantage</b> <b>Point</b> also explores kidnapping, assassination and terrorism.|$|R

[...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.
