40|$|Internal {{standing}} waves (seiches) in the South Aral Sea are studied {{for the first}} time. The study, based on numerical simulations and field data, focuses on two different campaigns: the first in autumn 2006, when the stratification was weak {{and there was a}} mild prevailing northeasterly wind, and the second in autumn 2013, when the stratification was strong and there was a mild easterly wind. Between these two campaigns, the sea surface level decreased by 3. 2  m. The periods of the fundamental modes were identified as 36 and 14  h, respectively. In both years, either second or third <b>vertical</b> <b>modes</b> were found. In general, the <b>vertical</b> <b>modes</b> in 2013 were higher because of the broad and strong pycnocline. For both years, {{it was found that the}} deep quasi-homogeneous mixed upper layer could sustain internal waves under mild wind conditions. The observed first and second <b>vertical</b> <b>modes</b> in 2006 are the first and second horizontal modes and the second and third <b>vertical</b> <b>modes</b> in 2013 are the second and third horizontal modes. The results suggest that, due to sea level variations, the neck connecting the Chernyshev Bay to the main body of the lake can become a critical location for the development of a nodal line for all principal oscillation modes.

EDJs are nevertheless found in nonlinear primitive equation models with idealised box geometry. Here we analyse several such model runs. We note that the variability of the zonal velocity in the model is dominated by the gravest linear equatorial basin mode {{for a wide range of}} baroclinic <b>vertical</b> normal <b>modes</b> and that the EDJs in the model are dominated by energy contained in <b>vertical</b> <b>modes</b> between 10 and 20. The emergence of the EDJs is shown to involve the linear superposition of several such neighbouring basin modes. Furthermore, the phase of these basin modes is set at the start of the model run and, in the case of the reference experiment, the same basin modes can be found in a companion experiment in which the amplitude of the forcing has been reduced by a factor of 1000. We also argue that following the spin-up, energy must be transferred between different <b>vertical</b> <b>modes.</b> This is because the model simulations are dominated by downward phase propagation following the spin-up whereas our reconstructions imply episodes of upward and downward propagation. The transfer of energy between the <b>vertical</b> <b>modes</b> is associated with a decadal modulation of the EDJs...|$|R

It is confirmed that Kelvin waves primarily advect particles near the basin perimeter in a cyclonic direction, and Poincaré waves primarily advect particles in off-shore (radial) directions {{in a manner that}} is oscillatory in time with frequencies near the inertial period. The internal current associated with the second <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> is usually far smaller than that associated with the energetically dominant, lowest <b>vertical</b> <b>mode.</b> However, because of the disparately slow eigenspeed of the vertical mode-two Kelvin wave, the resultant particle transport associated with the vertical mode-two flow near the basin perimeter can drive transport that is comparable with that associated with the Kelvin wave of the lowest <b>vertical</b> <b>mode.</b> It is discovered that nonlinear interaction between the Kelvin-Poincaré wave pair can give birth to a solitary-like wave of large amplitude in an off-shore region.

40|$|Observations are {{presented}} from Lake Biwa and Lake Kinneret showing the ubiquitous and often periodic nature of high-frequency internal waves in large stratified lakes. In both lakes, high-frequency wave events were observed within two distinct categories: (1) <b>Vertical</b> <b>mode</b> 1 solitary waves near a steepened Kelvin wave front and <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> 2 solitary waves {{at the head}} of an intrusive thermocline jet were found to have wavelengths � 64 – 670 m and � 13 – 65 m, respectively, and were observed to excite a spectral energy peak near 10 � 3 Hz. (2) Sinusoidal <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> 1 waves on the crests of Kelvin waves (vertically coherent in both phase and frequency) and bordering the thermocline jets in the high shear region trailing the <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> 2 solitary waves (vertically incoherent in both phase and frequency) were found to have wavelengths between 28 – 37 and 9 – 35 m, respectively, and excited a spectral energy peak just below the local maximum buoyancy frequency near 10 � 2 Hz.

The ratio between SSHA variance and vertically integrated energy of waves is proportional to 1) a dimensionless ratio characterizing the surface intensification of the pressure eigenfunction, 2) the squared internal gravity wave speed, and 3) the inverse of the water depth. Geographic variations in stratification and bathymetry can therefore cause geographically varying SSHA variance even for spatially uniform wave energy. The ratio between SSHA variance and wave energy across the North Atlantic shows important spatial variations based on eigensolutions for the standard <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> determined numerically using climatological hydrography. The surface-intensified mode result is similar, though the ratio is generally slightly larger and less sensitive to depth variations. Results are applied to the propagating annual-frequency portion of TOPEX altimeter SSHA in the North Atlantic.

The strong daily sea breeze was found to generate a <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> 1 internal Kelvin wave and basin-scale internal Poincare ́ waves of vertical modes 1, 2, and 3. The Kelvin wave, the dominant component of the internal wave field, was responsible for alongshore velocities in the nearshore regions. In the upwind nearshore regions, velocities were dominated by the forced response to the wind and were cross-shore in nature. In the lake interior, the Kelvin wave effect on the horizontal velocity field was minor compared to the higher <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> Poincare ́ waves. The Kelvin wave is shown to exist in resonant and nonforced states with the wind, whereas the <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> 1 Poincare ́ wave energy remained relatively constant, despite large variability in the forcing condi-tions.

40|$|An {{impedance}} eduction {{theory for}} a rigid wall duct containing an acoustic liner with an unknown impedance and uniform grazing flow is presented. The unique {{features of the}} theory are: 1) non-planar waves propagate in the hard wall sections of the duct, 2) input data consist solely of complex acoustic pressures acquired on a wall adjacent to the liner, and 3) multiple higher-order modes may exist in the direction perpendicular to the liner and the opposite rigid wall. The approach is to first measure the axial propagation constant of a dominant higher-order mode in the liner sample section. This axial propagation constant is then {{used in conjunction with}} a closed-form solution to a reduced form of the convected Helmholtz equation and the wall impedance boundary condition to educe the liner impedance. The theory is validated on a conventional liner whose impedance spectrum is educed in two flow ducts with different cross sections.

A benchmark method is used to educe the impedance spectrum in this duct. A dominant higher-order <b>vertical</b> <b>mode</b> propagates in the larger duct for similar test conditions, and the current theory is applied to educe the impedance spectrum.
