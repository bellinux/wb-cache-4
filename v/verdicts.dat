5|$|Five {{defendants}} were then indicted for stealing £50 {{from the house}} of Robert Edwards in Ely. Mr Gurney addressed the jury at length describing the events occurring {{in the town of}} Ely {{on the morning of the}} 23 May 1816. Eight witnesses were called. The jury returned guilty <b>verdicts</b> against Dennis, Jefferson, and Rutter. Hopkin and Cammell were given not guilty <b>verdicts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1790 and 1797, only 143 or 147 {{criminal}} cases {{were brought in}} the circuit courts, and 56 of those cases were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning the Whiskey Rebellion. And, between 1790 and 1801, only 426 {{criminal cases}} were brought in all federal courts (the district courts and the circuit courts combined). Between 1801 and 1828, a total of 2,718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts: 596 resulted in guilty <b>verdicts</b> by juries; 479, not guilty <b>verdicts</b> by juries; 902, nolle prosequi; and 741, other (either no disposition recorded, abated, quashed, discharged, discontinued, or prison break).|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and <b>verdicts,</b> and which attitudes correlate to favorable <b>verdicts.</b> Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
50|$|DVD <b>Verdict</b> {{also had}} four sister sites, titled Cinema <b>Verdict,</b> a {{theatrical}} movie review site, TV <b>Verdict,</b> a television review site, Pixel <b>Verdict,</b> {{a video game}} review site and DVD <b>Verdict</b> Presents.|$|R
50|$|Reversal of a jury's <b>verdict</b> {{by a judge}} {{occurs when}} the judge {{believes}} that there were insufficient facts {{on which to base}} the jury's <b>verdict,</b> or that the <b>verdict</b> did not correctly apply the law. This procedure is similar to a situation in which a judge orders a jury to arrive at a particular <b>verdict,</b> called a directed <b>verdict.</b> A judgment notwithstanding the <b>verdict</b> is occasionally made when a jury refuses to follow a judge's instruction to arrive at a certain <b>verdict.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... $5.7 million <b>verdict</b> {{on behalf}} of an injured {{journeyman}} carpenter who suffered stage III CRPS-II (causalgia) after a drill bit punctured his hand, wrapping the ulnar nerve. The Illinois Jury <b>Verdict</b> Reporter confirmed the <b>verdict</b> as the largest non-amputation hand injury <b>verdict</b> in Illinois, beating the previous record of $4.2 million.|$|R
5|$|Keable's {{distinction}} between the historical and the traditional Jesus, Wilson argued, was ultimately muddled and internally inconsistent, his <b>verdicts</b> on the illiberality of the contemporary church at odds with his own abiding conviction.|$|E
5|$|That day {{the jury}} {{returned}} <b>verdicts</b> of not guilty on all charges. Some of the prominent strikers were also arrested, but none {{was sentenced to}} punishment.|$|E
5|$|The jury in Hayes' {{case was}} {{composed}} of seven women and five men. Following {{the completion of the}} trial, the jury deliberated for about four hours to reach its guilty <b>verdicts.</b>|$|E

The Illinois Jury <b>Verdict</b> Reporter confirmed the <b>verdict</b> as the largest CRPS injury <b>verdict</b> in Illinois.|$|R
5000|$|In a jury trial, a {{directed}} <b>verdict</b> is {{an order}} from the presiding judge to the jury to return a particular <b>verdict.</b> Typically, the judge orders a directed <b>verdict</b> after finding that no reasonable jury could reach a decision to the contrary. After a directed <b>verdict,</b> {{there is no longer}} any need for the jury to decide the case.|$|R
50|$|Everyone {{involved}} with the case (public prosecutor, lawyers, and the accused) appealed the <b>verdict,</b> and the case went before the Supreme Court again between 27 March and 31 March 2006. The Supreme Court's 5-judge council had three options {{in regards to the}} district court verdict: upholding the <b>verdict,</b> modifying the <b>verdict,</b> or ordering a partial/full re-trial by partially/fully annulling the <b>verdict.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 25 May 2007, after deliberating for two hours, {{the jury}} {{returned}} guilty <b>verdicts</b> against both brother and sister. Mme M'Barek {{and her brother}} were each sentenced to 25 years in prison. Under French law, they each have an automatic right to appeal their conviction, which results in a retrial of the case.|$|E
5|$|Sukumaran {{remained}} mostly silent {{throughout the}} proceedings and blamed amnesia for his poor recollections of events leading to his arrest. Trials {{were scheduled to}} be completed with <b>verdicts</b> announced before 23 February 2006, before a legal deadline for the group's detention expired.|$|E
5|$|Another {{simplified}} experiment {{indicated that}} lawyers trained {{in a systematic}} selection method made better predictions of juror <b>verdicts</b> in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive relationships were weak or nonexistent.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the jury}} will be {{directed}} {{to try to reach}} a unanimous <b>verdict.</b> If they fail to reach a unanimous <b>verdict,</b> the judge may later (after not less than two hours) give directions that a majority <b>verdict</b> will be acceptable, but still no less than ten to two, although the jury should continue to try to reach a unanimous <b>verdict</b> if possible.|$|R
50|$|The first inquest jury in 2002 {{returned}} an open <b>verdict.</b> Stanley's family were unhappy with this outcome, particularly as the coroner, Dr. Stephen Chan, had only allowed {{the jury to}} return either a <b>verdict</b> of lawful killing or an open <b>verdict.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... $2.84 million <b>verdict</b> {{on behalf}} of a painter who {{severely}} injured his heel after falling from a lift at a school construction site. The <b>verdict</b> was the largest <b>verdict</b> ever recorded for a personal injury case in Jo Daviess County, Illinois.|$|R
5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a complex}} {{judicial}} organisation, {{as a consequence}} of its status of county capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of Dej, Gherla, Turda and Huedin. Appeals from these tribunals' <b>verdicts,</b> and more serious cases, are directed to the Cluj Court of Appeals. The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals.|$|E

Four witnesses called were Elizabeth Carter following which Mr Justice Burrough summed up. Lavender was pronounced guilty of the theft and Beamiss and Butcher received not guilty <b>verdicts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Balcer and Wolf {{conceived}} Law & Order: Criminal Intent as {{a police}} procedural crime drama that follows a distinct division of the New York City Police Department: the 'Major Case Squad', and its investigations in to high-profile murder cases, such as those involving VIPs, local government officials and employees, and people working in the financial industry and the arts and entertainment world. Unlike the other series in the Law & Order franchise, Law & Order: Criminal Intent gives significant attention to the actions and motives of the criminals, rather than primarily focusing on the police investigation and trial prosecution. Episodes do not contain trials, and end in confessions rather than plea bargains or <b>verdicts.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... $8 million <b>verdict</b> {{on behalf}} of an injured {{journeyman}} ironworker who suffered from a serious shoulder injury after a barge collided with his safety skiff attached to a construction work-flat.

50|$|The second inquest in April 1993 {{resulted}} in a <b>verdict</b> of unlawful killing but on appeal by the police this <b>verdict</b> was quashed by the High Court and a third inquest in October 1994 returned a <b>verdict</b> of “misadventure contributed to by neglect”.|$|R
5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached <b>verdicts</b> {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E
5|$|His {{business}} interests having collapsed, Baker abandoned his farm and relocated from New South Wales {{to the southern}} settlement of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land. In 1814 he is recorded as holding the office of government storekeeper in Hobart. A year later, at an approximate age of 54, he accepted a job as town crier for the newly created Deputy Judge Advocate's Court, calling witnesses and announcing <b>verdicts</b> on the roadside outside the courthouse. Any remaining business links with New South Wales were severed in 1819 with the sale of Baker's former farm to a colleague, Samuel Terry, who had recently visited him in Hobart. His wife, Elizabeth Baker, died in April 1824 and was buried in Hobart Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their <b>verdicts.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of arbitrary <b>verdict</b> {{has to put}} by good intention from both sides who have chosen to resolutetheir dispute outside the court. It is weird if both sides who chose resolute their dispute to the arbitraryinstitution end up complaining about the institution authority. In other words recognition and effectivity ofarbitrary <b>verdict</b> is relied on both sides who chose arbitrary institution. The contradiction between courtverdict and arbitrary <b>verdict</b> rises a new question about legality of court <b>verdict</b> put by judges, meanwhile thecontract has arbitrary clause which accepted by both sides. The goal and focus {{of this research is}} rely on howlegality of arbitrary <b>verdict</b> if in the contract has arbitrary clause to resolute dispute or different opinionbetween them. Achievement indicator of this research is explanation based law regulation if there is arbitraryclause and effect of the <b>verdict</b> if court and arbitrary institution put <b>verdict</b> to the same case...|$|R
50|$|Prosecutors may appeal when a {{trial judge}} sets aside a jury <b>verdict</b> for {{conviction}} with a judgment notwithstanding <b>verdict</b> for the defendant. A successful appeal {{by the prosecution}} would simply reinstate the jury <b>verdict</b> and so would not place the defendant at risk of another trial.|$|R
25|$|Before the <b>verdict,</b> President Bill Clinton {{was briefed}} on {{security}} measures if rioting occurred nationwide {{due to the}} <b>verdict.</b> An estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the <b>verdict</b> announcement. Long-distance telephone call volume declined by 58%, and trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange decreased by 41%. Water usage decreased as people avoided using bathrooms. So much work stopped that the <b>verdict</b> cost an estimated $480million in lost productivity.|$|R
5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror <b>verdicts</b> may not hold true across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
5|$|The illness {{emphasised}} certain {{traits in}} his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind {{faith in his}} closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His <b>verdicts,</b> not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} with Croatian victory, as it {{achieved}} the goals it had declared {{at the beginning}} of the war: independence and preservation of its borders. Approximately 21–25% of Croatia's economy was ruined, with an estimated US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost output, and refugee-related costs. A total of 20,000 people were killed in the war, and refugees were displaced on both sides. The Serb and Croatian governments began to progressively cooperate with each other but tension remains, in part due to <b>verdicts</b> by the ICTY and lawsuits filed by each country against the other.|$|E
