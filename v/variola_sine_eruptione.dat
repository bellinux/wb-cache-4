Variola minor was a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1 percent or less. Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called <b>variola</b> <b>sine</b> <b>eruptione</b> (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E

However, in fear of bioterrorism, the clinical manifestations that may be forgotten by emergency physicians have to be readdressed. Variola virus usually existed as two related strains: variola major with a mortality of 20 to 50 %, and variola minor with a mortality of less than 1 %. World Health Organization classification comprised another 3 additional types, that is, flat type, hemorrhagic type, and <b>variola</b> <b>sine</b> <b>eruptione.</b> The disease is highly contagious and spread by air droplets and direct contact with contaminants. Emergency reporting and pre-exposure vaccination {{are the most important}} steps in preventing epidemic, either from bioterrorism and the nature.
