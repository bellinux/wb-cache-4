40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, it is {{becoming}} an increasingly common requirement for ships to shut down ship generators and connect to high voltage shore power {{for as long as}} practicable while in port.

50|$|As the {{inrush current}} limiter self-heats, the current {{begins to flow}} through it and warm it. Its {{resistance}} begins to drop and a relatively small current flow charges the input capacitors. After the capacitors in the power supply become charged, the self heated inrush current limiter offers little resistance in the circuit, with a low voltage drop {{with respect to the}} total <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circuit. A disadvantage is that immediately after the device is switched off, the NTC resistor is still hot and has a low resistance. It cannot limit the inrush current unless it cools for more than 1 minute to get a higher resistance. Another disadvantage is that the NTC thermistor is not short circuit proof.|$|E
50|$|Initially, all {{switches}} {{are closed}} (on). Because the high-voltage semiconductor switch has much greater resistance than the mechanical switch plus the low-voltage semiconductor switch, current flow through it is low. To disconnect, first the low-voltage semiconductor switch opens. This diverts the current through the high-voltage semiconductor switch. Because of its relatively high resistance, it begins heating very rapidly. Then the high-speed mechanical switch is opened. Unlike the low-voltage semiconductor switch, which {{is capable of}} standing off only the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closed high-voltage semiconductor switch, this one is capable of standing off the full voltage. Because no current is flowing through this switch when it opens, it is not damaged by arcing. Then, the high-voltage semiconductor switch is opened. This actually cuts the power. However, it is not quite 100% off. A final low-speed mechanical switch disconnects the residual current.|$|E
5000|$|A {{flyback diode}} solves this starvation-arc problem by {{allowing}} the inductor to draw current from itself (thus, [...] "flyback") in a continuous loop until the energy is dissipated through losses in the wire, the diode and the resistor (Figure 3). When the switch is closed the diode is reverse-biased against the power supply and doesn't exist in the circuit for practical purposes. However, when the switch is opened, the diode becomes forward-biased relative to the inductor (instead of the power supply as before), allowing it to conduct current in a circular loop from the positive potential {{at the bottom of}} the inductor to the negative potential at the top (assuming the power supply was supplying positive voltage at the top of the inductor prior to the switch being opened). The voltage across the inductor will merely be a function of the forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flyback diode.

30|$|When a DC side fault occurs, the insulated-gate bipolar {{transistors}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inverter will be blocked under self-protection.
