40|$|My bachelor’s {{thesis is}} about bulk-driven CMOS {{principle}} for several analog circuit projects. A substrate gate {{is used for}} signal input to achieve low supply <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> low <b>wattage</b> while keeping parameters adequate to current structures. The goal of my work was to design current mirror with low supply <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> low <b>wattage</b> with usage of this principle. In my work there are basic data about bulk-driven technology and MOFSET transistors used in this technology. My project contains different kinds of schemes of bulk-driven current mirrors which are compared with conventional gate-driven current mirror. These circuits are simulated in Orcard Pspise program...|$|R

50|$|Fluorescent lamps {{are used}} for UV curing {{in a number of}} applications. In particular, these are used where the {{excessive}} heat of mercury vapor is undesirable, or when an item needs more than a single source of light and instead the item needs to be surrounded by light, such as musical instruments. Fluorescent lamps can be created that produce ultraviolet anywhere within the UVA/UVB spectrum. Additionally, lamps that have multiple peaks are possible, allowing a wider variety of photoinitiators to be used. While fluorescent lamps are less efficient at producing UV than mercury vapor, newer initiators require less total energy, offsetting this disadvantage.
