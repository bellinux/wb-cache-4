50|$|For the {{increasingly}} uncommon analog television standard, the audio for each TV channel is broadcast {{on a separate}} frequency band near the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> <b>frequency</b> band (refer to article NTSC, Transmission modulation scheme). This audio signal can be heard separate from the video, using standard analog FM radios equipped with the appropriate tuning circuits.|$|R
5000|$|The signal modulates {{a carrier}} by {{amplitude}} modulation, where {{an increase in}} the video modulating signal produces a decrease in the carrier amplitude, called [...] "negative modulation". When there is no modulating signal, the carrier has the full level and when there is a modulating <b>video</b> <b>frequency</b> (VF) <b>signal</b> the level of IF is lower. Since the level when transmitting a black scene is lower than the white level, the level of carrier when transmitting black is higher than the level of carrier when transmitting white. The modulators are set to yield 10% or 12.5% of carrier level when modulated by 1 V signal (which corresponds to white scene) This percentage is known as residual carrier.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to dynamic transmission bandwidth allocation for transport of real-time variable-bit-rate video in ATM networks. Describe video traffic in the frequency domain: the low <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> captures the slow time-variation of consecutive scene changes; the high <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> exhibits the feature of strong frame autocorrelation. Our study indicates that the video transmission bandwidth in a finite-buffer system is essentially characterized by the low <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b> Since the time scale of scene changes is usually {{in the range of}} a second or longer, the low <b>frequency</b> <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> is defined in a well-founded low frequency band. Hence, it is feasible to implement dynamic allocation of video transmission bandwidth using on-line observation and prediction of scene changes.

40|$|Simulated raw radar signals {{prove to}} be very useful at the first stages of testing radar signal {{processing}} algorithms and procedures. This is particularly true for synthetic aperture radar (SAR), where the costs of real signals acquisition are very high due to the costs of building the system {{as well as the}} costs of mission (air or space-borne). This paper describes a multifunctional SAR raw signal simulator that has been used for the verification of SAR image synthesis algorithms. Generated signals can be imitated for pulsed as well as FM-CW radars both in SLAR and squinted cases, it is also possible to choose between <b>video</b> and intermediate <b>frequency</b> <b>signals.</b> The simulator allows us to generate echo signals from stationary and moving targets. The user is able to differentiate the statistic properties of received echo signals for each target, thus allowing us to generate different types of reflecting surfaces. If present, a real raw SAR signal can be merged with a simulated one to produce more complicated scenarios. The paper presents results of the simulation of raw signals and their image after SAR processing...|$|R
50|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} {{works by}} varying the amplitude of the carrier wave {{according to the}} bent waveform of original video signal. In other words, when the carrier wave is combined with the <b>video</b> <b>signal,</b> <b>frequency</b> of the combined signal {{is the same as}} the frequency of the carrier wave while the amplitude is varied. The picture above can more directly explain how the shape is changed. In the combining process, if the video signal is at its peak (highest amplitude value), the amplitude of the varied carrier wave will be the highest and as for trough (lowest amplitude value), the amplitude of varied carrier wave will be the lowest. In other words, at the point in carrier wave that corresponds to the peak of video signal, the shape of wave will be most bulged and at the point corresponding to the trough, the shape will be most sunk. In fact, the change in amplitude of carrier wave is proportional to the amplitude of the video signal.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary data {{is often}} {{supported}} by an irregular structure, {{which can be}} conveniently captured by a graph. Accounting for this graph support is crucial to analyze the data, leading to an area known as graph signal processing (GSP). The two most important tools in GSP are the graph shift operator (GSO), which is a sparse matrix accounting for the topology of the graph, and the graph Fourier transform (GFT), which maps graph <b>signals</b> into a <b>frequency</b> domain spanned {{by a number of}} graph-related Fourier-like basis vectors. This alternative representation of a graph signal is denominated the graph <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b> Several attempts have been undertaken in order to interpret the support of this graph <b>frequency</b> <b>signal,</b> but they all resulted in a one-dimensional interpretation. However, if the support of the original signal is captured by a graph, why would the graph <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> have a simple one-dimensional support? That is why, for the first time, we propose an irregular support for the graph <b>frequency</b> <b>signal,</b> which we coin the dual graph. The dual GSO leads to a better interpretation of the graph <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> and its domain, helps to understand how the different graph frequencies are related and clustered, enables the development of better graph filters and filter banks, and facilitates the generalization of classical SP results to the graph domain.
