500|$|Sportswriters {{and fans}} have {{frequently}} called for Henderson to be {{inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame on the strength of his performance. [...] Commentator and former NHL coach Don Cherry argued that Henderson's status as hero of the [...] "greatest series in hockey history" [...] was enough to qualify him. [...] Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: [...] "So many Canadians get upset that I’m not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell them all the time if I was on the committee, I wouldn’t <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Quite frankly, I didn’t have a Hall of Fame career." [...] Henderson has been honoured by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Henderson has been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the IIHF Hall of Fame (2013) and has been honoured by Hockey Canada with the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in December 2012 in recognition of [...] "his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes" [...] along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Ontario.|$|E
2500|$|... "I ask the electors to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and the non-electors to {{work for}} me because women are wanted on the Board and there are too few women candidates." [...] Besant came out on top of the poll in Tower Hamlets, with over 15,000 votes. She wrote in the National Reformer: [...] "Ten years ago, under a cruel law, Christian bigotry robbed me of my little child. Now the care of the 763,680 {{children}} of London is placed partly in my hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT [puzzled]. Of course. [Pause]. Quite so. [Pause]. Er--yes. [Buoyant again] I {{think they}} will <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Eh? Yes? ...|$|E
5000|$|When I {{took one}} look at that ballot on Election Night... it's very easy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to see how someone could have <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the belief they <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Al Gore.|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg to {{withdraw}} my {{name from the}} list of candidates," [...] cried Paul Singleton. [...] "All who <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> will kindly <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Bart Conners, who is my choice." ...|$|R
60|$|You couldn't {{make that}} boy angry. We held a meeting {{just as we}} got to the hotel, and he and Corny both <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The day he {{was elected}} Mayor I KNOW that every Sprite meant To <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>ME,</b> but did not dare - He was so frantic with despair And furious with excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "But we Middlemarchers {{are not so}} tame as {{you take}} us to be. We have our intrigues and our parties. I am a party man, for example, and Bulstrode is another. If you <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> you will offend Bulstrode." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{delegation}} from New Hampshire, {{with all}} the glow of state pride, and {{with all the}} warmth of personal regard, would not have submitted my name to the convention, nor would they have cast a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> under circumstances other than those which occurred.|$|E
6000|$|... "Birmingham," [...] he said, {{referring}} to a Schedule under consideration, [...] "is to be cut into three constituencies of four members each. I am to have a constituency of 100,000 electors, I suppose. How many thousand inhabitants I do not know. Every effort {{will be made to}} prevent any of those electors knowing--in fact, it would be impossible for any of them to know--whether they <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> or not, or at any rate whether they effectively <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> or not, or whether the vote which they wished to give to me was really diverted to somebody else." ...|$|R
5000|$|On The Today Show of November 9, 2000, Buchanan said, [...] "When I {{took one}} look at that ballot on Election Night ... it's very easy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to see how someone could have <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the belief they <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Al Gore." [...] He, unlike the voters, did not have the {{opportunity}} to see the ballot before Election Day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fellow students!" [...] he cried. [...] "One word {{before you}} vote. I wish to {{withdraw}} from the contest, doing so in favor of two of my friends, Dick Rover and George Granbury. I thank those who <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> before {{from the bottom of my}} heart." ...|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT [hugely self-satisfied]. I think I've {{done the}} trick this time. I just {{gave them a}} bit of {{straight}} talk; and it went home. They were greatly impressed: everyone of those men believes in me and will <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> when the question of selecting a candidate comes up. After all, whatever you say, Larry, they like an Englishman. They feel they can trust him, I suppose.|$|E
6000|$|I {{gave the}} porter who took my bag a shilling. Practically {{it was my}} last, but that lawyer's face and manner seemed to justify the {{expenditure}} which--so oddly are our minds constituted--I remember reflecting I might regret if I had drawn a false inference. The man touched his hat profusely, and, I hope, {{made up his mind}} to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> next time. Then I turned to the Head of the Firm and said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> my {{noble and}} {{intelligent}} electors, and send our party into power, {{and the world}} shall be a new place, and there shall be no sin or sorrow any more! And each free and independent voter shall have a bran new Utopia made on purpose for him, according to his own ideas, with a good-sized, extra-unpleasant purgatory attached, to which he can send everybody he does not like. Oh! do not miss this chance!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Byles was, in 2011, {{rated the}} best looking male MP in the House of Commons; {{he was quoted}} saying [...] "It’s {{flattering}} and a little embarrassing … Thanks to everyone who <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Politics can be so boring sometimes so I think it’s great to inject a bit of fun into it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2012, Abdou {{was named}} as the club's Player of the Year for the 2011-12 season after a vote by Millwall's supporters. [...] "I {{would like to}} thank all the fans who <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> and my team mates as well because this is a team game," [...] he said after hearing of the award.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 Toronto {{municipal}} election {{was held on}} October 25. Augimeri won by an 89-vote margin(0.7%) over local businessman Gus Cusimano. Augimeri thanked her supporters the following day on October 26, 2010 when she said, [...] "I {{know a lot of}} the community <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because they know I'm the one to protect community interests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fellow cadets," [...] began Jack, in a clear, steady voice. [...] "All I wish {{to say is}} this: As major of the Putnam Hall Battalion I {{have enjoyed}} myself very much, and I trust my successor, whoever he may be, will have as good a time. I {{understand}} that some of you want to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> again. Let me say that I am not a candidate, and will not accept the office even if elected. I expect to leave this institution next June, {{and in the meantime}} hope to devote my time mostly to my studies. I thank you for your attention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know much}} about his madness. I shouldn't wonder {{if he had been}} sent by the Archbishop of Westminster. Why don't we have an Archbishop of Westminster when they've got one? I shall have to see to that when I'm in the House. I suppose there is a bishop, isn't there, Alfred?' Alfred shook his head. 'There's a Dean, I know, for I called on him. He told me flat he wouldn't <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I thought all those parsons were Conservatives. It didn't occur to me that the fellow had come from the Archbishop, or I would have been more civil to him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Bradley {{hesitated a}} little. [...] "No, we can't do that, {{but we can}} destroy any special {{privilege}} they hold. But {{the first thing that}} stares us in the face is the war tariff that is eating us up. I'm going to state just what I think in this campaign, and you can <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> or not. It is sheer robbery to continue a tariff that was laid {{at a time when we}} needed enormous revenue. See the surplus piling up in the public vault. You say it's better to have a surplus than a deficit. Yes, but I'd rather have the surplus in the pockets of the people. This taxing the people to death, in order to have a surplus to expend in senseless appropriations, is poor policy." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a {{telephone}} interview on the weekend, Chief Gadwa told The Journal being elected chief [...] "doesn't change me. I don't feel any more special or mightier than any other persons on the reserve. I feel I'll be more humble. The people <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I will continue to speak for them." [...] Sadly Theresa Gadwa died on November 27, 2015. She was 95 years old.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 November, Frankie Cocozza was {{ejected from}} the competition. He {{released}} a statement saying [...] "I'd like to apologise to Gary, my fellow contestants and everyone who has <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> but, as of today, I {{will no longer be}} in The X Factor. My life during the show has gone out of control and my behaviour off stage has overstepped the rules of the competition." ...|$|R

6000|$|But I have {{to hurry}} on, for I have but a half hour. The Judge has {{informed}} me, or informed this audience, that the Washington Union is laboring for my {{election to the}} United States Senate. This is news to me,--not very ungrateful news either. [Turning to Mr. W. H. Carlin, {{who was on the}} stand]--I hope that Carlin will be elected to the State Senate, and will <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> [Mr. Carlin shook his head.] Carlin don't fall in, I perceive, and I suppose he will not do much for me; but I am glad of all the support I can get, anywhere, if I can get it without practicing any deception to obtain it. In respect to this large portion of Judge Douglas's speech in which he tries to show that in the controversy between himself and the Administration party he is in the right, I do not feel myself at all competent or inclined to answer him. I say to him, [...] "Give it to them,--give it to them just all you can!" [...] and, on the other hand, I say to Carlin, and Jake Davis, and to this man Wogley up here in Hancock, [...] "Give it to Douglas, just pour it into him!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{records of}} a prosperous country life are easily and briefly told. The steward's books show what rents were paid and forgiven, what crops were raised, {{and in what}} rotation. What {{visitors}} came to us, and how long they stayed: what pensioners my wife had, {{and how they were}} doctored and relieved, and how they died: what year I was sheriff, and how often the hounds met near us; all these are narrated in our house journals, which any of my heirs may read who choose to take the trouble. We could not afford the fine mansion in Hill Street, which my predecessor had occupied; but we took a smaller house, in which, however, we spent more money. We made not half the show (with liveries, equipages, and plate) for which my uncle had been famous; but our beer was stronger, and my wife's charities were perhaps more costly than those of the Dowager Lady Warrington. No doubt she thought there was no harm in spoiling the Philistines; for she made us pay unconscionably for the goods she left behind her in our country-house, and I submitted to most of her extortions with unutterable good-humour. What a value she imagined the potted plants in her greenhouses bore! What a price she set upon that horrible old spinet she left in her drawing-room! and the framed pieces of worsted-work, performed by the accomplished Dora and the lovely Flora, had they been masterpieces of Titian or Vandyck, to be sure my lady dowager could hardly have valued them at a higher price. But though we paid so generously, though we were, I may say without boast, far kinder to our poor than ever she had been, for a while we had the very worst reputation in the county, where all sorts of stories had been told to my discredit. I thought I might perhaps succeed to my uncle's seat in Parliament, as well as to his landed property; but I found, I knew not how, that I was voted to be a person of very dangerous opinions. I would not bribe: I would not coerce my own tenants to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the election of '68. A gentleman came down from Whitehall with a pocket-book full of bank-notes; and I found that I had no chance against my competitor.|$|E

This probably did happen, though to what extent no one can be sure. It also hurt the presidential campaign of my friend, Governor Alf M. Landon of Kansas. This reinforced my conviction that it was absolutely necessary for the rights of the minority party to be protected in elections through the appointment of precinct judges and clerks.|$|R
5000|$|Cameron {{was elected}} to Antrim Borough Council in 2005 and was elected as the Council's first woman Mayor in 2010.
