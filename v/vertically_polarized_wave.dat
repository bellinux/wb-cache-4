So, the <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> is not suitable for snow depth sensing via GPS-IR. In contrast, the phase of the reflection coefficient for the horizontal polarization is constant over the full elevation angle range. Also, the reflected power is relatively large compared to the vertical polarization, especially at low grazing angles. From the above analysis, the desired antenna for snow sensing via GPS-IR should be horizontally polarized.|$|E

The procedure consists of propagating a <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> over the earth and measuring the field strength attenuation. A brief summary of present methods of measuring soil moisture is given. Certain aspects of radio wave propagation theory are discussed, covering such topics as the surface wave, the space wave, the skin depth, and the effect of the dielectric constant on radio wave propagation. Based on this theory, measurement parameters such as frequency, antenna separation, and antenna height were chosen for optimum performance. Using these parameters and information gained from preliminary measurements, the instrumentation was designed and is given in detail. Measurement variables such as antenna height, reflections, temperature, and vegetation were investigated with the use of experimental data. The width of the area affecting the propagating wave was also looked at experimentally. A relationship between soil moisture and signal strength is presented from measurements taken for various values of soil moisture content...|$|E

40|$|A {{new way of}} {{visualizing}} the Sommerfeld {{theory of}} propagation over a flat, imperfectly reflecting earth is presented. The Sommerfeld theory arises because the ray theory of propagation from a source {{in the presence of}} a flat, imperfectly reflecting earth is only an approximation.

These waves were generated by regional earthquakes occurring in the North Atlantic to the south of Iceland, and were recorded by the HOTSPOT and ICEMELT arrays and the GSN station BORG, located on Iceland. The phase, group, and amplitude information were measured for narrow-pass filtered waveforms over the period range of - 12 - 100 s.

40|$|Oblique {{incidence}} {{performance of}} a novel two-layer absorb/transmit frequency selective surface (FSS) is investigated. The FSS has good frequency stability for both horizontally and <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> incident normally or at oblique angles. Due to its transmission for 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz mobile bands and good absorption for 5 GHz waves, {{it has the potential}} as a security wall or isolator for 5 GHz WLAN systems. The absorption in the stop band helps reduce additional WLAN multipath fading caused by conventional reflecting FSS designs. The first layer of the FSS consists of conventional conducting cross dipoles having a circular aperture in the centre, while the second layer uses resistive cross dipoles. Moreover, the conducting cross dipoles have been sandwiched between two dielectric sheets to achieve a stable response for different angles of incidence. The periodicity of both FSS layers is the same while the distance between the two layers is reduced to one eighth of the free-space wavelength. This reduction leads to a more compact design compared to the conventional Salisbury screen, while still achieving acceptable absorption in the stopband. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented to confirm the performance of the absorb/transmit FSS. 4 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|A ground dipole {{functions}} as an enormous vertically oriented loop antenna (see drawing, right). It {{consists of two}} widely separated electrodes (G) buried in the ground, connected by overhead transmission cables to a transmitter (P) located between them. The alternating current from the transmitter (I) travels in a loop through one transmission line, kilometers deep into bedrock from one ground electrode to the other, and back through the other transmission line. This creates an alternating magnetic field (H) through the loop, which radiates ELF waves. Due to their low frequency, ELF waves have a large skin depth and can penetrate a significant distance through earth, so it doesn't matter that half the antenna is under the ground. The axis of the magnetic field produced is horizontal, so it generates <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> The radiation pattern of the antenna is directional, a dipole pattern, with two lobes (maxima) in {{the plane of the}} loop, off the ends of the transmission lines.
