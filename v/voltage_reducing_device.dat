In order to compare switching energy Esw {{of the same}} power rating device, a theoretical analysis is given to compare SiC device conduction loss and switching losses change when <b>device</b> maximal blocking <b>voltage</b> <b>reduces</b> by half.

Following by that, in order to <b>reduce</b> <b>device</b> turn-ON switching energy, a zero voltage switching circuit is used to evaluate all the devices. Device output capacitance stored energy Eoss are measured and turn-OFF switching losses are obtained by subtracting Eoss, which shows that GaN-HEMT is sill better than SiC device in terms of switching losses and 1200 V SiC-MOSFET has smaller switching losses than 650 V SiC-MOSFET...|$|R

40|$|Today {{there are}} a large variety of drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> for heavy trucks that are {{commonly}} used, for example roof deflectors, cab side extenders and chassis fairings. These devices are often proven to be efficient, reducing the total aerodynamic resistance for the vehicle. However, the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> are usually identical for a specific pulling vehicle, independent of {{the layout of the}} vehicle combination. In this study, three vehicle combinations were analyzed. The total length of the vehicles varied between 10. 10 m and 25. 25 m. The combinations consisted of a rigid truck in combination with one or two cargo units. The size of the gap between the cargo units differed between the vehicle combinations. There were also three configurations of each vehicle combination with different combinations of roof deflector and cab side extenders, yielding a total number of nine configurations. The aim of this investigation was to determine the aerodynamic effects of the roof deflector and cab side extenders {{as a function of the}} type of vehicle combination. Important factors were the total length of the vehicle combination and the influence of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> further downstream. The investigation was performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results from the investigation showed that the effect of the two drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> analyzed was different depending on the type of vehicle combination. It was established that the roof deflector and cab side extenders were always efficient in reducing drag both in 0 ° yaw and 5 ° yaw but the magnitudes differed between the configurations. The largest effects of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> were seen for the truck including the 1 st cargo unit; the influence of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices</b> on the 2 nd cargo unit was smaller. The aerodynamic reductions were diminishing downstream, why it was concluded that it is of great importance to improve the aerodynamic design of the rest of the vehicle to maintain the positive effects of the drag <b>reducing</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

For this purpose, the relevant quarter and half-wave design of acoustic resonators and/or sound-absorbing groups preformed separate modules, using crushed fragmented sound absorbers. These constructions are arranged at the appropriate spatial zones of air cavities of sound-insulating linings, where sound pressure antinodes of the lowest resonant acoustic eigenmodes are localized.

40|$|International audienceThe work {{presented}} in this paper is part of the QUIESST European project, in which one of the objective is to perform multi-objective holistic optimisations of noise <b>reducing</b> <b>devices.</b> We present here optimisation results concerning the extrinsic performances of noise barriers. The performances under interest are acoustical, economical and environmental. The variety of noise barriers considered is very wide, ranging from straight and flat barriers, to rough or capped barriers. A total number of nine noise <b>reducing</b> <b>device</b> families are optimised. Acoustical performances are obtained from numerical calculations: the Boundary Element Method (in 2 D) is used to obtain relative sound pressure levels at a set of receivers in different situations. Theses situations include road and rail sources; rural and urban cases; flat, embanked and depressed topographies. The economical performance is calculated according to the maintenance cost of the different materials in use in the barrier. Four environmental performances indicators are considered; their calculation is based on a life-cycle assessment analysis. All performances are expressed as a gain (or loss) relative to a reference screen. It is shown that the optimisation procedure allows one to obtain a wide variety of optimised noise <b>reducing</b> <b>devices,</b> and hence provides a helpful design tool by allowing one to focus on specific parameters...|$|R

5000|$|Transmitting {{electricity}} at high <b>voltage</b> <b>reduces</b> {{the fraction}} of energy lost to resistance, which varies depending on the specific conductors, the current flowing, {{and the length of}} the transmission line. For example, a [...] span at 765 kV carrying 1000 MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345 kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%. For a given amount of power, a higher <b>voltage</b> <b>reduces</b> the current and thus the resistive losses in the conductor. For example, raising the voltage by a factor of 10 reduces the current by a corresponding factor of 10 and therefore the [...] losses by a factor of 100, provided the same sized conductors are used in both cases. Even if the conductor size (cross-sectional area) is reduced ten-fold to match the lower current, the [...] losses are still reduced ten-fold. Long-distance transmission is typically done with overhead lines at voltages of 115 to 1,200 kV.
