40|$|During an {{underground}} mine fire, air can be rapidly depleted of oxygen and contaminated with smoke and toxic fire gases. Any delay in warning miners could have disastrous consequences. Unfortunately, present mine fire alarm systems, such as stench, audible or <b>visual</b> alarms, <b>telephones,</b> and messengers, are often slow, unreliable, and limited in mine area coverage. Recent {{research by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines has demonstrated that ultra low frequency electromagnetic signaling {{can be used for}} {{an underground}} mine fire alarm. In field tests of prototype equipment at five mines, electromagnetic signals from 630 to 2, 000 Hz were transmitted through mine rock for distances as great as 1, 645 m to an intrinsically safe receiver. The prototype system uses off-the-shelf components and state-of-the-art technology to insure high reliability and low cost. When utilized, this. technology would enable simultaneous and instantaneous warning of all underground personnel, regardless of their location or work activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of their successfully escaping a mine disaster. This report presents the theoretical basis for through-the-rock ultra low frequency electromagnetic transmission, design of the prototype transmitter and receiver, and the results of in-mine tests of the prototype system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Hearing-impaired people, and {{particularly}} hearing-aid and cochlear-implant users, often have difficulty communicating over the telephone. The intelligibility of telephone speech is considerably {{lower than the}} intelligibility of face-to-face speech. This is partly {{because of lack of}} <b>visual</b> cues, limited <b>telephone</b> bandwidth, and background noise. In addition, cellphones may cause interference with the hearing aid or cochlear implant. To address these problems that hearing-impaired people experience with telephones, this paper proposes a wireless phone adapter {{that can be used to}} route the audio signal directly to the hearing aid or cochlear implant processor. This adapter is based on Bluetooth technology. The favorable features of this new wireless technology make the adapter superior to traditional assistive listening devices. A hardware prototype was built and software programs were written to implement the headset profile in the Bluetooth specification. Three cochlear implant users were tested with the proposed phone-adapter and reported good speech quality.

40|$|THE MARKED {{growth in}} the use of the {{telephone}} for survey interviewing has spurred a number of queries about the effects of that medium on data quality. These concerns generally have involved the comparability of results obtained in telephone and face-to-face interviews; a related issue is whether survey techniques developed for face-to-face interviews can be utilized in telephone contacts. For example, can items which employ numerical scales be presented to telephone respondents without the visual aids commonly accompanying them in person interviews? As a contribution to this debate, this paper presents the findings of a national study which experimentally compared two methods of pre-senting seven-point scale attitude questions to telephone respondents.

40|$|Multitasking is a {{skill that}} is {{essential}} for effective everyday living. However, despite an increase in attempts to identify the cognitive components underlying such a skill, there is still uncertainty over the exact processes involved and what might impair them. This research has {{examined the effects of}} interruptions on a novel multitasking task (MT) and a single task (ST), in an attempt to further understand the processes involved. 40 participants completed both a ST and the MT, and were interrupted with a one minute arithmetic task during each. The novel MT required participants to complete subgroups from each of the four tasks provided (tangled lines, <b>visual</b> search, <b>telephone</b> and LegoTM) over ten minutes. The ST required participants to perform only one of the four tasks for the full ten minutes. Participants’ working memory scores were also measured. Interruption effects did not differ between the ST and the MT, and the interruption was not found to disrupt task performance. Strong effects of memory for task instructions were also found. It is suggested that participants adopted a strategy for use during the MT, with different strategies chosen by those with high and low working memory scores. These results are considered in relation to previous research, and appear to support the suggestion that the ability to deal with an unexpected interruption is separate from the ability to complete either a multitasking task or a single task (Law et al., 2004). The limitations surrounding this study are also considered, as is the need for future research that continues to develop models of multitasking, and methodologies for investigating the cognitive processes involved as well as what might impair them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{real time}} {{delivery}} of multimedia content (Multimedia streaming) becomes a prominent field {{with the development}} of different networking technology and multimedia technology. Most of the applications such as video conferencing, <b>visual</b> <b>telephone</b> etc. need multimedia transmission techniques that send multimedia data from one end to another with enhanced efficiency, robustness and security. Multimedia streaming service requires adequate bandwidth and delay variation to attain excellent quality of service. Congestion happens frequently owing to unpredictable fluctuations and burstiness of traffic flows within high speed networks. Congestion has to be resolved as it is the main cause for packet loss and long delay that affects the Quality of Service in Networks. Various researchers over last decade developed a number of congestion control mechanisms. But Congestion control for streamed media traffic over Internet is still a great challenge. This paper presents a brief survey and points out Pros and Cons of various congestion control protocols and algorithms that was developed to suit media traffic over Adhoc networks...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{graduate}} credit and a noncredit home economics course, {{this study of}} the University of Wisconsin Educational Telephone Network (ETN) investigated whether telephone instruction can be effective in adult education, and how adults would react to this medium of remote, off campus extension teaching. The graduate course was divided between an experimental group (telephone) and a control group (on campus, face to face instruction). The ETN noncredit seminar consisted of three two-hour sessions, one a week. Tentative evaluations led to these conclusions: (1) ways of handling telephone course content and format need to be identified and implemented; (2) participants and program lecturers need preparation for the mechanical aspect of such experiences; (3) certain types of individuals function better with articulated media than others do; (4) <b>visual</b> aids in <b>telephone</b> instruction enhance presentations and ease remoteness; (5) certain skills can be learned which enable persons to increase their effectiveness under telephone instruction; (6) telephone instruction is useful for persons scattered over wide geographical areas, and its use should be further refined, expanded, and evaluated.

40|$|Educational {{institutions}} {{have always had}} a central place in the online age. Before the advent of high-speed broadband, other communications technologies and services also played a big role in education.   University researchers were among the first Australian users of {{what became known as the}} Internet. When the domain name system was deployed in the mid- 1980 s, the. au domain was delegated to Robert Elz at the University of Melbourne. When the Australian Vice-Chancellor’s Committee decided to set up a national communications network to support research, Geoff Huston transferred to its payroll from ANU to work as technical manager for AARNet, whose current chief executive, Chris Hancock, is interviewed by Liz Fell in this issue. When a 56 kbps ARPANET link with Australia was made by NASA and the University of Hawaii via Intelsat in June 1989, the connection was established in Elz’s University of Melbourne laboratory. (Clarke 2004 : 31) In earlier times, the postal service made learning-at-a-distance possible by ‘correspondence’, particularly in remote areas of Australia. Advances in radio communications made it easier and the interactivity more immediate. Television sets and later video cassette and DVD players and recorders made it more <b>visual.</b> The <b>telephone</b> provided a tool of communication for teachers and learners; the best of them understood that most people were both at different times. Then simple low bandwidth tools like email and web browsing provided new ways for students, teachers and their institutions to communicate and distribute and share information. Learning management systems like Blackboard have been widely deployed through the education sector. Information that was once housed in libraries is now available online and social media platforms are providing new ways for students to collaborate. Ubiquitous, faster broadband and mobile access via smartphones and tablets promise further transformations.  ...|$|R
30|$|This study {{involves}} {{the reporting of}} a continuous case series of women {{with a history of}} pelvic or abdominal pain for more than 6  months who were seen in the pelvic pain clinic and were offered a laparoscopy. These women were then included in the study if they were found to have adhesions, but were excluded from the study if they had additional pathology such as endometriosis or required additional procedures other than adhesiolysis. Umbilical insertion of Verress’ needle and primary trocar was used except when the patient had had a previous midline laparotomy, in which case Palmer’s point was routinely used for entry. Routine bowel preparation with Picolax was employed in those patients known to have dense colonic adhesions or who had symptoms suggestive of such. Adhesions were divided using Metzenbaum scissors with haemostasis using suction irrigation achieved with a Surgiflex R WaveTM suction irrigation system with BICAPTM bipolar diathermy probe (ACMITM, USA).

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2006. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 86 - 88). viii, [89] leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe {{ability to}} avoid collisions {{is essential for}} survival. Diminished avoidance abilities among older adults and those under age 12 {{may account for the}} disproportionately high number of older individuals and children involved in pedestrian-vehicle collisions (Choueiri, E. M, Choueiri, G. M, Choueiri, B. M., 1993); (Kingma, J., 1994); (Mathey, F. J., 1983). The growing number of traffic-related fatalities underscores the need to attain a better understanding of collision avoidance response skill changes across the life span and the need to develop systems for screening and assessing individual collision avoidance skills. The primary objective of the parent research was to develop a battery of tests and to examine the relationships between sensory, attention, cognition and motor skills with collision avoidance ability. The degree of skill exhibited by an individual in avoiding automobile collisions in the simulator {{is expected to be a}} useful indicator of his/her ability to perform other related complex vehicle-maneuvering tasks such as those required for automobile operation. The purpose of this thesis project was to develop a simulated collision avoidance testing (SCAT) apparatus and procedure and conduct a pilot study to examine the SCAT system sensitivity to age and sex differences of the vehicle operator, particularly with respect to intra-task manipulations of visibility, event uncertainty, and type of evasive maneuver. One hundred and six healthy functional volunteers served as participants. These volunteers have 19 (6 - 19 years) participants in the young group; 43 (20 - 59 years) participants in the adult group, and 44 (60 - 74 + years) participants in the senior group. Five sets of tasks were performed: (1) Simulated Collision Avoidance Task with overall measures including crash frequency and crash severity;(2) Sensory Integrity tests (vision, hearing, and health questionnaires); (3) Information Processing Tasks including reaction time and movement time tests; (4) Tasks of Everyday Attention and Cognition (TEAC) : Visual Elevator Test (attention switching), Trails B Test (<b>visual</b> search), <b>Telephone</b> Directory Search Test (<b>visual</b> search), and <b>Telephone</b> Number Dialing Test (short-term memory); and (5) Movement Control Tasks: Grip Strength Test (strength), Balance Test (balance), Gross Motor (Fitts Tapping Test), Needle Threading Test (fine motor skill), Bow Tying Test (fine motor skill), and Tweezer Transfer Test (fine motor skill). The total time per test session was 90 - 120 minutes. Only the simulator results are presented in this thesis. Overall results for the SCAT showed significant differences in crash frequency ratio and crash severity as a function of age, sex, uncertainty and maneuver. Visibility was only marginally significant. The effects of age depended on level of task such that the senior group had a significantly higher crash frequency and severity than the other age groups for uncertain scenarios, while differences between other age groups were not significantly different There was an interaction of sex and maneuver in crash severity such that males performed worse than females. Females varied very little across maneuvers while males had progressively more fatal crashes from left to right to stop maneuvers. The stop maneuver had a significantly greater crash frequency than the left or right maneuvers. The right and stop maneuvers had a higher crash severity than the left maneuver for uncertain scenarios. Beneficial outcomes of this research for Hawaii and the nation may include improved medical screening and assessment batteries to aid licensing agencies, rehabilitation facilities, physicians, driver education specialists, law enforcement officers, families of unfit drivers, and all drivers on the road in identifying drivers who, for whatever reason, are unfit to drive without assistance. This research helps identify when collision avoidance abilities (and cognitive and motor function) reach maximal development, when they begin to decline, and the possibility of compensatory measures for recognized deficiencies. These findings are especially relevant to the identification of older persons at risk of auto accidents. Given the sensitivity to age and/or disability demonstrated by SCAT, these tasks may hold potential for screening candidates for driver's license renewal and for impaired driver rehabilitation in virtual reality [...] . risk free to the real world traffic. SCAT may comprise useful test battery elements for testing and predicting collision avoidance ability of potential drivers and for assessing an individual's fitness to drive thereby reducing traffic fatalities and extending the number of years of safe driving for motorists...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Integrated {{models of}} care are {{recommended}} {{for people with}} knee osteoarthritis (OA). Exercise is integral to management, yet exercise adherence is problematic. Telephone-based health coaching is an attractive adjunct to physical therapist-prescribed exercise that may improve adherence. Little {{is known about the}} perceptions and interpretations of physical therapists, telephone coaches, and patients engaged in this model of care. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore how stakeholders (physical therapists, telephone coaches, and patients) experienced, and made sense of, being involved in an integrated program of physical therapist-supervised exercise and telephone coaching for people with knee OA. DESIGN: A cross-sectional qualitative design drawing from symbolic interactionism was used. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 10 physical therapists, 4 telephone coaches, and 6 patients with painful knee OA. Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis informed by grounded theory. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: (1) genuine interest and collaboration, (2) information and accountability, (3) program structure, and (4) roles and communication in teamwork. Patients reported they appreciated personalized, genuine interest from therapists and coaches and were aware of their complementary roles. A collaborative approach, with defined roles and communication strategies, was identified as important for effectiveness. All participants highlighted the importance of sharing information, monitoring, and being accountable to others. Coaches found the lack of face-to-face contact with patients hampered relationship building. Therapists and coaches referred to the importance of teamwork in delivering the intervention. LIMITATIONS: The small number of physical therapists and telephone coaches who delivered the intervention may have been biased toward favorable experiences with the intervention and may not be representative of their respective professions. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated physical therapy and telephone coaching was perceived as beneficial by most stakeholders. Programs should be structured but have some flexibility to give therapists and coaches some freedom to adjust treatment to individual patient needs as required. Opportunities for <b>visual</b> communication between <b>telephone</b> coaches and patients could facilitate relationship building. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

An EQ- 5 D questionnaire was also enclosed to assess quality of life. One hundred and forty-three procedures were identified between September 1998 and July 2002. Having excluded those with additional pathology that required treatment, 90 were eligible for the study. Seventy-six replies were obtained; seven patients had moved away. Sixty-nine replies were analysed. Fifty-one (74 %) reported some improvement in their symptoms [12 (17 %) pain completely gone, 26 (38 %) greatly improved, 13 (19 %) a little better]. Patients still had significant pain [scores out of 100 for dysmenorrhoea (45), dyspareunia (28), dyschezia (28) and daily pain (29)]. Overall, quality of life was still lower than national averages (self-rated health status mean = 67.0 vs. 82.34, P< 0.05, weighted health state index = 0.67 vs. 0.85, P< 0.05), except in the good responders (pain gone or greatly improved, for whom quality of life returned to normal). There was no difference in pain scores, response and quality of life between women who had had their surgery more than 24  months earlier and those who had had surgery more recently. We have found a good response to adhesiolysis, which is comparable with other studies. A good response is associated with a normal quality of life and appears to be long standing.|$|R
