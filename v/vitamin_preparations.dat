In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.|$|E

Ethanol markedly diminished the bioavailability of [14 C]FAD to a greater degree than that of [14 C]riboflavin. Corroboration of an ethanol-impaired intraluminal hydrolysis of FAD was provided by using everted jejunal segments and measuring mucosal uptake of [14 C]riboflavin together with nonradiolabeled FAD.

40|$|Objective   To {{explore the}} role of amino acids and {{vitamins}} {{in the prevention of}} and recovery from the fatigue related to military operation in the officers and soldiers at high altitude. Methods   The participants were 100 officers and soldiers, whose Modified Fatigue Rating Scale (MFIS) scores were > 21 points. The participants were randomly divided into three groups: capsule, placebo, and granules. Amino acids capsule (8 kinds of essential amino acids and 11 kinds of vitamins were contained), placebo, or amino acid-fructose beverage was given to respective group for 14 days continuously. The 3000 -m running performance of the officers and soldiers stationed on a plateau was measured on the first and 14 th days. The maximal grip strength of the right hand, fist-making times per minute, and the height reaching by the hand after three-step run-up for the same candidate were observed before and after fatigue loading (3000 -m running). The blood levels of lactic acid and urea nitrogen of the candidates were measured after fatigue loading on the first and the 14 th days. Results   The 3000 -m running performance of officers and soldiers in the capsule and granules groups on the 14 th day were better than that of the first day (P P > 0. 05). The diﬀerence between the capsule and the granules groups in grip strength, fist-making times per minute, and hand reaching height on the 14 th day were obviously lower than that on the first day (P P > 0. 05). The blood levels of lactic acid and urea nitrogen in the capsule and granules groups on the 14 th day were lower than that on the first day (P P > 0. 05).

40|$|Professor Buytendijk’s miracle drug. The <b>vitamin</b> <b>preparation</b> Eviunis and {{the risks}} of {{scientists}} doing publicity work The discovery of vitamins {{at the start of}} the 20 th century not only stimulated new areas of scientific research in the field of nutrition and pharmacy; vitamins also turned out to be profitable products for new or existing industries. Consequently, vitamins drove scientists and commercial vitamin producers into each others’ arms during the first decades of the century. Several publications – by Harmke Kamminga and Sally Horrocks for instance – deal with the causes and effects of forms of co-operation between science and industry in the nutritional and pharmaceutical sector. They mostly stress – using examples from Great- Britain – the interconnected interests from which both profited: industry-sponsored vitamin research made vitamins available to a larger public of consumers, with scientists authorizing the health claims of the products these companies tried to sell. This article shows how Dutch scientists and vitamin producers were concerned with the same issue in the inter-war period. Not only does it focus on the interconnected interests, but particularly on the conflicts of interests scientists were experiencing whilst performing advisory or research work for the industry. The article singles out F. J. J. Buytendijk, nowadays remembered for his pioneering research in the field of phenomenological psychology after the Second World War, and his involvement with the Swiss <b>vitamin</b> <b>preparation</b> Eviunis at the end of the nineteen-twenties. Buytendijk actively promoted the introduction of this particular preparation on the Dutch market. He was confronted with a growing number of critics, however, after tests demonstrated how the preparation could hardly sustain any of the claims that had been made with regard to its vitamin-like performance. Buytendijk’s strongest critics accused him of misusing his scientific authority to sell a fraudulent product – after all, he that maintained his own tests had confirmed Eviunis’ claims. A final, state-ordered counter test of Eviunis resulted in the ban of the preparation from the Dutch market. However, it did not condemn Buytendijks commitment to the product. It only concluded that the physiologist had been mistaken in his interpretation of the working of Eviunis. Buytendijk’s reputation as a vitamin researcher compromised nonetheless, because of his spirited commitment to a product that turned out to sell an illusion. </p...|$|R
