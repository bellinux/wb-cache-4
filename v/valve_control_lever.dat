50|$|With {{the slogan}} “The challenger“, the HATZ 1B-series was {{presented}} in 1996, showing a number of technical highlights. In a minimum of space, all the important functional components of the engine such as decompression device, injection pump drive, oil pump with oil pump pressure regulator, valve train system for inlet and outlet <b>valve,</b> governor, speed <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> with governor spring and the multi-functional mechanical control system are integrated in the governor housing. Due to these technical features, the B-series scores with a light-weight and compact design.Depending on their cylinder capacity, the air-cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of B-series are available at power ranges from 1.5 to 7.6 kW and a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. Furthermore, models with vertical or horizontal crankshaft are available. The B-series complies with the strict requirements of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{enabling}} technologies required for successful commercialization of displacement controlled (DC) systems are the appropriate variable displacement pumps. This thesis aims to fill the current gap in literature {{with respect to the}} performance requirements of pumps used in DC systems as well as create a methodology to ensure a compact, low power, and low cost pump adjustment system design. This research looks both at the design considerations with respect to the individual components and the system as a whole. Also {{for the first time a}} measurement based approach is taken to specify the dynamic requirements of DC pumps. ^ Looking at the components a new sensor technology is presented including initial proof of concept measurements. The ideal valve configuration is presented as a slightly underlapped 3 position 4 port valve. Also a detailed qualitative analysis is presented about the swash plate centering mechanism showing which general configuration best meets the criteria for DC pumps considering compactness and performance. ^ With respect to the complete system a detailed hydraulic and kinematic model is presented. This model is used in a full factorial design of experiments to discover the system effects of sizing the <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>control</b> cylinder, <b>lever</b> arm and <b>control</b> pressure associated with the adjustment system. Additionally a methodology for sizing coupled components to satisfy pump response, pump power, and pump size requirements is detailed along with a general case study. ...|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Compressed {{air leakage}} {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 42 % of electrical energy loss on a typical mine compressed air system. By using underground <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{it is possible to}} reduce the amount of air leakage. Underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> was successfully implemented in a South African mine. The project implementation and achieved results are documented in this study. The implementation of underground <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> initially requires a large capital investment. In this study the electrical and financial savings realised by underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> and surface <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> were calculated. The payback periods for each control strategy were determined and compared. It was determined that underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> can realise up to 40 % higher electrical savings than surface control. Depending on the size of the mine and due to the large initial investment, the payback period for an underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> system can be up to six times longer than that of a surface control system.

50|$|Evidence of {{the early}} manual {{operation}} of the station survives. The wheel handle <b>valve</b> <b>controls</b> are now gone but marks on the control room floor indicate the locations of their footings. The steel frame within the chamber accommodates the fixings for the shafts that ran down from the wheel handles to the pipes at the basement level. The original Kemp hydraulic controls machine now stands near the roller door. It once stood on the raised concrete pad at the river side of the control room. Associated with this is the <b>lever</b> <b>control</b> mounted on a small pedestal which {{stands in the middle}} of the <b>control</b> room. The <b>lever</b> <b>control</b> opened and shut the valves which when they were too tight had to be manipulated by hand. This hydraulic control mechanism is no longer operational. Dotted lines on the control room floor near the lever pedestal indicate that the river valves are to the southeast and the dam valves to the northwest. Three original pressure gauges are housed in a timber panel below the middle window on the northwest wall. These were connected to the pumps.|$|R
