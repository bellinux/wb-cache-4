The influence of the presence of aboveground medium <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> on displaying site selection of Great Bustard males was investigated.

40|$|Aim. The {{issue of}} preterm birth due to {{exposure}} to magnetic fields from <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> is unclear. Exposure to electromagnetic field in uterus has been hypothesized as possible preterm birth. The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine whether living closer to high <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> increased the risk of preterm labor. Methods. In a nested case-control study, 135 cases of singleton live spontaneous preterm birth in Rohani hospital, Babol, Iran, during the period between 2013 and 2014 were studied. The 150 control subjects were singleton term live birth in the same year of birth and city of residence using randomized-digit dialing. The shortest distance to any of the high <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> to the maternal residence during pregnancy was measured using ArcGIS software for every case and control. To test the association between the preterm births and the residential proximity to <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> stepwise multiple logistic regression was used. Results. There were 28 households, 20 cases (14. 8 %) and 8 controls (5. 3 %) situated within 600 meters of high <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines.</b> The adjusted OR for spontaneous preterm birth and birth defect in women who were living in less than 600 meters from high <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> was higher compared to those living at farther distance (OR = 3. 28, CI: 1. 37 to 7. 85) and (OR = 5. 05, CI: 1. 52 to 16. 78), respectively.

They include high voltage transmission lines, some of these <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> are mounted on and passing through different urban areas, and some of these areas are informal development which were extended unofficially under or very close to these high voltage powerline which can put the people living in these areas in risk. Electromagnetic radiation from high <b>voltage</b> <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> can affect the health of people in urban and rural communities.
