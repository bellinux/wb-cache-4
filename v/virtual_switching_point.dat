40|$|International audienceVirtual {{switches}} are a {{key elements}} within the new paradigms of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Unlike proprietary networking appliances, <b>virtual</b> <b>switches</b> come {{with a high level}} of flexibility in the management of their physical resources such as the number of CPU cores, their allocation to the switching function, and the capacities of the RX queues, which gives the opportunity for an efficient sizing of the system resources. We propose a model for the performance evaluation of a <b>virtual</b> <b>switch.</b> Our model resorts to servers with vacation to capture the involved interactions between queues resulting from the implemented polling strategies. The solution to the model is found using a simple fixed-point iteration and it provides estimates for customary performance metrics such as the attained throughput, the packet latency, the buffer occupancy and the packet loss rate. In the tens of explored examples, the predictions of the model were found to be accurate, thereby allowing their use for the purpose of sizing problems. I. INTRODUCTION Computer networks are expected to undergo major changes with the development of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). SDN introduces a new architecture in which a single or a small set of centralized controller(s) replaces the control plane, formerly distributed on each router in traditional IP networks. As for NFV, it enables common network functions (e. g., packet forwarding, firewall, caching) to be done via software on industry-standard hardware (e. g., x 86 architecture). The expectations generated by combining SDN and NFV together are very high. Operators expect considerable gain in resource management flexibility (e. g., by dynamically reprogramming their network), while reducing their cost of operations by replacing dedicated and proprietary appliances by standard off the shelf hardware. Within SDN and NFV-based networks, nodes interconnecting the links are standard physical servers, with multiple CPU cores, running a <b>virtual</b> <b>switch</b> or <b>virtual</b> <b>switch</b> implementation. Analogously to routers in traditional IP networks, <b>virtual</b> <b>switches</b> are in charge of receiving, processing, switching, and transmitting packets flowing in the network. They handle incoming packets using a specialized library that largely defines their internal architecture. The DPDK library [1], which enables the processing of a packet in less than 80 CPU cycles, is becoming a prominent framework. Despite considerable progress, <b>virtual</b> <b>switches</b> are unlikely to be as fast their full hardware-based counterparts, and may be viewed as a critical spot when studying the performance of SDN/NFV networks...|$|R

40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>switches</b> {{have become}} popular among cloud {{operating}} systems to interconnect virtual machines {{in a more}} flexible manner. However, this paper demonstrates that <b>virtual</b> <b>switches</b> introduce new attack surfaces in cloud setups, whose effects can be disastrous. Our analysis shows that these vulnerabilities are caused by: (1) inappropriate security assumptions (privileged <b>virtual</b> <b>switch</b> execution in kernel and user space), (2) the logical centralization of such networks (e. g., OpenStack or SDN), (3) the presence of bi-directional communication channels between data plane systems and the centralized controller, and (4) non-standard protocol parsers. Our work highlights the need to accommodate the data plane(s) in our threat models. In particular, it forces us to revisit today's assumption that the data plane can only be compromised by a sophisticated attacker: we show that compromising the data plane of modern computer networks can actually be performed by a very simple attacker with limited resources only and at low cost (i. e., {{at the cost of}} renting a virtual machine in the Cloud). As a case study, we fuzzed only 2 % of the code-base of a production quality <b>virtual</b> <b>switch's</b> packet processor (namely OvS), identifying serious vulnerabilities leading to unauthenticated remote code execution. In particular, we present the "rein worm" which allows us to fully compromise test-setups in less than 100 seconds. We also evaluate the performance overhead of existing mitigations such as ASLR, PIEs, and unconditional stack canaries on OvS. We find that while applying these countermeasures in kernel-space incurs a significant overhead, in user-space the performance overhead is negligible...|$|R
