25|$|Lamba's highest score 320* {{came in the}} Duleep Trophy Final in 1987-88 for North Zone v West Zone. The West {{might have}} felt <b>very</b> <b>satisfied</b> with their first innings score of 444, with their captain and Test opener Anshuman Gaekwad making 216. Their opponents, however, had other ideas and replied with 868 all out. Lamba left Gaekwad in the shade with 320 in 720 minutes which was scored off 471 balls {{including}} six 6s and thirty 4s. That season he totalled 1097 runs at 84.38. Seven years later he crossed the triple hundred mark again with 312 for Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match versus Himachal Pradesh at Delhi. The hosts ran up 637-3 declared owing much to a first wicket Indian record wicket 464 between Lamba and Ravi Sehgal, who made 216. Lamba's 312 came off 392 balls with two 6s and twenty five 4s and took 567 minutes. These innings and similar knocks, such as his 617 balls 250 for Delhi v Punjab in 1996/97 gained him a somewhat mixed reputation.|$|E
25|$|After Osbourne {{left the}} Betty Ford Center {{where he had}} been treated for {{substance}} abuse, Lee presented him with the music he had written while Osbourne was away. Osbourne was purportedly <b>very</b> <b>satisfied</b> with {{the quantity and quality of}} Lee's new music, much of which would be used for the 1986 album, The Ultimate Sin. The album was awarded platinum status in May 1986 and was awarded double platinum status in October 1994. Lee and Osbourne once again toured extensively, this time with Phil Soussan on bass, John Sinclair on keyboards and Randy Castillo on drums. In Kansas City, Missouri on April 1, 1986, a concert was filmed which would be released later that year as the home video The Ultimate Ozzy. In 1987, after touring with Ozzy Osbourne in support of The Ultimate Sin album, Lee was fired in a telegram from Sharon Osbourne while working on one of his muscle cars back in Los Angeles. Lee was completely caught off guard at the time of his firing and was under the impression he had a solid working gig with the Osbourne camp.|$|E

25|$|KTVU officially joined Fox {{seven months}} later on October 9, 1986, when the fledgling network inaugurated {{programming}} with the debut of the late night talk show The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Similar to other Fox stations during the network's early years, KTVU was programmed as a de facto independent station, even after Fox expanded its programming into prime time on weekend evenings in April 1987. Until Fox completed the expansion of its prime time schedule (which began with the launch of a Saturday night lineup in July 1987, and was gradually rolled out to additional nights {{over the next seven}} years) and began offering programming on a nightly basis in September 1993, KTVU continued to air a movie at 8:00p.m. on nights when the network did not offer any programming. However, the station also decreased its reliance on movies during this period, due to the growing difficulty of broadcast stations in acquiring film content as the number of cable television networks increased. The strong ratings that KTVU had as an independent station carried over into its tenure with Fox, turning it into one of the network's strongest affiliates; despite having its programming occasionally being pre-empted by San Francisco Giants game telecasts, Fox was <b>very</b> <b>satisfied</b> with KTVU because of its ratings performance.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of its}} tenure with NBC, KRON was the network's second-largest {{affiliate}} and {{its largest}} on the West Coast. Despite this, KRON occasionally pre-empted NBC programming. One such notable omission was Another World, which would eventually air on the station in the early 1990s; KRON's decision to drop the daytime soap opera {{in the summer of}} 1998 (leaving Days of Our Lives and the struggling Sunset Beach as the only network soaps on its schedule) is thought to have hastened NBC's decision to cancel it altogether a year later. Two NBC daytime game shows, 50 Grand Slam and Just Men!, were never seen in the Bay Area. KRON also did not air NBC's soap operas in pattern (for example, KRON-TV aired Days of Our Lives after Another World, rather than the standard slot for NBC affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone—at 2:00 or 3:00p.m. depending on the season and time slot). Channel 4 also pre-empted some of the network's prime time programs. Similar to fellow NBC station KCRA-TV in neighboring Sacramento, KRON-TV stopped airing the Saturday morning T-NBC lineup in the early 1990s. Historically, NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than the other networks, but has recently eased its standards. The network would resort to purchasing stations {{for the sole purpose of}} switching or upgrading them to O status because of this (Miami's WTVJ and Salt Lake City's KUTV are such examples) or find independent stations to air NBC programs that the main affiliate did not air. In the case of KRON, many of the shows it preempted ended up on independent KICU-TV (channel 36). However, despite losing valuable advertising in one of the nation's largest television markets, NBC was <b>very</b> <b>satisfied</b> with KRON-TV, which was one of its strongest affiliates.|$|E

Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: [...] "It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father's life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That's how the story got made."

500|$|Another {{idea from}} which the episode was crafted was the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre: initially, the episode would have found the genre enjoyed by all {{citizens}} {{of the town of}} South Park, not just a younger audience. By Sunday, completed animated shots were being edited together and set to the song [...] "Landslide" [...] by Fleetwood Mac. The song's use in the episode was unsure until Tuesday night, when they eventually received clearance to use it. Parker noted later that they had backup songs to use if necessary, but none fit as well as [...] "Landslide". They were <b>very</b> <b>satisfied</b> with the ending, feeling it provided a very emotional conclusion to the show. In addition, the episodes contains what Parker describes in the commentary as [...] "our favorite thing of any South Park ever": the Duck President, who communicates by spraying feces from his mouth. [...] "Every time in the retake room when Duck President was on, shitting, quacking and shitting, we just thought it was the greatest thing ever," [...] he remarked.|$|E
500|$|Contrary to Winkelman, the German command was <b>very</b> <b>satisfied</b> {{with the}} day's events. It had been {{feared that the}} third day of the {{operation}} might become a [...] "crisis day", the XXVI Armeekorps having to overcome near Breda the resistance of several French divisions. The Germans had also been concerned that they may face some Belgian or even British divisions. Therefore, von Bock had before the invasion requested to be reinforced in this effort by another Army Corps. When this had been denied by chief of staff Franz Halder, he had arranged the formation of an extra Army Corps headquarters to direct the complex strategic situation of simultaneously fighting the Allies and advancing into the Fortress Holland over the Moerdijk bridges. As on 12 May no actual crisis seemed to materialise, with the French retreating and Belgian and British forces being completely absent, von Bock decided that XXVI Armeekorps would be responsible for pursuing the French south towards Antwerp, while some forces would be directed by the new headquarters, Generalkommando XXXIX under command of Generalleutnant Rudolf Schmidt, to advance north with 254. Infanteriedivision, most of 9. Panzerdivision, and SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler.|$|E

Though Barker helped write the songs on Enema of the State, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not official band member.

All the kids wanted autographs.... They'd unlock the doors and let kids into the studio, which most bands would never do."
