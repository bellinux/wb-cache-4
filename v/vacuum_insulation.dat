25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{incident}} CERN reported that the most likely {{cause of the problem}} was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets, and that– due to the time needed to warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature– it would take at least two months to fix. CERN released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008 respectively, and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008. The analysis of the incident by CERN confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause. The faulty electrical connection had led (correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium's enclosure and <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulation,</b> causing the coolant's temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it, and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees Celsius in some of the affected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other quench detectors also {{played a role in the}} rapid heating. Around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop, and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath. A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown. This accident was thoroughly discussed in a 22February 2010 Superconductor Science and Technology article by CERN physicist Lucio Rossi.|$|E

50|$|The PlusEnergy {{approach}} uses {{a variety}} of techniques to produce a building that generates more energy than it consumes. A typical example is to capture heat during the day {{in order to reduce the}} need to generate heat over night. This is achieved using large North and South facing window areas to allow sunlight to penetrate the structure, reducing the need for energy use from light bulbs. Triple-paned windows (U-value = 0.7) trap this heat inside, and the addition of heavy insulation then means the structure is already warm in the evening and therefore needs less heating. In the Sun Ship, a 60000 sq ft commercial, retail and residential PlusEnergy structure, techniques such as phase changing materials in the walls and <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulation</b> are also used.

40|$|Innovative heat {{management}} technologies can reduce emissions from cars by {{an order of}} magnitude. Substantial reductions would be realized during cold starts and in evaporative emissions. Such improvements result from {{a new class of}} variable-conductance steel <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulations</b> that insulate during one time period and take advantage of beneficial thermal conditions during another.

In a similar way, thermal cycling of fuel and the resulting vapor release can be reduced or avoided.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Insulation</b> Panels (VIPs) are thermal {{insulators}} {{consisting of}} an evacuated core material enveloped {{by a high}} barrier film or casing required to maintain the vacuum {{for a long period}} of time. In the evacuated state, the thermal conductivity of the core material ideally is a factor 5 to 10 lower than for insulators under atmospheric conditions. As a consequence, <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulation</b> panels combine high thermal performance with limited material thickness. This space-saving potential is among the most interesting features for large-scale application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulation</b> panels in architectural applications. Not only this space-saving potential, but also high thermal performance, low effective weight and possibly in some situations image proclamation, design potential and cost-effectiveness may be considered as advantages or added values of <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulation</b> panels over conventional thermal insulators. Application of these panels in building constructions, however, is not without risks regarding barrier envelope damage, service lifetime and thermal bridging. This paper therefore attempts to identify and elucidate the advantages and criticalities for application of <b>vacuum</b> <b>insulation</b> in buildings, so that architects and building engineers applying VIPs will know what aspects need to be considered more conscientiously...|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the incident of 19 th September caused a high pressure build-up inside the cryostat <b>insulation</b> <b>vacuum</b> which the existing overpressure devices could not contain.
