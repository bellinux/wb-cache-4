A tunable vacuum ultra-violet (<b>VUV)</b> <b>laser</b> {{source was}} {{recently}} developed for VUV spectroscopy using state selective excitation and total fluorescence detection. The <b>VUV</b> <b>laser</b> source {{makes use of}} a four-wave mixing process to provide tunable VUV radiation for the electronic excitation of the molecules. The theory of four-wave mixing, {{with the emphasis on}} parameters that are important for our experimental setup to generate efficient tunable VUV radiation is discussed. The experimental setup, and in particular the metal vapor heat-pipe, which provides Mg vapor as the nonlinear medium, is described. New diagnostic equipment described in this work was added to the experimental setup. This equipment was characterized and utilized together with the existing setup. The additional diagnostic equipment introduced enabled us to measure the tunable VUV output of the source (using a VUV monochromator), making it possible to significantly improve the efficiency of the existing tunable <b>VUV</b> <b>laser</b> source...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a spin- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (SARPES) apparatus with a vacuum-ultraviolet (<b>VUV)</b> <b>laser</b> (hν= 6. 994 eV) {{developed at the}} Laser and Synchrotron Research Center at the Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo. The spectrometer consists of a hemispherical photoelectron analyzer equipped with an electron deflector function and twin very-low-energy-electron-diffraction-type spin detectors, which allows us to analyze the spin vector of a photoelectron three-dimensionally with both high energy and angular resolutions. The combination of the high-performance spectrometer and the high-photon-flux <b>VUV</b> <b>laser</b> can achieve an energy resolution of 1. 7 meV for SARPES. We demonstrate that the present laser-SARPES machine realizes a quick SARPES on the spin-split band structure of a Bi(111) film even with 7 meV energy and 0. 7 ^∘ angular resolutions along the entrance-slit direction. This laser-SARPES machine is applicable to the investigation of spin-dependent electronic states on an energy scale of a few meV. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

This sub-nanosecond pulsed <b>VUV</b> <b>laser</b> operates at a repetition rate of 10 MHz, provides a flux of 2 × 10 ^ 12 photons/second, and enables photoemission with energy and momentum resolutions better than 2 meV and 0. 012 Å^- 1, respectively. Space-charge induced energy shifts and spectral broadenings {{can be reduced}} below 2 meV. The setup reaches electron momenta up to 1. 2 Å^- 1, granting full access to the first Brillouin zone of most materials. Control over the linear polarization, repetition rate, and photon flux of the VUV source facilitates ARPES investigations of {{a broad range of}} quantum materials, bridging the application gap between contemporary low energy laser-based ARPES and synchrotron-based ARPES.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of mutual control of nuclei and photons {{offered by the}} emerging field of nuclear quantum optics is theoretically investigated in three different applications. This extension of quantum optics towards nuclei is motivated by modern X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL) which open the possibility to coherently control nuclear states. As a first application we investigate the coherent population transfer between nuclear states in a three-level system driven by an XFEL. Such a level scheme is relevant for the triggering of isomers and might play a role for future energy storage solutions. The other way around, nuclei offer a platform to control single x-ray photons, which can be focused on spots essentially smaller than a single atom and used in future photonic circuits. The second part of this thesis puts forward a nuclear forward scattering setup that allows coherent control of a single x-ray photon using ^ 57 Fe nuclei. Finally, we show that nuclear quantum optics provides a significant improvement for detection in nuclear physics. The low-lying isomeric transition of ^ 229 Th can be addressed by <b>VUV</b> <b>lasers</b> and provides a potential next generation frequency standard. A main impediment is the large uncertainty of the nuclear transition frequency. Using an electromagnetically modified nuclear forward scattering setup, we show that coherence effects can reduce this uncertainty down to an unprecedented level...|$|R

Particular focus is made on work made {{in the frame of}} Eureka Eurolaser Excimer laser program (EU 205). This program, which started in 1987, associates laboratories and industrials from 5 european contries (France, Greece, RFA, Sueden and UK) for research and development on discharge excited excimer lasers and specific applications with the goal to develop a 1 - 3 KW average power UV Industrial excimer laser. This programm as very recently allowed the achievement in France of a 1 KW average power XeCl laser (λ = 308 nm). Most recent progress achieved on this program in the frame of GDR 919 CNRS "excimer lasers" are reviewed. Emphasis is made on plasma dynamics and discharge stability, atomic and molecular kinetics, laser modeling, optics, fluid-dynamics and coupled phenomena as well as system technical characteristics and performances. A review of recent work made at GDR 919 CNRS on specific applications of high average power excimer lasers is also presented with a particular focus on material processing (surface hardening, thin films elaboration, microelectronics related processing).

40|$|The {{rare gas}} alkali ionic {{molecules}} are {{established as a}} new class of ionic excimers which emit in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Temporal and spectral characteristics of these species with (XeRb) + at 164 nm and (XeCs) + at 160 nm have been investigated by soft x-ray excitation in a laser-produced plasma and by high energy pulsed electron beam pumping in this work. Soft x-ray pumping of XeF(B → X) and (XeRb) + yielded the first observation of excimer molecules formed by reactive kinetics in a laser-produced plasma. The spectrum of (XeRb) + was observed. The spectral structure could be assigned to 3 dipole allowed transitions originating from the 0 +(II), 1 (II), 1 (I) upper states ending in the 0 +(I) ground state. A kinetic study of electron beam pumped mixtures of Ar/Xe/Rb and Ar/Xe/Cs was performed. The observed temporal decays of (XeRb) + and (XeCs) + were analyzed. The results suggest that electron deactivation is surprisingly not a dominant quenching process for rare gas alkali ions. The radiative lifetimes are 150 ± 50 ns for (XeCs) + and 250 ± 50 ns for (XeRb) +. In addition several quenching rate constants were extracted from the experimental results. These rate constants and lifetimes were incorporated into a kinetic model for these species. This kinetic model reproduced the experimental observations well providing the electron quenching rate coefficient is kept to a maximum of 5 × 10 - 9 cm 3 s- 1. Estimates for the upper state densities were computed using this model to be ∼ 4 × 1015 cm- 3 for (XeCs) + and 2 × 1015 cm- 3 for (XeRb) +. Including absorption due to the photoionization of the alkali atoms, the net gain coefficients are computed to be on the order of 10 - 2 cm- 1.

By use of a Michelson interferometer working as a Fourier-transform spectrometer, the line shapes of different X-ray lasers have been measured with a very high accuracy (Δλ/λ~ 10 ^- 6). Achievement of the first XUV wavefront sensor has enabled us to measure the beam quality of laser-pumped as well as discharge-pumped X-ray lasers.

An independent simulation of the intricate beam dynamics in the magnetic bunch compressor is performed with the program CSRtrack. The SASE FEL process is simulated with the code FAST.
