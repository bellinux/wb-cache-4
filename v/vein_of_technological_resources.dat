40|$|<b>Technological</b> <b>resources</b> in {{the form}} of patents, trade secrets, and {{know-how}} have become key assets for modern enterprises. This paper addresses a critical issue in technology and innovation management, namely, the commercial exploitation <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> resulting from research and development (R&D) investments. Extracting economic value from these resources by maximizing the benefits for shareholders is an extremely challenging task because <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> are intangible, idiosyncratic, uncertain, predominantly tacit, and with poorly defined property rights. In their attempt to extract the maximum value from their <b>technological</b> <b>resources,</b> firms increasingly combine their internal exploitation through new product development (NPD) with external exploitation through licensing. However, most existing studies on NPD and technology licensing have treated the two exploitation paths independently and in isolation, which has resulted in two separate research streams using different theories and addressing different managerial challenges. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to contribute to filling this gap by developing and testing a comprehensive conceptual framework that simultaneously considers the antecedents affecting the successful implementation of NPD and licensing strategies as well as their consequences on firm profitability. The paper in particular investigates the effects of the interplay between <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> and three types of complementary resources, marketing, manufacturing, and relational. We test the model using structural equation modeling on a sample of 733 Spanish manufacturing firms observed from 2003 to 2007. The data provide support for the existence of different paths to market firm technologies: an internal path, whereby the ownership <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> fully explains NPD performance, and an external path, whereby high intensity of marketing and relational resources reinforces the positive effect <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> on licensing performance. This sustains the relevance of the resource-based value-enhancing effects of complementary resources in licensing, as opposed to the motivation-reducing effects advanced by transaction cost-based literature. Moreover, the empirical analysis shows a substitution effect between NPD and licensing, whereby their simultaneous pursuit at intense levels is associated with lower profit margins. This provides evidence of the much theorized, but seldom tested, rent dissipation effect. These findings offer several contributions to research on licensing, NPD, open innovation, and the resource-based view of the firm. On a managerial level, they suggest that achieving maximum value from proprietary technologies may not entail exploiting them both through external and internal paths. Managers are also informed that the resource combinations that enhance licensing performance include marketing and relational resource...|$|R

The article presents a theoretical deliberation concerning the development of {{issues related to the}} commercialisation of research results in the last century. A review of literature precedes the section on sources for the commercialisation of knowledge and technologies when considering research results and technology providers. The author claims that analysis <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> also determines the possibilities for the cooperation between science and business. It is important for the selection of the commercialisation strategy to describe <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> and their complementarity. Strong <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> and their market availability ensures independent technological development. However, a lack <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> or the chance to acquire them encourages an innovative organisation to pass know-how or technologies to another, capable organisation which is willing to commercialise this knowledge on the market. Frequently however when commercialising research results, organisations establish cooperation on the market in order to build resources to implement research results. This article, ‘Commercialisation of research results – cooperation between science and business’, is concluded with an example depicting the cooperation between scientists and business people in a new spin-off company set up in order to build <b>technological</b> <b>resources</b> and the market implementation of a device for measuring the structure of soft material surfaces.
