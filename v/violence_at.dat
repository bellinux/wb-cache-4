5|$|During the Early Modern {{period of}} Swiss history, the growing {{authoritarianism}} of the patriciate families {{combined with a}} financial crisis {{in the wake of}} the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, Sarumpaet, who was {{suffering}} domestic <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> home and {{discouraged by the}} market, left theatre and entered the film industry. After her divorce, which took several years and required records of her broken ribs to satisfy the religious courts, she returned to theatre in 1989 with a performance of Shakespeare's Othello. Sarumpaet began working as a director in 1991, with the television serial Rumah Untuk Mama (House for Mother), which was broadcast on the state-owned television station TVRI. That same year, she adapted Antigone, a tragedy by French writer Jean Anouilh, in a Batak setting.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{criminal}} inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists {{to photograph the}} scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation {{because there was no}} doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|William Hale Thompson was the Mayor of Chicago {{during the}} riot and {{a game of}} brinksmanship with Illinois Governor Frank Lowden may have {{exacerbated}} the riot since Thompson refused to ask Lowden to send in the National Guard for four days, despite Lowden ensuring that the guardsmen were in Chicago and ready to intervene. Although future mayor Richard J.

5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E

5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton offered {{conditional}} clemency to sixteen {{members of}} the FALN convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to bomb-making, and sedition, {{as well as for}} firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison, which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received, according to the White House. Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce <b>violence,</b> <b>at</b> the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress. Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive.|$|E
5|$|Racial <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> {{the time}} was common {{throughout}} the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around {{the start of the}} 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democrat-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.|$|E

5|$|Susianna Kentikian {{was born}} in Yerevan, Armenian SSR, the {{daughter}} of veterinary doctor Levon Kentikian and his wife Makruhi. At the age of five, she left Armenia {{with her parents and}} her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at asylum seekers' homes. However, due to the <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to Moldova and later to Russia, where Kentikian went to school {{for a short period of}} time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in Hamburg, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's residence status remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating <b>violence.</b> <b>At</b> the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E
5|$|The protests {{quickly turned}} to riots, with Hutu gangs {{moving through the}} {{district}} attacking Tutsi homes as they went. The <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> this stage consisting primarily of arson rather than killing, except {{in cases where the}} Tutsi tried to fight back. First in Ndiza and then across the country, Hutu burned Tutsi homes to the ground primarily by igniting paraffin, a product widely available in Rwanda for use in lamps. Made homeless, many Tutsi sought refuge in Catholic Church missions and with the Belgian authorities, while others crossed into Uganda and the Congo, beginning what would become a mass exodus {{by the end of the}} revolution. The arsonists recruited local peasants to their ranks, ensuring the rapid spread of the revolt. Many Hutu still believed that the king was superhuman, and claimed that they carried out the attacks on his behalf. By 9 November violence had spread across the country, except for Gitera's home province of Astrida (Butare) and the far southwest and east. Rioting was heaviest in the northwest; in Ruhengeri, every Tutsi home was destroyed by fire.|$|E

She identifies the five main suspects: Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) and Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). Marsden arrests Dan for the shooting, although he is later acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence. Dan was set up by Phil but it was, in fact, Lisa who shot him. Marsden later arrests Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) for the attempted murder of her husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). Little Mo claims self-defence, since she has been a victim of domestic <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> the hands of Trevor. The trial ends, with Trevor's treatment of Little Mo revealed. In 2003, Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) visits Marsden with evidence that Phil killed his ex-girlfriend Lisa. Jill helps set up a honey-trap for Phil in order to obtain a confession from him, with PC Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny) and DI Dominic Price (Paul Brennen), but it fails when Kate falls in love with Phil and Marsden fires her. Marsden arrests Phil, but with insufficient evidence and no confession he is released. It later emerges that Lisa is safe and well, and Phil is innocent. Marsden later arrests Phil when Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) set him up in an armed robbery.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, lay to the east, on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron Valley below it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of <b>violence</b> <b>at</b> the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer {{at the site of the}} Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.|$|E
