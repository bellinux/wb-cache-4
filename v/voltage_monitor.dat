50|$|The {{metering}} {{must be able}} {{to accumulate}} energy units in both directions or two meters must be used. Many meters accumulate bidirectionally, some systems use two meters, but a unidirectional meter (with detent) will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid. In some countries, for installations over 30 kWp a frequency and a <b>voltage</b> <b>monitor</b> with disconnection of all phases is required. This is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility, and the excess can not either be exported or stored. Grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity. Now they need to also provide storage. This is normally hydro-storage, but other means of storage are used. Initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output. With variable renewable energy, storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available, and consumption whenever it is needed. The two variables a grid operator have are storing electricity for when it is needed, or transmitting it to where it is needed. If both of those fail, installations over 30kWp can automatically shut down, although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate. Grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems, although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power, and results in a substantial loss of revenue. Three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements.|$|E

40|$|An {{advanced}} charger {{has been}} proposed for a battery that comprises several lithium-ion cells in series. The proposal is directed toward charging the cells in as nearly an optimum manner as possible despite unit-to-unit differences among the nominally identical cells. The particular aspect of the charging problem that motivated the proposal can be summarized as follows: During bulk charging (charging all the cells in series at the same current), the voltages of individual cells increase at different rates. Once one of the cells reaches full charge, bulk charging must be stopped, leaving other cells less than fully charged. To {{make it possible to}} bring all cells up to full charge once bulk charging has been completed, the proposed charger would include a number of top-off chargers one for each cell. The top-off chargers would all be powered from the same DC source, but their outputs would be DC-isolated from each other and AC-coupled to their respective cells by means of transformers, as described below. Each top-off charger would include a flyback transformer, an electronic switch, and an output diode. For suppression of undesired electromagnetic emissions, each top-off charger would also include (1) a resistor and capacitor configured to act as a snubber and (2) an inductor and capacitor configured as a filter. The magnetic characteristics of the flyback transformer and the duration of its output pulses determine the energy delivered to the lithium-ion cell. It would be necessary to equip the cell with a precise <b>voltage</b> <b>monitor</b> to determine when the cell reaches full charge. In response to a full-charge reading by this <b>voltage</b> <b>monitor,</b> the electronic switch would be held in the off state.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityWith {{the continual}} global {{increase}} in the demand for electricity, power systems are becoming more complex. In addition, factors such as power market deregulation, unscheduled voltage regulation, transmission line outages may lead to power transfer across areas being even more unpredictable. These issues all contribute to transmission lines carrying electric power nearer to their limits, which causes power systems to being operated under serious stress. Many recent major blackouts are caused by voltage collapse, and this justifies {{the need for a}} fast and accurate <b>voltage</b> stability <b>monitoring</b> approach for the modern power system. Conventional <b>voltage</b> <b>monitoring</b> and control is based on SCADA and EMS controls nowadays. As a result of the limitations of these measurements, which include slow data sampling rate, slow data communication, and slow state estimation processing, it may take minutes for a whole snapshot of the measured electrical power system to be obtained. Hence, operators do not really have access to the real time and detailed voltage and current vectors required for on-line voltage control, which makes the actual implementation of on-line voltage control unrealistic. However, with the development and installation of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in power systems, data can be made available at high-sampling rates, allowing for more efficient on-line <b>monitoring</b> of <b>voltages.</b> The development and applications of wide area measurement systems (WAMS) provides the foundation for on-line assessment of voltage stability in large scale power systems. In order to not let the long computational time of the conventional monitoring and optimization methods offset the advantage of the PMUs and WAMS. A model-free <b>voltage</b> <b>monitoring</b> method together with a brand new voltage optimization method is provided in this dissertation.
