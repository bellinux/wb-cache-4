5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{applications}} for vapor chambers. First, they are used when high powers and heat fluxes are applied to a relatively small evaporator. [...] Heat input to the evaporator vaporizes liquid, which flows in two dimensions to the condenser surfaces.

Note that most vapor chambers are insensitive to gravity, and will still operate when inverted, with the evaporator above the condenser. In this application, the <b>vapor</b> <b>chamber</b> acts as a heat flux transformer, cooling a high heat flux from an electronic chip or laser diode, and transforming it to a lower heat flux that can be removed by natural or forced convection.

Meniscus curvature at every location along the wick is calculated {{as a result of this}} coupling. The model accounts for the change in interfacial area in the wick pore, thin-film evaporation, and Marangoni convection effects during phase change at the liquid–vapor interface.

40|$|Abstract. Two-phase heat {{transfer}} {{devices such as}} heat pipes and <b>vapor</b> <b>chambers</b> are composed of an evaporator, an adiabatic section and a condenser. For the dry-out prevention and capillary purpose, adiabatic sections and evaporators are covered by wick structures. Common wick structures are grooves, mesh, sintered powder and their combination. Combining with the wick structures, the major phase change effects on evaporators are thin-film evaporation. For the research between parameters of wick structure and evaporator performance, we developed a facility to measure the {{heat transfer}} on evaporators. To ensure the least heat losing, the path of heat flux and test condition were designed with several thermal guards. A pressure control system was established with balance mechanisms to maintain a stable condition of low pressure. Since temperature differences are very fast while the major phase change effect is thin-film evaporation, a high speed data acquisition system was used. Based on this test platform, the performance of evaporators can be determined at specific conditions...|$|R
50|$|Many gamers and {{computer}} enthusiasts choose to overclock their CPU(s) and GPU(s) {{in order to}} gain extra performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either processing unit often requires additional cooling to what the original equipment manufacturer shipped their product with, most notably in the case of CPUs. Two types of mainstream cooling exist, air cooling and water cooling. Air cooling, the more common of the two, uses a heat sink often in conjunction with heat pipes or <b>vapor</b> <b>chambers</b> to move heat away from the component and dissipate it into the air. Water cooling is somewhat more complex, it makes use of water blocks, radiators, pumps, tubing and optionally a reservoir. Water removes heat by running water through a block affixed to the component and then allowing the water time in the radiator in order to cool off. Fans are often used to increase a radiator's rate of heat dissipation.|$|R

40|$|The thermal and {{hydrodynamic}} {{performance of}} passive two-phase cooling {{devices such as}} heat pipes and <b>vapor</b> <b>chambers</b> {{is limited by the}} capabilities of the capillary wick structures employed. The desired char- acteristics of wick microstructures are high permeability, high wicking capability and large extended meniscus area that sustains thin-film evaporation.

In the present work, models are developed to predict the capillary pressure, permeability and thin-film evaporation rates of various micropillared geometries. Novel wicking geometries such as conical and pyramidal pillars on a surface are proposed which provide high permeability, good thermal contact with the substrate and large thin-film evaporation rates. A com- parison between three different micropillared geometries – cylindrical, conical and pyramidal – is pre- sented and compared to the performance of conventional sintered particle wicks. The employment of micropillared wick structure leads to a 10 -fold enhancement in the maximum heat transport capability of the device.

In this <b>vapor</b> <b>chamber,</b> nanostructure is patterned {{on the inner}} top surface of condensing wall and this condensing wall is made to be superhydrophobic to replace the conventional porous wick. This improvement not only results in drop-wise condensation which has a much higher heat transfer coefficient compared with film condensation, but also provides a shortcut for the condensed water to drop back directly to the center wick. Thus, a smaller liquid flow resistance and higher anti-dryout capability are achieved. The evaporator wick is made of sintered multi-layer copper powder. The dimensions of the <b>vapor</b> <b>chamber</b> are 70 x 70 x 3 mm(3). The test module includes an aluminum block with recirculated cooling water going through it and a heater with an area of 1. 5 x 1. 5 cm(2). The optimum working pressure is determined by testing {{the performance of the}} <b>vapor</b> <b>chamber</b> under different initial pressures. Heater temperature, horizontal resistance and vertical resistance are identified as key parameters to evaluate the performance of heat spreader. It is found that heater temperature increases with increasing heat flux. However, the vertical resistance shows the opposite tendency with increasing heat flux. The performance of the novel <b>vapor</b> <b>chamber</b> is compared with that of a conventional <b>vapor</b> <b>chamber</b> and copper plate. The newly developed <b>vapor</b> <b>chamber</b> can greatly reduce the heater temperature.
