5|$|In {{terms of}} rhythm, English is {{generally}} {{described as a}} stress-timed language, meaning {{that the amount of}} time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and <b>vowel</b> shortening causes changes in <b>vowel</b> quality: <b>vowel</b> reduction.|$|E

50|$|For example, in many languages, {{including}} English, most front <b>vowels</b> are unrounded, {{while most}} back <b>vowels</b> are rounded. There are no languages {{in which all}} front <b>vowels</b> are rounded and all back <b>vowels</b> are unrounded. The most likely explanation {{for this is that}} front <b>vowels</b> have a higher second formant (F2) than back <b>vowels,</b> and unrounded <b>vowels</b> have a higher F2 than rounded <b>vowels.</b> Thus unrounded front <b>vowels</b> and rounded back <b>vowels</b> have maximally different F2s, enhancing their phonemic differentiation.|$|R
50|$|Kédang has a {{total of}} twelve <b>vowels</b> in its language, {{separated}} into two sets evenly with six <b>vowels</b> per set. One set is composed of modal <b>vowels</b> or also known as normal <b>vowels</b> while the other set is breathy <b>vowels.</b> The <b>vowels</b> can be distinct by two different methods: by the word initial position and by the pitch. Modal <b>vowels</b> (normal <b>vowels)</b> occur {{in the middle and}} the final position while breathy <b>vowels</b> do not. While the breathy <b>vowels</b> are pronounced at a lower pitch.|$|R
40|$|The present article {{presents}} {{a study of}} the raising of overlong mid <b>vowels</b> in Estonian dialects. Long mid <b>vowels</b> of South Estonian dialects (Mulgi, Tartu and Võru) have split into full-long mid <b>vowels</b> (Q 2) and into overlong raised mid <b>vowels</b> (Q 3). Raising of mid <b>vowels</b> also characterises West Estonian dialects. The formant values of raised mid <b>vowels</b> of Võru and Mulgi show that they are much higher than mid <b>vowels</b> and very close to high <b>vowels.</b> The degree of raising of mid <b>vowels</b> is not as large in the Western dialect. The raising of overlong mid <b>vowels</b> in South Estonian has led to their near-merger with overlong high <b>vowels...</b>|$|R
5|$|Sinhala {{alphabet}} {{differs from}} other Indo-Aryan alphabets {{in that it}} contains a pair of <b>vowel</b> sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it. These are the two <b>vowel</b> sounds {{that are similar to}} the two <b>vowel</b> sounds that occur {{at the beginning of the}} English words at (ඇ) and ant (ඈ).|$|E
5|$|The Great <b>Vowel</b> Shift {{affected}} the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent {{shift in the}} <b>vowel</b> system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second <b>vowel</b> in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great <b>Vowel</b> Shift explains many irregularities in spelling, since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English <b>vowel</b> letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers are}} {{assigned}} to sounds and to symbols, e.g. 304 is the open front unrounded <b>vowel,</b> 415 is the centralization diacritic. Together, they form a symbol that represents the open central unrounded <b>vowel.</b> There is no three digit number for the open central unrounded <b>vowel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Raised <b>vowels</b> and {{retracted}} <b>vowels</b> {{constitute the}} traditional, but articulatorily inaccurate, category of back <b>vowels,</b> though they also cover {{most of the}} central <b>vowels.</b>|$|R

50|$|In most Germanic languages, lax <b>vowels</b> {{can occur}} only in closed syllables. Therefore, these <b>vowels</b> are also called checked <b>vowels,</b> {{as opposed to}} the tense <b>vowels</b> that are called free <b>vowels</b> because they can occur even in open syllables.|$|R

5|$|Colonial orthography {{is marked}} {{by the use of}} c for /k/ (always hard, as in cic /kiik/), k for /q/ in Guatemala or for /k’/ in the Yucatán, h for /x/, and tz for /ts/; the absence of glottal stop or <b>vowel</b> length (apart {{sometimes}} for a double <b>vowel</b> letter for a long glottalized <b>vowel,</b> as in uuc /u’uk/), the use of u for /w/, as in uac /wak/, and the variable use of z, ç, s for /s/. The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.|$|E
5|$|English has {{undergone}} many historical sound changes, {{some of them}} affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties {{are affected by the}} Great <b>Vowel</b> Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities <b>Vowel</b> Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different <b>vowel</b> landscapes in some regional accents.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>vowels</b> in Konkani {{is a subject}} of debate. Sources argue for {{anywhere}} from 8 distinct <b>vowels</b> to 16 distinct <b>vowels,</b> not including {{an equal number of}} long <b>vowels</b> and nasal <b>vowels.</b> The following table shows one interpretation of the <b>vowels</b> found in the Konkani language, while the IPA Chart below the table shows another interpretation.|$|R
50|$|Nasal <b>vowels</b> {{are found}} in various {{languages}} around the world, such as French, Portuguese, Breton, Hindi, Hmong, Hokkien, Yoruba and Cherokee. Those nasal <b>vowels</b> contrast with oral <b>vowels.</b> Many languages, however, have only oral <b>vowels</b> or do not contrast oral and nasalizational <b>vowels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nasal <b>vowels</b> once contrasted after nasal stops, as {{they still}} do in Numee. However, in Ndrumbea, nasal stops {{partially}} denasalized before oral <b>vowels,</b> so that now prenasalized stops precede oral <b>vowels,</b> and nasal stops precede nasal <b>vowels.</b> Similarly, [...] only occurs before oral <b>vowels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} {{language has}} seven monophthong <b>vowel</b> phonemes. They are aligned into three <b>vowel</b> harmony groups by a parameter called ATR (advanced tongue root); {{the groups are}} ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment seems to have superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front <b>vowel</b> spellings 'ö' and 'ü' are still often used in the West to indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian <b>vowel</b> system also has rounding harmony.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{results in}} a <b>vowel</b> system with 7 different <b>vowel</b> qualities and a length distinction in {{the high and low}} vowels only; this system is depicted in table 3.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vowel</b> length. The {{pronunciation}} of {{long and}} short vowels depends on the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. A long <b>vowel</b> has about 208% {{the length of a}} short <b>vowel.</b> In word-medial and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels are now only 127% as long as short vowels in initial syllables, but they are still distinct from initial-syllable short vowels. Short vowels in noninitial syllables differ from short vowels in initial syllables by being only 71% as long and by being centralized in articulation. As they are nonphonemic, their position is determined according to phonotactic requirements.|$|E
5000|$|In articulation, front <b>vowels</b> {{contrast}} with raised <b>vowels</b> and retracted <b>vowels.</b> In this conception, front <b>vowels</b> are a broader category than those {{listed in the}} IPA chart, including , , and, marginally, mid-central <b>vowels.</b> Raised or retracted <b>vowels</b> may be fronted by certain consonants, such as palatals and in some languages pharyngeals. For example, [...] may be fronted to [...] next to [...] or [...]|$|R
5000|$|After the −ATR non-high <b>vowels</b> /e a o/, +ATR mid <b>vowels</b> /e̘ o̘/ become −ATR high <b>vowels</b> /i u/. This is not {{reflected}} in the orthography, for both sets of <b>vowels</b> are spelled , and in many dialects this rule does not apply, for these <b>vowels</b> have merged.|$|R
50|$|Retracted <b>vowels</b> {{and raised}} <b>vowels</b> {{constitute}} the traditional, but articulatorily inaccurate, category of back <b>vowels.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Vowel</b> {{letters are}} also grouped in pairs—of unrounded and rounded <b>vowel</b> sounds—with these pairs also {{arranged}} from front {{on the left}} to back on the right, and from maximal closure at top to minimal closure at bottom. No <b>vowel</b> letters are omitted from the chart, though in the past some of the mid central vowels were listed among the 'other symbols'.|$|E

5|$|Although , {{a variant}} of sporangium, is an eye rhyme for orange, {{it is not a}} true rhyme as its second {{syllable}} is pronounced with an unreduced <b>vowel</b> , and often stressed.|$|E
50|$|Murmured <b>vowels</b> after plain consonants {{contrast}} with plain <b>vowels</b> after aspirated consonants, and likewise glottalized <b>vowels</b> with ejective consonants, {{so these are}} phonations of the <b>vowels</b> and not assimilation with consonant phonation.|$|R
5000|$|Salar <b>vowels</b> are as in Turkish, {{with the}} back <b>vowels</b> [...] and the {{corresponding}} front <b>vowels</b> [...]|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vowels</b> may be {{stressed}} or unstressed. Unstressed <b>vowels</b> are shorter and lower in intensity than stressed <b>vowels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great <b>Vowel</b> Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the <b>vowel</b> shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Classical Nahuatl {{and most}} of the modern {{varieties}} have fairly simple phonological systems. They allow only syllables with maximally one initial and one final consonant. Consonant clusters occur only word-medially and over syllable boundaries. Some morphemes have two alternating forms: one with a <b>vowel</b> i to prevent consonant clusters and one without it. For example, the absolutive suffix has the variant forms -tli (used after consonants) and -tl (used after vowels). Some modern varieties, however, have formed complex clusters from <b>vowel</b> loss. Others have contracted syllable sequences, causing accents to shift or vowels to become long.|$|E
5|$|If {{the only}} <b>vowel</b> {{in the word}} stem is , the suffixes will use the +ATR suffix forms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vowels</b> {{characters}} {{also come}} in two basic styles: circle <b>vowels,</b> and orienting <b>vowels.</b> <b>Vowels</b> have only a general shape and size, but their orientation and exact appearance are usually dictated by the adjacent characters.|$|R
50|$|Germanic {{languages}} have lax <b>vowels</b> generally only {{in closed}} syllables {{and so they}} are also called checked <b>vowels.</b> The tense <b>vowels</b> are called free <b>vowels,</b> as they often occur the end of a syllable.|$|R
