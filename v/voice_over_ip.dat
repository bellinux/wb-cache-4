Internet telephony utilizes the Internet medium to transfer audio between two or more clients in real time, thus allowing the clients to make conversations simultaneously on telephones. Converged voice and data using a packet based transport offers flexible, scalable, and cost efficient services. Emphasis is put on the efficient <b>voice</b> communication <b>over</b> the <b>IP</b> network so that Quality of Service (QoS) is maintained. Packet voice quality issues and strategies for minimizing the packet loss are described and implemented...|$|R

25|$|Digital {{switches}} work {{by connecting}} {{two or more}} digital circuits, according to a dialed telephone number or other instruction. Calls are set up between switches. In modern networks, this is usually controlled using the Signalling System 7 (SS7) protocol, or one of its variants.

To use a VoIP service, an individual only needs a user name for identification. In comparison, the {{public switched telephone network}} requires detailed information from a user before creating an account. The limited identity information requirement makes VoIP calls appealing to criminals. In addition, due to VoIP call encryption, conventional eavesdropping and wiretapping methods are ineffective. Forensic investigators thus require alternative methods for recovering evidence related to VoIP calls.

25|$|Modern {{personal}} computers have encouraged {{the use of}} digital modes such as radioteletype (RTTY) which previously required cumbersome mechanical equipment. Hams led the development of packet radio in the 1970s, which has employed protocols such as AX.25 and TCP/IP. Specialized digital modes such as PSK31 allow real-time, low-power communications on the shortwave bands. EchoLink using <b>Voice</b> <b>over</b> <b>IP</b> technology has enabled amateurs to communicate through local Internet-connected repeaters and radio nodes, while IRLP has allowed the linking of repeaters to provide greater coverage area. Automatic link establishment (ALE) has enabled continuous amateur radio networks to operate on the high frequency bands with global coverage. Other modes, such as FSK441 using software such as WSJT, are used for weak signal modes including meteor scatter and moonbounce communications.|$|E
