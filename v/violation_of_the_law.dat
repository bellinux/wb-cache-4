5|$|Two {{months into}} his term, Dow {{inadvertently}} ran afoul {{of his own}} prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge {{had no choice but}} to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{can be held}} in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E

25|$|The Center for Constitutional Rights and the Humanitarian Law Project took up {{a similar}} case {{challenging}} the AEDPA and the USA PATRIOT Act in 2003. In March 2004, Judge Audrey Collins enjoined the US Government from enforcing applicable sections of the USA Patriot Act against the plaintiffs; however, FeTNA was {{not covered by the}} ruling, because they did not provide the court with adequate details to prove that their proposed actions—doing cultural work in LTTE-occupied parts of Sri Lanka—would actually be in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} {{a great deal of}} {{discussion}} about the legality of the mutual housing program. This discussion was sparked by Charles Palmer, the Defense Housing Coordinator, during 1941, although there was never any clear statement of an actual legal problem related to the mutual housing program. On a number of occasions the Legal Counsel of the FWA and Westbrook were asked to defend the legality of the program. They announced that they could not find any <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> But the question itself, posed by the Defense Housing Coordinator, created a number of doubts among influential individuals who could have protected and encouraged the program, rather than watch it be dismantled.|$|E

25|$|The Congregation for Clergy {{explained}} that Lennon was given {{sufficient time to}} present information to solidify his decisions to the Dicastery, and to forward all of the acts pertinent in the matter to the Congregation. The absence of any decree from Lennon, indicating and formalizing his dispositions made in his March 12, 2009 letter to the pastor, troubled the judges. The Congregation for Clergy reasoned {{that even if the}} March 12, 2009 letter to the pastor was taken as a manifestation of Lennon's dispositions in the matter, which is the essence of a decree, the Congregation for Clergy clearly saw that it lacked elements required by the canons.

25|$|Leadership {{problems}} {{occurred in}} the firefighting division as well. By July 2005, both of the assistant chief positions and five of the 12 deputy chief positions were vacant and being filled by acting officers. City personnel rules limited an individual to just 120 days in an acting position, and placement in an acting capacity {{could not be used}} in lieu of training or evaluation. In February 2004, Assistant Chief Pete Miller — who oversaw support personnel for the building inspection division, facilities maintenance, firefighter training division, health and safety, and vehicular maintenance — retired. Thompson appointed Deputy Chief Kenneth B. Ellerbe to the position, and Ellerbe was still there more than 17 months (510 days) later in apparent <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, {{parents of}} Srirasmi Suwadee, {{formerly}} a Thai princess, were sentenced for “insulting {{the royal family}} and lodging a malicious claim.” In 2015, the Minister of Justice asked the French ambassador to help extradite Thais charged with lèse-majesté; however, the military government has never successfully extradited someone living abroad. In November 2015, Glyn T. Davies, the US ambassador to Thailand, was investigated for a speech criticizing long prison sentences handed to those who found guilty of lèse-majesté. Critics accuse the junta of harnessing the deep reverence that Thais have for the king to boost their own power. In 2016, Facebook blocked users in Thailand from accessing a page satirizing Thailand’s royal family, citing the lèse-majesté law. Around the same time, there was speculation that the junta was able to obtain private chat logs of Facebookers. In May 2017, the military junta stated that merely viewing material considered lèse-majesté would be a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Albert II of Germany in 1439 when {{defending}} Hungary against Turks, Mikolaj Szarlejski recognized opportunity to regain the land {{of his family and}} the Clan in Slovakia. Szarlejski tried to convince Hungarian Royal Council that family properties have been taken in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> However, Hungarian Lords and Royal Council in Hungary had no intention to give back all of the north defence to their enemy. Then in 1439 Szarlejski decided to raise army against Hungary. With help of the Hussite side, he succeeded to siege several strongholds in the Vah area. Supported by Jan de Jani of Ostoja, the Voivode of Pomerania and Gdańsk and several other powerful Lords from the Clan of Ostoja and with support of many friends, the war against Hungarian Empire and Germany was in the beginning successful. Unfortunately, Szarlejski although being in charge of Polish forces in Prussia, did not have any significant commanding talent and ironically, both Stibor of Stiboricz and his son Stibor Stiboric of Beckov made great improvements in the fortification of their Castles which made siege of many of them almost impossible. Beckov Castle would later hold siege from Turkish side about 100 years later. As result of that and because the enemy was to strong, military action failed.|$|E

500|$|The Church of Scientology sued Reader's Digest in Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany for {{publishing}} a condensed {{version of the}} Time story. The only court to provide a temporary injunction was in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The Church of Scientology subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the Digest in Lausanne, and Mike Rinder stated it was in blatant <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> By defying the Swiss court ban, the Reader's Digest risked a fine of about $3,400, as well as a potential three months' jail time for the Swiss Digest editor-in-chief. A hearing on the injunction was set for November 11, 1991, and the injunction was later lifted by the Swiss court.|$|E
