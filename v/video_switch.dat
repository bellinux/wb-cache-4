50|$|Before {{the mouse}} became {{relevant}} in server switching applications, the term Keyboard <b>Video</b> <b>Switch</b> (KVS) {{was used to}} describe keyboard and monitor switching devices. With the increased adoption of Microsoft Windows, the mouse and other I/O ports in peripheral switching became prevalent. Remigius Shatas, the founder of Cybex (a popular peripheral switch manufacturer at that time) expanded the initialism to Keyboard, Video and Mouse (KVM) in 1995. Some years later, Universal Serial Bus (USB) began to become the new industry standard for connecting computer peripherals.|$|E

The commercially developed module was making its third flight on the Shuttle and carried 20 experiments: 11 biotechnology experiments, three advanced materials development experiments, four technology demonstrations and {{two pieces of}} supporting hardware measuring on-orbit accelerations. Improvements {{had been made to}} the SPACEHAB system to reduce demand on crew time. A new <b>video</b> <b>switch</b> had been added to lessen the need for astronaut involvement in video operations, and an experiment interface had been added to the telemetry system to allow the experiment investigator to link directly via computer with the onboard experiment to receive data and monitor status. Charlotte, an experimental robotic device being flown for first time, also reduced crew workload by taking over simple tasks such as changing experiment samples.|$|E

The authors introduce a key technology which uses AD 8108 /AD 8109 as switching devices, micro-controller LPC 2214 ARM as the control unit {{to form a}} multi-channel <b>video</b> <b>switch.</b> Firstly, this paper analyzes the working principle of AD 8108 /AD 8109 and LPC 2214. Then the authors give the hardware structure of the multi-channel <b>video</b> <b>switch</b> system, and the software design of the system. Finally, this paper puts forward the key issues to the switch of the multi-channel video signal after experiments.

40|$|The Bates Linear Accelerator uses six 4 MW 2. 856 GHz RF {{transmitters}}. Phase drifts {{between the}} transmitters 12 klystrons of greater than 0. 5 degree or any amplitude drifts compromise beam delivery {{and are a}} common occurrence. Machine operators in years previous to the Phase and Amplitude Monitoring system "PAM" were unable to tell which klystron was affecting beam and resorted to shifting the phases of each klystron experimentally. The PAM system has proven itself as a viable monitor, easing phase re-adjustment. PAM is comprised of off-the-shelf RF amplitude and phase detectors, phase shifters, splitters, and VME hardware under EPICS. The detected signals are amplified and matrixed to the control room via an EPICS driven custom <b>video</b> <b>switch,</b> are sample/held, then digitized by a VME 12 bit ADC. Each of the 14 channels employ phase shifters and code that can auto zero the displayed phase. Phase drift is then apparent. Amplitude setpoints can also be auto zeroed with drift displayed as power deviations. To ensure repeatability to less than 0. 25 degree a continuous calibration sequencer is employed that {{has been shown to}} measure phase drift independent of amplitude shifts. Under investigation is the viability of 60 Hz sourced and slow phase feedback and correction. Comment: ICALEPCS 2001 conference paper and poster. 3 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{real-time}} telemedicine to support urgent care is growing. The {{primary focus of}} our work has been on improving the care provided to critically ill infants born at community hospitals {{who need to be}} transported to tertiary care centers for specialized neonatal treatment. Providing real-time effective communication between community physicians, transport teams, and specialists will lead to better decisions about where to transport patients, better patient care during transfers, and reduced time to proper treatment upon arrival at the receiving hospital. There are a number of challenges in implementing a system that meets these needs: creating a reliable high-bandwidth channel on a moving ambulance by aggregating unreliable low-bandwidth cellular channels, providing a user interface that can be easily and effectively used by physicians, and instrumenting the incubator in which the infants are transported. We have built a bi-directional near real-time video-conferencing system designed to facilitate better communication between physicians and transport teams. In addition to providing much higher-quality video than current mobile telemedicine applications, our application provides collaborative and domain-specific features not offered by a regular teleconferencing system: doctors and transport team members can save and email snapshots and video clips for further analysis and discussion, zoom in on different portions of the <b>video,</b> <b>switch</b> between several cameras for different views of the patient and a vitals signs monitor, and set the video transmission parameters (e. g., frame rate and latency). by Irene Fan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the EXPRESS (Expedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station) rack project {{is to provide a}} set of {{predefined}} interfaces for scientific payloads which allow rapid integration into a payload rack on International Space Station (ISS). VxWorks' was selected as the operating system for the rack and payload resource controller, primarily based on the proliferation of VME (Versa Module Eurocard) products. These products provide needed flexibility for future hardware upgrades to meet everchanging science research rack configuration requirements. On the International Space Station, there are multiple science research rack configurations, including: 1) Human Research Facility (HRF); 2) EXPRESS ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System); 3) WORF (Window Observational Research Facility); and 4) HHR (Habitat Holding Rack). The RIC (Rack Interface Controller) connects payloads to the ISS bus architecture for data transfer between the payload and ground control. The RIC is a general purpose embedded computer which supports multiple communication protocols, including fiber optic communication buses, Ethernet buses, EIA- 422, Mil-Std- 1553 buses, SMPTE (Society Motion Picture Television Engineers) - 170 M video, and audio interfaces to payloads and the ISS. As a cost saving and software reliability strategy, the Boeing Payload Software Organization developed reusable common software where appropriate. These reusable modules included a set of low-level driver software interfaces to 1553 B. RS 232, RS 422, Ethernet buses, HRDL (High Rate Data Link), <b>video</b> <b>switch</b> functionality, telemetry processing, and executive software hosted on the FUC computer. These drivers formed the basis for software development of the HRF, EXPRESS, EXPRESS ARIS, WORF, and HHR RIC executable modules. The reusable RIC common software has provided extensive benefits, including: 1) Significant reduction in development flow time; 2) Minimal rework and maintenance; 3) Improved reliability; and 4) Overall reduction in software life cycle cost. Due to the limited number of crew hours available on ISS for science research, operational efficiency is a critical customer concern. The current method of upgrading RIC software is a time consuming process; thus, an improved methodology for uploading RIC software is currently under evaluation...|$|E

40|$|This memo {{outlines}} how RTP {{sessions are}} synchronised, and discusses how rapidly such synchronisation can occur. We {{show that most}} RTP sessions can be synchronised mmediately, but {{that the use of}} <b>video</b> <b>switching</b> multipoint conference units (MCUs) or large source-specific multicast (SSM) groups can greatly increase the synchronisation delay. This increase in delay can be unacceptable to some applications that use layered and/or multi-description codecs. This memo introduces three mechanisms to reduce the synchronisation delay for such sessions. First, it updates the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) timing rules to reduce the initial synchronisation delay for SSM sessions. Second, a new feedback packet is defined for use with the extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback (RTP/AVPF), allowing <b>video</b> <b>switching</b> MCUs to rapidly request resynchronisation. Finally, new RTP header extensions are defined to allow rapid synchronisation of late joiners, and guarantee correct timestamp-based decoding order recovery for layered codecs in the presence of clock skew. </p...|$|R
