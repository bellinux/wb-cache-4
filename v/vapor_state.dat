50|$|Advection: The {{movement}} of water — in solid, liquid, or <b>vapor</b> <b>states</b> — through the atmosphere. Without advection, water that evaporated over the oceans could not precipitate over land.|$|R
50|$|Many {{thermodynamic}} cycles {{are made}} up of varying processes, some which maintain a constant volume and some which do not.

50|$|Organic {{peroxides}} {{may be in}} {{the solid}} or liquid state. There are no organic peroxides in the <b>vapor</b> <b>state.</b> Occasionally liquid organic peroxides are desensitized by mixing with solid materials so that the mixture behaves as if it is a solid.|$|E
50|$|The {{saturation}} vapor {{curve is}} the curve separating the two-phase {{state and the}} superheated <b>vapor</b> <b>state</b> in the T-s diagram. The saturated liquid curve is the curve separating the subcooled liquid state and the two-phase state in the T-s diagram.|$|E

This book is divided into 14 chapters. The first four chapters provide background information and general principles applicable to all types of calorimetry of non-reacting systems.

50|$|On a {{molecular}} level, {{there is no}} strict boundary between the liquid state and the <b>vapor</b> <b>state.</b> Instead, there is a Knudsen layer, where the phase is undetermined.

40|$|MIPROPS {{is a set}} of {{programs}} which gives the thermophysical and transport properties of selected fluids. Although these programs are written in FORTRAN 77 for implementation on microcomputers, they are direct translations of interactive FORTRAN IV programs which were originally developed for large mainframes. MIPROPS calculates the properties of fluids in both the liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>states</b> over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The fluids included are: helium, parahydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, nitrogen trifluoride, methane, ethylene, ethane, propane, and iso- and normal butane. All of the programs except for the helium program utilize the same mathematical model of the equation of state. A separate program was necessary for helium, as the model for the helium thermodynamic surface is of a different form. The input variables are any two of pressure, density, or temperature for the single phase regions, and either pressure or temperature for the saturated liquid or <b>vapor</b> <b>states.</b> The output is pressure, density, temperature, internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, specific heat capacities, and speed of sound. In addition, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and dielectric constants are calculated for most of the fluids. The user can select either a single point or a table of output values for a specified temperature range, and can display the data either in engineering or metric units. This machine independent FORTRAN 77 program was implemented on an IBM PC XT with an MS-DOS 3. 21 operating system. It has a memory requirement of approximately 100 K. The program was developed in 1986...|$|R
40|$|A new {{atmospheric}} humidity variable called the modified relative humidity (MRH) is proposed based on {{properties of the}} Johnson’s SB distribution function. The frequency distribution of MRH can be roughly approximated by the normal distribution, while other variables such as relative humidity and the water vapor mixing ratio cannot. This characteristic suggests that MRH is convenient for statistical variable controls such as data assimilation and climatological grid data controls. Super-saturation and negative water <b>vapor</b> <b>states</b> induced by positive and negative humidity increments are avoided by using MRH. Three types of MRH, Types-I, -II, and -III, were examined. Type-III, with three fixed parameters, was the best function for approximating to the normal distribution. However, Types-I and -II, each with two fixed parameters, were beneficial for stable statistical humidity variable estimations...|$|R
50|$|Cavitation is the {{formation}} of a void, such as a bubble, within a liquid. A fluid passes from a liquid state to a <b>vapor</b> <b>state</b> due to a change in the local pressure while the temperature remains constant. In the case of a dam spillway, this can be caused by turbulence or vortices in flowing water.|$|E
5000|$|Condensed aerosol fire {{suppression}} is a particle-based form of fire extinction similar to gaseous {{fire suppression}} or dry chemical fire extinction. The aerosol employs a {{fire extinguishing agent}} consisting of very fine solid particles and gaseous matter to extinguish fires. The condensed aerosol microparticles and effluent gases are generated by the exothermic reaction; until discharged from the device, the particles remain in <b>vapor</b> <b>state.</b> They are cooled and [...] "condensed" [...] within the device and discharged as solid particles.|$|E
50|$|As {{the piston}} is pushed inward, it uncovers exhaust ports in the {{cylinder}} wall. The supercritical water has now given up enough energy through expansion {{that it is}} in a <b>vapor</b> <b>state.</b> This exhaust vapor passes out of the exhaust ports in the cylinder wall and across regenerative heating coils, which are wrapped around the cylinder. The heat from the exhaust vapor is used to preheat the water in these tubes before it enters the steam generator. The vapor then passes into the condenser.|$|E
50|$|A {{saturation}} dome {{uses the}} projection of a P-v-T diagram (pressure, specific volume, and temperature) onto the P-v plane. This gives a P-v diagram at a constant temperature. The points that create the left-hand side of the dome represent the saturated liquid states, while the points {{on the right-hand side}} represent the saturated <b>vapor</b> <b>states</b> (commonly referred to as the “dry” region). On the left-hand side of the dome there is compressed liquid and on the right-hand side there is superheated gas.Within the dome itself, there is a liquid-vapor mixture. This two-phase region is commonly referred to as the “wet” region. The percentage of liquid and vapor can be calculated using vapor quality. The triple state line is where the three phases (solid, liquid, and vapor) exist in equilibrium.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{information}} on the chemical composition of cometary snows can be inferred from the distance r(0) between sublimating states in the cometary nucleus. Consideration is given to three techniques for measuring r(0) : estimation of the dependence on distance of non-gravitational forces (NGF); estimation of the dependence on distance of molecular emissions; and (3), analysis of the cometary light curve. The dependence on distance of the NGFs suggests that the observed sublimations of short-period coments are determined by water snow. Light curves of newly discovered comets appear to confirm this result. The large production rates of H and OH in cometary atmospheres suggest that they are due to dissociation of H 2 O in the <b>vapor</b> <b>states.</b> Estimates of r(0) for eleven different comets are given in a table...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an extension of}} the Bell−Salt lattice model of water to the study of water confined in a slit pore. Wall−fluid interactions are chosen to be qualitatively representative of water interacting with a graphite surface. We have calculated the bulk vapor−liquid phase coexistence for the model through direct Monte Carlo simulations of the vapor−liquid interface. Adsorption and desorption isotherms in the slit pore were calculated using grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, the thermodynamic conditions of vapor−liquid equilibrium for the confined fluid were determined. Our results are consistent with recent calculations for off-lattice models of confined water that show metastable <b>vapor</b> <b>states</b> of confined water persisting beyond the bulk saturation conditions, except for the narrowest pores. The results are similarly consistent with recent experiments on water adsorption in graphitized carbon black...|$|R
50|$|A {{low-temperature}} separator is {{a special}} one in which high-pressure well fluid is jetted into the vessel through a choke or pressure reducing valve so that the separator temperature is reduced appreciably below the well-fluid temperature. The temperature reduction is obtained by the Joule-Thomson effect of expanding well fluid as it flows through the pressure-reducing choke or valve into the separator. The lower operating temperature in the separator causes condensation of vapors that otherwise would exit the separator in the <b>vapor</b> <b>state.</b> Liquids thus recovered require stabilization to prevent excessive evaporation in the storage tanks.|$|E
5000|$|Johansen's {{model is}} more complex than Mackay's model. It {{considers}} particles to be in one of three states: at the surface, entrained in the water column or evaporated. The empirically based model uses probabilistic variables to determine where the dispersant will move and where it will go after it breaks up oil slicks. The drift of each particle is determined by the state of that particle; this means that a particle in the <b>vapor</b> <b>state</b> will travel much further than a particle on the surface (or under the surface) of the ocean. This model improves on Mackay's model in several key areas, including terms for: ...|$|E
5000|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) {{are described as}} organic chemicals, some of which occur naturally in oil and gas, that have high vapor pressure at ordinary room temperature. As a result, these chemicals exhibit an ease of transition from the liquid to the <b>vapor</b> <b>state</b> under atmospheric (ambient) conditions. In general chemistry terms, VOCs are organic molecules with low molecular weights, boiling points below 200 ˚C, and low to medium solubility in water. The EPA defines VOC’s as, “Any compound of carbon, excluding carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates and ammonium carbonate, which participates is atmospheric photochemical reactions, except those designated by the EPA as having negligible photochemical reactivity.” ...|$|E

40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{numerical}} investigation of structural {{order in the}} shifted-force Lennard-Jones system by calculating metrics of translational and bond-orientational order along various paths in the phase diagram covering equilibrium solid, liquid, and <b>vapor</b> <b>states.</b> A series of non-equilibrium configurations generated through isochoric quenches, isothermal compressions, and energy minimizations are also considered. Simulation results are analyzed using an ordering map representation [Torquato et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2064 (2000); Truskett et al., Phys. Rev. E 62, 993 (2000) ] that assigns to both equilibrium and non-equilibrium states coordinates in an order metric plane. Our results show that bond-orientational order and translational order are not independent for simple spherically symmetric systems at equilibrium. We also demonstrate quantitatively that the Lennard-Jones and hard sphere systems sample the same configuration space at supercritical densities. Finally, we relate the structural order found in fast-quenched and minimum-energy configurations (inherent structures). Comment: 35 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
50|$|A {{saturation}} {{state is the}} point where a phase change begins or ends. For example, the saturated liquid line represents the point where any further addition of energy will cause {{a small portion of}} the liquid to convert to vapor. Likewise, along the saturated vapor line, any removal of energy will cause some of the vapor to condense back into a liquid, producing a mixture. When a substance reaches the saturated liquid line it is commonly said to be at its boiling point. The temperature will remain constant while it is at constant pressure underneath the saturation dome (boiling water stays at a constant of 212F) until it reaches the saturated vapor line. This line is where the mixture has converted completely to vapor. Further heating of the saturated vapor will result in a superheated <b>vapor</b> <b>state.</b> This is because the vapor will be at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature (212F for water) for a given pressure.|$|E
50|$|One-dimensional {{crystalline}} nanowires {{are then}} grown by a liquid metal-alloy droplet-catalyzed chemical or {{physical vapor deposition}} process, which {{takes place in a}} vacuum deposition system. Au-Si droplets {{on the surface of the}} substrate act to lower the activation energy of normal vapor-solid growth. For example, Si can be deposited by means of a SiCl4:H2 gaseous mixture reaction (chemical vapor deposition), only at temperatures above 800 °C, in normal vapor-solid growth. Moreover, below this temperature almost no Si is deposited on the growth surface. However, Au particles can form Au-Si eutectic droplets at temperatures above 363 °C and adsorb Si from the <b>vapor</b> <b>state</b> (because Au can form a solid-solution with all Si concentrations up to 100%) until reaching a supersaturated state of Si in Au. Furthermore, nanosized Au-Si droplets have much lower melting points (ref) because the surface area-to-volume ratio is increasing, becoming energetically unfavorable, and nanometer-sized particles act to minimize their surface energy by forming droplets (spheres or half-spheres).|$|E
5000|$|The {{process begins}} with the {{incomplete}} combustion of fuel in the attached appliance, usually a wood or coal stove, or open fire. The unburned volatiles are heated to the <b>vapor</b> <b>state</b> but not consumed {{due to a lack}} of adequate heat and oxygen within the appliance. These volatile distillates escape into the chimney, where they contact cooler surfaces and condense into tar-like deposits, and soot. Successive layers accumulate until either the chimney plugs completely, or the chimney reaches a temperature and oxygen level at which the deposit will ignite. Due to the concentrated level of volatile material now present, these fires tend to burn very hot. [...] Alternatively, a chimney fire may be caused by old bird's nests which have fallen into the chimney and lodged there. When a hot ember ignites the nests, the fire can be just as serious as one caused by ignition of soot. In very old houses, the chimney may also be very large and thick enough to withstand the fire.|$|E
40|$|Mercury is a {{chemical}} element considered unessential to any metabolic process; however, it is easily accumulated in most organisms. It is naturally found in both organic and inorganic forms in solid, liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>states.</b> Its biogeochemical cycle involves processes {{occurring in the}} soil, water and the atmosphere. In 2002, elementary mercury {{was found in the}} city of Descoberto, Minas Gerais, Brazil, where 70 families live, and its origin may be related to gold exploration that happened in this region in the 19 (th) century. In this work, three areas were chosen to identify a possible mercury contamination of water, soil, sediment and fish samples and to establish local reference values and counter-evidence of the data previously obtained. Based on the results, high mercury concentrations in soil (0. 26 to 0. 55 mg. kg(- 1)), sediments (0. 13 to 0. 61 mg. kg(- 1)) and water (< 0. 2 to 2, 10 mu g. L(- 1)) were verified...|$|R

Liquid-vapor surface tension measurements both Submitted to y Permanent address: Physics Dept., San Jose State University, San Jose, Calf. 95192 with and without a gravitational field are in agreement with experimental values for simple substances. These measurements are also consistent with the van der Waals theory using the measured interface density profile though the theory does not explicitly account for the work required to form the density gradient in the interface for the reference hard sphere system. The mean field van der Waals (vdW) model has been popular because it is simple enough to be rigorously derivable from statistical mechanics, yet realistic enough to capture both the liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>states</b> of matter, as well as predict the coexistence region [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Biological ion {{channels}} are nanoscale transmembrane pores. When water and ions are enclosed within the narrow {{confines of a}} sub-nanometer hydrophobic pore, they exhibit behavior not evident from macroscopic descriptions. At this nanoscopic level, the unfavorable interaction between the lining of a hydrophobic pore and water may lead to stochastic liquid-vapor transitions. These transient <b>vapor</b> <b>states</b> are "dewetted", i. e. effectively devoid of water molecules within {{all or part of}} the pore, thus leading to an energetic barrier to ion conduction. This process, termed "hydrophobic gating", was first observed in molecular dynamics simulations of model nanopores, where the principles underlying hydrophobic gating (i. e., changes in diameter, polarity, or transmembrane voltage) have now been extensively validated. Computational, structural, and functional studies now indicate that biological ion channels may also exploit hydrophobic gating to regulate ion flow within their pores. Here we review the evidence for this process and propose that this unusual behavior of water represents an increasingly important element in understanding the relationship between ion channel structure and function...|$|R
