40|$|Abstract]: This {{project is}} to build a wall {{climbing}} robot. This robot is a suction type of wall climbing robot; using PIC to do the interfacing, control the movement of the robot, ventilation fan and the sensors. The position sensors are used to sense any things blocking its path while it is climbing up, therefore it can be rotated left, right, up and down. The on-board pump has been replaced by computer fan which will lower the cost as well as the weight of the original product. The cost of building this robot must be cheaper than the commercial robots. BACKGROUND In all suction adhesion robot that are used for wall climbing robot, they used onboard pump that created a pressure drop inside the vacuum cups that are pressed against the wall or ceiling. As the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> are pressed against the wall, the on board pump will start to pump the air in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> out to the surrounding. After some time, the pressure inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> is lower than that outside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> thus it is able to “stick” onto the wall. This type of wall climbing robot requires a smooth and flat vertical surface, therefore if there is a crack in the wall or the vertical surface is uneven, it will not work. Another problem of this type of robot is that it is much slower than other types of wall climbing robot, as it needs time to build up the required pressure to hold itself on to the wall. The suction adhesion robots are normally used on valley bridges and the temperature could be around 0 to 50 degree Celsius. As for the weight, this type of robot should not be more than 35 kg, thus the body of this robot should be make of non metallic material. The centre of gravity of the robot must be kept as close as to the vertical surface as possible, as the force required to hold the whole weight of the robot will be reduced. Although this kind of robot is normally used to do the cleaning for high buildings and under high way bridges, this will in turn replace human beings thus reducing the accident rate. This will further increase the human being rate of living...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} use of a balloon {{catheter}} device with {{the use of}} a cervical <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> device in performing hysterosalpingography (HSG). Design Prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. Setting Tertiary infertility center. Patient(s) Two hundred twenty-nine infertile women undergoing HSG. Intervention(s) Subjects were randomized to undergo HSG using a cervical <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> (n = 115) or a balloon catheter (n = 114). Randomization was performed according to Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Main Outcome Measure(s) The degree of pain experienced during and after the HSG, evaluated using a 100 -mm visual analogue scale. The length of the procedure, the fluoroscopic time, the volume of contrast used, the difficulty of performing HSG, and the percentage of complications were also evaluated. Result(s) Women in the cervical-cup group experienced more pain than those in the balloon catheter group during the contrast injection (median visual analogue scale pain scores, 13. 0 vs. 6. 5). The placement of the balloon catheter in comparison with the cervical cup was slightly easier to perform, although it required a somewhat longer time. The HSG using the cervical cup required less fluoroscopic time (median, 0. 6 vs. 0. 8 min). Conclusion(s) The balloon catheter appears to be better tolerated than the cervical cup, but the difference is minimal.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether sonohysterography (SHG) {{should be performed}} with Plexiglas hysterosalpingographic vacuum cups instead of standard catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective setting, 226 women randomly classified into 2 groups underwent SHG. The method used for cervical cannulation was a two-way catheter in the first group (n = 108) and a Plexiglas hysterosalpingographic <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> in the second one (n = 118). Diagnostic reliability, easy applicability for the physician, discomfort for the patients and cost of the instruments were assessed for both devices. RESULTS: 226 / 226 (100 %) complete sonohysterographic examinations were performed. As regards uterine cavity distension the same diagnostic reliability was reported for vacuum cups and two-way catheters. The standard catheter obscured the cervical canal because of the dilation of the balloon. Both methods were judged as easy to use, and {{no statistically significant difference}} was found as far as the time required for cervical cannulation (p 0. 05). A little more discomfort was recorded by women who underwent sonohysterography with standard balloon catheters but a greater interpersonal variability was noticed in this group (SD 3. 65 vs. 1. 13 in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup</b> group). Vacuum cups were by far the most economical devices (unit cost: 16. 70 euro vs. catheter unit cost 46. 20 euro). CONCLUSION: Vacuum cups allow sonohysterography to be correctly performed. As they are inexpensive, easy to use, better tolerated by the patients and more helpful for visualisation of the lower third of the uterine cavity, vacuum cups should be considered a serious alternative to standard catheters in the performance of SHG...|$|E

However, the lateral thighs have not been easily treated because fat from this area cannot be easily drawn into a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup.</b> Objectives: The authors investigated the safety and efficacy of a prototype applicator for treatment of “nonpinchable ” fat in the lateral thighs. Methods: In this prospective, nonrandomized, interventional cohort, multicenter study, a 120 -minute unilateral treatment with a prototype conformable-surface applicator was performed on 1 lateral thigh of 40 patients, with the contralateral thigh serving as the control. During follow-up visits at 2 and 4 months, fat reduction was assessed by ultrasound imaging and clinical photography, and patient satisfaction surveys were completed.

40|$|There {{are many}} cases {{when it would}} be {{beneficial}} to provide reliable, reversible adhesion at a tissue-device interface. There are currently many adhesion mechanisms used during surgical procedures such as graspers, <b>vacuum</b> <b>cups</b> and hooks. However, these are known to cause some scale of tissue trauma. This thesis investigates the viability of using a bio-inspired, structured polymer surfaces to provide wet adhesion forces through the formation of liquid bridges on the tip of discrete pillars. The mechanism described involves a contribution from both Stefan forces and capillary forces to provide the total adhesion force. A main factor to this work is the ability to successfully, repeatedly and reliably fabricate polymer surfaces at a micron scale with varying geometry, specifically in terms of pillar spacing. The substrate should be flexible and have the ability to tune the wettability. A number of lithography techniques have been explored for a range of polymers, finally settling on a nano-imprint lithography technique with Poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as the polymer. Experimental adhesion tests have been performed and it has been found, that for such an adhesion mechanism to be successful, an optimal contact angle must be reached. If the contact angle is too high, repulsive forces in convex menisci will form and the adhesion will be low as a result. If the contact angle is too low, the capillary length : pillar height ratio results in the surface acting super-hydrophobic and completely wetting the pillars, preventing the formation of liquid bridges, and again resulting in low adhesion, it is proposed that such a mechanism would occur at contact angles lower than 50 °. A mathematical model has been investigated, encompassing both the Stefan and adhesion forces and the limitations of this have been discussed in relation to the complexity of this system...|$|R

40|$|A {{vacuum gripper}} {{is used to}} lift hard, flat objects such as boards, doors and metal discs. The gripper {{reviewed}} in particular {{can be viewed as}} a beam construction consisting of three parallel beams combined with a fourth beam orthogonal to the first three. On each end of the three parallel beams there is a <b>vacuum</b> <b>cup,</b> adding up to a total of six cups. The aim of this report was to analyze the strength of a ProWood Maxi with tilt by Lifts All AB made of steel with a yield strength of 355 MPa and to further develop it. The development process of the gripper aimed to produce a concept of a steering or warning system to prevent undesired tilts of the gripper to avoid injuries on the user as well as damages on the load. A requirement on the construction was an ability to be able to withstand a load of 200 kg. The project was restricted to only analyze the beam construction of the gripper with the main focus on the stresses and deformations. Calculations were performed including free body diagrams, force and torque equilibria as well as shear force and internal torque diagrams. Following this, computer analyses were done with the aim to find more realistic forces on the vacuum cups by letting those stay fixed and apply forces on the suspension devices corresponding to 200 kg. These forces were then used to analyze the stresses and deformations of the construction using ANSYS. For the concept of steering and warning system, strain gauges were placed on the beam construction. These gauges image the distribution of the load on the gripper and prevents usage if the load exceeds predefined critical values. The results of the analysis showed that the maximum stresses were about 50 MPa and that the maximum deformations in the steel construction ended up at 2. 3 mm. In conclusion, the total deformation of the steel construction is small compared to the deformation in the elastic vacuum cups. The steel construction will be able to hold a load of 200 kg with a safety factor of n= 7 considering the yield strength of the steel. It is also possible to enable a simple control system to prevent undesired tilting using strain gauges via a warning system, however using an active balance system would not be practical...|$|E
50|$|They {{are based}} on {{different}} physical effects used to guarantee a stable grasping between a gripper and the object to be grasped.Industrial grippers can be mechanical, the most diffused in industry, but also based on suction or on the magnetic force. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cups</b> and electromagnets dominate the automotive field and in particular metal sheet handling. Bernoulli grippers exploit the airflow between the gripper and the part that causes a lifting force which brings the gripper and part close each other (i.e. the Bernoulli's principle). Bernoulli grippers are a type of contactless grippers, namely the object remains confined in the force field generated by the gripper without coming into direct contact with it. Bernoulli grippers have been adopted in photovoltaic cell handling, silicon wafer handling, {{and also in the}} textile and leather industries.Other principles are less used at the macro scale (part size >5mm), but {{in the last ten years}} they demonstrated interesting applications in micro-handling. Some of them are ready of spreading out their original field. The other adopted principles are: Electrostatic grippers and van der Waals grippers based on electrostatic charges (i.e. van der Waals' force), capillary grippers and cryogenic grippers, based on liquid medium, and ultrasonic grippers and laser grippers, two contactless grasping principles. Electrostatic grippers {{are based on}} charge difference between the gripper and the part (i.e. electrostatic force) often activated by the gripper itself, while van der Waals grippers are based on the low force (still electrostatic) due to the atomic attraction between the molecules of the gripper and those of the object.Capillary grippers use the surface tension of a liquid meniscus between the gripper and the part to center, align and grasp the part, cryogenic grippers freeze a small amount of liquid and the resulting ice guarantees the necessary force to lift and handle the object (this principle is used also in food handling and in textile grasping). Even more complex are ultrasonic based grippers, where pressure standing waves are used to lift up a part and trap it at a certain level (example of levitation are both at the micro level, in screw and gasket handling, and at the macro scale, in solar cell or silicon wafer handling), and laser source that produces a pressure able to trap and move microparts in a liquid medium (mainly cells). The laser gripper are known also as laser tweezers.|$|R

Some types of woodworking joints make use of separate internal reinforcements, such as dowels or biscuits, which in a sense can be considered fasteners within the scope of the joint system, although on their own they are not general purpose fasteners. Furniture supplied in flat-pack form often uses cam dowels locked by cam locks, also known as conformat fasteners. Fasteners {{can also be used to}} close a container such as a bag, a box, or an envelope; or they may involve keeping together the sides of an opening of flexible material, attaching a lid to a container, etc. There are also special-purpose closing devices, e.g. a bread clip.|$|R
40|$|Under the FAA Aging Aircraft Research Program we are {{developing}} robots to deploy conventional and, later, new-concept NDI sensors for commercial aircraft skin inspection. Our prototype robot, the Automated NonDestructive Inspector (ANDI), holds to the aircraft skin with <b>vacuum</b> assisted suction <b>cups,</b> scans an eddy current sensor, and translates across the aircraft skin via linear actuators. Color CCD video cameras {{will be used}} to align the robot with a series of rivets we wish to inspect using NDI inspection sensors. In a previous paper we provided a background scenario and described two different solutions to the alignment problem: a model-based system built around edge detection and a trainable neural network system. In this paper, we revisit the background and previous research and detail the first steps taken towards a method that will combine the neural and the model based systems: a neural edge detector. 1. 0 BACKGROUND 1. 1 Project Goals The initial goal of the Automated NonDestru [...] ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The risk of obstetric {{brachial plexus}} palsy (OBPP) is {{increased}} in infants delivered instrumentally. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify risk factors for OBPP and to evaluate the association between possible risk factors linked to the duration of the vacuum extraction procedure and the subsequent risk. METHODS: A population-based retrospective design was adopted. Using a national registry of operative vaginal deliveries linked to the Medical Birth Registry in Sweden, we evaluated by univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses the risk factors for OBPP in 13, 716 women delivered by vacuum extraction. The variables assessed in the multiple logistic regression analysis were shoulder dystocia, fetal birth weight of 3, 999 g or greater, fundal pressure, number of tractions, vacuum application time, parity, <b>vacuum</b> silicone <b>cup,</b> epidural anesthesia, and fetal head at the level of the ischial spines at vacuum application time. RESULTS: Obstetric brachial plexus palsy was recorded in 153 (1. 1 %) infants. The following variables increased significantly the risk of OBPP in the newborn: shoulder dystocia (odds ratio 16. 0; 95 % confidence interval 8. 9 - 28. 7), fetal birth weight of 3, 999 g or greater (7. 1; 4. 8 - 10. 5), and administration of fundal pressure (1. 6; 1. 1 - 2. 3). The probability of the risk of OBPP in vacuum-assisted deliveries increased in relation to vacuum extraction time (minutes). CONCLUSION: Shoulder dystocia in the setting of vacuum extraction is a prominent risk factor for OBPP in the newborn. The risk of OBPP increases with the time required for vacuum extraction.
