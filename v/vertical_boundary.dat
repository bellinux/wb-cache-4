5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a <b>vertical</b> <b>boundary</b> and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{transaction}} cost economics has become a popular theory within the construction research community. This approach has been singularly applied {{as a means to}} explain and predict phenomena concerning the construction firm, including its <b>vertical</b> <b>boundaries.</b> However, this is {{at a time when the}} chief proponents of transaction costs are urging researchers to take a pluralistic stance in relation to the theory of the firm.

Firms vertically integrate to create specific investment between stages of the value chain, to internally exploit their pool of knowledge and capacities, and to guarantee quality of inputs and services employed. On the other hand, firms avoid high levels of vertical integration in the presence of high demand changes in order to stay flexible.

The study finds that the quantitative model provides strong support for the Transaction Cost Economics theory, while the qualitative method lends strong support to the Measurement Cost and Resource Based View theories of vertical boundaries.

40|$|Essay 1 : An Examination of the Efficiency, Foreclosure, and Collusion Rationales for Vertical Takeovers We {{investigate}} the efficiency, foreclosure, and collusion rationales for vertical integration using a large sample of vertical takeovers. The efficiency rationale posits that vertical integration prevents future holdup between non-integrated suppliers and customers. In contrast, the foreclosure and collusion rationales suggest that vertical integration harms competition. To distinguish between these hypotheses, {{we examine the}} wealth effects of the merging firms, acquirer rivals, target rivals, and corporate customers on announcement of vertical takeovers. Our univariate and cross-sectional results suggest that firms alter their <b>vertical</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{in a manner that}} is consistent with the efficiency rationale. Our tests do not find evidence supportive of the anti-competitive rationales for vertical integration. Essay 2 : Determinants of Firm <b>Vertical</b> <b>Boundaries</b> and Implications for Internal Capital Markets In this paper, we {{investigate the}} determinants of vertical relatedness between business segments of multi-segment firms and how vertical relatedness affects the internal allocation of capital. Consistent with theory, we observe a higher degree of vertical relatedness between segments in environments likely to involve contracting problems. Further, there is a greater tendency for investments to flow towards segments with better investment opportunities as the degree of vertical relatedness between business segments in the firm increases. This indicates that internal capital markets function better in the presence of significant vertical relatedness between segments. This finding supports the Stein (1997) model, which suggests that the headquarters is able to do a better job of “winner-picking” when firms operate in related lines of businesses...|$|R
40|$|Results {{of direct}} {{numerical}} simulations are presented for the transient and turbulent natural convection cooling of an initially isothermal quiescent liquid metal {{placed in a}} vertical cylinder {{in the presence of}} a vertical magnetic field. The electrically conductive low-Prandtl number fluid is put to motion when the cylindrical wall is suddenly cooled to a uniform lower temperature. For this particular cooling process, the flow is characterized by three sequential almost discrete stages: (a) development of momentum and thermal boundary layers along the cylindrical cold wall, (b) intrusion of the cooled fluid into the main fluid body, and (c) flow and thermal stratification. The selected Rayleigh numbers in the present study are high enough so that turbulent convection is established. The numerical results show that the magnetic field has no observable effect at the initial stage of the <b>vertical</b> <b>boundary</b> layer development and conduction heat transfer is favored during the intrusion stage. An interesting effect of the magnetic field during the stratification stage is the deceleration of the cooling process for low Rayleigh numbers and its acceleration for high ones. This dependence of the magnetic field effect on the Rayleigh number was found to be related to the cold vortices emanating from the <b>vertical</b> <b>boundary</b> layer. In contrast with the hydrodynamic cooling, the magnetic field was also found to accelerate the cooling near the bottom of the cylinder...|$|E
