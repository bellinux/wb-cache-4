40|$|Abstract: Sydney Harbour Bridge {{is a key}} {{transport}} infrastructure that connects North Sydney and Sydney Central Business District (CBD). To alleviate the congestion on Sydney Harbour Bridge, NSW Roads and Maritime Services imposes a time of day tolling between $ 2. 5 and $ 4 on the southbound traffic to Sydney CBD. This study develops mathematical models for formulating the toll pricing problem on Sydney Harbour Bridge considering that different travellers may have different <b>value-of-times</b> (VOTs). The models examine quantitatively the effect of different toll levels on the efficiency (in terms of the total generalized travel time and generalized travel cost of all travellers) and equity (in terms of the ratio of generalized travel cost among different traveller classes).

In this paper, we discuss the computation of this measure {{in the case of}} discrete choice models allowing for random taste heterogeneity. We first present the theoretical assumptions associated with models using randomly distributed travel-time coefficients, and highlight several important issues that must not be neglected when such an approach is adopted in practice. We then look in detail at the issue of models producing a non-zero probability of positive travel-time coefficients, and discuss the consistency of such estimates with theories of rational economic behaviour. We note that by using an unbounded statistical distribution, positive travel-time coefficients are postulated a priori by the researcher, rather than being revealed by the data. We then illustrate how to compute the <b>value-of-time</b> from randomly distributed travel-time coefficients, using various experiments. Finally, we present a simple application to illustrate some concrete difficulties associated with estimating such models. Our results show that the model providing th...|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} {{of demand for}} priced highway lanes is becoming increasingly important to agencies seeking to improve mobility and find alternative revenue sources {{for the provision of}} transportation infrastructure.

40|$|Heterogeneity is {{important}} in some settings. One such instance involves congested networks with tolls, since people trade time for money at different rates. This paper reports results from two experiments that examine these issues. In both experiments, subjects choose between traveling on an indirect route that does not congest and a direct toll route that congests as more subjects travel on it. In the first experiment, values of time are assigned to subjects. Subjects generally sort themselves with high <b>value-of-time</b> subjects choosing the toll route. I also find that {{as the cost of}} deviating from the equilibrium prediction increases, subjects are more likely to make choices consistent with equilibrium. In other words, coordination problems diminish as <b>value-of-time</b> heterogeneity increases. The second experiment simulates a boring commute in which subjects must wait after the experimental rounds are finished. Subjects can give up money for reduced waiting time in this experiment by traveling on the toll route. In this experiment, some subjects travel the toll route frequently, giving up some of their payout in order to reduce their waiting time after the experiment. These choices are likely based on individuals’ values of time, since aggregate behavior differs by session. There is also evidence that subjects with time constraints travel the toll route more often than other subjects...|$|E

The efficiency loss and the road capacity and/or toll set by a monopolist are investigated under different kinds of government regulatory regimes.

Each group has a distinct group-specific demand function to characterize its trip rates. Users are assumed to minimize their individual generalized cost, thus they choose routes on the basis of travel time and monetary cost. With this explicit consideration of user heterogeneity, various possibilities of profitability and welfare gain of a private toll road in a given network under various combinations of road capacity and toll charge are presented.

Although the shortest handling time - and costs - are noted for the business-as-is scenario, the introduction of a UCC is assessed as the most sustainable cost-efficient alternative concept. Despite the additional handling resources that are needed, the cost-efficiency level could be very high if the initiative attracted a lot of attention, many stakeholders were involved and if there was an effective roll-out of this new model. This could lead to impressive cost savings which actually constitutes an assumption for this case study. Tethering is also assessed very positively as an economically sustainable concept. That is because the transport costs (as part of the logistics costs) are the ones which are mostly affected by transport decisions [40].|$|E

In this research, state-of-the-art econometric models are developed within a methodological framework that allows for the estimation of the VOT. Ordered and binary discrete choice models have been developed. Furthermore, a mixed effects model that accounts for the unobserved heterogeneity across different individuals has also been specified. The models have been applied to short intercity trips between two medium-size cities (Agrinio and Patras) in Greece. The model specification combines trip-based characteristics (mode, travel time, and travel cost), with socioeconomic characteristics, such as profession, education, and car ownership.

The focus of this paper is on ex post analyses carried out with five case studies in larger infrastructure projects to assess the economic profitability actually occurring from new infrastructure.

40|$|The {{presence}} of distortive taxation and agglomeration {{benefits in the}} labour market means that there are benefits and losses not captured by standard cost-benefit analyses of transport policy measures. Recent theoretical analyses have raised concerns that the labour market effects of congestion charges may constitute considerable losses {{in the form of}} reduced aggregate labour income, over and above what is captured by the consumer surplus in the standard analysis of congestion charges 9 ̆ 6 possibly to the extent that congestion charges may reduce aggregate social welfare, contrary to conventional wisdom in transport economics. The sign and size of these effects are an empirical question, however. We investigate this issue by estimating the labour income effects of the Stockholm congestion charges, using an estimated relationship between workplace accessibility and labour income. Results show positive effects on labour income, meaning that the 9 ̆ 3 wider economic benefits 9 ̆ 4 of this system are in fact benefits, not losses.

40|$|Accessibility in {{transport}} policy documents is usually measured through partial indicators such as road speeds, traffic queues or train fares. In the literature, more advanced indicators are found, based on e. g. market potential or utility-based methods. This paper presents a generalised transport costs indicator for policy making which incorporates financial costs, travel times, {{and reliability of}} travel times. It calculates the average costs per kilometre of trips by transport mode, trip purpose, trip distance, region and time-of-day. A case study for the Netherlands shows that generalised transport costs by private car rose by 6 % between 2000 and 2007. The main causes were increasing fuel costs and values-of-time. Average travel speed has increased despite more congestion on the trunk road network. Generalised costs of train trips have also risen by about 6 %, because {{of an increase in}} train fare prices and the <b>value-of-time.</b> The time costs have, however, been reduced by improved reliability. Long-term scenarios without new policies also show an increase in generalised costs, both for cars and trains.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{constructing}} confidence set estimates for parameter ratios arises {{in a variety}} of econometrics contexts; these include <b>value-of-time</b> estimation in transportation research and inference on elasticities given several model specifications. Even when the model under consideration is identifiable, parameter ratios involve a possibly discontinuous parameter transformation that becomes ill-behaved as the denominator parameter approaches zero. More precisely, the parameter ratio is not identified over the whole parameter space: it is locally almost unidentified or (equivalently) weakly identified over a subset of the parameter space. It is well known that such situations can strongly affect the distributions of estimators and test statistics, leading to the failure of standard asymptotic approximations, as shown by Dufour. Here, we provide explicit solutions for projection-based simultaneous confidence sets for ratios of parameters when the joint confidence set is obtained through a generalized Fieller approach. A simulation study for a ratio of slope parameters in a simple binary probit model shows that the coverage rate of the Fieller's confidence interval is immune to weak identification whereas the confidence interval based on the delta-method performs poorly, even when the sample size is large. The procedures are examined in illustrative empirical models, with a focus on choice modelsconfidence interval; generalized Fieller's theorem; delta-method; weak identification; ratio of parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{methodology}} {{is developed}} {{in order to}} assess the viability of transport infrastructure investment in the form of High Speed Rail (HSR). Public transportation mode operators such as HSR, conventional trains and buses, maximize their profits by varying prices and frequency for a given demand and infrastructure cost.

Hypothetical data for a particular route is used for game-based analysis. In this multiplayer game, the effect of introducing the new mode of transport on the Nash equilibrium is studied taking into account the competition between the other modes of transportation. The analysis of market share for the modes has been carried out using heterogeneity of the passengers based on the concept of <b>Value-of-Time</b> (VOT). The passengers are assumed to be intelligent and rational in choosing the mode that minimizes their generalized travel cost, which is a function of travel time weighted by the individual VOT and the monetary cost associated with the mode of travel. Thus, different combinations of entry and response strategies are studied for HSR and existing modes, and the impact of introduction of HSR is assessed in terms of profit, thus, reflecting on the sustainability and financial viability of the transport infrastructure investment...|$|E

In transportation research, for example, tens of thousands stated their choices between alternatives characterized by cost and time attributes. In this study I explore {{the extent to which}} the data acquired in such studies may exhibit the co-occurrence of different choice algorithms within such survey populations. For that purpose I propose a novel version of the outcome-oriented approach. It is applied to the outcomes of two Dutch <b>value-of-time</b> surveys. If the recorded choice patterns are viewed apart, most could be the result of several different algorithms, in line with the main criticism of the outcome-oriented approach. The novel version considers the causal relationships between an individual’s personal circumstances, his use of a particular algorithm and the resulting choice pattern. It employs inferential statistics for analyses of the frequencies of the expected and actually recorded choice patterns within groups of respondents. Applied to the Dutch survey results this allowed disentangling, at the aggregate level, the overlap in explaining compensatory and non-compensatory algorithms to a large extent. It revealed that weighted additive (WADD) algorithms incorporating different degrees of loss aversion could explain most recorded choice behaviour while none of the many non-compensatory algorithms that were considered yielded a more than marginal explanation. Replications of this study, preferably by re-analysing other large-scale surveys with more complicated choice sets, is recommended to find out whether or not these findings are incidental. % defined WAD...|$|E
40|$|Private roads {{competition}} {{is one of}} the important issues under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme. When two or more competing firms operate multiple toll roads, their profits are interrelated due to demand inter-dependence and each firm must consider what its competitors' choices are likely to be. The main task of this dissertation is to develop game-theoretic approaches {{to the study of the}} road network that involves multiple toll roads operated by competitive private firms. The strategic interactions and market equilibria among the private firms are analyzed in determining their supply or price or both over the network. Furthermore, exact bounds are established for the efficiency loss of private road competition in some simplified or special cases. First, the effects of oligopolistic equilibria are examined on a network of parallel roads. The inefficiency is bounded by considering general demand and cost functions. As a supplement, both toll and capacity competition among private asymmetric roads is also considered; next, the case of fixed OD demand with continuously distributed <b>value-of-time</b> is investigated. The efficiency loss is discussed under different kinds of regimes and the construction capacity set by a monopolist is considered as well as the toll charge. A rate-of-return (ROR) regulation which may have attractive advantages is suggested for the regulatory authority; for further extension of previous work, the problems are examined in a context of general traffic networks. The study shows that generally private pricing and competition can be both profitable and welfare-improving. Investigating the subgame perfect equilibrium in an oligopolistic freight market is another task of this dissertation. A partially non-cooperative game among shippers, carriers and infrastructure companies (IC) is modeled by a three-stage procedure. The study shows that the equilibrium flows can also maximize total system profits if the IC and the carrier both use vertically efficient nonlinear pricing schedules...|$|E
40|$|In San Diego, California, a value pricing {{project has}} been {{implemented}} {{in order to make}} better use of the existing reversible HOV-facility on Interstate 15, just north of San Diego. In this project, paying solo drivers are allowed to use the Express Lanes. These drivers experience the benefits of free-flow travel instead of the heavily congested traffic situations on the main lanes. The price for using the Express Lanes is determined dynamically and depends on the flow of traffic on these lanes. The objectives of the research presented in the report are: (1) to determine if the project has a congestion relieving effect for the main lanes, (2) how travelers decide between the different travel options in the 1 - 15 corridor. Using the available historical traffic data, changes in traffic conditions on the 1 - 15 main lanes were examined. The project {{does not seem to have}} a congestion relieving effect. The number of participant is small and there is almost always latent demand. In order to determine how people choose between the different travel options, travel time savings for the Express Lane users were determined. The travel time savings were calculated from loop detector speed at different cross-sections and reach values up to 18 minutes. The estimated travel time savings were then used to estimate mode choice models which explain the choice behavior of travelers between spending time by traveling on the main lanes and spending money by traveling on the Express Lanes. The choice models show that wealthier people, people with a higher level of education, home owners, and woman are more likely to pay for the use of the Express Lanes.

40|$|Private {{provision}} of public roads through build-operate-transfer (BOT) contracts is increasing {{around the world}} in both developed and developing countries. Under a BOT contract, a private firm builds and operates roads in a road network at its own expense, and in return receives the revenue from road tolls for a number of years. Then these roads are transferred to the government. Important issues are the length of the concession period, capacity, toll charges and the benefits to the private investor, road users and the whole society under various market conditions and government regulations. Several issues related to a BOT toll road project are studied. This thesis first develops a benchmark analysis of the BOT road contract viewed as a combination of concession period, road capacity and toll charge under the assumption that the demand and cost functions are known to both public and private sectors. A bi-objective optimization problem is proposed for maximizing social welfare and private profit. And the properties of the concession period, service quality, social welfare and profit gains along the Pareto-optimal frontier are studied. A variety of government regulatory regimes are also investigated. We prove that: the private sector tends to offer a lower road capacity and a lower service quality under the price-cap regulation, while it chooses a higher service quality, a higher capacity and a higher toll charge under the rate-of-return regulation than those associated with the corresponding Pareto-efficient solution. In contrast, we prove that both the demand and markup charge regulations lead to Pareto-optimal outcomes. User heterogeneity in <b>value-of-time</b> (VOT) has long been a fascinating issue in road pricing studies. This thesis investigates the effects of the user VOT heterogeneity on the properties of the Pareto-efficient BOT contracts. Under some technical conditions, we prove that, the Pareto-optimal road-life concession period is free from the effects of user heterogeneity, while, even with constant returns to scale, the service quality is not constant and dependent on the curvature of the mean residual VOT function. The effects of user VOT heterogeneity on the outcomes of various regulatory regimes are also investigated. We find that, both the demand and markup regulations fail to achieve the Pareto-optimal outcomes and result in a lower level of capacity and service quality. In the presence of traffic uncertainty, this thesis proposes the BOT contract with full and partial flexibility according to the instruments adopted by {{the public and private sectors}}. Full flexibility refers to the case in which the public sector promises an exogenous rate of return on the private investment and in turn can freely ex post adjust the contract in a socially optimal manner according to the observed demand curve. Partial flexibility refers to the case where the public and private sectors agree on an ex ante demand risk allocation by contract and the ex post contract adjustment can be made contingent on a Pareto-improvement to both parties. A preferred Pareto-improvement can be selected from the Pareto-optimal solution set of a bi-objective programming problem equipped with a rational preference. In comparison with the traditional rigid contract, in which, private sector burdens all project risk, the proposed flexibility of the BOT contract is valuable for the contract adjustment mechanism to solve the discrepancy between the public and private sectors. Two other issues are also investigated in this thesis. One is how to select the optimal combination of concession period, capacity and toll levels for a BOT toll road project if the yearly increasing operation costs are incorporated in the project. Another is how to choose the capacity and toll levels of an ”add-on” toll road parallel to an existing one with various ownership regimes, namely the existing road can be a free, public or private toll road...|$|E
