25|$|At the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, McKean and Caesar Rodney {{represented}} Delaware. McKean {{proposed the}} <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> that the Continental Congress later adopted: that each colony, regardless of size or population, have one vote. This decision set the precedent, the Congress of the Articles of Confederation adopted the practice, and {{the principle of}} state equality continued {{in the composition of}} the United States Senate.|$|E
25|$|After {{criticism}} of the voting system after the 2007 Contest, changes in the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> were made with the re-introduction of a national jury alongside televoting while {{the format of the}} semi-finals remained the same. Forty-two countries participated in the contest; Slovakia announced that it would return to the contest, while San Marino withdrew due to financial issues. Latvia and Georgia originally announced their intention to withdraw, but it was later stated by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) that both countries would indeed participate. However, Georgia later decided to withdraw after the EBU rejected its selected song as being a breach of contest rules.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{scholars}} of legislative politics propose comparative analyses of parliamentary voting behavior across different countries and parliaments. Yet parliamentary <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> differ dramatically across parliamentary chambers and ignoring these differences may, in the extreme, lead to meaningless comparisons. In this paper {{we present a}} first glimpse at a comprehensive data collection effort covering more than 250 parliamentary chambers in 176 countries. Focusing on European legislatures we find some notable differences as compared to previous studies on parliamentary <b>voting</b> <b>procedures.</b> We propose to analyze what explains the presence of various <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> and find that electoral institutions play a non-negligeable role...|$|R
25|$|Full {{preparations}} for the 2003 contest began on 18 May 2003 at the Skonto Hall. There were rehearsals, press conferences and participants were also involved in an internet chat. Two dress rehearsals were held on 23 May, {{in front of an}} estimated 12,000 people. The organisers of the contest held a press conference; one of the issues complained about was the lack of invitations for the after-party. The final dress rehearsal was held on 24 May, the day of the contest. A simulation of the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> was also held, in which the presenters linked up with all twenty-six countries by satellite for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The President of the European Council is {{appointed}} for a {{two and a}} {{half year}} term in a qualified majority vote of the European Council. A president can be reappointed once, and be removed by the same <b>voting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Unlike the post of President of the European Commission, the appointment of the President of the European Council does not have to reflect the composition of the European Parliament. The president's work involves coordinating the work of the European Council, hosting its meetings and reporting its activities to the European Parliament after each meeting. This makes the president the lynchpin of negotiations to find agreement at European Council meetings, which has become a more onerous task with successive enlargement of the EU to 28 Member States. The president also chairs informal summits of the 19 Member States which use the euro as their currency. Additionally, the president provides external representation to the Union on foreign policy and security matters when such representation is required at the level of heads of state or government (bilateral summits and G8/G20).|$|E
500|$|Prior to 1621, {{the only}} oath taken {{was that of}} {{obedience}} {{to the rules of}} the conclave in force at that time, when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked, and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote. Gregory XV added the additional oath, taken when each cardinal casts his ballot, to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting [...] "courtesy votes" [...] and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three. Speed in electing a pope was important, and that meant using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the serious business of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates. The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step-by-step procedure used in choosing a pope; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis. The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> of scrutiny making use of anonymous oaths. This was perhaps the most significant change in the modern era. It was a significant change to the step-by-step <b>voting</b> <b>procedure,</b> since that detailed <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> was first created in 1621. It was Pius XII who made this change in 1945.|$|E

However, the selection of two sports out of the five nominees as potential 2012 sports went to squash and karate, as determined by a <b>voting</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
500|$|The first All-Star Final Vote {{was held}} during the 2002 season. The 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game had 30 player rosters so the fans were {{voting for the}} 30th player.

40|$|The paper {{challenges}} the 'orthodox doctrine' of collective choice theory {{according to which}} Arrow 2 ̆ 019 s 'general possibility theorem' precludes rational decision procedures generally and implies that in particular all <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> must be flawed.

All <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> that have been proposed, {{with the exception of}} approval voting, involve restrictions on voters expressions of their preferences. These restrictions, not any general impossibility, are the cause of various well known pathologies. In the class of unrestricted <b>voting</b> <b>procedures</b> I favor 'evaluative voting' under which a voter can vote for or against any alternative, or abstain. I give a historical/conceptual analysis of the origins of theorists 2 ̆ 019 aversion to cardinal analysis in collective choice and voting theories...|$|R

500|$|Having {{received}} ITV's improved bid, Parry {{on the day}} of {{the vote}} phoned an anxious Chisholm. He urged him to bid higher and agreed to delay the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Chisholm called an emergency meeting, where he was told by one company advisor not to match ITV's offer. Chisholm decided against and phoned Murdoch in New York in the early hours to seek permission to raise BSkyB's bid. Their new offer totalled £304 million; £35 million for 60 live games which rose to £40 million in the fifth year. Chisholm telephoned Parry and faxed him the details of BSkyB's bid. It was claimed that East saw Sugar on the morning of the vote talking to someone about ITV's bid and telling them to [...] "blow them out of the water." [...] Sugar originally denied this, but in later years confessed it was in fact Chisholm.|$|E
2500|$|Decisions {{were made}} by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Nothing, however, stopped jurors from talking informally among {{themselves}} during the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> and juries could be unruly, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> was public and transparent. Each heliast had received two votes, one [...] "not guilty" [...] and one [...] "guilty". Then the herald (κήρυξ) would, first, ask the heliasts {{if they wanted to}} submit any objections against the witnesses and, then, he would call them to cast their votes in two different amphoras, one of copper for the [...] "non-guilty" [...] votes and one of wood for the [...] "guilty" [...] votes. The voting was secret, since each juror had to cover the vote with his fingers, so that nobody could see in which amphora he threw it. In the civil cases the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> was different, because the amphoras were as many as the litigant parties and the jurors had to vindicate one of them by casting their vote.|$|E

These papers are then presented to a topic selection committee which rewords each topic and eventually narrows {{down the number}} of topics to five topics. Then the five resolutions are put to a two-tiered voting system. State forensic associations, the National Forensic League, and the National Catholic Forensic League all vote on the five topics, narrowing it down to two. Then the two topics are again put to a vote, and one topic is selected.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the final}} program (episode 8), the winner was chosen only by public vote. [...] Despite that, [...] the jury still voted and commented on each performance. [...] Voting started {{when the program}} started at 8 pm and {{concluded}} at some undisclosed time during the 1.5 hr long program. [...] The <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> potentially gave an unfair advantage to contestants who performed early in the show. [...] Indeed, the winner of Talang 2007 performed first. [...] Furthermore, all of the phone numbers for each contestant were published before the show, allowing the public to vote for their favorite contestant before they had given their final performance.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, protest {{votes are}} often made {{in order to}} {{indicate}} dissatisfaction with the slate of candidates presented on a particular ballot or to highlight the inadequacies of a particular <b>voting</b> <b>procedure.</b> Since most states' electoral systems do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of [...] "None of the Above", most protest votes {{take the form of}} a clearly non-serious candidate's name entered as a write-in vote. Mickey Mouse is often selected for this purpose. As an election supervisor in Georgia observed, [...] "If [...] doesn’t get votes in our election, it’s a bad election." [...] The earliest known mention of Mickey Mouse as a write-in candidate dates back to the 1932 New York City mayoral elections.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to some broadcasters' continued complaints about politically charged, neighbourly and diaspora voting, the EBU evaluated the <b>voting</b> <b>procedure</b> {{used in the}} contest, {{with the possibility of}} a change in the voting system for 2009. [...] Contest organisers sent a questionnaire regarding the voting system to participating broadcasters, and a reference group incorporated the responses into their suggestions for next year's format. Telewizja Polska (TVP), the Polish broadcaster, suggested that an international jury similar to the one used in the 2008 Eurovision Dance Contest be introduced in the Eurovision Song Contest to lessen the impact of neighbourly voting and place more emphasis on the artistic value of the song. A jury would lead to less political and diaspora voting as the jury members, mandated to be music industry experts, would also have a say in addition to [...] "random members of the public".|$|E
