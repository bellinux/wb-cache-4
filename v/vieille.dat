25|$|Shallow waters lay to the south. Toward {{the east}} and west {{currents}} ranging from 6–15 knots prevent mooring. Consequently, La <b>Vieille</b> could only be approached from the north side, and even then only during the three days either side of the quarter moon, if the sea is perfectly calm. In rough seas, whirlpools of 40 to 50 metres can be present.|$|E
25|$|The {{neighbourhood}} of Le Marais in Paris {{has experienced}} a growing gay presence since the 1980s, {{as evidenced by the}} existence of a large gay community and of many gay cafés, nightclubs, cabarets and shops, such as one of the largest Gay Club in Europe called Le Depot. These establishments are mainly concentrated in the southwestern portion of the Marais, many on or near the streets Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie and <b>Vieille</b> du Temple.|$|E
25|$|In 1407, Louis of Orléans {{was murdered}} in the rue <b>Vieille</b> du Temple in Paris. John did not deny responsibility, {{claiming}} that Louis was a tyrant who squandered money. Louis' son Charles, the new Duke of Orléans, turned to his father-in-law, Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, for support against John the Fearless. This resulted in the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War, which lasted from 1407 until 1435, beyond Charles' reign, though the war with the English was still in progress.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} of La <b>Vieille</b> {{was designed to}} be aesthetically pleasing, yet sufficiently distinct to minimise confusion with the nearby tower Tévennec. Its shape is a squat quadrilateral, with slight crenellations. The tower is square and semi-cylindrical on the north face, widening toward the base. The structure of the lighthouse was built in stone using bosses of grey granite quarried from the Île de Sein, while {{the upper part of the}} tower and corners were built from coated cinder blocks of blue kersantite.|$|E
25|$|La <b>Vieille</b> {{achieved}} notoriety in the 1920s {{when two}} disabled war veterans were stranded there for weeks by storms, their health deteriorating. They were employed {{under a new}} law reserving the job of lighthouse keeper {{to those who had}} served in the war. The tremendous difficulties experienced in getting them back to shore led to the repeal of the new law. In 1995 it was the penultimate French lighthouse to become automated, a process delayed due to the keepers on-site staging a protest against the task being carried out.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{royal family}} went into exile on 14 April 1931 after {{municipal}} elections brought Republicans {{to power in}} most of the major cities, leading to the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. Alfonso XIII had hoped that his voluntary exile might avert a civil war between the Republicans and the Monarchists. The royal family went to live in France and later Italy. Victoria Eugenie and Alfonso later separated, and she lived partly in the UK and, after being invited to leave Britain by its government, in Switzerland. She purchased a chateau, the <b>Vieille</b> Fontaine, outside Lausanne.|$|E

25|$|Firm {{commitment}} by the Minister of Public Works to {{construction of the}} lighthouse finally came on 29 January 1881, {{after two years of}} assessment. Work commenced at Île de Sein, where the raw materials (stone) were stored. The engineer in charge of overseeing the works, Probestau, set up home on the island. Since the construction of La <b>Vieille</b> followed Ar Men, the team were able to draw on a wealth of experience. Each year on the first of May, workmen would arrive at the island in a small steam-powered boat towing a longboat laden with construction materials, as well as rowboats for landing. Anchorages set up allowed the team to moor the steamboat and longboat.|$|E
25|$|The firm {{suddenly}} found itself without {{the vast majority}} of its business (despite later receiving financial compensation for the physical assets seized by Mobutu's regime) but managed to survive: full ownership passed to conglomerate Société Générale de Belgique, where it was grouped with its other metals and mining interests. As a reflection of its enforced departure from the Katanga Province, the new, simplified name Union Minière was adopted. With its more European focus, Union Minière began to grow its business again through the 1980s, initially largely organically. In 1989 however, Société Générale announced plans to merge Union Minière with three other Belgian metals companies in which it held a significant stake: zinc producer <b>Vieille</b> Montagne (with a history stretching back to 1805); Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt, which dealt {{in a wide range of}} metals including copper, cobalt, and lead; and Mechim, an engineering firm. The much enlarged company was initially renamed Acec-Union Minière (although the prefix was dropped in 1992) and subsequently set about streamlining its organisational structure, but the global economic downturn of the early-to-mid-1990s hit profits and forced management to implement a major restructuring programme in 1995. The three-year plan, implemented under the guidance of recently appointed CEO Karel Vinck, involved the loss of around 25% of Union Minière's workforce and the sale of a number of non-core assets, including a zinc wire operation, French roofing material retailer Asturienne and much of the company's exposure to the diamond products sector (including Diamant Boart).|$|E
500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{a new style}} of novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the roman-feuilleton {{presented}} stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's La <b>Vieille</b> Fille (The Old Maid), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the roman-feuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eugène Sue and Alexandre Dumas, père. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called [...] "les faux dieux de cette littérature bâtarde" [...] ("the false gods of this bastard literature"). He also wanted {{to show the world}} that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was [...] "plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais" [...] ("younger, fresher, and greater than ever"). His first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful. Even though Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes ("A Harlot High and Low"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was [...] "doing pure Sue". He tried again in 1844 with Modeste Mignon, but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his [...] "own old pen again".|$|E
