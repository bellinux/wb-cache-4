Starch sorghum can be converted into glucose and then by using the help of microorganisms are converted into bioetanol. The methods used in this research is the process of sakarifikasi and the fermentation is done simultaneously (SSF) in 2 -Litre fermenters.

At the aim to reduce this catastrophe several author have been shown that the Laser light scattering can be uses to reveals the particulate emitted in the smoke. Infact experimental and theoretical investigations have shown that lidar is a powerful tool to detect the tenuous smoke plumes produced by forest fires at an early stage. In early 90 's Arbolino and Andreucci have shown the theoretical possibility to detect the particulate emitted in atmosphere from smoke forest fire. Vilar at all have shown experimentally the possibility to measure the density variation in atmosphere due to plume emitted in forest fire event. Gaudio at all. have already shown {{that it is possible to}} evaluate water vapor emitted in smoke of <b>vegetable</b> <b>fuel</b> using a CO 2 dial system. In this paper a theoretical model to evaluate the capabilities of a lidar system in fire surveillance of wooded areas will be presented. In particular we intend propose a technique to minimizing the false alarm in the detection of forest fire by lidar based on a measurement of second components emitted in a combustion process. Usually to detect a fire alarm a rapid increase of aerosol amount is measured. If the backscattering signal report a peak, the presences of a forest fire will be probable. Our idea to confirm this hypothesis is measure the second components emitted in a forest fire at the aim to minimize the false alarm. The simulated measurements of the humidity amount within the smoke plume will be carried out by means of Raman analysis. Fixing the burning rate of the vegetable-fuels, the maximum range of detection will be evaluated...|$|E

The development of technology biokonversi to produce the <b>vegetable</b> <b>fuel</b> (biofuel) from resources could be renewed now was the main priority. The government announced the plan to reduce the Indonesian dependence on fuel oil (FUEL OIL) by publishing PP Nomor 5 in 2006 about the policy of Nasional Energy. Several researches showed that the sum cetana (CN) biodiesel higher than diesel oil (diesel fuel). The figure cetana in general diesel oil 45, whereas biodiesel 62 to that was based on the oil palm, 51 for the distance of the fence and 62. 7 to that was based on the vegetables coconut [Soerawidjaja, 2003]. His difference that is coconut oil had more oxygen and the value calorie him was lower than diesel fuel, so as to make the process of the burning to coconut oil more perfect and clean. Beside the surplus on coconut oil also had the weakness that is in the use of coconut oil could come closer together so as menyumbat the pipe channel, the filter and especially to the sprayer or nosel. The burning of oil also was able to be not burnt perfect, so as to cause many smokes and to enable the occurrence of carbon sediment on the end the oil sprayer. The success parameter of early of the research pembakaan diffusion of coconut oil was miyak the coconut could be burnt, from results of the research menunjukan that in the pressure 25 C coconut oil could have been burnt but just a few coconut oil that was burnt, that was caused because the low temperature will result in oil that dikabutkan by nosel too few and finally seldom also oil that reacted with oxygen from air that was the condition for the occurrence of the burning.

5000|$|Some Diesel-powered cars can {{run with}} minor {{modifications}} on 100% pure vegetable oils. Vegetable oils tend to thicken (or solidify {{if it is}} waste cooking oil), in cold weather conditions so vehicle modifications (a two tank system with diesel start/stop tank), are essential in order to heat the fuel prior to use under most circumstances. Heating to the temperature of engine coolant reduces fuel viscosity, to the range cited by injection system manufacturers, for systems prior to 'common rail' or 'unit injection ( [...] VW PD)' systems. Waste vegetable oil, especially if {{it has been used}} for a long time, may become hydrogenated and have increased acidity. This can cause the thickening of fuel, gumming in the engine and acid damage of the fuel system. Biodiesel does not have this problem, because it is chemically processed to be PH neutral and lower viscosity. Modern low emission diesels (most often Euro -3 and -4 compliant), typical of the current production in the European industry, would require extensive modification of injector system, pumps and seals etc. due to the higher operating pressures, that are designed thinner (heated) mineral diesel than ever before, for atomisation, if they were to use pure <b>vegetable</b> oil as <b>fuel.</b> <b>Vegetable</b> oil <b>fuel</b> is not suitable for these vehicles as they are currently produced.

Here, the use of <b>vegetable</b> oil <b>fuels</b> is a promising path, especially when decentrally cold pressed oils are used in a closed cycle, {{which means that the}} fuels are utilized at the same place (at the same farm) at which they are produced. This approach delivers cost efficient fuel, increased added value due to local production or even self-supply, as well as the reduction of CO 2 and other harmful emissions like soot. The presented approach is integrating fuel and engine development to achieve a final solution which enables the machine owner to use the most economic fuel. Here the results of the project's engine development on a test bench are presented. When biofuels are used, particulate and hydrocarbon emissions decrease by about 50 % compared to diesel.
