Then the people, laity and clergy, whether by plurality of votes or by what other means is not very certain, affirmed the testimony in favor of one of the claimants. Then the proceeding was signed, first by those who held the court, and then by the persons who affirmed the judgment, who also swore to it in the same manner.[69] ...|$|E

The study involved semi-structured interviews with twenty respondents from eight English universities in a range of disciplinary areas. An initial analysis of the interviews illuminated the powerful affective dimensions of the <b>viva</b> <b>voce</b> and the gendered nature of its processes. Resisting the binary separation of reason and emotion, the paper draws upon discursive theories of affect, gender and subjectivity to consider the affective economies that are illuminated in this data and suggests that this involves the reproduction of gendered hierarchies...|$|R

40|$|Background: Oral {{examinations}} {{are used}} {{as a mode of}} assessment of medical students. There are many deficiencies and biases in traditional <b>viva</b> <b>voce.</b> In view of minimizing deficiencies and biases this study was conducted with the objective of obtaining the perceptions of students and teachers about objectively structured <b>viva</b> <b>voce</b> (OSVV). Methods: OSVV was conducted during formative assessment in Microbiology. 56 participants (50 students+ 6 faculties) were included. Feedback in the form of questionnaire (based on Likert scale and open ended questions) was obtained from all the participants. All faculties felt that the overall process was better than traditional <b>viva</b> <b>voce.</b> Results: Students response to statements suggested a more positive than negative reception to this form of assessment. However there was variation in the response to different statements. 80 - 90 % students agreed that time allotted was adequate and questions were easy to understand. 60 - 80 % felt that this method a well-organized system that cover most of topics from the syllabus and will be helpful in enhancing performance in final examination. 68 % students agreed that OSVV is an effective tool but they were not confident whether OSVV is better than traditional <b>viva</b> <b>voce.</b> 42 % agreed and 38 % were neutral in their opinion whether OSVV is better than traditional <b>viva</b> <b>voce.</b> Conclusions: There is need of extensive ground work, training of teachers, orientation of students, practice to students by mock exams etc. A large sample than used here would be needed to substantiate this trend. OSVV should be tried in all other medical subjects and in large number of medical colleges. [Int J Res Med Sci 2016; 4 (7. 000) : 2951 - 2954...|$|R
