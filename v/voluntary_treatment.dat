40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsThe {{pharmacological}} treatment {{of individuals with}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and severe substance use disorder (SUD) is controversial, and few studies have examined the long-term psychosocial outcome of these treatments. Our aim was to investigate whether {{pharmacological treatment}} was associated with improved long-term psychosocial outcomes. MethodsThe present naturalistic study consisted of a long-term follow-up of 60 male patients with ADHD and comorbid severe SUD; all participants had received compulsory inpatient treatment due to severe substance abuse. The average interval between inpatient discharge and follow-up was 18. 4 months. Thirty patients had received pharmacological treatment for ADHD, and 30 patients were pharmacologically untreated. The groups were compared with respect to mortality and psychosocial outcomes operationalized as substance abuse status, ongoing voluntary rehabilitation, current housing situation and employment status. ResultsThe groups were comparable with regard to the demographic and background characteristics. Overall, mortality was high; 8. 3 % of the participants had deceased at follow-up (one in the pharmacologically treated group and four in the untreated group; the between-group difference was not significant). The group that received pharmacological treatment for ADHD exhibited fewer substance abuse relapses, received more frequently <b>voluntary</b> <b>treatments</b> in accordance with a rehabilitation plan, required less frequent compulsory care, were more frequently accommodated in supportive housing or a rehabilitation center, and displayed a higher employment rate than the non-treated group. ConclusionsThe recommendations for the close clinical monitoring of high-risk populations and the prevention of misuse and drug diversion were fulfilled in the structured environment of compulsory care for the treated group. Pharmacological treatment of ADHD in individuals with severe SUD may decrease the risk of relapse and increase these patients' ability to follow a non-pharmacological rehabilitation plan, thereby improving their long-term outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Regular HIV testing {{among people}} who inject drugs is an {{essential}} component of HIV prevention and treatment efforts. We explored HIV testing behaviour among a community-recruited sample of injection drug users (IDU) in Bangkok, Thailand. Methods Data collected through the Mitsampan Community Research Project were used to examine correlates of HIV testing behaviour among IDU and to explore reasons for not being tested. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with willingness to access HIV testing at the drug-user-run Mitsampan Harm Reduction Centre (MSHRC). Results Among the 244 IDU who participated in this study, 186 (76. 2 %) reported receiving HIV testing in the previous six months. Enrolment in <b>voluntary</b> drug <b>treatment</b> (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 34; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 18 - 4. 63) and the tenofovir trial (OR = 44. 81; 95 %CI: 13. 44 - 149. 45) were positively associated with having been tested, whereas MSHRC use (OR = 1. 78; 95 %CI: 0. 96 - 3. 29) was marginally associated with having been tested. 56. 9 % of those who had not been tested reported in engaging in HIV risk behaviour in the past six months. 181 (74. 2 %) participants were willing to be tested at the MSHRC if testing were offered there. In multivariate analyses, willingness to get HIV testing at the MSHRC was positively associated with ever having been to the MSHRC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2. 42; 95 %CI: 1. 21 - 4. 85) and, among females, being enrolled in <b>voluntary</b> drug <b>treatment</b> services (AOR = 9. 38; 95 %CI: 1. 14 - 76. 98). Conclusions More than three-quarters of IDU received HIV testing in the previous six months. However, HIV risk behaviour was common among those who had not been tested. Additionally, 74. 2 % of participants were willing to receive HIV testing at the MSHRC. These findings provide evidence for ongoing HIV prevention education, as well potential benefits of incorporating HIV testing for IDU within peer-led harm reduction programs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Treatment {{services}} {{to patients with}} substance use disorders (SUDs), including those mandated to treatment, needs to be evaluated and evidence based. The Norwegian Municipal Health Care Act calls for mandated treatment for persons with “severe and life-threatening substance use disorder” if these individuals are not otherwise willing to be voluntarily treated and consequently risk their lives over drug use. This study aims to examine substance use–related outcomes at 6  months following inpatient treatment and to analyse factors associated with improved outcomes and abstinence. Method This prospective study followed 202 hospitalized patients with SUD who were admitted voluntarily (VA; n[*]=[*] 137) or compulsorily (CA; n[*]=[*] 65). The European Addiction Severity Index was used at baseline and at follow-up to assess socio-demographic and substance use variables. Regression analysis was conducted to investigate factors associated with abstinence at 6  months of follow-up. Results The frequency of use of a preferred substance showed marked improvement for both VA and CA patients (61 and 37  %, respectively) at follow-up. Seventy-five percent of VA patients using amphetamine reported improvement compared to 53  % of CA patients. At follow-up, the CA group continued {{to have a higher}} rate of injection use. The CA group had experienced higher rates of overdose in the past 6  months and lower abstinence rates (24  % versus 50  %) at follow-up. A lower severity of drug use at intake (non–injection drug use), <b>voluntary</b> <b>treatment</b> modality, and higher treatment involvement during follow-up all were significant factors associated with abstinence at 6  months after treatment. Conclusion <b>Voluntary</b> <b>treatment</b> for SUD generally yielded better outcomes; nevertheless, we also found improved outcomes for CA patients. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that in reality, the alternative to CA treatment is no treatment at all and instead a continuation of life-threatening drug use behaviours. Our observed outcomes for CA patients support the continuation of CA treatment...|$|E

An online survey was distributed across three continents. Distribution to the medical directors of the cystic fibrosis centres affiliated with the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Australia (inclusion of New Zealand) and to every clinician member of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society. More than 200 cystic fibrosis patients not considered to be terminally ill and, who voluntarily ceased treatment, were reported by the clinicians surveyed.

Only one child, six adolescents and one adult were judged by clinicians not to be competent to make the decision to stop treatment. Time-consuming and low immediate-impact therapies, such as respiratory physiotherapy, were most frequently discontinued.
