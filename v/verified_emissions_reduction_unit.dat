50|$|The EU ETS is 'linked' to the Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism {{projects}} as {{it allows the}} limited use of 'offset credits' from them. Participating firms were allowed to use some Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>units</b> (CERs) from 2005 and <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Units</b> (ERUs) from 2008.

The <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> produced by the CDM are called Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reductions</b> (CERs); reductions produced by JI are called <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Units</b> (ERUs). The <b>reductions</b> are called [...] "credits" [...] because they are <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> credited against a hypothetical baseline of emissions.|$|R
50|$|In December 2012, ERU prices {{crashed to}} a low of 15c before {{recovering}} to 23c after news that EU’s Climate Change Committee was to vote on a ban of ERUs from countries that have not signed up to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol.

50|$|The National Allocation Plans for Phase II, {{the first}} of which were {{announced}} on 29 November 2006, provided for an average reduction of nearly 7% below the 2005 emission levels. However, the use of offsets such as <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Units</b> from JI and Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reductions</b> from CDM projects was allowed, with the result that the EU would be able to meet the Phase II cap by importing units instead of reducing emissions (CCC, 2008, pp. 145, 149).|$|R
5000|$|The CDM {{addresses}} the second objective {{by allowing the}} Annex I countries to meet part of their <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> commitments under the Kyoto Protocol by buying Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>units</b> from CDM <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> projects in developing countries (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 14). Both the projects {{and the issue of}} CERs units are subject to approval to ensure that these <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> are real and [...] "additional." [...] The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).|$|R
5000|$|Article 6.1 {{states that}} [...] "The {{acquisition}} of <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> shall be supplemental to domestic actions {{for the purposes}} of meeting commitments under Article 3". Article 17 states that [...] "…Any such trading shall be supplemental to domestic actions for the purpose of meeting quantified <b>emission</b> limitation and <b>reduction</b> commitments under that article". Article 12.3.b states that [...] "Parties included in Annex I may use the certified <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> accruing from such project activities to contribute to compliance with part of their quantified <b>emission</b> limitation and <b>reduction</b> commitments under Article 3…".|$|R
5000|$|CERs {{can be used}} by Annex 1 {{countries}} in order to comply with their emission limitation targets or by operators of installations covered by the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in order to comply with their obligations to surrender EU Allowances, CERs or <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Units</b> (ERUs) for the [...] emissions of their installations. CERs can be held by governmental and private entities on electronic accounts with the UN.|$|R
50|$|Some CDM {{projects}} remove {{or destroy}} industrial gases, such as hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O). HFC-23 {{is a potent}} greenhouse gas (GHG) and is a byproduct from {{the production of the}} refrigerant gas chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified <b>emissions</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{cost-efficient}} way {{to allocate}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> among countries or regions is to harmonise their marginal reduction costs. This {{could be achieved}} by a market of <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> (ERUs). To model such a market, we use a multi-regional MARKAL-MACRO model. It gives insights into the consequences of co-ordinating CO 2 abatement on regional energy systems and economies. As a numerical application, we assess {{the establishment of a}} market of ERUs among three European countries for curbing their CO 2 emissions...|$|R
50|$|As {{noted in}} the {{previous}} paragraph, participants in the NZ ETS could also use most of the 'Kyoto Units' to meet their surrender obligations. The permitted units were: Assigned amount <b>units</b> (AAUs), <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Units</b> (ERUs), Removal Units (RMUs), and Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reductions</b> (CERs). However, temporary CERs and iCERS cannot be used, and neither can CERs and ERUs generated from nuclear projects. Consequently, compared to other emissions trading schemes, the NZ ETS is highly linked to the international markets {{and will be a}} price-taker.|$|R
5000|$|Corporations have {{multiple}} ways {{to balance their}} carbon liability. They can reduce their carbon emissions (their [...] "carbon footprint") through capital investment, projects and demand reduction. They can purchase emission permits, be allocated quotas (such as European Union Allowances (EUA)) or buy carbon credits. The latter are largely produced by CDM projects (Clean Development Mechanism) and Joint Initiatives. These credits are largely traded in form of Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> (CER), or <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Unit</b> (ERU). Voluntary <b>Emissions</b> <b>Reduction</b> (VER) have a similar function but have not registered / cannot be registered under {{the rules of the}} Kyoto Protocol.|$|R
5000|$|The CDM allows industrialized {{countries}} to buy CERs and {{to invest in}} <b>emission</b> <b>reductions</b> where it is cheapest globally (Grubb, 2003, p. 159). Between 2001, {{which was the first}} year CDM projects could be registered and 7 September 2012, the CDM issued 1 billion Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>units.</b> [...] As of 1 June 2013, 57% of all CERs had been issued for projects based on destroying either HFC-23 (38%) or N2O (19%). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) was included in the CDM carbon offsetting scheme in December 2011.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the strict rules {{set out for the}} mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions.</b> A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the <b>Verified</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>Reductions</b> (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in the mandatory market.|$|R
40|$|Coal mine methane {{resources}} of Kuznetsk coal basin in Russia amounts to over 13 trillion cubic meters. Presently 47 coal mines {{operate in the}} region and emit 216 million cubic meters of methane per year but unfortunately none of them attempt to utilize drained methane. Development of coal mine methane recovery and utilization is of great technological, economical and ecological importance for Kuzbass. One of the main challenges in monitoring methane recovery and utilization projects and generated <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Units</b> trading under the framework of Kyoto Protocol mechanisms becomes a selection of successful methane utilization options. Each separate coal enterprise features certain peculiarities that impact the decision adoption. Dominating role here is played by the existing thermal and electrical power market and <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> market price. Application of a mathematical tools based on game theory may serve as one of the means in addressing this issue. The method implies a financial-economic model plotting, where the main players are the “coal mine ” and the “emission <b>reduction</b> <b>units</b> market”. A practical magnitude of results analysis of shaped models implies the development and the definition of the best effective scenario for economic system development with regard of regional and business peculiarities and the elaboration of recommendations for specific coal mining entities of Kuzbass region...|$|R
