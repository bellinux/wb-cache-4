5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a <b>vacuole</b> and releasing their enzymes into the <b>vacuole.</b> Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central <b>vacuole</b> encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a <b>vacuole</b> {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a <b>vacuole.</b> There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E

Preparations of isolated <b>vacuoles</b> often contain “impure vacuoles,” namely, <b>vacuoles</b> contaminated with some cytoplasmic remnants.

40|$|Rimmed <b>vacuoles</b> in myofibers {{are thought}} to be due to the {{accumulation}} of autophagic <b>vacuoles,</b> and can be characteristic in certain myopathies with protein inclusions in myofibers. In this study, we performed a detailed clinical, molecular, and pathological characterization of Becker muscular dystrophy patients who have rimmed <b>vacuoles</b> in muscles. Among 65 Becker muscular dystrophy patients, we identified 12 patients who have rimmed <b>vacuoles</b> and 11 patients who have deletions in exons 45 - 48 in DMD gene. All patients having rimmed <b>vacuoles</b> showed milder clinical features compared to those without rimmed <b>vacuoles.</b> Interestingly, the rimmed <b>vacuoles</b> in Becker muscular dystrophy muscles seem to represent autophagic <b>vacuoles</b> and are also associated with polyubiquitinated protein aggregates. These findings support the notion that rimmed <b>vacuoles</b> can appear in Becker muscular dystrophy, and {{may be related to the}} chronic changes in muscle pathology induced by certain mutations in the DMD gene...|$|R

5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same way}} as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant <b>vacuole.</b> Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each epidermal cell has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) and {{the interior of the}} animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a <b>vacuole,</b> surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central <b>vacuole.</b> The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E

The addition of 1 mM EDTA resulted in increased stability of <b>vacuoles</b> with 50 % lysis occurring after 50 min (cowpea) and 120 min (barley). Other com-pounds were tested for their effects on the stability of <b>vacuoles.</b> The longer life of <b>vacuoles</b> {{in the presence of}} EDTA allowed transport studies to be carried out using radiolabeled tracers. The uptake of [14 C]sucrose (10 mM) by cowpea <b>vacuoles</b> was stimulated approximately two-fold by the presence of MgATP (10 HIM); the Km for [14 G]sucrose uptake by cowpea <b>vacuoles</b> was 12. 5 mM.

These <b>vacuoles</b> {{are bound}} by a "smooth" double {{membrane}} and do not contain acid phosphatase activity. In an attempt to identify the membrane source of these <b>vacuoles,</b> I have used morphological techniques combined with immunological probes to localize specific membrane antigens to the limiting membranes of newly formed or nascent autophagic <b>vacuoles.</b> Antibodies to three integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane (CE 9, HA 4, and epidermal growth factor receptor) {{and one of the}} Golgi apparatus (sialyltransferase) did not label these <b>vacuoles.</b> Internalized epidermal growth factor and its membrane receptor were not found in nascent autophagic <b>vacuoles</b> but were present in lysosome-like degradative autophagic <b>vacuoles.</b> All these results suggested that autophagic <b>vacuoles</b> were not formed from plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, or endosome constituents. Antisera prepared against integral membrane proteins (14, 25, and 40 kD) of the RER was found to label the inner and outer limiting membranes of almost all nascent autophagic <b>vacuoles.</b> In addition, ribophorin II was identified at the limiting membranes of many nascent autophagic <b>vacuoles.</b> Finally, secretory proteins, rat serum albumin and alpha 2 u- globulin, were localized to the lumen of the RER and to the intramembrane space between the inner and outer membranes of some of these <b>vacuoles.</b> The results were consistent with the formation of autophagic <b>vacuoles</b> from ribosome-free regions of the RER...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>vacuoles</b> in wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Highbury) starchy endosperm cells was studied using electron microscopy. Some <b>vacuoles</b> were always present, {{even in the}} coenocytic cytoplasm. The first formed endosperm cells were highly vacuolated, but became filled with cytoplasm as they grew older. Various-sized pieces of cytoplasm were found in <b>vacuoles</b> of developing endosperm cells, probably {{as a result of}} autophagic sequestration. The membranes of the autographic <b>vacuoles</b> appeared to originate from the rough endoplasmic reticulum and from extensions of already-formed <b>vacuoles.</b> Autographic activity was confirmed by localizing the hydrolytic enzyme acid phosphatase within the <b>vacuoles.</b> The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) also stained positive for this enzyme...|$|R
5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge <b>vacuole</b> occupying the cell center.|$|E

However, no pH dependence was observed.

40|$|Invasive Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) {{can enter}} {{epithelial}} cells wherein they mediate formation of plasma membrane bleb-niches for intracellular compartmentalization. This phenotype, and capacity for intracellular replication, requires the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPr) activity of ExoS, a PA type III secretion system (T 3 SS) effector protein. Thus, PA T 3 SS mutants lack these capacities and instead traffic to perinuclear <b>vacuoles.</b> Here, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that the T 3 SS, via the ADPr activity of ExoS, allows PA to evade acidic <b>vacuoles</b> that otherwise suppress its intracellular viability. The acidification state of bacteria-occupied <b>vacuoles</b> within infected corneal epithelial cells was studied using LysoTracker to visualize acidic, lysosomal <b>vacuoles.</b> Steady state analysis showed that within cells wild-type PAO 1 localized to both membrane bleb-niches and <b>vacuoles,</b> while both exsA (transcriptional activator) and popB (effector translocation) T 3 SS mutants were only found in <b>vacuoles.</b> The acidification state of occupied <b>vacuoles</b> suggested a relationship with ExoS expression, i. e. <b>vacuoles</b> occupied by the exsA mutant (unable to express ExoS) were more often acidified than either popB mutant or wild-type PAO 1 occupied <b>vacuoles</b> (p < 0. 001). An exoS-gfp reporter construct pJNE 05 confirmed that high exoS transcriptional output coincided with low occupation of acidified <b>vacuoles,</b> and vice versa, for both popB mutants and wild-type bacteria.

40|$|Objective: The {{presence}} of sperm-head <b>vacuoles</b> has been suspected to be deleterious to {{the outcomes of}} assisted reproductive technology (ART). It is difficult to accurately distinguish morphologically abnormal sperm with <b>vacuoles</b> under a light microscope. This study was per-formed to analyze {{the result of the}} observation of sperm-head <b>vacuoles</b> using Papanicolaou staining under a light microscope and whether the male partner’s age affects these <b>vacuoles.</b> Methods: Sperm morphology with <b>vacuoles</b> was evaluated using Papanicolaou staining and observed under a light microscope (400 ×) in 980 men. The normal morphology was divided into three categories (group A, 14 % of normal morphology). The criteria for the sperm-head <b>vacuoles</b> were those given in the World Health Organization manual. For the analysis of the age factor, the participants were divided into the following groups: 26 – 30 years, 31 – 35 years, 36 – 40 years, 41 – 45 years, and 46 – 50 years. Results: The percentage of sperm-head <b>vacuoles</b> increased with normal sperm morphology (group A vs. groups B, C) (p< 0. 05). In the case of the age factor, a statistically significant difference was not observed across any of the age groups. Conclusion: A majority of the sperm-head <b>vacuoles</b> showed a statistically significant difference among normal morphology groups. Therefore, we should consider the probability of the percentage of sperm-head <b>vacuoles</b> not increasing with age but with abnormal sperm morphology. A further study is required to clarify the effect of the sperm-head <b>vacuoles</b> on ART outcomes...|$|R

In this study, nucleolar <b>vacuoles</b> were investigated by using radioautography, actinomycin D, and electron microscopy. It was found, from grain counts of nucleoli labeled with uridine 3 H, that nucleoli containing <b>vacuoles</b> had more than three times as many grains/µ 2 of nucleolar substance as did nucleolei without <b>vacuoles.</b> Treatment of tobacco callus cells with various concentrations of actinomycin D caused the percentage of cells containing nucleolar <b>vacuoles</b> to decrease; with the highest concentration the percentage of these cells dropped from the normal level of about 70 % o to less than 10 %. However, after removal of actinomycin D the cells regained nucleolar <b>vacuoles</b> up to the control level. When radioautography was used with actinomycin D, {{it was found that the}} actinomycin D inhibited the uptake of uridine- 3 H, i. e. inhibited RNA synthesis, in those nucleoli which lost their nucleolar <b>vacuoles.</b> In addition, after removal of the cells from actinomycin D, it was found that as the cells regained nucleolar <b>vacuoles</b> the nucleoli also began to incorporate uridine- 3 H.

25|$|Herring {{are among}} the most {{spectacular}} schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. Schools have been measured at over four cubic kilometres in size, containing about four billion fish. These schools move along coastlines and traverse the open oceans. Herring schools in general have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds. Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very fast to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a <b>vacuole</b> which can look like a doughnut from a spotter plane. The intricacies of schooling is far from fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding energetics. Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion. The way the fish array in the school probably gives energy saving advantages, though this is controversial.|$|E
