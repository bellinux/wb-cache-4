2500|$|The use {{of credit}} ratings by {{regulatory}} agencies {{is not a}} new phenomenon. In the 1930s, regulators in the United States used credit rating agency ratings to prohibit banks from investing in bonds that were deemed to be below investment grade. [...] In the following decades, state regulators outlined a similar role for agency ratings in restricting insurance company investments. From 1975 to 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recognized the largest and most credible agencies as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, and relied on such agencies exclusively for distinguishing between grades of creditworthiness in various regulations under federal securities laws. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 created a <b>voluntary</b> <b>registration</b> system for CRAs that met a certain minimum criteria, and provided the SEC with broader oversight authority.|$|E

DEPUTY-SPEAKER, I {{think the}} House will allow {{me in the}} remarks that I wish to make, {{to refer to a}} {{communication}} that I had received, namely, the decision arrived at by the Transvaal Government in respect to the question of Asiatics. Everybody in the House is aware of the enormous interest, even passionate interest, that has been taken in this subject, especially in India, and for very good reasons. Without further preface let me say, this is the statement received by Lord Elgin from the Government of the Transvaal last night:--"Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian and Chinese communities have offered <b>voluntary</b> <b>registration</b> in a body within three months, provided signatures only are taken of educated, propertied, or well-known Asiatics, and finger-prints of the others, and that no question against which Asiatics have religious objections be pressed. The Transvaal Government have accepted this offer, and undertaken, pending registration, not to enforce the penalties under the Act against all those who register. The sentences of all Asiatics in prison will be remitted to-morrow." [...] Lord Selborne adds, [...] "This course was agreed to by both political parties." [...] I am sure that everybody in the House will think that very welcome news. I do not like to let the matter drop without saying a word--I am sure Lord Elgin would like me to say it--in recognition of the good spirit shown by the Transvaal Government.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{an increasingly}} prevalent metabolic disorder that {{is associated with}} substantial disease burden. Australia has an opportunity to improve ways of caring for the growing number of people with diabetes, but this may require changes to the way care is funded, organised and delivered. To inform how best to care for people with diabetes, and to identify the extent of change that is required to achieve this, the Diabetes Care Project (DCP) will evaluate the impact of two different, evidence-based models of care (compared to usual care) on clinical quality, patient and provider experience, and cost. Methods/Design: The DCP uses a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial design. Accredited general practices that are situated within any of the seven Australian Medicare Locals/Divisions of General Practice that have agreed {{to take part in the}} study were invited to participate. Consenting practices will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups for approximately 18 to 22 months: (a) control group (usual care); (b) Intervention 1 (which tests improvements that could be made within the current funding model, facilitated through the use of an online chronic disease management network); or (c) Intervention 2 (which includes the same components as Intervention 1, as well as altered funding to support <b>voluntary</b> patient <b>registration</b> with their practice, incentive payments and a care facilitator). Adult patients who attend the enrolled practices and have established (≥ 12 month's duration) type 1 diabetes mellitus or newly diagnosed or established type 2 diabetes mellitus are invited to participate. Multiple outcomes will be studied, including changes in glycosylated haemoglobin (primary outcome), changes in other biochemical and clinical metrics, incidence of diabetes-related complications, quality of life, clinical depression, success of tailored care, patient and practitioner satisfaction, and budget sustainability. Discussion: This project responds to a need for robust evidence of the clinical and economic effectiveness of coordinated care for the management of diabetes in the Australian primary care setting. The outcomes of the study will have implications not only for diabetes management, but also for the management of other chronic diseases, both in Australia and overseas. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Despite intense {{interest}} in trial registration, {{there is a}} wide gap between theoretical postulates on trial registration and its implementation worldwide. Objective We aimed to evaluate trialists views about current international guidelines on trial registration, including the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) policies and the Ottawa Statement, as well as their intention to register any future clinical trials they conduct. Methods We identified all 40, 158 PUBMED-indexed clinical trials published from May 2005 to May 2006 using an advanced search strategy. From a random sample of 500 confirmed clinical trials, corresponding authors with e-mail contact addresses were surveyed. Results A total of 275 (60 %) questionnaires from 45 countries were completed. 31 % of the respondents had received only nonindustry funding during the past ten years, while 5 % and 61 % had received only industry or mixed funding respectively. Approximately two third of participants supported registration of all 20 WHO Data Set items, and endorsed the Ottawa Statement part 1 and part 2. Delayed public disclosure of some essential data in instances where they may be considered sensitive for competitive commercial reasons was supported by 30 % of the participants, whereas immediate disclosure was supported by 53 %. Only 21 % of participants had registered all of their ongoing trials since 2005, while 47 % stated that they would provide the 20 WHO Data Set items to a publicly accessible register for all their future clinical trials; a significantly higher proportion of participants who received only nonindustry funding (62 %) was found among those who would always provide the 20 WHO items for future trials, compared to 42 % of participants who received mixed or only industry funding. Among those who were undecided about endorsing registration. One third of participants expressed a lack of sufficient knowledge as the primary reason. Conclusion Although disagreement was apparent on certain issues, our findings illustrate that trial registration is gradually becoming part of the current research paradigm internationally. Our results also suggest that researchers require more knowledge to inform their decision to comply with the International standards at this early stage of <b>voluntary</b> trial <b>registration.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of {{doctoral}} research that investigated midwives’ responses to the changed regulation conditions after the introduction of a single national register for health practitioners in Australia in 2010. The Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act (2009) legislated for universal statutory registration under one national agency, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulatory Agency (AHPRA). The move focused on national uniformity of registration standards across health practitioners and ensuring public safety through the development of a flexible, responsive and sustainable Australian health workforce that is suitably trained and qualified (AHPRA, 2010). This research is concerned with how the members of one national board, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA), made meaning out of the national registration renewal standards. National registration created a number of new situations for midwifery practitioners that presented potential challenges and opportunities that need examination. A separate register for midwives meant that for some midwives this was the first opportunity to register as a midwife, without the need to also be registered as a nurse. Previous <b>voluntary</b> arrangements for <b>registration</b> renewal in some jurisdiction were made statutory at national level for all practitioners – namely, continuing professional development, and proof of competence {{in the form of a}} declaration of recency of practice, and insurance cover. Also, a new annotation on the midwifery register presented experienced midwives with the equivalent of three years, full-time practice across the full range of maternity services, the option of gaining eligibility status.
