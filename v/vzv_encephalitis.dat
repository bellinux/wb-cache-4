50|$|Classic {{textbook}} descriptions {{state that}} VZV reactivation in the CNS {{is restricted to}} immunocompromised individuals and the elderly, however, recent {{studies have found that}} most patients are immunocompetent, and less than 60 years old. Old references cite vesicular rash as a characteristic finding, however, recent studies have found that rash is only present in 45% of cases.In addition, systemic inflammation is not as reliable an indicator as previously thought: the mean level of C-reactive protein and mean white blood cell count are within the normal range in patients with VZV meningitis.MRI and CT scans are usually normal in cases of VZV reactivation in the CNS. CSF pleocytosis, previously thought to be a strong indicator of <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> was absent in half of a group of patients diagnosed with <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> by PCR.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion Severe <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> occurs {{mainly in}} {{patients}} {{with a history of}} immune deficiency. In the ICU setting, about 20  % of the patients experienced status epilepticus. MRI is useful to evaluate patients with <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> ICU mortality is 23  % and correlates with the number of organ dysfunction at ICU admission.|$|E
30|$|Introduction Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is {{responsible}} for human infections with various clinical presentations, followed by long-lasting viral latency in the spinal and cranial ganglia. VZV reactivation can be responsible for encephalitis. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe the clinical features and the prognosis of <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in adults patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).|$|E
40|$|Viral infections of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) are highly varied and in many cases {{difficult}} for diagnostics. Recently they have become more frequent in the practice of the specialists in infectious diseases and general medicine. Sometimes they had a motley clinical spectrum in other cases they were so similar that their appearance was a big challenge for clinicians. The aim of this presentation was to clarify the peculiarities in clinical course and prognostic factors {{of some of the most}} widespread viral CNS infections. In Bulgaria, 400 cases of viral infections of the CNS were registered per annum. The most prevalent of them were caused by Enteroviruses. Encephalitis, caused by Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) was associated with high mortality and severe residual complications in survivors. <b>VZV</b> provoked benign <b>encephalitis</b> with cerebellitis. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus meningitis was characterized with long-lasting meningeal signs and combined with some psychological deviations and focal neurological disorders. Influenza virus rare but serious affected CNS with convulsions, psychotic expressions, stupor and coma. Prognosis for the severity of viral infections of the CNS was dependent on age, immune status, neurological predisposition and virulence of the etiological agent. Some peculiarities at laboratorial findings, as well as the delaying of specific etiological therapy were important prognostic factors for bad outcome...|$|R
40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) {{is a human}} {{herpesvirus}} {{which causes}} varicella (chickenpox) as a primary infection, and, following a variable period during which it remains in latent form in trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia, reactivates in later life to cause herpes zoster (shingles). VZV is a significant cause of neurological disease including post-herpetic neuralgia which may be persistent and highly resistant to treatment, and small and large vessel <b>encephalitis.</b> <b>VZV</b> infections are more frequent with advancing age and in immunocompromised individuals. An understanding of the mechanisms of latency is crucial in developing effective therapies for VZV infections of the nervous system. Such studies have been hampered by the difficulties in working with the virus and also {{the lack of a}} good animal model of VZV latency. It is known that the ganglionic VZV burden during latency is low. Two of the key questions that have been addressed are the cellular site of latent VZV and the identity of the viral genes which are transcribed during latency. There is now a consensus that latent VZV resides predominantly in ganglionic neurons with less frequent infection of non-neuronal satellite cells. There is considerable evidence to show that at least five viral genes are transcribed during latency. Unlike herpes simplex virus- 1 latency, viral protein expression has been demonstrated during VZV latency. A precise knowledge of which viral genes are expressed is crucial in devising novel antiviral therapy using expressed genes as therapeutic targets. Whether gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels is more extensive than currently reported will require much more work and probably new molecular technology...|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} multiplex PCR assay for single-tube amplification that detects simultaneous {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1), {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 (HSV- 2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is reported with particular emphasis on how the method was optimized and carried out and its sensitivity was compared to previously described assays. The assay has been used on {{a limited number of}} clinical samples and must be thoroughly evaluated in the clinical context. A total of 86 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from patients which had the clinical symptoms of encephalitis, meningitis or meningoencephalitis were included in this study. The sensitivity of the multiplex PCR was determined to be 0. 01 and 0. 03 50 % tissue culture infective doses/the reciprocal of the highest dilution positive by PCR for HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 respectively, whereas for VZV, CMV and EBV, 14, 18, and 160 ag of genomic DNA were detected corresponding to 48, 66, and 840 genome copies respectively. Overall, 9 (10. 3 %) of the CSF samples tested were positive in the multiplex PCR. HSV- 1 was detected in three patients (3. 5 %) with <b>encephalitis,</b> <b>VZV</b> was detected in four patients (4. 6 %) with meningitis, HSV- 2 was detected in one neonate (1. 16 %), and CMV was also detected in one neonate (1. 16 %). None of the samples tested was positive for the EBV genome. None of the nine positive CSF samples presented herpesvirus coinfection in the central nervous system. Failure of DNA extraction or failure to remove any inhibitors of DNA amplification from CSF samples was avoided by the inclusion in the present multiplex PCR assay of α-tubulin primers. The present multiplex PCR assay detects simultaneously five different herpesviruses and sample suitability for PCR in a single amplification round of 40 cycles with an excellent sensitivity and can, therefore, provide an early, rapid, reliable noninvasive diagnostic tool allowing the application of antiviral therapy {{on the basis of a}} specific viral diagnosis. The results of this preliminary study should prompt a more exhaustive analysis of the clinical value of the present multiplex PCR assay...|$|R
30|$|Patients {{and methods}} A {{retrospective}} multicenter cohort study was performed, including consecutive adult patients admitted to 18 French ICUs between 01 / 01 / 1999 and 01 / 09 / 2015 with {{a diagnosis of}} <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> Data and follow-up were abstracted from the medical charts. Patients were evaluated for vital status at ICU discharge. A univariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with ICU survival.|$|E
30|$|Discussion We {{report the}} {{clinical}} features of 47 patients {{admitted to the}} ICU {{for the management of}} <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> This diagnosis may be challenging as clinical signs and symptoms may be diminished by an underlying cause of immunosuppression. Indeed, one-third of the patients had no fever and up 30  % had no skin rash. Patients should be investigated for VZV-related cerebral arteritis despite the fact that its treatment remains a matter of debate.|$|E
40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is {{a highly}} {{neurotropic}} virus that can cause infections in both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Several studies of VZV reactivation in the peripheral nervous system (herpes zoster) have been pub-lished, while exceedingly few investigations {{have been carried out}} in a human brain. Notably, there is no animal model for VZV infection of the central nervous system. In this report, we characterized the cellular environment in the temporal lobe of a hu-man subject who recovered from focal <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> The approach included not only VZVDNA/RNA analyses but also a delineation of infected cell types (neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes). The average VZV genome copy number per cell was 5. Several VZV regulatory and structural gene transcripts and products were detected. When colocalization studies were performed to determine which cell types harbored the viral proteins, the majority of infected cells were astrocytes, includ-ing aggregates of astrocytes. Evidence of syncytium formation within the aggregates included the continuity of cytoplasm posi-tive for the VZV glycoprotein H (gH) fusion-complex protein within a cellular profile with as many as 80 distinct nuclei. As with other causes of brain injury, these results suggested that astrocytes likely formed a defensive perimeter around foci of VZV infec-tion (astrogliosis). Because of the rarity of brain samples from living humans with <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> we compared our VZV re-sults with those found in a rat encephalitis model following infection with the closely related pseudorabies virus and observed similar perimeters of gliosis...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} AIDS who {{developed}} the clinical picture of bilateral progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN) in combination with varicella zoster encephalitis is described. The picture developed more than 2 years after an episode of ophthalmic zoster infection, and following intermittent exposure to oral acyclovir because of recurrent episodes of cutaneous herpes simplex infection. Aqueous humour, obtained by paracentesis of the anterior chamber, was analysed using immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Postmortem analysis of eye and brain tissue was performed by using conventional techniques and in situ hybridisation. While conventional techniques all failed to detect a causative agent, analysis of the aqueous humour using PCR, and histological examination of necropsy specimens from eyes and brain using in situ hybridisation were conclusive for the diagnosis varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. This case documents the presumed association of PORN and <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in a severely immunocompromised AIDS patien...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVaricella zoster virus (VZV) is {{a leading}} cause of acute viral {{encephalitis}} but little is known about its clinical, biological and imaging features. Furthermore, the most favourable treatment regimen has not been determined. We studied a prospective cohort of 20 HIV-negative patients presenting with acute <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis</b> caused by primary infection or reactivation. VZV was identified in 16 of 20 cases by PCR detection of the DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. The four remaining cases occurred during or soon after a VZV rash. The median age of the 17 adults was 76 (19 - 86) years; the three other patients were children (0. 5 - 5 years). Three patients were immunocompromised. Nine adult patients presented with a rash. Eighteen patients presented with fever and an acute encephalitic syndrome: diffuse brain dysfunction, focal neurological signs, seizures and cranial nerve palsies. Three patients presented with either ventricular or subdural haemorrhage, one with myelitis, and one with asymptomatic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery. The imaging was either normal or revealed non-specific abnormalities such as cortical atrophy but no evidence of stroke. All patients were given acyclovir at various dosages and durations but the case fatality rate remained high (15 %) and sequelae were frequently observed either at discharge or at follow-up 3 years later...|$|E
40|$|A 37 -year-old {{man with}} a three-year history of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome was {{admitted}} with impaired consciousness, seizures and fever. He was on {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} and on neurotoxoplasmosis secondary prophylaxis. Laboratory exams from two months before showed a CD 4 cell count of 37 /µL and a viral load of 230, 000 copies/mL. Three months before admission he developed herpetic skin rash in the right trunk and acyclovir was added to his treatment regimen. On physical exam he was drowsy and had motor and sensory aphasia. The patient had elevated protein levels and normal pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Contrast enhanced computed tomography scan of the brain showed a hypodense lesion in the left parietal lobe, with poorly defined margins and no contrast enhancement. The magnetic resonance scan (MRI) showed multiple hyperintensities in T 2 -weighted image in white and grey matters and hypointense products of hemorrhage in both hemispheres and in the cerebellum. He was empirically treated with intravenous acyclovir and prednisone. Viral DNA of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was detected in the CSF by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Acyclovir was continued for 10 days and the patient became well, with improvement of aphasia. We present a case of <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> confirmed by nested PCR, in a patient with suggestive MRI findings, wh...|$|E
40|$|Both {{varicella}} (chickenpox), and the reactivated form of {{herpes zoster}} (shingles), may cause neurological complications with various {{central nervous system}} (CNS) manifestations. Following introduction of PCR as a diagnostic method, the possibilities to detect the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to explore this disease, have dramatically improved. With the quantifiable properties of real-time PCR the question arose whether VZV viral load was correlated to the severity of neurological disease. In 97 patients, the medical records were retrospectively studied and the spectrum of clinical entities discerned. CSF VZV DNA was quantified in 66 of these cases. Baseline viral loads were higher in patients with meningitis and encephalitis as compared with those suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome. However, these differences did not reflect the severity of disease why this parameter was not a reliable predictor of outcome. Additionally, based on our data, VZV {{seems to be a}} more common aetiological agent of CNS infections than previously thought. Despite the usefulness of PCR, this technique has its diagnostic limitations. In patients with late diagnosis, the VZV DNA may be absent at time of PCR analysis. Serological analysis for detection of intrathecal antibody production is then required. Using a crude VZV antigen does not properly discriminate between antibodies to VZV and HSV- 1. We produced and evaluated a purified glycoprotein antigen, VZVgE. When 854 serum samples were analysed, VZVgE-ag showed equal sensitivity and at least as high specificity compared with VZVwhole-ag. VZVgE was also evaluated as a serological antigen in CSF. Paired samples of CSF and serum from 29 patients with clinical diagnosis of VZV CNS infection (n= 15) or herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) (n= 14), all confirmed by PCR were analysed. In ELISA, 11 / 14 HSE patients showed intrathecal antibody production with VZVwhole-ag compared with 4 / 14 using VZVgE-ag. In the patients with VZV CNS infection, the two antigens showed comparable results. When the CSF/serum samples pairs were diluted to identical IgG concentrations, higher CSF/serum optical density (OD) ratios were found in VZV patients using VZVgE-ag compared with VZVwhole-ag. These results show that VZVgE is a sensitive antigen for serological diagnosis of VZV CNS infection without cross-reactivity to HSV- 1 IgG. To evaluate the potential degree of brain damage in patients with VZV CNS infections, we prospectively studied the CSF concentrations of neuron-specific light chain neurofilament protein (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) and S- 100 β protein in 24 patients with VZV DNA positivity and acute neurological symptoms. Concentrations of CSF NFL and GFAp were moderately increased, while the S- 100 β levels were reduced. These results indicate that VZV might induce neuronal damage and astrogliosis, and this finding was most pronounced in the patients with <b>VZV</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> The cognitive impairment in patients with VZV CNS infections is largely unknown. We investigated the cognitive impairment in 14 patients with predominant CNS infections caused by VZV in a 3 -year follow-up. The VZV patients performed worse than controls (n= 28) on 4 tests covering the domains of speed and attention, memory and learning and executive function. The VZV patients were also classified into the concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with development of dementia. A greater proportion of VZV patients was classified with MCI compared with controls. These findings suggest that patients with previous VZV CNS infection might carry a risk of long-term cognitive impairment...|$|E
