50|$|The {{simplest}} {{system is}} to use a lens with fixed focus set at the hyperfocal distance. This will produce images that are acceptably sharp from infinity to some near plane (usually five to eight feet away). This system is used in most cheaper cameras.More complex systems allow <b>variable</b> <b>focus,</b> through a dial or slider. Many cameras with this system have distance markings on the control; {{it is up to the}} user to set the focus according to the distance to the subject. Most Minox cameras use this system.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{steps forward}} in {{material}} science {{have led to}} at least one method for developing large (>10 mm) GRIN lenses with 3-dimensional gradient indexes. There is a possibility of adding expanded deformation capabilities to the GRIN lenses. This translates into controlled expansion, contraction, and shear (for <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> lenses or asymmetric optical variations). These capabilities have been demonstrated. Additionally, recent advances in transformation optics and computational power provide a unique opportunity to design, assemble and fabricate elements in order to advance the utility and availability of GRIN lenses across a wide range of optics-dependent systems, defined by needs. A possible future capability could be to further advance lens design methods and tools, which are coupled to enlarged fabrication processes.|$|E

The 10 meter diameter dish antenna system has a <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> feed horn system which can provide a wide beam for target detection, and a narrow beam for tracking (other similar radars have scan rates in excess of [...] per second).

5000|$|Ellipsoidals are {{supplied}} {{with a certain}} size lens or lenses that determines the field angle, anywhere from five to ninety degrees. Field angle is {{the angle of the}} beam of light where it reaches 10% of the intensity of the center of the beam. Most manufacturers now use field angle to indicate the fixture's spread typically in this series (5°, 10°, 19°, 26°, 36°, 50°, 75°, 90°). Older fixtures are described by the width of the lens x focal length of the instrument. For example, a 6x9 ellipsoidal would have a 6" [...] diameter lens and a focal length of 9". 6x9 Instruments have a field angle of approximately 37°. 6x12 instruments have a field angle of approximately 27°. As the field angle narrows, the instrument can be used further from the stage. <b>Variable</b> <b>focus</b> (zoom) instruments with two lenses that move in and out from the lamp housing are also available, allowing the user to manually adjust to the desired focal length within a certain range. Ellipsoidals can be used for any job but their primary function is to illuminate a specific proximity. They are the common use for spotlights as they can give a small sharp circle. It has an ellipsoidal reflector behind the lamp to reflect the light in the direction required. They have brackets on the end to attach gels and barn doors. Barn doors do the same as the shutters but give a softer edge.|$|E

40|$|<b>Variable</b> light <b>focusing</b> is {{the ability}} to {{flexibly}} select the focal distance of a lens. This feature presents technical challenges, but is significant for optical interrogation of three-dimensional objects. Numerous lens designs have been proposed to provide flexible light focusing, including zoom, fluid, and liquid-crystal lenses. Although these lenses are useful for macroscale applications, they have limited utility in micron-scale applications due to restricted modulation range and exacting requirements for fabrication and control. Here, we present a holographic focusing method that enables <b>variable</b> light <b>focusing</b> without any physical modification to the lens element. In this method, a scattering layer couples low-angle (transverse wave vector) components into a full angular spectrum, and a digital optical phase conjugation (DOPC) system characterizes and plays back the wavefront that focuses through the scattering layer. We demonstrate micron-scale light focusing and patterning over a wide range of focal distances of 22 – 51 [*]mm. The interferometric nature of the focusing scheme also enables an aberration-free scattering lens. The proposed method provides a unique <b>variable</b> <b>focusing</b> capability for imaging thick specimens or selective photoactivation of neuronal networks...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{of focus}} identification are reported one each for American English, Greek and Swedish. In the first experiment, listeners {{were presented with}} isolated sentences as well as sentences extracted from question-answer contexts {{and were asked to}} identify focus distribution. In the second experiment, questions were paired with prosodically variable answers and listeners were asked to identify the matching pairs. In the third experiment, lexical words were extracted from their sentence context and listeners were asked to identify focalised words. The results indicate the following: (1) isolated sentences have <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> identifications but no final-focus bias; (2) focus is best identified at non-final position; (3) focus is identified in the question-answer contexts of the corresponding prosodic pairs; (4) lexical words out of immediate sentence context have <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> identifications. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a miniature simultaneous vision simulator instrument with various image-forming channels, {{each one of}} which projects, onto the retina of the same eye, a component image with a different degree of defocusing of the same observed object, such that the superposition {{of all of the}} component images forms a final simultaneous vision image on the retina of the eye. The instrument has at least one adjustable <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> lens which, as the focus is changed, modifies the vergence of the light beam passing through said adjustable lens. Furthermore, one of the image-forming channels passes through the adjustable <b>variable</b> <b>focus</b> lens.

40|$|In this letter, we {{demonstrate}} Drop-on-Demand {{printing of}} <b>variable</b> <b>focus,</b> polarisationindependent, liquid crystal (LC) microlenses. By carefully selecting the surface treatment {{applied to a}} glass substrate, {{we are able to}} deposit droplets with a well-defined curvature and contact angle, which result in micron-sized lenses with focal lengths on the order of 300 µm - 900 µm. Observations with an optical polarising microscope confirm the homeotopic alignment of the LC director in the droplets, which is in accordance with the polarisation independent focal length. Results show that microlenses of different focal lengths can be fabricated by depositing successive droplets onto the same location on the substrate, which can then be used to build up programmable and arbitrary arrays of microlenses of various lens sizes and focal lengths. Finally, we utilise the thermal dependency of the order parameter of the LC to demonstrate facile tuning of the focal length.
