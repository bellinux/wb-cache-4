50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by James Barney Marsh and built in 1911, the same year in which he filed a patent for his rainbow arch design. His design features two arched ribs, one {{on either side of}} the roadway, rising above the deck. The deck is suspended from the arches by <b>vertical</b> <b>risers.</b> Drivers see the rainbow arch crowns on each side, similar to crossing a pony truss bridge. The bridge over the Little Cottonwood River is one of the oldest Marsh rainbow arches in the country. Unfortunately, as traffic flow increased and farm machinery got larger, many of Marsh's rainbow arch designs became obsolete, since they could not be widened. There are only half a dozen Marsh rainbow arch bridges remaining in Minnesota.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study on vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a <b>vertical</b> <b>riser</b> subject to uniform and linearly sheared currents. The model <b>vertical</b> <b>riser</b> tested at the MARINTEK by ExxonMobil is considered. The predicted numerical {{results are in}} good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that the dominant mode numbers, the maximum root mean square amplitudes, the dominant frequencies and the fatigue damage indices increase with the flow velocity. A standing wave response is observed for the single-mode in-line (IL) and cross-flow (CF) vibrations. Dual resonance is found to occur at most of the locations along the riser. At some locations along the riser, a third harmonic frequency component is observed in the CF response and a frequency component at the CF response frequency {{is found in the}} IL response apart from the frequency component at twice the CF response frequency. The majority of the vortex shedding shows a clear 2 S pattern, whereas a 2 P mode is observed near the position where the maximum vibration amplitude appears. The higher IL fatigue damage in the present study emphasises the importance of the IL fatigue damage especially in the design of low flow velocity or low mode number applications...|$|R

In this study, the slot gating system is employed to improve mold fi lling behavior and therefore, {{to improve the quality}} of aluminum castings produced in permanent molds. An equipment as well as operation procedures for real-time X-ray radiography of molten aluminum fl owing into permanent molds have been developed.

Following ideas from the literature, we introduce a virtual valve located {{at the bottom of the}} riser. This allows us to reproduce observed periodic regimes. It also brings insight into the physics of the slugging phenomenon. Most importantly, this model reveals relatively easy to tune and seems suitable for control design.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a weak structural nonlinearity on the dynamical behaviour of a <b>vertical</b> offshore <b>riser</b> subjected to vortex-induced vibration (VIV). Coupling of the riser dynamics with the flow of the surrounding fluid is achieved by attaching a wake oscillator to a reduced model of the structure, which is obtained through the application of the invariant manifold technique for the derivation of nonlinear normal modes. The structure is modeled as an Euler–Bernoulli beam excited at modal frequencies by vortices in the form of wake oscillators of Van der Pol type as shown in Figure 1. The rise may move only in the direction normal to flow (Fig. 1 (b)), an assumption that is quite valid when its flowwise displacement is relatively small. For flexible cylinders supported at both ends, experimental investigations show that the cross-flow response dominates over the inline motion in terms of amplitude [18], therefore having a greater contribution in the fatigue of the riser’s material.

The sheared oscillatory flow along the span causes low-frequency oscillations in higher modes in the in-line direction, thus forming ‘X’ shaped, ‘II’ shaped, and ‘O’ shaped trajectories at various positions along the span when the riser is excited at its top end in one direction.

It is shown that under certain current conditions there exist multiple stable and unstable static solutions of the downstream riser. There also exists a critical current velocity and once this velocity is exceeded no static solutions of the downstream riser can be found.

40|$|A {{computer}} program is {{developed for the}} dynamic analysis of a spar platform coupled with mooring lines and risers in waves, winds, and currents. The new multi-contact analysis program is developed for the nonlinear multi-contact coupling between <b>vertical</b> <b>risers</b> and guide frames inside of the spar moon-pool. The program extends capability of the current coupled dynamic analysis program, WINPOST, by adding the capability of analyzing riser effects caused by the contact forces and moments from buoyancy-cans inside the spar moon-pool on the global spar motions. The gap between the buoyancy can and riser guide frames are modeled using three different types of nonlinear gap springs. The new riser model also considers the Coulomb damping between the buoyancy-cans and riser guide frames, and it also calculates the impact force on risers for use in fatigue analysis. The spar platform generally uses <b>vertical</b> <b>risers</b> with dry trees. However, as the water depth increases, {{the size of the}} buoyancy-can increases, and it makes installation more difficult. The pneumatic riser support system does not use buoyancy-cans and is an alternative solution to the buoyancy-can approach. The dynamic characteristics of pneumatic riser support system are studied by using the newly developed numerical analysis program. The damped Mathieu instability diagram for the damped Mathieu's equation is developed. Due to spar heave and pitch coupling, Mathieu's instability may become excited in long period waves. In the numerical analysis program, pitch and roll hydrostatic stiffness are recalculated for heave motion in every time step to check Mathieu's instability for the spar platform. Simplified vortex-induced vibration effects on the spar platform are considered in newly developed numerical analysis program, and the results are systematically compared with those of the original program WINPOST. The results in this paper show that the buoyancy-can effect significantly reduces the spar pitch motion, and the Coulomb damping effect also significantly reduces the spar heave motion. The buoyancy-can effect also {{plays an important role in}} Mathieu instability. The results also show that a pneumatic riser support system increases the spar heave motion and payload...|$|E

40|$|Free Standing Hybrid Riser (FSHR) is an {{innovative}} concept for the riser to transport {{oil and gas}} from the seabed to a floating production platform deployed in deep water. A FSHR mainly consists of a buoyancy can, a <b>vertical</b> steel <b>riser,</b> a flexible jumper and an upper riser assembly (URA). This study focuses {{on the development of}} the numerical scheme for the dynamic simulation of a FSHR whose flexible jumper is connected to a moored floating production vessel, say floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO). The numerical scheme is mainly based on an existing in-house numerical code, known as COUPLE. In using COUPLE, URA is modeled as a rigid body. The URA connects a <b>vertical</b> steel <b>riser</b> and a flexible jumper, both of which are modeled by beam elements (experienced both tensions and bending moments) in COUPLE. The buoyancy can is connected to the URA through a tether chain, which provides the vertical upright force on the URA and in turn the tension to the <b>vertical</b> <b>riser.</b> The tether chain is modeled by bar elements (experienced only tensions) while the buoyancy can is modeled as a rigid cylinder (beam element). The motions and forces of the two rigid bodies, namely URA and the buoyancy can, are coupled in the simulation. Because the connection between the URA and steel riser is considered as ?rigid?, an accurate numerical scheme modeling a rotational spring connecting the URA and steel riser is developed for calculating the bending moment applied at the upper end of the riser. Given the motion at the upper end of the flexible jumper (connecting to a FPSO), numerical simulations are made for two different FSHRs. The results simulated using COUPLE are in satisfactory agreement with those obtained using OrcaFlex, a commercial code widely used by the offshore industry. Furthermore, the vortex induced motion (VIM) of the buoyancy can is considered in the simulation and its effects on the motion of the FSHR are explored, which is compared with the corresponding model tests.
