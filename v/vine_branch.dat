40|$|Mechanical pruning, usually {{integrated}} with manual finishing, still excites some doubts regarding {{the quality of}} the cut which appears not to be the best as precision and cleanliness. This aspect, probably conditioned by the model and the application of pruning machines, might also be affected by the characteristics of the <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> in particular by their cutting force. In order to evaluate the cutting force on different vine type, laboratory and field trails were carried out. The experiments were set in order to evaluate this parameter during winter pruning in relation to three variables: <b>vine</b> type; <b>branch</b> size; pruning time. The results show how the cutting resistance of <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> during vegetative rest depends on vine variety (Trebbiano 675 N Cabernet 1175 N), on the diameter of the canes (increase of force from 56 % to 86 % between the classes of diameter) and on the pruning date (26 % decrease of the cutting force in the latest period for Trebbiano and Sangiovese, and 32 % for Cabernet Sauvignon). Such variations, which can be considerable, affect directly the pruning results. High values of cutting force can generate tiring of operator in manual pruning or cutting damages on the vegetation during mechanical pruning...|$|R
60|$|Perfect stillness in the garden: {{no sign of}} a light {{anywhere}} {{at the back of the}} house: first-floor windows all shut: second-floor windows still open. I fetched the pruning-ladder; put it against the side of the porch; tied one end of my bit of rope to the top round of it; took the other end in my mouth, and prepared to climb to the balcony over the porch by the thick <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> and the trellis-work.|$|R

40|$|A model {{procedure}} for the sustainable management of plant biomass related to wine production, namely <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> from agricultural {{practices in the}} vineyard and marcs remaining after grapes crushing, was devised. An artificial humification process was set up that could respond {{to the needs of}} environmental sustainability and could be a safe way to be reintroduce in the vineyard part of the organic matter previously exported, thus contributing to recover or maintain vineyard soil fertility. Two different strategies for composting were tested, namely a static pile, made by branches and marcs, and a pile that was fed twice a year alternatively with <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> and grape marcs. The experimentation lasted 710 days, during which environmental parameters, i. e. temperature and rainfalls were monitored. Growth dynamics of the principal functional groups of microorganism were followed. A characterization of the composted material was obtained by measuring several parameters among which, pH, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and heavy metals content. The characteristics of the produced compost fulfill the requirements prescribed by the Italian legislation regarding the use of compost as soil amendment. Germination tests demonstrated the absence of phytotoxicity and conversely evidenced a stimulating activity towards root development...|$|R

5000|$|... "The old God {{is still}} alive!" [...] This redemptive {{cry of a}} man when he saw another {{survivor}} {{at the end of}} the Thirty Year's War gave this wine region its name. Today a stony wayside shrine, entwined with <b>vine</b> <b>branches,</b> between Sasbachwalden and the neighbouring town Obersasbach remembers this event. However, in this area viniculture was already practised in the past. Documentary evidence marks the year 1601 as the date of granting the right to grow wine in this area.|$|R
50|$|Xavery {{was the son}} of Jan Baptist Xavery, the sculptor, and {{the pupil}} of Jakob de Wit. He practised at Amsterdam, Breda, and the Hague, and passed some time in Paris. Occasionally he imitated the manner of Berchem in his landscapes, and {{approached}} closely to his master, Jakob de Wit, in his feigned bas reliefs. He painted portraits of several distinguished persons, among them If. Braamcamp and the sculptor Cressant. He died {{towards the end of the}} 18th century. In the S.

50|$|The door is {{composed}} of ten panels which depict the Christian meaning of death. The panels are arranged in five rows and two columns. The {{top half of the}} door depicts the deaths of Jesus and Mary, spread across two panels. The two central panels show a <b>vine</b> <b>branch</b> and wheat, which are shown as being turned into wine and bread in symbolic tribute to the Eucharist. The bottom panels depict the deaths of Abel, Saint Joseph, Saint Peter, Pope John XXIII, Saint Stephen, Pope Gregory VII, and two allusions to the personification of Death. Beneath these depictions are a row of six animals: a blackbird, a dormouse, a hedgehog, an owl, a tortoise and a raven. The inside of the door shows the artist's dedication to Pope John XXIII.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{composition}} and properties of a biomixture {{used in a}} biobed are decisive for pesticide sorption and degradation. This study was performed to investigate the capability of compost-based substrates in mixtures with citrus peel and <b>vine</b> <b>branch</b> straw and peat-based substrates in mixtures with soil and <b>vine</b> <b>branch</b> straw at different levels in order to degrade isoproturon and bentazone. RESULTS: Dissipation and mineralisation rates of both pesticides were determined, and metabolic activity was followed as respiration. Compost-based substrates showed faster pesticide dissipation {{in the presence of}} lignocellulosic materials, as in garden compost and <b>vine</b> <b>branch</b> straw. The increasing content of <b>vine</b> <b>branch</b> straw in peat-based substrates does not seem to affect dissipation of the parent compounds. Low mineralisation rate was observed in all treatments. CONCLUSION: Higher pesticide degradation was observed in the lignocellulosic substrates, probably because of the development of lignin-degrading microorganisms which have shown to be robust and are able to degrade recalcitrant pesticides...|$|E
50|$|The grapevine (typically Vitis vinifera) {{has been}} used as a symbol since ancient times. In Greek mythology, Dionysus (called Bacchus by the Romans) was god of the vintage and, therefore, a grapevine with bunches of the fruit are among his attributes. His attendants at the Bacchanalian festivals hence had the vine as an attribute, {{together}} with the thyrsus, the latter often entwined with <b>vine</b> <b>branches.</b> For the same reason, the Greek wine cup (cantharos) is commonly decorated with the vine and grapes, wine being drunk as a libation to the god.|$|R

60|$|I {{reached the}} balcony over the porch in safety, {{depending}} more upon the tough <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> than the trellis-work during my ascent. My next employment was {{to pull up}} the pruning-ladder, as softly as possible, by the rope which I held attached to it. This done, I put the ladder against the house wall, listened, measured {{the distance to the}} open second-floor window with my eye, listened again--and, finding all quiet, began my second and last ascent. The ladder was comfortably long, and I was conveniently tall; my hand was on the window-sill--I mounted another two rounds--and my eyes were level with the interior of the room.|$|R
5000|$|Jerusalem {{with its}} many holy places {{probably}} {{had the highest}} concentration of mosaic-covered churches but {{very few of them}} survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called [...] "Armenian Mosaic" [...] which was discovered in 1894 on the Street of the Prophets near Damascus Gate. It depicts a <b>vine</b> with many <b>branches</b> and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the <b>vine's</b> <b>branches</b> are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: [...] "For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows." [...] Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a mortuary chapel.|$|R

60|$|I {{should not}} have quoted the {{following}} case had not the author of 'Des Jacinthes' (11/107. Amsterdam 1768 page 124.) impressed me with the belief not only of his extensive knowledge, but of his truthfulness: he says that bulbs of blue and red hyacinths may be cut in two, {{and that they will}} grow together and throw up a united stem (and this I have myself seen) with flowers of the two colours on the opposite sides. But the remarkable point is, that flowers are sometimes produced with the two colours blended together, which makes the case closely analogous with that of the blended colours of the grapes on the united <b>vine</b> <b>branches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Putatan got {{its name}} from a tree called putat. When the Spaniards colonized the Philippines, those who came to this {{particular}} place which has yet no name during the 18th century found out that many trees abound which looked like the Santol tree but whose leaves are much bigger with flowers blooming like rounded bunches of threads in rosy color to become chain of fruits in a seemingly small <b>vine</b> <b>branches.</b> The fruits, which {{are known to be}} poisonous, resembled the American guava. Now, the Spaniards wanted to know the name of this place and had to ask the residents who likewise answered them, putat, and thinking the Spaniards were asking for the name of the trees around the area.|$|R
5000|$|This reptile {{gets its}} common {{name from the}} cranial bumps that give the {{appearance}} of horns or ears; In fact, auriculatus is Latin for [...] "ears" [...] or [...] "eared", depending on the case. Other characteristics of this gecko include a thin prehensile tail which will regenerate if it drops off, as well as small toe pads. Although these geckos have to ability to grip <b>vines,</b> <b>branches,</b> and other obstacles, most do not have the ability to climb sheer surfaces, such as glass. As small as one inch long (from snout to vent) and weighing 3 grams at hatching, it reaches an average length of 7 to 9 inches and 60 to 70 grams in weight. They are considered a small to medium size gecko.|$|R

50|$|During {{the reign}} of Maria Theresa, Neustift once {{suffered}} a particularly bad wine harvest. The empress freed the village from paying taxes and {{in a sign of}} their gratitude, the vintners brought Maria Theresa a crown made of <b>vine</b> <b>branches.</b> She returned it to Neustift with the command to celebrate the church patron Saint Roch every year on 16 August. The crown is kept in the Kronenstüberl restaurant, which belongs to the Eischer family. In 1713, the plague stuck Neustift. In the same year, an Italian merchant donated funds for the Rochuskapelle (Chapel of St Roch) to commemorate its victims. When Joseph II dissolved the Dorotheastift, Neustift am Walde came into the possession of the Stift Klosterneuburg. Neustift furthermore became an independent parish and the chapel was transformed into the Neustift parish church.|$|R
50|$|The high {{clearance}} tractors (enjambeur) {{are a great}} help. The different steps consist in: crushing the vine shoots {{after they have been}} taken and placed {{in the middle of the}} row; a hole being made in the auger, where the vines stocks are missing, in order to plant grafts in the spring; ploughing or scraping, done in order to aerate the soil and eliminate any weeds; chemical weeding to kill weeds; several treatments of the vines, done in order to protect against fungal diseases (mildew, powdery mildew, grey rot, etc.) and some insects (Eudemis and Cochylis); regular trimming consisting in snipping or cutting excess <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> (shoots) using the trellising system; mechanical harvesting carried out with a harvesting machine or a grape picking head mounted on a {{high clearance}} tractor (enjambeur).|$|R
50|$|They are <b>vines</b> {{producing}} <b>branching</b> stems with tendrils from a {{tuberous root}} system. The leaves are alternately arranged. Flowers are borne in raceme-like clusters, often toward {{the ends of}} the stems. The bell-shaped flowers have five tepals usually in shades of pink or purplish, and sometimes yellowish or white. The stamens are joined at the bases, forming a tube.|$|R
60|$|The wife curtsied low, and by hospitable signs prayed the {{demoiselle}} {{to come to}} the fire, {{and take}} off her wet mantle. It was a very comfortable room, with a wide chimney, and deep windows glazed with thick circles of glass, the spaces between leaded around in diamond panes, through which <b>vine</b> <b>branches</b> could dimly be seen flapping and beating in the storm. A table stood under one with various glasses and vessels of curious shapes, and a big book, and at the other was a distaff, a work-basket, and other feminine gear. Shelves with pewter dishes, and red, yellow, and striped crocks, surrounded the walls; there was a savoury cauldron on the open fire. It was evidently sitting-room and kitchen in one, with offices beyond, and Grisell was at once installed in a fine carved chair by the fire--a more comfortable seat than had ever fallen to her share.|$|R

In the Dominus Flevit Church on Mount Olives a 7th-century Byzantine chapel was unearthed in 1955. The floor is richly decorated with intersecting circles and pictures of fruit, leaves, flowers, and fish. A Greek inscription mentions Simon, who [...] "decorated this place of prayer in honor of Jesus". In the nearby Church of the Agony (built originally in the last decades of the 4th century) a colorful mosaic floor was discovered in 1920 which follows a geometric design. Fragments of a similar geometric mosaic floor were preserved in the Basilica of St. Stephen (outside the Damascus Gate) which was built by Empress Aelia Eudocia {{in the first half of}} the 5th century.|$|R
