40|$|In Malaysia, {{many cases}} of {{children}} get trapped and suffocated in the unattended vehicle were reported and the cases are in increasing trend. It is very surprising that the death caused by the non-moving vehicle keep increasing even though the awareness campaign on the safety of children in non-moving vehicle were carried out by government. The methods that were introduced by previous researchers to detect the present {{of the children in}} the unattended vehicle such as the usage of capacitive sensor, microwave sensor, pressure sensor and image sensor have yet to be effective to reduce the number of death in the unattended vehicle. Thus, the research is carried out to provide a comprehensive child detection and feedback system in unattended vehicle by combining the usage of human physiological signals such as voice and body odor with temperature and motion detection systems. The system will integrate all the detection signals and then provide the efficient feedback <b>system</b> by triggering <b>vehicle</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> and sending message to parents. If no response from parents or no response on <b>vehicle</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system,</b> the proposed system then will integrate with the existing vehicle security system, ignition system and power window by activating those system. The proposed system is tested successfully to detect the voice, odor and motion of children in vehicle. The project is now at prototype stage and capable to detect the present of voice, odor, motion and temperature in the vehicle accurately and provide the efficient feedback system by sending the message to parents, activating the <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> and controlling the window movement in order to release the high temperature and toxic gas from the vehicle. The outcome of the project will benefit the security and vehicle manufacturing industry due to the simple design, low cost and easy handling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Keeping safe {{distance}} between two cars {{is an important}} topic for car accident prevention. This paper presents a practical nighttime vehicle distance measuring method based on a single CCD image. The method combines the image-based distance measuring system (IBDMS) with nighttime <b>vehicle</b> distance <b>alarm</b> <b>system.</b> To solve the nighttime feature extraction problem, the proposed method uses two taillights as the feature. Based on the proportionality of similar triangles, distance between a CCD camera and taillight of the vehicle ahead can be measured. The method focuses on detecting taillight and differentiating the targeted vehicle from others {{on the basis of}} partial image analysis instead of whole image processing. As a result, high-speed processing and simple configuration of the proposed method have been achieved as demonstrated in this paper. 1...|$|R

The study of telecommunication is an interesting field because it involves digital signal processing, signal and systems, programming and more. This inspires people to improvise the technology into daily use. In this project, the technology of telecommunication, to be specific; SMS, is integrated or improvised to the present vehicle security system. Instead of human to human telecommunication, this system creates new entity which is machine to human telecommunication. This system is an upgrading and improving vehicle security system by integrating SMS features to alert vehicle owners whenever intrusion occurs. This project involves hardware and software parts construction and the integration of both parts to create the system. We succeed in achieving the objective and in fact, add another feature to the system which will initiates a call to the owner after sending the SMS.

There are different <b>vehicle</b> <b>alarm</b> and security <b>systems</b> with one or more limitations. In this paper, a low cost and efficient vehicle tracking and security system using Global Positioning System (GPS) is developed. The system consists of a hardware device (in-vehicle unit) installed in the vehicle to be tracked and a user/control phone. The device receives signal from the GPS satellites, send this data to the authorized user’s phone by Short Message Service (SMS) {{with the help of the}} Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) module placed in the device. The data that is been sent to the control phone is processed and fed into a Geographic information System (GIS) interface for the graphical location information display. The developed system also has the ability of stopping and starting the car by the connected relay when codes in form of SMS are sent to the in-vehicle unit from the authorized user of the system. The test results show that, the developed system is highly accurate and effective in determining location of vehicle and it is of high performance...|$|R
