50|$|Some {{criticism}} of the Homeland Security Grant Program {{has come from the}} distribution of funds. Not unlike other federal funding programs, the HSGP distributes a portion of funding based on population and distributes the remainder of funding evenly. For its part, the HSGP distributes 60% of funds on the basis of population, and the other 40% is evenly spread across all recipients regardless of population. Wyoming for instance, despite being the least populous state, received more funding per capita in homeland security grants than any other state in 2004. At $45.22 per citizen of the state, Wyoming received more than four times the amount of funding per citizen given to either California or New York.Another criticism has come from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in regards to the risk-based grant methodology. Although the GAO concluded that the overall risk-based methodology (threat, vulnerability and consequences) was reasonable, the absence of a proper way to measure variations in vulnerability greatly reduce the value of the vulnerability portion of the assessment. Ultimately, they concluded that the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> as part of its risk analysis model should be amended to better capture variations in vulnerability across the different states and urban areas it assesses.|$|E

New challenges to track information changes in real time require new methods in web information retrieval using multi agent system (MAS) technology. This research continues previous work on extracting data from online social networks (OSNs) by using an agent in each user profile to monitor its updates, which are sent to a controller agent that saves a history of each user’s activity in a local repository, as well as applying a <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> to users ’ profiles. An algorithm making use of MAS within the online social network retrieval system (OSNRS) is proposed. Our experiments on data extraction show that using MAS simplifies the process of tracking profile’s history and opens the opportunity of understanding the dynamic behaviour of OSN users especially when it is combined with text mining. The application of the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> over time highlighted {{that in the case of}} this experiment the structure of the node’s network, rather than the contents of the node, changed over time.

In applied work typically static versions of these measures are used so that the effect of asset changes on welfare is ignored. Unless the policymaker’s concern with household welfare is myopic, policy design requires welfare measures that incorporate the dynamics of asset accumulation. We use a simple microeconomic growth model to show that the use of a static or dynamic welfare measure affects the choice between three types of interventions (transfers, productivity enhancements and reductions in risk). We also show (using data for rural households in Zimbabwe) that the composition of the group of low-welfare households may change dramatically over time. For both reasons static poverty (or <b>vulnerability)</b> <b>measures</b> may be a poor basis for policy. Using the Zimbabwe example we show that when it is not feasible to estimate a structural dynamic model then the accuracy of existing regression-based <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measures</b> can be greatly improved by including asset measures in the regression. ...|$|R

We also define a class of <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measures</b> on graphs similar to the edge-connectivity of graphs and show how it is related to r-balanced graphs. All these definitions are matroidal and the definitions of r-balanced matroids naturally extend the definitions of r-balanced graphs. The <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measures</b> in graphs that we define are ranked and are lesser than the edge-connectivity. Due to the relationship of the r-balanced graphs with the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measures</b> defined in the dissertation, identifying r-balanced graphs and calculating the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measures</b> in graphs prove to be useful in the area of network survivability.

This {{can lead to the}} profile owners being vulnerable to privacy and social engineering attacks which include identity theft, stalking and re identification by linking. Due to a need to address privacy in OSNs, this thesis presents a framework to quantify the vulnerability of a user¿s OSN profile. Vulnerability is defined as the likelihood that the personal details displayed on an OSN profile will spread due to the actions of the profile owner and their friends in regards to information disclosure. The <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> consists of three components. The individual vulnerability is calculated by allocating weights to profile attribute values disclosed and neighbourhood features which may contribute towards the personal vulnerability of the profile user. The relative vulnerability is the collective vulnerability of the profiles¿ friends. The absolute vulnerability is the overall profile vulnerability which considers the individual and relative vulnerabilities. The first part of the framework details a data retrieval approach to extract MySpace profile data to test the vulnerability algorithm using real cases. The profile structure presented significant extraction problems because of the dynamic nature of the OSN. Issues of the usability of a standard dataset including ethical concerns are discussed. Application of the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> on extracted data emphasised how so called ¿private profiles¿ are not immune to vulnerability issues. This is because some profile details can still be displayed on private profiles. The second part of the framework presents the normalisation of the measure, {{in the context of a}} formal approach which includes the development of axioms and validation of the measure but with a larger dataset of profiles. The axioms highlight that changes in the presented list of profile attributes, and the attributes¿ weights in making the profile vulnerable, affect the individual vulnerability of a profile. iii Validation of the measure showed that vulnerability involving OSN profiles does occur and this provides a good basis for other researchers to build on the measure further. The novelty of this <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> is that it takes into account not just the attributes presented on each individual profile but features of the profiles¿ neighbourhood...|$|E

The contribution of this paper is twofold: it sheds light on the timely debate on vulnerability to poverty from trade openness focusing on micro linkages between trade liberalisation and household consumption over a longer time span than is usually covered by current literature; it proposes a new <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> capable of assessing, besides the non-stochastic poverty determinants and the observed impact of shocks on households, the net welfare effect of risk-induced "ex-ante" changing behaviour, using cross-sectional data. The main results of this paper are the following: it highlights the presence of a growing phenomenon of vulnerability induced by risk exposure alongside the reduction of poverty rates in Vietnam; it demonstrates the presence of a negative welfare effect of "ex ante" changing behaviour induced by risk exposure. On the top of that, it assesses robust heterogeneity in vulnerability according to households' relative position in trade related activities. Our empirical results are relevant for policymaking.

40|$|Abstract—Cascading {{failures}} are {{the typical}} reasons of black-outs in power grids. The grid topology {{plays an important}} role in determining the dynamics of cascading failures in power grids. Measures for vulnerability analysis are crucial to assure a higher level of robustness of power grids. Metrics from Complex Networks are widely used to investigate the grid vulnerability. Yet, these purely topological metrics fail to capture the real behaviour of power grids. This paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, as a <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> to de-termine the critical components in a power grid. Differently than the existing purely topological measures, the effective graph resistance accounts for the electrical properties of power grids such as power flow allocation according to Kirchoff laws. To demonstrate the applicability of the effective graph resistance, a quantitative vulnerability assessment of the IEEE 118 buses power system is performed. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the effective graph resistance to identify the critical transmission lines in a power grid. I...|$|E

The first two are purely topological metrics. The blackout size calculation results from a model of cascading failure in power networks. Testing the response of 40 areas within the Eastern US power grid and a standard IEEE test case to a variety of attack/failure vectors indicates that directed attacks result in larger failures using all three <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measures,</b> but the attack vectors that appear to cause the most damage depend on the measure chosen. While our topological and power grid model results show some trends that are similar, there is only a mild correlation between the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measures</b> for individual simulations.

Here we conduct Monte Carlo experiments designed to explore the performance of different estimators with different measures, under different assumptions regarding the underlying economic environment.

If the <b>vulnerability</b> <b>measure</b> is risk-sensitive, but consumption is measured with error, a simple estimator proposed by the authors(2003) generally performs best.
