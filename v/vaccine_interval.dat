40|$|Background. The {{monovalent}} meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (PsA-TT, MenAfriVac) {{was developed}} {{for use in the}} “meningitis belt ” of sub-Saharan Africa. Mali was 1 of 3 countries selected for early introduction. As this is a new vaccine, postlicensure surveillance is particularly important to identify and characterize possible safety issues. Methods. The national vaccination campaign was phased from September 2010 to November 2011. We conducted postlicensure safety surveillance for PsA-TT in 40 government clinics from southern Mali serving approximately 400 000 people 1 – 29 years of age. We conducted analyses with individual-level data and population-level data, and we calculated rates of adverse events using the conditional exact test, a modified <b>vaccine</b> cohort risk <b>interval</b> method, and a modified self-controlled case series method for each outcome of interest, including 18 prespecified adverse events and 18 syndromic categories. Results. An increased rate of clinic visits for fever within 3 days after vaccination was found using multiple methods for all age groups. Although other signals were found with some methods, complete assessment of all other prespecified outcomes and syndromic categories did not reveal that PsA-TT was consistently associated with any other health problem.

The large numbers allowed investigation of possible predictors of immune response and reactogenicity. We used regression analysis {{to examine the}} effect of variables including past receipt of seasonal <b>vaccine,</b> antipyretics post-vaccination, <b>interval</b> between doses and pre-existing antibodies to H 1 N 1 (2009) on immunogenicity. We also examined the relationship between immunogenicity and reactogenicity and whether prior infection or underlying conditions affected reactogenicity. For both vaccines, haemagglutination-inhibition titres were 60 % higher in children with fever ? 38 °C after vaccination and 29 % lower in those previously given seasonal vaccine. Early use of antipyretics did not affect immunogenicity. Post-vaccination titres were higher with longer intervals between doses and in those with evidence of prior infection, but reactogenicity in the latter was unaffected. In the adjuvanted vaccine group, reactions were more common in children with atopy. Both vaccines were safe and immunogenic in those with prior infection. Reduction in the interval between doses for earlier protection would be at the cost of reduced immunogenicity. The effect of seasonal vaccine on immunogenicity merits further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Commonly, tetanus is {{a disease}} of the acve age (5 to 40 years). This period predisposes {{to all kinds of}} trauma and therefore, the risk of {{acquiring}} the disease is pretty high. Tetanus occurring in the newborn is known as “ Neonatal tetanus “ which is a killer disease, second only to measles among the six target disease of EPI. Even with treatment, the case‐fatality rate can be as high as 80 – 90 percent (virtually 100 percent). WHO defines elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT) as less than 1 neonatal tetanus (NT) case per 1000 live births (LBs) in every district. While progress has been made, by the end of 2008 MNT sll remains major public health problem in 46 countries, Sudan being one of them.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} hepatitis B vaccine when added to the routine expanded programme on immunisation under field conditions in rural Africa. DESIGN [...] Infants were immunised according to two schedules [...] an early schedule at birth, 3 months, and 6 months and a later schedule to correspond with routine vaccination in the expanded programme on immunisation at 3 months, 4 1 / 2 months, and 6 months. SETTING [...] Venda, northern Transvaal, South Africa, a self governing region of 7460 square kilometers varying from rural villages to small towns. SUBJECTS [...] The 1989 birth cohort of Venda. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Coverage for hepatitis B vaccine at first, second, and third doses; serological assessment of vaccine efficacy by prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen in infants who had completed the three dose course of immunisation; antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen to determine if natural infection occurred. RESULTS [...] Vaccine coverage for hepatitis B dropped sharply from 99 % to 53 % to 39 % for the first, second, and third dose respectively. In contrast, vaccine coverage was maintained at 97 - 99 % for the three doses of poliomyelitis vaccine. Serological evaluation of vaccine efficacy showed that only 3. 5 % of recipients of all three doses failed to develop antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. Only 6. 6 % of vaccine recipients were vaccinated according to either the early or later schedules whereas 93. 4 % received their doses of <b>vaccine</b> at <b>intervals</b> {{beyond the limits of}} either of the planned schedules. There was, however, no significant difference in seroconversion to the surface antigen between the "unscheduled" or scheduled groups of those who were vaccinated according to the early or late schedules. The pattern of prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, which showed a sharp fall in children aged over 7 months, suggested that the antibodies were acquired passively rather than by active infection. CONCLUSIONS [...] Supplementation of the present expanded programme on immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine in rural Africa is fraught with difficulties. However, the vaccine was effective within a fairly wide spacing of dosage. Adding hepatitis B vaccine to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis as a tetravalent vaccine is proposed as a means of effectively integrating it into the expanded programme on immunisation in Third World settings...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: The risk of {{developing}} chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is 5 % in general population but can reach up to 20 % in HIV patients. The response rate to HBV vaccine in HIV infected patients is 23. 8 - 56 percent. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate response of HIV-infected patients to 20 µg dose of recombinant HBV vaccine. Materials & Methods: In this quasi experimental study, 51 subjects, sampled through census, were HIV patients who had HBsAg negative test in HIV/AIDS counseling and care center. Patients were vaccinated with 20 µg of recombinant HBV <b>vaccine,</b> IM at <b>intervals</b> of 0, 1 and 6 months. Response to the vaccine was checked 2 months after the last injection. Data were analyzed with SPSS software, using descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests. Results: The mean age of the patients was 33. 68 ± 8. 37 years. Two patients were female (3. 9 %) and 49 patients were male (96. 1 %). Mean of hepatitis B antibody level was 47. 55 ± 71. 58 mIU/ml. The levels of antibody in different patients were as follow: 31 patients (60. 8 %) 10 mIU/ml. There was no significant correlation between antibody levels and CD 4 + cell count (correlation coefficient = - 0. 191). Conclusion: Response to hepatitis B vaccination is low in HIV infected patients. Conventional dose of HBV vaccine is not enough to get protective immunity. Therefore, two-fold dose of vaccine dose, repeat of conventional dose or increasing of interval administration of hepatitis B vaccine should be considered in future studies...|$|R

The live vaccine contains surface proteins (HA, NA) from the wild-type virus A/equine/Otar/ 764 / 2007 (Н 3 N 8; American Lineage Florida Clade 2), and internal proteins (PB 2, PB 1, PA, NP, M, NS) from the attenuated Ca donor virus A/Hong Kong/ 1 / 68 / 162 / 35 CA (H 3 N 2). To determine {{the safety and}} duration of the protective immune responses, 90 yearlings were intranasally vaccinated in single mode, double mode at an interval of 42 days (107. 0 EID 50 /animal for both vaccinations), or with PBS (control group). Ten animals from each group were challenged with the homologous wild-type virus A/equine/Otar/ 764 / 07 (Н 3 N 8) at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 12 months after vaccination. Similarly, 10 animals from each group were challenged with the heterologous wild-type virus A/equine/Sydney/ 2888 - 8 / 07 (Н 3 N 8; American Lineage Florida Clade 1) 12 months after vaccination. The vaccine was completely safe, and single intranasal vaccination of yearlings was capable of inducing statistically significant (from P= 0. 03 to P< 0. 0001) clinical and virological protection against the homologous virus; however, only double mode vaccination generated significant (from P= 0. 02 to P< 0. 0001) protection against the heterologous virus at 12 months (observation period). Interestingly, this vaccine enables the differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals.

The amplified gene was cloned into pET 28 c, transformed into Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) and got expressed after IPTG induction. The recombinant protein was then purified using Ni-NTA and named r 78. Three groups of mice were immunized with 10  μg of r 78 plus MPL-A, r 78 encapsulated in positively charged liposomes and control animals immunized with PBS. Two booster doses were given with the respective <b>vaccine</b> at an <b>interval</b> of 2 weeks each. Mice were challenged with 1  ×  107 Leishmania promastigotes and sacrificed on different post infection/challenge days. ResultsImmunization with r 78 along with MPL-A and liposome-encapsulated r 78 brought {{a significant reduction in}} parasite load. In comparison to the infected controls, the parasite load declined by 96. 2 % in mice immunized with r 78 plus MPL-A and 97. 23 % in animals immunized with liposome-encapsulated r 78. The immunized animals also exhibited profound DTH response. The serum antibody responses increased from 15 to 90 days post infection/challenge. Immunized animals showed greater IgG 2 a levels and lesser IgG 1 levels in comparison to the infected controls. The splenocytes from immunized mice were cultured, stimulated with r 78 and analyzed for cytokine profile. The levels of IL- 2 and IFN-γ were greater in immunized animals as compared to control mice.
