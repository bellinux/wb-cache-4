40|$|Extraordinary {{variation}} {{has been}} found in mitochondrial (mt) genome inheritance, gene content and arrangement among bivalves. However, only few bivalve mt genomes have been comparatively analyzed to infer their evolutionary scenarios. In this study, the complete mt genome of the venerid Paphia euglypta (Bivalvia: Veneridae) was firstly studied and, secondly, it was comparatively analyzed with other <b>venerids</b> (e. g., Venerupis philippinarum and Meretrix petechialis) to better understand the mt genome evolution within a family. Though several common features such as the AT content, codon usage of protein-coding genes, and AT/GC skew are shared by the three <b>venerids,</b> a high level of variability is observed in genome size, gene content, gene order, arrangements and primary sequence of nucleotides or amino acids. Most of the gene rearrangement {{can be explained by the}} "tandem duplication and random loss'' model. From the observed rearrangement patterns, we speculate that block interchange between adjacent genes may be common in the evolution of mt genomes in <b>venerids.</b> Furthermore, this study presents several new findings in mt genome annotation of V. philippinarum and M. petechialis, and hence we have reannotated the genome of these two species as: (1) the ORF of the formerly annotated cox 2 gene in V. philippinarum is deduced by using a truncated "T" codon and a second cox 2 gene is identified; (2) the trnS-AGN gene is identified and marked in the mt genome of both <b>venerids.</b> Thus, this study demonstrated a high variability of mt genomes in the Veneridae, and showed the importance of comparative mt genome analysis to interpret the evolution of the bivalve mt genome...|$|E
40|$|Several {{issues in}} the methods of reconstructing paleoecology of the Mesozoic brackish-water bivalves, the {{contents}} of the bivalve assemblages and their paleoenvironments in Japan are discussed. The brackish-water environments can be reconstructed as shallow marine environments associated with fluvial systems on the basis of facies analysis. Paleoecology of bivalve fossils is inferred from their modes of occurrence in each depositional environment. Here, descriptions are given for two examples of paleoecologic analysis of the Mesozoic bivalve faunas : (1) Comparisons between the "mid"-Cretaceous Goshoura Group and the Upper Cretaceous Himenoura Group; both groups are characterized by brackish-water-influenced tidal flat deposits containing abundant true oyster (Crassostrea). Infaunal bivalves of the "mid"-Cretaceous assemblage are characterized by neomiodontids, although those of the Upper Cretaceous assemblage are represented by <b>venerids.</b> (2) Another example is the taxonomy and paleoecology of the Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous primitive Crassostrea. These oysters are ecologically similar to recent Crassostrea, but compared with recent species, shell sizes of the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous materials are small. Their shell structures are characterized by poorly developed chambers and chalky deposits, which suggest more archaic conditions...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{analysed}} {{the nuclear}} ITS 2 rRNA primary sequence and secondary structure in Veneridae and comparatively with 20 Bivalvia taxa {{to test the}} phylogenetic resolution of this marker and its suitability for molecular diagnosis at different taxonomic levels. Maximum-Likelihood and Bayesian trees based on primary sequences were congruent with (Profile-) Neighbor-Joining trees based on a combined model of sequence-structure evolution. ITS 2 showed higher resolution below the subfamily level, up to the intraspecific level, providing a phylogenetic signal comparable to (mitochondrial and/or nuclear) gene fragments two-five times longer. Structural elements of the ITS 2 folding, such as specific mismatch pairing and compensatory base changes, provided further support for the monophyly of some groups and for their phylogenetic relationships. Veneridae ITS 2 folding is structured in six domains (DI-VI) and shows five striking sequence-structure features. Two of them, the Basal and Apical STEMs, are common to Bivalvia, while the presence of both the Branched STEM and the Y/R stretches occurs in five superfamilies of the two Heterodonta orders Myoida and Veneroida, thus questioning their reciprocal monophyly.

40|$|Background: The species {{boundaries}} of some <b>venerids</b> {{are difficult to}} define based solely on morphological features due to their indistinct intra- and interspecific phenotypic variability. An unprecedented biodiversity crisis caused by human activities has emerged. Thus, to access the biological diversity and further the conservation of this taxonomically muddling bivalve group, a fast and simple approach that can efficiently examine species boundaries and highlight areas of unrecognized diversity is urgently needed. DNA barcoding has proved its effectiveness in high-volume species identification and discovery. In the present study, Chinese fauna was chosen to examine whether this molecular biomarker is sensitive enough for species delimitation, and how it complements taxonomy and explores species diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 315 specimens from around 60 venerid species were included, qualifying the present study as the first major analysis of DNA barcoding for marine bivalves. Nearly all individuals identified to species level based on morphological traits possessed distinct barcode clusters, except for the specimens of one species pair. Among the 26 individuals that were not assigned binomial names a priori, twelve respectively nested within a species genealogy. The remaining individuals formed five monophyletic clusters that potentially represent species new to science or at least unreported in China. Five putative hidden species were also uncovered in traditional morphospecies. Conclusions/Significance: The present study shows that DNA barcoding is effective in species delimitation and can ai...|$|E

A total of 1258 individuals (632 in winter and 626 in summer) and 62 taxa representing polychaetes, crustaceans, bivalves, echinoderms, bryozoans, sponges, cnidarians and cephalochordates were collected. Benthic assemblages in the upper estuary were unlike those in the lower estuary and a clear substitution of benthic taxa along the estuary was observed. Macrofaunal invertebrates in the low salinity region, composed of coarse sediments, were dominated by tellinids, <b>venerids</b> (bivalves), cirolanids (isopods), cyclopoids (copepods), and nereidids (polychaetes). While the high salinity region, composed of fine sediments, were dominated by nuculids (bivalves), cirratulids (polychaetes), and by amphiurids (ophiuroids). The Paraguaçu estuarine system is not severely affected by anthropogenic activities. In {{the great majority of}} the study sites, concentrations of trace metals and PAHs in the sediments were near background values. Nutrients values were also low.

40|$|Bivalves and {{gastropods}} {{landed in}} Belgium are {{taken as a}} by-catch of fisheries targeting finfish or crustaceans, and the nation has never had specialized molluscan fisheries. Species landed consist mainly of whelk, Buccinum undatum; and scallops, Pecten maximus and Chlamys spp. Long-term trends in the landings of mollusks {{are closely related to}} long-term changes in fleet and vessel size, gear types used, fishing grounds and target species, and demand on the local market. In the 1950 ' s, the annual landings of whelk fluctuated between 80 and 200 t, while those of scallop were insubstantial. Since then, the landings gradually rose to record figures of 678 t for whelk and 762 t for scallop in the mid- 1970 's. Most recently, there has, however, been a substantial drop in the landings of both species. Provisional figures for 1991 and 1992 revealed an almost 50 % decrease in landings for whelk, and 80 % decrease for scallop. Documented history on mollusk trade and consumption in the area nowadays called Belgium goes back to {{the early days of the}} Roman occupation. A regional seafood specialty in Belgium is "moules frites" (blue mussels, steam boiled with a mixture of vegetables, and served with French fries). In 1990, over 30, 000 t of mussels were consumed, all of which were imported, mostly from the Netherlands.

40|$|Clam culture {{industry}} is rising every year worldwide. The most produced species is the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. China {{is the main}} producer country followed by Italy, South Korea, USA and Spain. The introduction of the Manila clam in Europe was between 1970 and 1980. R. philippinarum is well adapted and grows faster than native species R. decussatus, for this, is the most produced species in Europe. The production of <b>venerids</b> in Galicia {{is a very important}} socio-economic resource. The production of Manila clam in Galicia rose in the last years and now is the most produced species too. The infection by Perkinsus olseni {{is one of the most}} serious diseases affecting clams. The parasite is highly distributed worldwide and affect to a large list of molluscs. Mortality of R. decussatus and R. philippinarum was associated with P. olseni infection in south Europe as well as with R. philippinarum mortality in several Asian countries. Two species of the genus Perkinsus, P. olseni and P. marinus, are included in the list of notifiable diseases of the World Organization for Animal Health, which indicates the interest to stop the expansion of the disease. The knowledge of P. olseni is very scarce in comparison with P. marinus which provokes massive mortalities in oysters Crassostrea virginica in USA. The economic transcendence of the perkinsosis justifies the research for a better knowledge of the disease and minimizes their effects. With this purpose, this study was developed in order to know (1) the variability of P. olseni along the Spanish coast, with the emphasis in virulence variability among populations, and (2) the modulation of the Manila clam protein expression due to P. olseni infection, with emphasis in the search of protein markers of resistance to the disease. The study of the variability was done analyzing the genetic population structure as well as the proteome of P. olseni clons derived from several regions of the Spanish coast. Furthermore, the proteome of P. olseni was compared with the proteome of two species of the genus, P. marinus and P. chesapeaki, in order to amplify the perspective of the variability of P. olseni. The analysis of the modulation of the Manila clam protein expression due to P. olseni infection was focused in haemocytes and haemolymph. The effect of the exposition to P. olseni in clams was measured at short time and a long time with the aim in the modulation of the immune response of the clam to the parasite...|$|E
40|$|In {{southern}} South America {{little is}} known about the biotic response of marine species to large scale climate variability during the Holocene. Fossil shells of the aragonitic bivalve Retrotapes exalbidus (previously called Eurhomalea) offer the possibility to investigate climate variability in the Beagle Channel and past seasonal dynamics of sea water temperature during the mid-to-late-Holocene. This selection is based on two reasons: extant R. exalbidus preserve annual increments in the outer shell layer (Lomovasky et al., 2002 J. Sea Research 48, 209 - 216); and, although not very common as other <b>venerids,</b> this species is well preserved in different Holocene marine outcrops along the channel. Holocene fossil shells of R. exalbidus were sectioned, polished, photographed and measured, and after examination three of them were selected for chemical sampling. In each case, one-half of the shell was used to resolve the annual growth bands and the other half was used for stable isotopes sampling. In addition, a fragment of each shell was used to C- 14 dating performed in the Poznań Radiocarbon Laboratory with the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) technique. Ontogenetic ages were measured by counting the annual growth increments under a stereo microscope. Our results show differences between the three specimens. In the ontogenetic oldest individual (14 years), which gave a calibrated mean value age of 3839 BP, the δ 18 O values ranged from 1. 53 ‰ to – 1. 16 ‰. The two other specimens (8 years), with calibrated mean ages of 5190 BP and 431 BP, gave δ 18 O values from 1. 55 ‰ to 0. 44 ‰ in the oldest specimen, and from 1. 29 ‰ to 0. 72 ‰, in the youngest one. Besides, we found variations in annual growth increment widths at different radiocarbon ages, probably correlated with environmental changes over the mid-to-late Holocene. We correlated the most positive δ 18 O values with winter and the most negative δ 18 O with summer. In addition, the summer values around 3800 yr BP are more negative than around 5000 years or 500 years BP. These findings correlate well with an episode of cooling at ca. 5000 BP, followed by a period of ameliorization (the Hypsithermal at ca. 4000 BP), and towards the end of the Holocene, at ca. 500 years BP, a new cooling event was recorded. This sclerochronological study of the growth patterns and the oxygen isotope ratios in fossil R. exalbidus shells demonstrated that this species clearly exhibited annual cycles showing seasonality patterns through the mid-to-late Holocene, providing an opportunity to analyze intra-seasonal time scales in the fossil record.
