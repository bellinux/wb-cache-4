5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch <b>videotape</b> for initial {{broadcast}} and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than <b>videotape.</b> It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas <b>videotape</b> was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and <b>videotape.</b> Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on <b>videotape.</b>|$|E
5|$|Canadian singer-songwriter Mac DeMarco has {{released}} three studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays (EPs), three singles, and 17 music videos. DeMarco was in several bands {{in high school}} until he graduated in 2008. In 2009, he released his debut EP, Heat Wave, under the name Makeout <b>Videotape.</b> The EP sold out its 500-unit run. DeMarco was joined by Alex Calder and Jen Clement, and Makeout <b>Videotape</b> was signed to Unfamiliar Records. Heat Wave was followed by two EPs, Eating Like a Kid and Bossa Yeye, and one studio album, Ying Yang, all in 2010.|$|E
40|$|The uses, pitfalls, and {{mechanics}} of <b>videotaping</b> for educational research are summarized [...] The first section discusses methodological aspects of <b>videotaping,</b> suggesting {{the capabilities of}} the technique and specific uses for <b>videotaping</b> in research studies. Diiadvantages are also detailed, and a simple framing technique is aetcribed which can insure that the research task is amenable to <b>videotaping.</b> Under procedural 'aspects of <b>videotaping,</b> the discussion covers equipment considerations, including selection, tape format, and maintenance. The physical setup for <b>videotaping</b> is then explained, with emphasis on eamera placement, procedures, materials, and audio recording, including types of microphones and subject placement. Specific video recording methods are presented and include suggestions for focus, lighting, and camera placement. Tape and equipment storage guidelines are also suggested. Six references tied a glossary of technical terms are provided. An appendix summarizes and lists the specific, sequential steps in videorecording, from preparation through production and equipment storage.

40|$|The consumers' home use of {{videocassette}} recorders {{to record}} TV programmes or motion pictures has concerned copyright owners, who fear that their economic interest will be jeopardized. The 1976 US Copyright Act is {{silent on the}} issue of private, non-commercial home <b>videotaping.</b> The US Supreme Court, in the Betamax case, has ruled that private, non-commercial home <b>videotaping</b> is not a copyright infringement. However, neither the law nor the ruling has actually resolved the fundamental copyright problem associated with home <b>videotaping.</b> This article proposes a number of public and private policy options for reaching an optimal solution.

5000|$|DeYoung was {{the first}} person in 19 years in the United States to have the {{execution}} <b>videotaped</b> and the first in which execution by lethal injection was recorded. The previous <b>videotaped</b> execution had been a gas chamber execution that took place in California. Other states are now considering <b>videotaping</b> executions. [...] There is open discussion concerning whether or not making executions public would sway people to be more for or more against the death penalty.|$|R
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} <b>videotape</b> there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The <b>videotape</b> can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E

Al-Zawahri's four-minute address was titled The Aggression against Lal Masjid and {{dedicated}} solely to the clash between the Lal Masjid militants and the Pakistan Army. The video was released by al-Qaeda's media wing, as-Sahab and subtitled in English.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a 35mm film telerecording rather than on <b>videotape.</b> This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy of the play is known to exist.|$|E
5|$|Between {{approximately}} 1967 and 1978, {{large quantities}} of <b>videotape</b> and film stored in the BBC's Engineering department and film libraries, respectively, were wiped or destroyed {{to make way for}} newer programmes. This happened for several reasons, primarily the belief that there was no practical value to its retention.|$|E
5|$|Censorship {{and musical}} rights issues kept a complete, {{pristine}} version of Witchfinder General from being released on <b>videotape,</b> laserdisc or DVD for many years. Although uncensored theatrical prints {{have been available}} for archival showings in the US for several years, video releases of the title were repeatedly compromised.|$|E
50|$|The {{manner in}} which <b>videotaping</b> is {{implemented}} holds the potential for bias. This bias can be avoided by using an equal-focus perspective. This finding has been replicated numerous times, reflecting the growing uses of <b>videotaped</b> confessions in trial proceedings.|$|R

5|$|The Israeli {{government}} {{arranged for}} the trial to have prominent media coverage. Capital Cities Broadcasting Corporation of the United States obtained exclusive rights to <b>videotape</b> the proceedings for television broadcast. Many major newspapers {{from all over the}} globe sent reporters and published front-page coverage of the story. The trial was held at the Beit Ha'am (today known as the Gerard Behar Center), an auditorium in central Jerusalem. Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass booth to protect him from assassination attempts. The building was modified to allow journalists to watch the trial on closed-circuit television, and 750 seats were available in the auditorium itself. Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings, and <b>videotape</b> was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day.|$|E

40|$|Three young autistic {{adults were}} trained to {{purchase}} items. Training was conducted in one setting with concurrent generalization probes taken in three community stores. Training in one setting failed to produce generalization to the three probe settings. Generalization training, which consisted of viewing <b>videotapes</b> of models who purchased items in the probe settings and answering questions about the models' responses, was then introduced. Training with the <b>videotapes</b> resulted in generalization to the three community stores.
