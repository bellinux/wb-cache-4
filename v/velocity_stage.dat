It used a Strassburg-Kehl FuG 203 radio guidance system powered by a propeller-driven (mounted on the nose) electric generator. The missile needed two crew on the launch aircraft to control it, one operator used a reflector-type sight to aim at the target and the other flew the missile using a joystick and another sight paired to the first with a servo system.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeismic array based {{analysis}} of the major Kokoxili earthquake (Tibet, 14 November 2001) yields an unambiguous reconstruction of the seismic rupture history and relates it to the generated seismic radiation. We demonstrate that after a classical sub-Rayleigh <b>velocity</b> <b>stage,</b> the rupture speed has jumped to supershear values close to compressional wave velocity over a 175 -km-long fault segment, before abruptly slowing down in the late part of the earthquake. The transition locations between these three phases are correlated with the fault geometry and {{are associated with the}} most energetic radiation. This observation proves that the rupture velocity changes, as theoretically predicted, are a primary source of high-frequency seismic radiation. This result requires reconsidering the origins of seismic damage, generally attributed to slip variations...|$|E
40|$|Single bubble {{velocity}} profile (velocity vs. distance) has been measured for a 1. 45 mm diameter bubble {{to try to}} explain reported differences in gas holdup in two systems: F 150 vs. 1 -pentanol, and MIBC vs. NaCl. It was found that in F 150 the bubble slowed rapidly to reach the terminal <b>velocity</b> <b>stage</b> of the profile while in 1 -pentanol the bubble remained in the deceleration stage and was consequently moving faster, at almost twice the speed. The lower rise velocity in F 150 means longer bubble residence time and corresponding higher gas holdup than with 1 -pentanol, as reported. In the second system, the bubble in MIBC reached terminal velocity more rapidly than in NaCl which agrees with the reported higher gas holdup in MIBC compared to NaCl. An implication for gas holdup evaluation is that the value may depend {{on the part of the}} {{velocity profile}} over which it is measured.

30|$|There {{are three}} stages {{for the upper}} motion debris: stage I is when the motion {{velocity}} continues to increase, although the debris {{has not yet been}} in contact with the substrate materials. As shown in Fig.  5, the motion velocities of particles both in front and postmedian are slightly increased after they leave the movement section. Stage II is when the motion velocity rapidly decelerates, and strong interactions occur between the motion debris and substrate materials (impacting, scouring and erosion cause great energy dissipation for the motion debris). The velocity sharply decreases when the sliding masses encounter the bed materials accumulated in the flume, activating the bed materials through the transmission of kinetic energy. The frontal particle will bound up and then undergo a process of deceleration and acceleration in sequence. The process of impact with the substrate and bouncing off the bed can last for several cycles, but the fragment will slide along the bed with decreasing <b>velocity.</b> <b>Stage</b> III is the continued motion process, with a gradual decrease in the overall velocity as the bed materials mix into the upper motion debris. The particles in the postmedian section bounce off the bed the first time it encounters the substrate, and then move down along the surface of the bed, decelerating until they stop. During the deceleration process, part of the consumed energy will be transmitted to the static substrate materials which then are entrained. Furthermore, the velocity fluctuates when the particles move forward because of the collision of the following particles.|$|E
40|$|Code {{and data}} files {{available}} with hard {{copy of the}} thesis in the library. Lahars and other mass flows are highly hazardous phenomena that can pose great risk to areas in their path. Due to their often unpredictable onsets, scientific observations are limited. In addition, the erosive capabilities of a lahar mean that {{the most commonly used}} monitoring and sampling methods, such as load cells and bedload traps, are often damaged early in the flow. The cost of repair and maintenance of these instrumentation prohibits comprehensive coverage of each channel that might be at risk from lahars. The development of seismic sensors as an alternative monitoring method could prove effective as they do not require contact with a flow and are therefore less at risk from damage. The complex behaviour of a lahar can be witnessed in the geophysical record of its passage which, in combination with more traditional monitoring methods, can be used to record the detailed evolution of a flow. The three-dimensional analysis of seismometer recordings can provide an approximation of the frontal velocity that may differ from maximum velocity estimates made using super-elevation calculations. Comparisons of the seismic records of different mass flow types illustrate {{that it is possible to}} differentiate between them. Frequency analysis allows for the distinction of the flow mechanisms, particle interactions, and dominant rheology of a lahar. Low frequencies are more indicative of bedload frictional motion, while higher frequencies reflect the collisional impacts of particles, either between themselves or with the substrate. Detailed records of a flow at a single site provide a comprehensive understanding of the temporal variations that occur within the duration of a lahar, while comparative analyses of numerous sites along a channel highlight its downstream evolution. While initial onset signals can be recorded at local-to-source sites, they are attenuated too quickly to be observed further downstream. The records at proximal sites can, however, reflect the stages, or packets, involved during the main bulk of lahar initiation. At more distal sites, observations show that a lahar transitions to a [minimal] 4 -phase behaviour. This consists of a frontal bow wave of ambient streamwater that increases in volume with distance from source, and immediately precedes the lahar proper. The following phases are defined by variations in sediment concentration, <b>velocity,</b> <b>stage,</b> and, in the case of Crater Lake-originating lahars, water chemistry. The understanding of the variable behaviour possible during a lahar, as well as the identification of the specific flow type recorded, is fundamental to modelling approximations of flow volumes, sediment concentrations, likely inundation areas, and probable damage by the flow. It is essential for the development of future warning systems that the variations that can occur within a single lahar are better understood, as lahars represent a serious threat to the slopes of many volcanoes worldwide...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A RiverSonde radar system, {{operating}} at a frequency of approximately 350 MHz in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band, was {{installed on the}} Cowlitz River at Castle Rock, Washington, USA during October 2003 and has been operating for several months. Using techniques and equipment developed over several decades for measuring ocean surface currents at much lower frequencies, this radar system continuously measures the river streamflow from a location on one {{bank of the river}} by utilizing Bragg scattering from naturally-occurring water waves of 0. 5 -m wavelength. Data are processed in real time on a portable laptop computer and are available through a dial-up modem. The radar data provide hourly estimates of mean flow and cross-channel variations in the flow. Mean values of the radar flow profile track very closely continuous in-situ stage height measurements. River flow velocities of 0. 8 m·s- 1 - 3. 5 m·s- 1 were observed in the first five months of the experiment, with a nearly linear relationship between radar-inferred flow <b>velocity</b> and <b>stage</b> height of 9 m– 14 m. The radar velocity also appears to have a weak correlation with the local wind and several tidal frequencies. The strong correlation between surface <b>velocity</b> and <b>stage</b> height suggests that – with refinement – surface <b>velocity</b> could replace <b>stage</b> height in river gaging, as well as offering additional flow information...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Numerical {{modeling}} technique {{based on}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) {{has been used to}} study the gasification and combustion of chipped scrape tire in a two-stage system for recycling scrape tire for heat recovery. Effect of equivalence ratio on the syngas composition and combustion behavior was investigated. Results indicated {{that it is possible to}} recover energy from recycled waste tire through this two-stage system. Optimal gasification of chipped tires was achieved in the primary chamber at equivalence ratio around 0. 3 in which the average syngas composition constituted of 0. 22 and 0. 17 for of CO and H 2, respectively. Further, the high <b>velocity</b> <b>staged</b> air injection to the secondary chamber created “turbulent jet mixing ” effect thereby uniform temperature distribution is achieved and is contained in the upper half of the secondary chamber. The uniform temperature distribution and the increased wall heat flux at optimal equivalence ratio, clearly indicates better heating rate of the water tubes located in the secondary chamber for steam generation.

Results show that the 2 -d temperature field under different accelerations matched the variation in average temperatures: they both experience three variations at different time and <b>velocity</b> <b>stages.</b> The greater acceleration has a faster change in average temperature with time, due to the accumulation of combustion heat: the smaller acceleration has a higher average temperature at the same speed. No matter what acceleration was used, in time, the flame angle of inclination increased, but the growth rate decreased until an angle of 90 °: this could be explained by analysis of the force distribution within the flame. It is also found that, initially, the growth rate of angle with velocity under the greater acceleration was always smaller than that at lower accelerations; it was also different in flames with uniform velocity fire conditions...|$|R

The noise sources associated with the interferometers such as gravity gradient, seismic and quantum noise will also be discussed. Thermal noise {{will be discussed in}} depth. The main body of this thesis focused on developing and characterising a pulling machine capable of producing small diameter silica fibres for use in prototype advanced gravitational wave detectors. An initial diameter target was to pull repeatable sets of fibres with a minimum diameter ≤ 20 µm. The pulling machine worked by heating a silica stock, with one end clamped down and the other clamped to a high <b>velocity</b> pulling <b>stage,</b> with a CO 2 laser until the stock was sufficiently hot enough and producing a fibre by moving the pulling stage. The CO 2 beam was directed to and focused down onto the stock using a series of mirrors and two lenses to a beam width of 105 ± 7 µm. Three different methods were used to create fibres: one stage absolute position pull, one <b>stage</b> <b>velocity</b> profile pull and two <b>stage</b> <b>velocity</b> profile pulls. The one stage absolute position pull produced fibres that would taper down to a minimum diameter ranging between 20 to 48 µm. The one <b>stage</b> <b>velocity</b> profile pulls produced fibres ranging between 7. 4 ± 0. 4 µm and 18. 3 ± 0. 6 µm. These fibres then ranged in breaking stress values of 2. 26 ± 0. 26 × 10 ^ 8 Pa and 6. 05 ± 0. 39 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and a Young’s modulus value between 14. 4 ± 1. 7 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and 106. 0 ± 6. 8 × 10 ^ 9 Pa. The two <b>stage</b> <b>velocity</b> profile pulls produced fibres ranging between 8. 72 ± 0. 61 µm and 14. 83 ± 0. 57 µm. These fibres then ranged in breaking stress values of 2. 14 ± 0. 3 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and 4. 82 ± 0. 36 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and a Young’s modulus value between 54. 0 ± 7. 5 × 10 ^ 9 Pa and 87. 0 ± 14. 3 × 10 ^ 9 Pa. The thinnest set of fibres were produced with two stage pulls and were found to have a higher Young’s modulus value than the literature value for bulk fused silica, indicating a possible change in properties when the diameter is ≤ 10 µm. Further investigation will need to be carried out to find out if this is the case. The target of producing repeatable silica fibres with a minimum diameter ≤ 20 µm was met. There is still {{a lot of work to}} be completed with regards to perfecting the fibre’s shape, improving the strength and investigating the loss associated with the fibre.
