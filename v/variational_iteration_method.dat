30|$|Fractional {{calculus}} (FC) {{has become}} an alternative mathematical method to describe models with nonlocal behavior. In the last decade, considerable interest in fractional differential equations has been stimulated due to their numerous applications {{in the areas of}} physics and engineering [1 – 15]. Several numerical and analytical methods have been developed to study the solutions of nonlinear fractional partial differential equations, fractional sub-equation methods [16 – 18], the homotopy perturbation methods [19 – 21], the <b>variational</b> <b>iteration</b> <b>methods</b> [22 – 27], homotopy perturbation transform methods [28, 29], Adomian descomposition methods [30 – 33], and other analytical approaches that could be of interest for the reader are presented in [34 – 38]. It worth noting that there exist only two main definitions of the fractional derivative; the first was proposed by Riemann and Liouville and is the derivative of the convolution of a given function and a power law kernel, the second one was suggested by Caputo and it is the convolution of the local derivative of a given function with power law function [39].|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{fractional}} {{initial and}} boundary value {{problems have been}} studied extensively. Several forms {{of them have been}} proposed in standard models, {{and there has been a}} significant interest in developing numerical schemes for their solutions. Several numerical techniques, such as Laplace and Fourier transforms [1, 2], Adomian decomposition and <b>variational</b> <b>iteration</b> <b>methods</b> [3, 4], eigenvector expansion [5], differential transform and finite differences methods [6, 7], power series method [8], residual power series method [9 – 12], collocation method [13], operational matrix of fractional integration method [14, 15], and wavelet method [16, 17], are used to solve such problems. Many applications of fractional calculus to various branches of science such as engineering, physics and economics can be found in [18, 19]. Considerable attention has been given to the theory of fractional ordinary differential equations and integral equations [20, 21]. Additionally, the existence of solutions of ordinary and fractional boundary value problems using monotone iterative sequences has been investigated by several authors [22 – 25]. Some applications are discussed by Singh et al. [26]. They analyze a new fractional model of chemical kinetics system related to a newly discovered Atangana-Baleanu derivative with fractional order having nonsingular and nonlocal kernel. Also, Singh et al. [27] presented a reliable algorithm based on the local fractional homotopy perturbation. Moreover, Singh et al. [28] proposed a new numerical algorithm, namely q-homotopy analysis Sumudu transform method (q-HASTM), to obtain the approximate solution for the nonlinear fractional dynamical model of interpersonal and romantic relationships.|$|R
30|$|In 1895, Korteweg and de Vries [1] {{developed}} the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation to model weakly nonlinear waves. It {{has been used}} in several different fields to describe various physical phenomena of interest. The KdV-Burgers (KdVB) equation which is derived by Su and Gardner [2] appears {{in the study of the}} weak effects of dispersion, dissipation, and nonlinearity in waves propagating in a liquid-filled elastic tube. Recently, the nonlinear fractional partial differential equations, such as fractional KdV-Burgers equation [3], fractional Schrödinger-Korteweg-de Vries equations [4] and fractional Burgers’ equations [5], were also presented to describe many important phenomena and dynamic processes in physics. Some theoretical issues concerning the KdVB equation, such as the traveling wave solution, have received considerable attention [6]. A number of exact solitary wave solutions to KdVB equations have been found in the past few years. The exact solutions of a compound KdVB equation were obtained by using a homogeneous balance method in [7]. By using the special truncated expansion method, Hassan [8] constructed solitary wave solutions for the compound KdVB equation and discussed the generalized two-dimensional KdVB equation. The Exp-function method is applied to obtain generalized solitary solutions and periodic solutions for the KdVB equation in [9]. In the past several decades, many authors have paid attention to studying the numerical methods for solving KdVB equations. Soliman extended the <b>variational</b> <b>iterations</b> <b>method</b> to solve the KdVB equations [10]. A new decomposition method was presented to find the explicit and numerical solutions of the KdVB equations without any transformations, linearization or weak nonlinearity assumptions in [11]. The element-free Galerkin (EFG) method for numerically solving the compound KdVB equation was discussed by Rong-Jun and Yu-Min in [12]. The explicit restrictive Taylor approximation (RTA) was implemented to find numerical solution of KdV-Burgers in [13]. Nonlinear dispersive wave propagation problems that described the KdVB equations in [14] were simulated by high-order compact finite difference schemes coupled with high-order low-pass filter and the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme.|$|R
