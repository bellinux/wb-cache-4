In simple terms, resistance is related to vessel radius by the Hagen-Poiseuille's equation [...] (resistance∝1/radius4, so the smaller the radius, the very much higher the resistance). Other physical factors that affect resistance include: <b>vessel</b> <b>length</b> (the longer the vessel, the higher the resistance), blood viscosity (the higher the viscosity, the higher the resistance) {{and the presence of}} an arterial stenosis (a narrow stenosis increases resistance to flow, however this increase in resistance rarely if ever increases systemic blood pressure, it decreases downstream flow). Substances called vasoconstrictors can reduce the calibre of blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure. Vasodilators (such as nitroglycerin) increase the calibre of blood vessels, thereby decreasing arterial pressure.|$|E

5000|$|Initially {{branches}} are mechanically {{attached to}} the trunks of trees by forming interlocking wood grain patterns {{at the top of}} the joint (Fig. 1). [...] The xylem tissues in this location are denser than in surrounding tissues of the tree's stem or branch, the wood grain pattern formed is tortuous and in these tissues there is typically a reduction in <b>vessel</b> <b>length,</b> diameter and frequency of occurrence (i.e. more of the xylem consists of fibre cells). [...] This specialized xylem tissue, formed under the branch bark ridge, provides unique mechanical properties to the union of the branch to the trunk, requiring that wood fibres are stretched along their length (the axial strength of the wood) in order to rupture the attachment apart.|$|E

40|$|Scientists {{have long}} sought to {{understand}} how vascular networks supply blood and oxygen to cells throughout the body. Recent work focuses on principles that constrain how vessel size changes through branching generations from the aorta to capillaries and uses scaling exponents to quantify these changes. Prominent scaling theories predict that combinations of these exponents explain how metabolic, growth, and other biological rates vary with body size. Nevertheless, direct measurements of individual vessel segments have been limited because existing techniques for measuring vasculature are invasive, time consuming, and technically difficult. We developed software that extracts the length, radius, and connectivity of in vivo vessels from contrast-enhanced 3 D Magnetic Resonance Angiography. Using data from 20 human subjects, we calculated scaling exponents by four methods [...] two derived from local properties of branching junctions and two from whole-network properties. Although these methods are often used interchangeably in the literature, we do not find general agreement between these methods, particularly for <b>vessel</b> <b>lengths.</b> Measurements for <b>length</b> of <b>vessels</b> also diverge from theoretical values, but those for radius show stronger agreement. Our results demonstrate that vascular network models cannot ignore certain complexities of real vascular systems and indicate the need to discover new principles regarding <b>vessel</b> <b>lengths...</b>|$|R

50|$|Poland {{is known}} for the socalled Lewin-type log-boats, found a Lewin Brzeski, Koźle and Roszowicki Las accordingly. These boats, are {{characterized}} by square or trapezoidal cross-section, rectangular hull-ends and low height of the sides in relation to <b>vessel</b> <b>length.</b> In addition, nearly all the Lewin-type boats have a single hole in the bow and two at the stern. The low height {{is a result of}} the parent log being split lengthwise in half, in order to obtain two identical timbers from a single trunk. The advantage lies in the resulting identical twin hulls, which are then joined to form a double-hulled raft. The paired hulls were joined by transverse poles, which did not go through the holes in the platform ends but were fastened to the top walls or in special grooves at the hull ends. These vessels were typically 7-12 m in length, and the largest of them could carry up to 1.5 tons of cargo because of the special design. The Lewin type logboats are usually associated with the Przeworsk culture in the early centuries AD.|$|E
40|$|International audienceVessel {{length is}} an {{important}} but understudied dimension of variation in angiosperm vascular anatomy. Among other traits, <b>vessel</b> <b>length</b> mediates an important tradeoff between hydraulic efficiency and safety that could influence how plants respond to extreme weather with climate change. However, the functional significance of <b>vessel</b> <b>length</b> variation within individual stems is poorly known, in part because existing data analysis methods handle uncertainty {{in a way that}} makes <b>vessel</b> <b>length</b> distributions difficult to compare. We provide a solution to this problem through a hierarchical Bayesian framework for estimating vessel lengths and we demonstrate the flexibility of this method by applying it to data from serial cross sections of dye injected stems. Our approach can accelerate data collection and accommodate associated uncertainties by statistically correcting for bias and error that result from subsampling images. We illustrate our analytical framework by estimating and comparing <b>vessel</b> <b>length</b> distributions for 21 woody species characteristic of a North American forest. The best-fit model corrected for both bias due to secondary growth and sampling error within and among species. <b>Vessel</b> <b>length</b> estimates from this model varied by almost an order of magnitude and parameters of these distributions correlated with point estimates derived from a different, commonly used method. Furthermore, we show how key contrasts can be estimated with the Bayesian framework, and in doing so, we show that the shape of the <b>vessel</b> <b>length</b> distribution differed between ring-and diffuse-porous species, suggesting that within-stem <b>vessel</b> <b>length</b> variation corresponds to water stress seasonality and contributes to landscape-level habitat segregation. Our analysis method revealed the importance of within-stem variation in <b>vessel</b> <b>length,</b> and our results complement work on between-species variation in average <b>vessel</b> <b>length,</b> further illuminating how vascular anatomy can influence woody plants' responses to water stress...|$|E

40|$|Background: As novel {{endovascular}} {{strategies are}} developed for treating neurological disease, {{there is an}} increasing need to evaluate these techniques in relevant preclinical models. The use of non-human primates is especially critical given their structural and physiological homology with humans. In order to conduct primate endovascular studies, a comprehensive understanding of the carotid anatomy is necessary. We therefore performed a detailed examination of the <b>vessel</b> <b>lengths,</b> lumen diameters and angles of origin of the baboon extracranial carotid system. Methods: We characterized the extracranial carotid system often male baboons (Papio anubis, range 15. 1 – 28. 4 kg) by early post-mortem dissection. Photographic documentation of <b>vessel</b> <b>lengths,</b> lumen diameters, and angles of origin were measured for each segment of the carotid bilaterally. Results: The common carotid arteries averaged 94. 7 ± 1. 7 mm (left) and 87. 1 ± 1. 6 mm (right) in length. The average minimal common carotid lumen diameters were 3. 0 ± 0. 3 mm (left) and 2. 9 ± 0. 2 mm (right). Each animal had a common brachiocephalic artery arising from the aorta which bifurcated into the left common carotid artery and right braciocephalic artery after 21. 5 ± 1. 6 mm.
