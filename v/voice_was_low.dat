60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> in an awing, {{confident}} {{contrast with}} the headlong emphasis of his movements. He sat down abruptly.|$|E

60|$|Pan {{had entered}} from the dance hall entrance. Blinky, {{unsteady}} on his feet, {{came in from}} the street. After a tense moment the poker players went on with their game, and the drinkers emptied their glasses. But <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> <b>low,</b> glances <b>were</b> furtive.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed to}} force himself to finish. His <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> very <b>low.</b>|$|R

6000|$|The <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>low,</b> with {{a certain}} faint {{sweetness}} or tone which falls soothingly on my ear.

6000|$|...

When he speaks, his <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>low,</b> {{and in two}} confrontational flashbacks with his hostile father-in-law, Khanna’s performance peaks. The superstar’s superb performance in Basu Bhattacharya’s domestic drama proves his unexplored talent at stasis." ...|$|R
50|$|His {{briefing}} of John F. Kennedy, on October 16, {{confirmed the}} Soviet weapons' presence, {{which had not}} been expected by the intelligence community or military.Lundahl began the briefing, with assistance from Acting Director of Central Intelligence whose <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>low</b> and often difficult to hear.
