5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a <b>vertical</b> <b>tube</b> that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
25|$|This process is, in principle, {{similar to}} the one {{described}} above; however, the pellets produced are directly (continuously or discontinuously) crystallized and then subjected to a solid-state polycondensation (SSP) in a tumbling drier or a <b>vertical</b> <b>tube</b> reactor. During this processing step, the corresponding intrinsic viscosity of 0.80–0.085 dℓ/g is rebuild again and, at the same time, the acetaldehyde content is reduced to < 1 ppm.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of whistle {{phenomena}} in which heat plays a role. The temperature in a sound wave varies, but since it is so small normally it is common to neglect its effects. When amplification can occur a small variation can grow and have important influence on the sound field created. The most well known thermal whistle is the Rijke tube. Peter Rijke placed a heated a gauze material inside a <b>vertical</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E

50|$|The NRX reactor {{incorporated}} a calandria, a sealed vertical aluminium cylindrical vessel with {{a diameter of}} 8 m and height of 3 m. The core vessel held about 175 six-centimetre-diameter <b>vertical</b> <b>tubes</b> in a hexagonal lattice, 14,000 litres of heavy water and helium gas to displace air and prevent corrosion. The level {{of water in the}} reactor could be adjusted to help set the power level. Sitting in the <b>vertical</b> <b>tubes</b> and surrounded by air were fuel elements or experimental items. This design was a forerunner of the CANDU reactors.|$|R

25|$|Column stills are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still {{in the production of}} bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long <b>vertical</b> <b>tube.</b> Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40–50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.|$|E
25|$|Sarracenia are {{herbaceous}} {{perennial plants}} that grow from a subterranean rhizome, with many tubular pitcher-shaped leaves radiating {{out from the}} growing point, and then turning upwards with their trap openings facing {{the center of the}} crown. The trap is a <b>vertical</b> <b>tube</b> with a 'hood' (the operculum) extending over its entrance; and below it the top of the tube usually has a rolled lip (the peristome) which secretes nectar and scents. The hood itself frequently produces nectar too, but in lesser quantities.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives did {{not show}} the pressure of steam in the boiler, but {{it was possible to}} estimate this by the position of the safety valve arm which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot <b>vertical</b> <b>tube</b> of mercury with a sight-glass at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|E

Due {{to the lack of}} reliable water vapor condensation models for high mass flux densities in helical tubes, in the paper is proposed usage of standard modification that correlate condensation heat transfer coefficient inside <b>vertical</b> <b>tubes</b> with condensation heat transfer coefficient inside helical tubes through enhancement factor. Although this modification is originally introduced for application without phase changes, in present work is shown that it can be also applied for phase changing application. Furthermore, modification was applied to two reliable condensation models for <b>vertical</b> <b>tubes</b> which are than compared by using both local and averaged approach for different mass flux densities...|$|R

2500|$|The {{division}} of the MAUD Committee at Liverpool was led by Chadwick, who was assisted by Frisch, Rotblat, Gerry Pickavance, Maurice Pryce and John Riley Holt. The division at Liverpool also controlled a small team at the nearby University of Bristol that included Alan Nunn May and Cecil Frank Powell. At Liverpool they focused on the separation of isotopes through thermal diffusion as was suggested in the Frisch-Peierls memorandum. The {{was based on the}} fact that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. That this can be used as a means of isotope separation was first demonstrated by Klaus Clusius and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938, who used it to separate isotopes of neon. They used an apparatus called a [...] "column", consisting of a <b>vertical</b> <b>tube</b> with a hot wire down the centre. The advantage of the technique was that it was simple in design and there were no moving parts. But it could take months to reach equilibrium, required a lot of energy, and needed high temperatures that could cause a problem with the uranium hexafluoride.|$|E
6000|$|The whale-line is {{only two}} thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.

As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub.
