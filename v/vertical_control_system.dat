40|$|There {{are tens of}} {{thousands}} of flooded mines in Europe, which of majority has unknown areas that cannot be searched by divers. A robot must be developed in order to examine the mines and decide about reopening them. This robot has to be autonomous, and able to navigate through the narrow tunnels and shafts. Its propulsion system is a crucial part of exploring the mines. The robot being a submarine, it should also be able to adjust its buoyancy. These two systems allow for the vertical movement of the submarine, propul-sion system being the only means to move horizontally. This thesis is focused on the <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and the challenges the required very small size will create. It is worth mentioning that a similar robotic submarine has not been developed earlier, which makes the project interesting. In this thesis, first, some basic principles of submarine diving and its depth control methods are explained and different ballast system operating principles are compared and explained. The propulsion system is tested, its performance is evaluated and differ-ent methods for usage of thrusters is studied. The submarine should have four thrusters on both sides in a manifold that is integrated to the hull, in order to maintain spherical shape. Two horizontal ones on each side, for dependability, and two vertical ones as well. The energy efficient way is to move slowly and avoid active braking. The buoyancy <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is the more complex of the two <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> Considering many different options, the most suitable system for this robot shall have a small brushless electric motor, micro-hydraulic pump, shutoff valve and ballast cylinders that are used to control the weight of the submarine. The system will use oil as the me-dia instead of water, because of issues with availability and size of water hydraulic components. The power consumption of these two systems was measured in case of thrusters and simulated in case of buoyancy control and a guideline when to use one or the other was formed. The buoyancy control is less energy-efficient than it could, mostly because of the low efficiency of the small gear-type pump. The system would be greatly improved if the pump could be replaced with a more efficient one...|$|R

40|$|Background and problem: There is {{an ongoing}} debate in todayâ€™s society about <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> {{developed}} {{in the private sector}} who are now also used in the public sector. One popular management <b>control</b> <b>system</b> adopted by the public sector is Lean. Lean has been criticized but it is still being implemented in many public organizations. A potential problem can arise when the horizontal Lean concept meets the <b>vertical</b> management <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> that are common in public organizations. Purpose: Our purpose with this thesis is to describe the potential conflict between Lean and vertical management in three public organizations. The concept of Lean can be experienced differently at different levels within organizations and this will be analyzed by using institutional theory. Delimitation: We chose to describe three different organizations. This decision to choose three organizations enable us to not make a general conclusion based on our findings, since the sample is not big enough. Method: We have written a qualitative thesis and we have interviewed two respondents {{in each of the three}} organizations that we studied; the interviews were conducted in a semi-structured way. The empirical material has been analyzed with the basis on the literature review. Conclusion: The respondents have not described any potential conflict between the horizontal Lean concept and the <b>vertical</b> management <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> This could be explained by using institutional theory, stating that the respondents are unwilling to see and explain potential conflicts...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to present a detailed analysis of the optimal combination of heterogeneous height data, with particular emphasis on (i) modelling systematic errors and datum inconsistencies, (ii) separation of random errors and estimation of variance components for each height type, and (iii) practical considerations for modernizing <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> Specifically, <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> networks consisting of ellipsoidal, orthometric and geoid height data are investigated. Although the theoretical relationship between these height types is simple in nature, its practical implementation has proven to be quite challenging due to numerous factors that cause discrepancies among the combined height data. To address these challenges a general procedure involving empirical and statistical tests for assessing the performance of selected parametric models is developed. In addition, variance component estimation is applied to the common adjustment of the heterogeneous heights. This leads to an in-depth analysis of the effects of correlation among heights of the same type, provisions for computing non-negative variance factors, and the intrinsic connection between the proper modelling of systematic errors and datum inconsistencies with the estimated variance components. Additional numerical studies include the calibration of geoid error models (both regional and global), scaling the GPS-derived ellipsoidal height covariance matrix, and evaluating the accuracy of orthometric heights obtained from national/regional adjustments of levelling data. Ultimately, one of the main motivations for this work is embedded in the eminent need to introduce modern tools and techniques, such as GNSSlevelling, in establishing <b>vertical</b> <b>control.</b> Therefore, part of this researc [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{longwall}} {{system of}} mining coal, providing advantages {{in the areas}} of productivity as well as health and safety, is described, and technological developments leading to a full automation of the system are discussed. In the longwall system large blocks of coal (up to 600 feet wide and up to 5000 feet long) are developed, with each block mined out by taking successive slices across the short dimension of the block and loading the broken coal onto a conveyor. A self-advancing system supports the roof over the length of the face throughout cutting and loading, with the supports advanced with the face, and the roof allowed to collapse behind them. A double-ranging drum longwall shearer provides the system with an efficient yaw, roll, and variable-thickness vertical control.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to control an {{unstable}} mechanical system: an inverted pendulum. A digital computer controls a motor-powered cart on which a rod is attached by a nearly frictionless ball-bearing pivot. The rod is free to rotate around the pivot axis.

After the pendulum is raised near the vertical position, the computer program controlling the cart is run. The cart is equipped with devices to measure the angle of the pendulum displaced from the vertical and the position and velocity of the cart. These signals are processed by a proportional controller using angle, angular velocity, position, and velocity feedback. The angle and angular velocity feedback loop helps to keep the pendulum vertical. The position and tachometer feedback keeps the cart from running off the premises. If the pendulum swings to either side of the <b>vertical,</b> the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> will sense the deviation, and the cart will move underneath the rod and continue to balance the unstable structure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHow stable is <b>vertical</b> eye-in-head {{position}} <b>control</b> {{in darkness}} when no visual targets are present? We evaluated this while varying both body-in-space orientation and eye-in-orbit position in six subjects who were free from oculomotor/vestibular disease. Vertical eye movements were monitored using a CCD-video tracking system, and results were confirmed on one subject with the magnetic search coil. Three body orientations were used: (1) seated upright; (2) supine; and (3) prone. In {{each of these}} body orientations starting eye-in-orbit position was varied in quasi-random order from âˆ’ 20 to + 20 deg, while vertical eye drift was monitored for a 90 sec period at each position. Subjects were instructed to hold their eyes as steady as possible. The relationship between body orientation/eye position and vertical eye drift velocity was examined using a linear regression technique. In contrast to prior clinical reports, normals exhibit a vertical nystagmus/drift in darkness. Moreover, slow-phase eye velocity {{was found to be}} dependent on eye-in-orbit position in the upright and supine body orientations. This pattern of eye drift mirrors Alexander's Law, with significantly increased drift velocities when subjects looked in the direction of their re-centering saccades (P < 0. 05 or better). Body-in-space orientation also modulated the eye drift velocity, with significant differences in rate of eye drift (P < 0. 05 or better) between extremes of body orientation (supine and prone) for five out of six subjects. The stability of the <b>vertical</b> oculomotor <b>control</b> <b>system</b> in the absence of visual input is strongly affected by body-in-space orientation and eye-in-orbit position: manipulating either of these variables results in non-random patterns of drift. These results are discussed using a multiple-input model of <b>vertical</b> eye-in-head position <b>control.</b> Â© 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
