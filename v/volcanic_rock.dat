5|$|The {{characteristics}} of boulder problems depend {{largely on the}} type of rock being climbed. Granite, for example, often features long cracks and slabs.

5|$|Later, but not {{precisely}} dated, eruptions from the Lassen volcanic area have formed over 30 smaller steep-sided, mound-shaped accumulations of <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock,</b> called lava domes. Crescent Crater, which {{at first glance}} appears as a parasite on Lassen's northeast flank, has been more heavily glaciated and thus is older. Other dacite domes which rose on Tehama's flanks are Bumpass Mountain, Helen Ridge, Eagle Peak, Vulcan's Castle and Reading Peak. An upper limit of 10,000years has been set for the domes next to Lost Creek (north domes). All of these domes must have risen with great rapidity.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> share {{a number}} of common minerals. Differentiation of <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> tends to {{increase}} the silica (SiO2) content mainly by fractional crystallization. Thus, more evolved <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> tend to be richer in minerals with a higher amount if silica such as phyllo and tectosilicates including the feldspars, quartz polymorphs and muscovite. While still dominated by silicates, more primitive <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> have mineral assemblages with less silica, such as olivine and the pyroxenes.

40|$|Pliocene felsic rift margin and Quaternary rift center <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> {{from the}} {{northern}} Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) exhibit contrasts in major and trace element contents and Sr-Nd isotopic ratios. Quaternary rift center felsic <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are mainly peralkaline trachytes and rhyolites, whereas Pliocene felsic rift margin <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are represented by benmoreites, weakly peralkaline trachytes and rare rhyolites. Most of the felsic rift margin <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> have greater Al 2 O 3, K 2 O, Nb, Zr, Rb, and Sr, and lesser CaO, Zr/Nb, and CaO/Al 2 O 3 than rift center <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b> These contrasts may have been inherited from differences in the compositions of their parental basic magmas, which were produced by variable degrees of partial melting.

5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock,</b> and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E

30|$|<b>Volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as good recorders of the geomagnetic field corresponding {{to the time of}} their formation. Because <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are free from the effect of inclination shallowing that could be introduced from the compaction of sediments during syn- or post-depositional processes, <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are considered to provide higher fidelity paleofield records than sedimentary rocks. In some recent studies, paleomagnetic directions derived from <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> were used to check the validity of coeval directions inferred from sedimentary rocks (e.g., Gilder et al., 2003; Hankard et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2010).|$|R
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|Older {{and more}} deeply eroded, the Western Cascades are {{a range of}} volcanoes lying west of and merging with the High Cascades. They consist of partly altered <b>{{volcanic}}</b> <b>rock</b> from vents in both volcanic provinces, including varied lavas and ash tuffs {{ranging in age from}} 0 to 40million years. As the Cascades rose, the Rogue maintained its flow to the ocean by down-cutting, which created steep narrow gorges and rapids in many places.

30|$|Differences in {{diagenesis}} {{sequences of}} volcanic reservoirs in {{eastern and western}} China lead to the differences of reservoir types. Primary reservoir formations in <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are represented by the Yingcheng Formation in the Songliao Basin in eastern China. Secondary weathering reservoir formations in <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> are represented by Carboniferous formations in northern Xinjiang in western China.

30|$|Formation, {{preservation}} and reformation of reservoir spaces in <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> during the evolution process are highly complicated. Primary pores and fractures are mostly controlled by original eruption states, namely lithology of <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Under the same tectonic stress, {{the development and}} preservation of structural fractures are also controlled by the original eruption states. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>rocks</b> formed after volcano eruption, cooling, solidification, compaction and consolidation contain disconnected primary pores without permeability. Only after various geological transformations in later stages, they can have reservoir capacities. On the whole, volcanism, tectonic movements, weathering, leaching and fluids are key factors and geological actions for the formation and development of reservoir spaces in <b>volcanic</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E
5|$|Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples, with {{linguistic}} and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as {{peoples of the}} Philippines, Malaysia, Madagascar and Oceania. Chipped-pebble tools dating from perhaps as early as 15,000 years ago suggest that the initial human inhabitants of Taiwan were Paleolithic cultures of the Pleistocene era. These people survived by eating marine life. Archaeological evidence points to an abrupt change to the Neolithic era around 6,000years ago, {{with the advent of}} agriculture, domestic animals, polished stone adzes and pottery. The stone adzes were mass-produced on Penghu and nearby islands, from the <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> found there.

5|$|The Hawaiian monk seal, as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago.

5|$|The {{continental}} crust {{consists of}} lower density material {{such as the}} igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.|$|E

The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows.

5|$|The steep-sided, {{symmetrical}} stratovolcanoes in {{the region}} were built by repeated eruptions of thick, slow-moving lava that have commonly flowed only a few kilometres from the vent. Explosive eruptions are often associated with these volcanoes, depositing alternating layers of volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and globes of molten rock called volcanic bombs or lava bombs, which are added to its slopes to create the stratovolcano. Edziza's stratovolcanoes contain a fine-grained silica-rich <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> called trachyte; they have not erupted for thousands of years, allowing erosion to destroy the original cone, creating craggy ridges and rock outcrops of more resistant materials.|$|E

Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, <b>volcanic</b> <b>rock</b> making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
