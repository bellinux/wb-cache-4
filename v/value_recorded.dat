5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved road salt in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than any <b>value</b> <b>recorded</b> in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice as high as locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E
5|$|Siward died {{more than}} a decade before the death of Edward the Confessor, but despite this the Domesday Book {{recorded}} 4 manors, 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire, owned directly by Earl Siward in 1066, all of them subsequently held by Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester. This land was stated to have been worth £212, while his son Waltheof was said to have held £136 worth of land across 9 counties. Domesday records give an incomplete picture of Siward's holdings. In total it recorded property worth £348 for Siward and his son, which on its own would compare poorly with the £2493 in <b>value</b> <b>recorded</b> to have been held by the family of the earls of Mercia. Of the latter, however, Morcar of Mercia, Earl of Northumbria on the day of King Edward's death, possessed land worth £968, while Tostig, exiled earl at the time, had land worth £491; both may have come into possession of some of Siward's land in the course of becoming Earls of Northumbria. Moreover, the counties that would become Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland were largely omitted from the survey, while, besides being only very poorly documented, the lands in Yorkshire had been severely devastated and devalued during the Harrying of the North.|$|E

There is general agreement that {{research is needed to}} examine the residual lead and its association to heavy metals contamination in soil and quantify the health hazards. This research was directed to quantify and document the geographic distribution of lead and associated heavy metals concentration in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Lead, cadmium, chromium, zinc, and copper were selected to analysis. The soil samples used in this research were collected during a previous Encountors Binational Community Lead Study (RO 1 ES 11367; 2001 - 2006. The composite surface soil samples were taken from municipal blocks around 50 strata that were randomly selected. Within each stratum, 10 blocks were randomly selected. The samples were prepared for analysis by X-ray fluorescence. The general procedures of EPA method 6200 for field portable XRF were followed for preparation of the samples, with slight modification. These included grinding, mixing, pressing, and homogenization. 496 soil samples were analyzed in this study. Statistical analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between lead and associated heavy metals. Additionally, geographic information system techniques (GIS) were used to create a detailed colored map of metals concentration. The soil lead concentration levels were recorded, ranging from 12. 6 to 550. 3 ppm, with the mean concentration <b>values</b> <b>recorded</b> for lead was 42. 8 ppm. Soil chromium concentration levels recorded for chromium ranged from 1. 8 to 75. 6 ppm; with mean concentration <b>values</b> <b>recorded</b> for chromium was 32. 1 ppm.
