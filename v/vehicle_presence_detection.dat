40|$|Rising {{from the}} “excess demand” modern {{societies}} and economies place on limited road resources, congestion causes increased vehicle emissions, decreases national efficiency, and wastes time (Downs, 2004). In order to minimise congestion’s impacts, traffic management systems gather traffic data {{and use it}} to implement efficient management algorithms (Downs, 2004). This dissertation’s purpose has been the development of a distributable <b>vehicle</b> <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> sensor, which will wirelessly provide vehicle presence information in real time. To address the sensor’s wireless power requirements, the feasibility of self-powering the device via harvested energy has been investigated. Piezoelectric, electrostatic, and electromagnetic energy harvesting devices’ principles of operation and underlying theory has been investigated in detail and an overview presented alongside a literature review of previous vibration energy harvesting research. An electromagnetic energy harvesting device was designed, which consists of: a nylon reinforced rubber bladder, hydraulic piston, neodymium magnets, and wire-wound coil housing. Preliminary testing demonstrated a harvested energy between 100 mJ and 205 mJ per axle. This amount is able to be transferred to a 100 O load when driven over at speeds between 10 km/h and 50 km/h. Combined with an embedded circuit, the energy harvester facilitated the development of a passive sensor, which is able to wirelessly transmit a vehicle’s presence signal to a host computer. The vehicle detected event is displayed via a graphical user interface. Energy harvesting’s ability to power the embedded circuit’s wireless transmission, demonstrated the feasibility of developing systems capable of harvesting energy from their environment and using it to power discrete electronic components. The ability to wirelessly transmit a vehicle’s presence facilitates the development of distributable traffic monitoring systems, allowing for remote traffic monitoring and management...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this article, device-free human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> method {{based on}} {{principal}} components analysis of the radio signal strength variations is proposed. The method increases user awareness for automated power management interaction in residential power saving systems. Motivation comes from a need for decreasing the installation complexity and development costs induced by the integration of specific human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> sensors. The method exploits {{the fact that a}} human body interferes with radio signals by introducing irregularities in the radio signature which indicate possible human presence. By analyzing radio signals between radio transceivers embedded in 2. 4 GHz wireless power outlets, the original environment is not visually modified and a certain level of sensorial intelligence is introduced without additional sensors. The analysis of the signal strength variations in principal components space enhances the detection accuracy level of human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> method, retaining low installation costs and improving overall energy conservation...|$|R

This thesis presents an investigation of device-free environmental perception capabilities in a 5 G prototype system in two cases; walking speed and human <b>presence</b> <b>detection,</b> and elaborate a comparison with the former case and acceleration sensing analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> and tracking using an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) impulse-based mono-static radar. UWB radar can complement other human tracking technologies, as {{it works well}} in poor visibility conditions. UWB electromagnetic wave scattering from moving humans forms a complex returned signal structure which can be approximated to a specular multi-path scattering model (SMPM). The key technical challenge is to simultaneously track multiple humans (and non-humans) using the complex scattered waveform observations. We develop a multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) framework that solves the complicated data association and tracking problem for an SMPM of moving objects/targets. Human <b>presence</b> <b>detection</b> utilizes SMPM signal features, which are tested in a classical likelihood ratio (LR) detector framework.
