The city also faced programs with large swaths of <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E

40|$|With the {{decrease}} in the demand for large-scale apartments {{as a result of}} an aging society and a decrease in population, there has been an increase in <b>vacant</b> <b>houses</b> due to a supply that exceeds the projected demands. As a method of urban regeneration in rural areas and activation of citizen communities, the utilization of <b>vacant</b> <b>houses</b> has become one of the ways to promote a new lifestyle, active movement for citizen participation, and business model for long-term revitalization. This study aims to uncover and examine the major causes and factors behind the upswing in <b>vacant</b> <b>houses.</b> We investigated the current state of <b>vacant</b> <b>houses,</b> the recent policies concerning them, and the types of <b>vacant</b> <b>houses</b> in Korea’s Gyeonggi province. We then categorized and analyzed the causes of <b>houses</b> being <b>vacant,</b> their types, and the methods of utilizing them under different local conditions in order to understand the efficient processes and strategies for their utilization. The results showed that an excess of building construction (especially recent construction permits), the number of recipients of the national basic livelihood scheme, and the number of elderly people showed the strongest correlation with <b>vacant</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R

25|$|On March 27, 2011, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg {{announced}} that the city would file a formal challenge to the Census results, {{as a result of}} alleged undercounting in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.

According to the Census, they grew by only 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while the other boroughs grew by between 3% and 5%. In addition, the Mayor claims, the census showed improbably high amounts of <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> in vital neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Queens.|$|E
2500|$|With housing {{consisting}} {{almost entirely}} of single-room-occupancy hotel rooms, studio and one bedroom apartments, the Tenderloin historically housed single adults and couples. After World War II, with the decline in central cities throughout the United States, the Tenderloin lost population, creating {{a large amount of}} <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> units by the mid-1970s. Beginning in the late 1970s, after the Vietnam War, the Tenderloin received large numbers of refugees from Southeast Asia—first ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, then Khmer from Cambodia and Hmong from Laos. The low-cost <b>vacant</b> <b>housing,</b> and the proximity to Chinatown through the Stockton Street Tunnel, made the area appealing to refugees and resettlement agencies. Studio apartments became home for families of four and five people and became what a local police officer called [...] "vertical villages." [...] The Tenderloin quickly increased from having just a few children to having over 3,500 and this population has remained. A number of neighborhood Southeast Asian restaurants, bánh mì coffee shops, ethnic grocery stores, video shops, and other stores opened at this time, which still exist.|$|E
2500|$|Union-Miles Park was {{originally}} part of Newburgh Township, which was organized in 1814. Settled by whites {{as an area}} of farms and orchards, Union-Miles Park became one of two centers in the Cleveland steelmaking industry beginning in 1856. The steel mills drew Irish, Scottish, and Welsh immigrants to the area, with the intersection of E. 93rd Street and Union Avenue becoming known as [...] "Irishtown". After an 1882 strike at the steel mill was broken using Polish and Slovak strikebreakers, the large Irish and Welsh communities were displaced by these two new immigrant groups. Railroads cut through many areas of Union-Miles Park, defining the area. The steel industry in Union-Miles Park collapsed during the Great Depression. White flight from {{the area in the}} 1960s, and a strong influx of African Americans eager to take advantage of inexpensive housing, radically changed the demographic nature of the neighborhood. Since the mid-1970s, Union-Miles Park has been challenged by a high poverty rate, low adult educational achievement, extensive decrepit and <b>vacant</b> <b>housing,</b> high crime, and a lack of employment opportunities.|$|E
