40|$|A {{marine reserve}} is planned in the <b>Voordelta</b> to {{compensate}} for the loss of nature due to the construction of the second Maasvlakte (MVII). In order to evaluate the effect of this compensation, a monitoring and evaluation programme has been started (MEP-MV 2). As part of this programme, a base-line monitoring for macrobenthos has been conducted in 2004 and 2005 in the area where the marine reserve is planned, the location where MVII is planned and in two reference areas. The study presented in this report is part of the base-line monitoring programme. The major goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the spatial and temporal differences in macrofauna abundance between the marine reserve area and the reference areas. Historical data (1993 - 2004) on 5 shellfish species that are a potential food source for birds in the <b>Voordelta</b> have been analysed. The <b>Voordelta</b> area is characterised by large differences in environmental conditions. Especially the area in front of the Haringvliet (MOND) accommodates a specific macrobenthos community. Cockles are almost explicitly found in this area of the <b>Voordelta,</b> while other species are rarely found. This difference between the area MOND and the other areas within the <b>Voordelta</b> has been confirmed by the present study. The other areas show similar patterns in both in average biomass and density, as well as the historical patterns. Differences can be found between the Southern reference area and the two search areas for the marine reserve (ZRA and ZRB). The average density of Spisula subtruncata is higher in the search areas. Also the trends in both density as biomass of the other shellfish species observed in the search areas differ in the from the trends observed in the other areas. It is concluded that the autonomous developments within the Southern reference area differ from the developments within the marine reserve areas. It would be better if the reference area will be located within the same outer delta as the marine reserve area. The feasibility of this depends on the dimensions and the location of the reserve area. Due to the specific macrobenthos community in front of the Haringvliet, this area cannot be used as a reference area...|$|E
40|$|Data are {{reported}} on the amphipods and isopods taken in a sledge-type hyperbenthos sampler in the subtidal of the <b>Voordelta,</b> a shallow coastal area in the Westerschelde, the last estuary of the delta area (SW Netherlands). More than 300 samples were collected between 1988 and 1991. Two salt marches in the brackish part of the estuary were sampled monthly with a flume net in 1990 and 1991. A total of 46 amphipod species (42 gammarideans, 3 caprellids and 1 hyperiid), 19 of which are new for the area were recorded. The dominant amphipod species in the <b>Voordelta</b> and the marine part of the Westerschelde estuary are Atylus swammerdami and Gammarus crinicornis. Estimated densities of both species are high comparison to these estimated from macrobenthos samples taken in the same area. This suggests that {{an important part of}} the population swims above the bottom and is subsequently overlooked in benthos surveys using only grabs or corers. Some amphipod species that had not been previously recorded from that area were found to be quite common inhabitants of the hyperbenthal. The dominant species in the brackish part of the estuary are Corophium volutator, Gammarus salinus, Pleusymtes glaber and Bathyporeia species. In the salt marshes the same species are dominant but densities are much higher than in the main estuarine channel. Gammarus zaddachi is only present in the salt marshes. The only abundant Isopoda are Idotea linearis in the <b>Voordelta</b> and Paragnathia formica, Eurydice pulchra and Lekanesphaera rugicauda in the salt marshes. From a total of 8 species, there were no new records for the study area...|$|E
40|$|Phaeocystis {{blooms in}} the Southern Bight of the North Sea may cause {{damage to the}} aquatic {{ecosystem}} and to commercial mussel cultures {{at the entrance of}} the Oosterschelde estuary. In this paper the potential for early detection of Phaeocystis blooms in Dutch coastal waters is studied, using a combination of field data, satellite observations and hydrodynamic- and biological modelling. For the spring bloom period in the year 2003 MERIS chlorophyll-a maps, derived with the HYDROPT algorithm for coastal waters, were compared to in-situ measurements at stations off the coast in de <b>Voordelta</b> and the results of the GEM biogeochemical model. The analysis shows that the spatial and temporal variability in Phaeocystis abundance and total biomass (expressed by the Chl-a concentration) during spring is large. It is confirmed that blooms may develop off shore and show a tendency to accumulate within 10 km from the coastline, giving rise to rapid biomass accumulation {{at the mouth of the}} multiple estuaries in the <b>Voordelta.</b> Based on the outcome of this study an early warning system is proposed that notifies local water managers and shellfish growers for potentially harmful Phaeocystis bloom formation...|$|E
40|$|A first {{assessment}} of the ecological importance of the hyperbenthic fauna in coastal and estuarine systems was made in December 1988 in a pilot study (41 stations) covering the Westerschelde and Oosterschelde estuaries, {{and part of the}} neighbouring shallow coastal area, the <b>Voordelta.</b> Multivariate analysis revealed three major gradients which could be divided into seven spatially defined hyperbenthic communities. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was applied to correlate these species assemblages with a number of environmental variables measured at each station. Species distributions in the Westerschelde appear to be primarily determined by a gradient involving salinity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen. Hyperbenthic animals, mainly the mysid Neomysis integer, reached high densities in the brackish part (> 12 ind·m - 2), whereas the more seaward stations had lower densities but a higher number of species. In the benthic filter-feeder dominated Oosterschelde, the total density of the hyperbenthos was very low (- 2). The shallow coastal area had intermediate densities. There was a clear gradient from offshore to inshore but the environmental variables measured did not correlate well with this gradient. Though there were substantial overlaps between the clusters, as defined by the different multivariate techniques used, the <b>Voordelta</b> area can be divided into three main subareas...|$|E
40|$|Gyrodactylus arcuatus-like monogeneans {{collected}} from the gills of 3 goby species, Pomatoschistus minutus, P. lozanoi and P. pictus, from the <b>Voordelta</b> Area (SW Netherlands) were compared on a morphometric basis with C. arcuatus from its type host, the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. Univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out on measurements of 17 characters of the opisthaptoral hard parts of 268 specimens. The contribution of host-dependent and seasonal factors to the observed morphological variation are discussed. Univariate statistics (ANOVA) were used to detect features that were useful in separating the gyrodactylids from the different host groups. Subsequent factor analysis and discriminant analysis, combining all variables, led to the separation of 3 distinct forms (possibly species) dependent on the host species harbouring them. G. arcuatus (sensu stricto) was only present on G. aculeatus, while P. minutus acid P. lozanoi carried a common species, Gyrodactylus sp. 1, and P. pictus hosted Gyrodactylus sp. 2. Seasonal variation in size of the sclerities was demonstrated on the Gyrodactylus species from P. minutus and P. lozanoi, and {{should be taken into}} consideration when specimens are compared. The findings are discussed in view of the possibility of phylogenetic host specificity of the gyrodactylids occurring on goby species that live sympatrically in the <b>Voordelta</b> area. status: publishe...|$|E

Displacement {{is a relatively new}} topic to fisheries science, and no studies in the Dutch North sea are available. Because the MSFD measures are not yet implemented, actual displacement in the assigned areas cannot be studied yet. Therefore, displacement in historically closed/managed areas was studied.

The aim was to study if displacement could be analysed, and if so, to what extent displacement depends on the type of fisheries...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of nematode communities (species composition and abundance) of twenty {{stations in the}} <b>Voordelta</b> (Southern Bight of the North Sea) was investigated {{in relation to the}} sediment composition, the bottom morphology, the hydrodynamical forces, the salinity and the chlorophyll-a content. Similarities between stations were determined using classification (TWINSPAN) and ordination (DCA) techniques. Changes in the structure and the composition of the nematode communities are mainly correlated to the sedimentological gradient. Apart from the sediment composition, the salinity also determines the species composition of these communities. Finally, a correlation between the ecophysiological characteristics of the species present, the environmental stability and the food supply is hypothesized. However, further investigations are required to support these results...|$|E
40|$|The mesoparasitic copepod Lernaeocera lusci (Bassett-Smith, 1896) was {{recovered}} from first-year bib (Trisopterus luscus L.) in the <b>Voordelta</b> (Southern Bight of the North Sea) from May until December 1989. Analysis of the seasonal abundance {{and of the}} population structure showed that transmission of infective stages to bib mainly occurred from June to September. From September to December the overall prevalence fluctuated around 70 %. Maximum parasite population size (47 / 10 4 m²) and the highest total egg number were recorded in September and October, respectively. It was found that total parasite mortality was significantly influenced by mortality of hosts carrying parasites. Natural mortality probably contributed to a small percentage to total parasite mortality. Calculation of the temporal mean-variance regression equation revealed that the parasites were aggregated within the definitive host population...|$|E
40|$|Marine areas face several challenges: while high {{pressure}} is already imposed on marine ecosystems, traditional and new uses of seas increase continuously. Traditional, top-down, single sector approaches were often {{not able to}} find sustainable solutions able to preserve ecosystems benefits in the long-term. Marine spatial planning is a widely applied instrument {{for dealing with the}} challenges in order to lead to more sustainable development. Stakeholder participation forms a key to marine spatial planning processes and is handled as an approach to enhance sustainable development. This thesis analyses conditions for enhancing the degree to which stakeholder participation contributes to sustainable marine spatial planning. Success conditions are identified from the literature and analysed regarding two cases of applied marine spatial planning in Europe: the <b>Voordelta</b> (The Netherlands) and the Barents Sea- Lofoten area (Norway). The analysis focusses on fishing and nature protection interests. The process towards the <b>Voordelta</b> management plan forms an impressive first attempt of applying stakeholder participation as part of marine spatial planning. There is a rather high degree of stakeholder participation and major efforts were made to realize active participation. The outcome was successful to a quite high degree: some trade-offs were identified in cooperation with stakeholders and there was some degree of ownership. However, there were drawbacks regarding the latter especially for the fishing sector and regarding the strict deadline. The process towards the Barents Sea—Lofoten area management plan was rather technical: it was dominated by experts and officials, and organised top-down with a limited role for stakeholders. There was a limited degree of success of the outcome: there was only one fairly-balanced compromise and basically no feeling of ownership developed among the fishing and nature protection interests. The thesis confirmed the importance of the success conditions analysed. Finally, recommendations as based on these two strikingly different approaches to stakeholder participation in marine spatial planning are offered as linked to the analysed success conditions...|$|E
40|$|Early (post) larval fish {{constitute}} {{a significant part}} of the temporary hyperbenthos, i. e. of the fauna living in the lower reaches of the water column close to the substratum. Information on the densities and spatial and temporal variations of these stages, as well as on their lengths at the moment of occurrence, can be an important contribution to the knowledge of their dispersion, migrations and to the identification of possible bottlenecks in their recruitment. Therefore the hyperbenthos of the <b>Voordelta,</b> a shallow coastal zone in front of the Dutch Delta, as well as that of the subtidal channels and the intertidal brackish marsh creeks of the Westerschelde Estuary, was sampled monthly during one year by means of a sledge and a stow net. A total of 37 taxa were recorded from 410 samples. Densities often exceeded 400 ind 1000 m - 2 in the <b>Voordelta</b> and 300 ind 1000 m - 2 in the Westerschelde, including the tidal marshes of Waarde and Saeftinghe. The dominant taxa were clupeid larvae (predominantly herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus, Pomatoschistus spp. (a mixture of sand goby P. minutus and Lozano's goby P. lozanoi), common goby Pomatoschistus microps, Syngnathus spp. (probably almost exclusively Nilsson's pipefish S. rostellatus), plaice Pleuronectes platessa, sole Solea solea and flounder Pleuronectes flesus. Most species were found at a larger size in the Westerschelde (and in the tidal marshes) suggesting migration from the shallow coastal area into the estuary. Several species utilize the tidal marshes in the brackish reaches of the Westerschelde. The nursery value of these areas however, is restricted to specific early life history stages of a few species, especially flounder, bass Dicentrarchus labrax and the common goby. The estuary itself seems to function as a nursery for other species like sole and plaice. The hyperbenthic sledge was found to sample specific life history stages of postlarval flatfish (early settlement stages at the onset of asymmetry), which are not easy to sample with other types of sampling gear...|$|E
40|$|For the {{management}} of the shellfish sector, shellfish are regularly imported from various European countries into the Dutch coastal waters. With the import of shellfish, there is a risk of unintentional introduction of exotic species, pests and diseases that could have harmful effects. Therefore, the transports or shellfish are watched critically by the various stakeholders. The present study focuses on the risks of the unintentional introduction of new exotic species with the shellfish transports. We define exotic species as species that are non-indiginous for the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf area and are introduced into this area by human activities. The biogeographical area Northeast Atlantic continental shelf region ranges from the Northern part of Spain to the coastal areas of Norway. Once established somewhere in the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf, shellfish transports can accelerate the introduction into the Dutch coastal waters. Far from every introduction of exotic species becomes a pest. However, once introduced it is very difficult if not impossible to remove the species from the ecosystem. In this study, the risks of unintentional introduction of exotic species with various shellfish transports are evaluated. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality will use this information to develop a new national policy for the transfer of shellfish. Recently, the debate on the present policy that dates from 1997 has intensified due to judgments of the Council of State and the European Court of Justice. Moreover, the shellfish farmers are more and more interested to transfer mussels and seed mussels that have been captured with mussel seed capture devices from the Oosterschelde and the <b>Voordelta</b> to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. This transport is prohibited under the present policy. The invasiveness of a species {{is an important factor in}} a risk assessment for the introduction of exotic species. The list “ 100 of the World’s most invasive alien species” gives a good overview of the species with the highest risks. As a first indication this list is very useful, however, it should not be assumed that the list is complete. Besides as assessment on species, the risks can also be assessed on the location from where the shellfish are imported. Most of the exotic species that are present in the Dutch coastal waters have their area of origin in NW Pacific (39 species) or the NW Atlantic Ocean (26 species). The majority of he exotic species are introduced the Dutch coastal areas by secondary transport. Shellfish imports from Ireland, UK and France show the highest risks on introducing exotic species due to the number of exotic species in these countries and the environmental conditions that are comparable to the conditions in the Dutch coastal waters. According to the national policy on shellfish transfer, it is obliged to transfer shellfish from the Oosterschelde and <b>Voordelta</b> to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea (South – North transport). The risks of this transport on introduction of exotic species have been evaluated by means of expert judgment and literature review. A group of 11 national and international experts have been consulted for this study. A list of exotic species of the South (Oosterschelde, <b>Voordelta,</b> Grevelingenmeer and Veerse Meer) has been compiled and compared with the list of exotic species present in the North (Dutch part of the Wadden Sea). The target species, species that are present in the South but not in the North could potentially be introduced in the Dutch Wadden Sea with the shellfish transfer from the South. The risks of each of the 65 target species have been evaluated semi-quantitatively from the chance of successful introduction and the expected impact. The species with the highest risks are the tunicates Didemnum sp. and Botrylloides violaceus, the copepods Mytilicola orientalis and M. ostreae, the American whelk tingle Urosalpinx cinerea, the bryozoa Smittoidea prolifica, the protist Marteilia refringens and the marcoalgae Gracilaria vermiculophylla, Polysiphonia senticulosa and Undaria pinnatifida. At present it is allowed and common practice to transfer mussels from the Danish and German parts of the Wadden Sea to the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The risks assessment indicates that with these shellfish transfers 46 exotic species could potentially be introduced into the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea. The species with the highest risks are mainly macroalgae: Gracilaria vermiculophylla, Heterosiphonia japonica and Laminaria ochotensis. The risks of shellfish transfers within the Wadden Sea are lower than the risks of shellfish transfer from South to North. During the Summer of 2008, 30 samples have been taken from mussels in the water column (rope culture and Mussel seed capture devices) and from the bottom (culture plots and natural beds), both in the Oosterschelde and the <b>Voordelta.</b> The samples have been analyzed for associated flora and fauna. Special attention was paid to the exotic species. In total 12 exotic species were identified in the samples. In the samples from the <b>Voordelta</b> only one exotic species was found (Sargassum muticum). The exotic species accounted for more than 10 percent of the total number of species identified in samples from the Oosterschelde. There was a clear distinction in species composition between the samples from the water column and from the bottom. Characteristic species for the bottom samples were the American slipper limpet (Crepidula fornicata), the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the brush-clawed shore crab (Hemigrapsus takanoi) and the polychate Syllis gracilis. Characteristic species for the suspended culture are the macroalgae Sargassum muticum, Codium fragile and Undaria pinnatifida and the tunicate Styela clava. The present study is primarily focused on exotic species that might be introduced with shellfish transports. However, also other harmful not-exotic organisms such as toxic algae, pests and diseases could be unintentionally (re-) introduced with the shellfish. Based on the results of this study the research questions as formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality can be answered as follows: 1. Shellfish import from France, Ireland and the UK constitutes the highest risk at introduction of exotic species with shellfish transfer into the Dutch coastal waters. The risks of import from Ireland and UK to the Oosterschelde have been quantified in a previous study, the PRIMUS study. 2. The list with “ 100 of the World’s most invasive alien species” gives a good indication of the invasiveness, and thus potential impact of species. However, the list is not exhaustive. 3. The risks of introducing exotic species with shellfish transfer from South to North are not absent. The report gives an overview of risk species and a quantification of the risks. The number of exotic species associated with rope culture and mussel seed capture devices in the Oosterschelde corresponds to the number of exotic species associated with the bottom culture. However, the composition of the exotics differ. 4. The risks of introducing exotic species with shellfish transfer within the Wadden Sea (Danish and German Wadden Sea to the Dutch Wadden Sea) is less than the risks of shellfish tranports from the Oosterschelde and <b>Voordelta</b> to the Wadden Sea. The report gives an overview of the risk species and a quantification of the risks...|$|E
40|$|Once, {{shellfish}} reefs - mainly {{flat oysters}} - covered about 20 % of the North Sea floor, but diseases, pollution and overfishing {{have led to}} a significant decline. As part of the Haringvliet Dream Fund Project (www. haringvliet. nu), ARK Nature and World Wildlife Fund Netherlands are working on shellfish reef restoration. Shellfish, such as mussels and flat oysters, are keystone species for marine biodiversity, since they filter the water, provide shelter and nursery grounds for many marine animals, serve as attachment substrate for plants and range of animals, including birds.

40|$|During 1989 monthly {{beam trawl}} samples were {{collected}} at 48 stations in the Dutch Delta. The annual mean densities of the demersal fishes and mobile epibenthic invertebrates at these stations were calculated. These data were then subjected to multivariate statistical techniques for {{an analysis of the}} spatial structure of the communities found and to study the relationship between these communities and their environment. The present study confirms the results of HENDERSON (1989) that, given a fairly limited number of environmental variables, mainly salinity and exposure/substratum type, quite accurate predictions of the type of community expected at a certain site can be made. The explicit inclusion of epibenthic invertebrates, a dominant group in most assemblages, in studies mainly targeted at demersal fishes, is strongly recommended. In the Dutch Delta rich and varied communities exist in the <b>Voordelta.</b> A number of groups, such as salmonids, anadromous species and starfish, expected in the Westerschelde are absent or extremely rare probably as a consequence of pollution stress.

40|$|The hyperbenthic mysids and euphausiids of the subtidal shallow {{coastal waters}} (the <b>Voordelta)</b> and the Westerschelde estuary in the Delta area (SW Netherlands) were {{regularly}} sampled between 1988 and 1991. Two salt marshes in the brackish {{part of the}} estuary were studied in the same period. Eight mysid species and one euphausiid species were identified. The spatial and seasonal distribution patterns of all species are described. The most abundant species in the coastal area is Schistomysis spiritus, followed by Mesopodopsis slabberi, Schistomysis kervillei, and Gastrosaccus spinifer. In the marine part of the Westerschelde the same four species are dominant but densities are generally higher in the coastal area. Only Siriella armata and the euphausiid Nyctiphanes couchi never enter the estuary. Higher mysid densities, mainly M. slabberi and the estuarine endemic Neomysis integer, {{are found in the}} brackish part of the Westerschelde. Praunus flexuosus is a euryhaline species with a preference for the intertidal areas.

40|$|The {{potential}} ecological {{effects of}} the sand mining activities for Maasvlakte 2 {{have been identified in}} an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). One of the identified effects in this EIA was an impact on the number of sea ducks in the Natura 2000 area 'Voordelta'. The sand mining activities will cause an increase of the silt concentration along the North Sea coast. Subsequently the light intensity in the water column decreases. A change of the light intensity can affect the growth of phytoplankton. An impact on the growth of phytoplankton can finally affect higher-order species in the food chain: phytoplankton is eaten by bivalves and bivalves form the main food of sea ducks like eiders. Within this so-called impact-effect chain from sand mining to sea ducks, a large number of uncertainties play a role. In the EIA safe assumptions were used for a lot of these uncertainties. The final predicted impact {{is a result of the}} accumulation of several safe assumptions. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of this predicted impact will be small. Information on this probability of occurrence will be useful in the discussion about the necessity of mitigating and compensating measures. The main objective of this thesis is to give insight in the probability of occurrence of the possible effects of sand mining on sea ducks in the <b>Voordelta.</b> The research started by analysing which uncertain factors and processes have a large influence on the final result. A Monte Carlo analysis was used to take the uncertainties of these factors into account in the modelling of the ecological effects. Probability density functions were estimated for the relevant variables and were finally combined in the Monte Carlo analysis. From the results of the Monte Carlo analysis probability distribution functions for the impact of sand mining on eiders are derived. These probability distribution functions show that the probability that the sand mining activities for Maasvlakte 2 have a significant effect on eiders in the <b>Voordelta</b> is very small and can be considered negligible. In this thesis is shown that giving insight in the probability of occurrence of significant ecological effects by using a probabilistic analysis is possible. The methodology that is used in this thesis is also expected to be applicable for the assessment of ecological effects of other human activities. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

A BACI-design {{experiment}} was used {{to examine the effects of}} a traditional beam trawl gear and the pulse trawl gear. The pulse trawl gear is gaining popularity amongst Dutch fishers in recent years due to reduced fuel costs and good sole catches. The research was carried out in the northern part of the Dutch <b>Voordelta</b> (southern North Sea coastal zone area, 15 – 22 m deep, sandy habitat) in June 2013. In this experimental area, fishing disturbance was considered to be low so interference with the experiment was minimalized. Within the experimental area 3 sub-areas (150 m x 1000 m) were established for the BACI experiment: 1) a pulse trawl area; 2) a beam trawl area; 3) a reference area. The pulse and beam trawl areas of the BACI experiment were trawled by a commercial vessel (pulse) and a research vessel (beam) for one day. Before trawling, the areas were sampled with a multibeam, a sediment profile imaging (SPI) camera and a benthic sledge.

40|$|During the 1960 s {{and early}} 1970 s, the open {{system of the}} Rhine-Meuse estuary with a {{continuous}} salinity gradient was converted {{into a series of}} stagnant fresh water lakes separated by sluices from the North Sea coastal region ‘Voordelta’. For the last 50 yr, the macrozoobenthic communities have been monitored intensively, and a large dataset is available on the responses of macrozoobenthic communities to strong disturbances (e. g. transitions in salinity, currents and dynamics) and gradual changes (e. g. changes in pollution and nutrient levels). The current study analyzes patterns and developments in macrozoobenthic compositions in terms of community descriptors (e. g. density, richness, evenness and diversity) and proportional distributions over feeding guilds (suspension feeders, deposit feeders, surface deposit feeders, herbivores, omnivores and predators). We compare historic and present situations and show that communities respond in similar ways (viz. peaking densities co-occurring with decreasing richness and diversity) to large disturbances and that the distribution over the feeding guilds indicates the state of the environment. Although the historic communities showed signs of system deterioration (mainly due to pollutants and nutrients), and at present, exotic species are abundant in the region, historic data were found to be valuable as a reference for what can be expected on the macrozoobenthic level following estuary restoration. This study showed the value of an undisturbed estuary in terms of total macrozoobenthic diversity compared to the series of fresh water lakes now separated from the <b>Voordelta</b> system and raises questions about future plans for a regulated salt water inlet that will be restricted to only 11. 5 km inland. ...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{the mobile}} epifauna of the Oosterschelde estuary, {{collected}} by beam trawl, were compiled from several studies. Multivariate statistical techniques {{brought out the}} fact that the Oosterschelde, when compared with neighbouring areas, has a characteristic epibenthic fauna. Diversity as measured by Hill's diversity numbers N through N +infinite, is higher for the Oosterschelde (N 1 = 4. 5) than for the <b>Voordelta</b> (N 1 = 3. 5) and the Westerschelde (N 1 = 2. 2). Four epifaunal communities can be distinguished within the Oosterschelde, the two most seaward communities being the richest. Annual production is estimated at about 6 gADW m - 2 yr - 1, annual consumption is estimated at over 25 g ADW m - 2 yr - 1. These results are highly dependent on the assumptions. Over 85 % of the epibenthic production and consumption in the Oosterschelde is accounted for by only six species: starfish Asterias rubens, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, bib Trisopterus luscus, brown shrimp Crangon crangon, shore crab Carcinus maenas and dab Limanda limanda. In spite of its abundance, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus contributes little to the production. From the available data it is difficult {{to assess the impact of}} the construction of the storm-surge barrier and the compartmentalization dams on the epibenthic fauna. The increase in flatfish in the Hammen area is probably linked to the decrease in current velocities in that area. On the other hand the increase in flatfish in the Hammen area is probably linked to the decrease in current velocities in that area. On the other hand the increase in the gadoids bib and whiting Merlangius merlangus is predominantly due to the stronger year classes in the post-barrier time period. Lower nutrient inputs through the Northern branch, in combination with the increase of the gadoids, may have caused the decline of the brown shrimp in the Oosterschelde. A decrease has also been observed in the sand eel Ammodytes tobianus and the hooknose Agonus cataphractus...|$|E
40|$|The {{razor clam}} Ensis directus was {{introduced}} to Europe presumably as larvae in ballast water around 1978. Starting in the German Bight it spread northward and southward along the continental coastline. Currently {{it is the most}} common shellfish species in the Dutch coastal zone, where it mainly occurs in the <b>Voordelta</b> and off the Wadden Sea islands. The mean density of E. directus in the Dutch coastal zone increased from around 2 – 5 individuals m- 2 in the late ‘ 90 ’s to around 12 – 19 individuals m- 2 from 2002 onwards. Diet studies show that E. directus makes up a significant proportion in the current diet of plaice, sole, dab, flounder and dragonet and in the diet of eider and common scoter. In recent years E. directus contributed 20 – 100 % of the total wet weight in fish stomachs. The proportion E. directus in the diet increases with fish length. Based on stomach contents of oiled and beached birds and of faeces samples the recent frequency of occurrence is 85 – 90 % in eider and 26 % in common scoter. Also waders, gulls and corvids prey on E. directus but the contribution to the diet is still unquantified. Because of its great burying depth the species is not easily accessible. Fish either profit from massive die-offs that regularly occur, or they extract (probably only the smaller) individuals from the sediment. Sea ducks can extract E. directus from the sediment, while shorebirds and gulls feed on dying E. directus washing up on the shore. E. directus is possibly an important food item for fish and seabirds when they occur in high densities and in the right size classes. Since the availability depends greatly on massive die-offs, shell size, burying depth and water depth, it is probably not a very reliable food source. Judging from the role E. directus currently plays for the higher trophic levels, its introduction must have caused a major change in the food relations in its distribution area...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch coast {{carries a}} variety of values. With its {{diversity}} in dune areas, its shallows and the delta areas, the coastal area of the Netherlands has a high ecological value, forming a unique biotope for {{a great variety of}} plant and animal species, and providing an important foraging area for migrating birds. The economic importance of the Dutch coast is significant as well. The coastal waters provide a large area for the fishing industry and in the wide dunes drinking water has been extracted since the nineteenth century. The Dutch coast is the gateway to the ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam and it also attracts millions of tourists every year. Furthermore, the coastal area is popular as a residential and as an agricultural area. Finally, the Dutch coast carries many socio-cultural values. For centuries, the coast has {{played an important role in}} securing the safety of the hinterland while the image of the coast with its dikes, dunes and water works is characteristic of Dutch cultural history. Against this backdrop, the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat) has established the umbrella project Water Assets within the organisation for water exploration (WVK). The most important reason this project has been established is that in the past the costs were often a deciding factor in the specification of policies on water, while the assets of water management were often not considered in detail. Participants in the Water Assets project are, among others, the National Institute for Coast and Sea (RIKZ) and the National Institute for Inland Water Management and Wastewater Treatment (RIZA). In the context of salt water management, the RIKZ had two case studies 1 carried out by the Institute for Environmental Issues (IVM) and Resource Analysis (RA). The first case study is aimed at an Integrated Coastal Zone policy, in which various options of coastal management of the Hondsbossche Zeewering are evaluated. The second case study investigates the idea of a Veluwe on Sea. In this case study, the effects of the introduction of a natural sea reserve in the <b>Voordelta</b> area are evaluated. The central question in the Water Assets project is how to make the benefits of integrated water management and policy visible. It is all about quantifying the benefits and disadvantage of certain actions, comparing the different dimensions of certain effects and balancing both against each other. It was decided to split the project three ways into ecological (Green issues), economic (Financial issues) and socio-cultural (Opinions) methods of evaluation. Management and legal issues in this study do not form separate aspects; they are tools or they are part of the three abovementioned topics. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 : provides, I believe, a quasi-complete {{overview}} of the existing literature on the hyperbenthos. It thus serves as a general introduction to the work presented in this thesis. Studies are situated {{in space and time}} and the main structural characteristics of hyperbenthic communities are summarised. Quite some effort is paid to resolve the overriding semantic disagreement which seems to slow down progress in the field. Sampling methodology and the history of hyperbenthic research are reviewed. The role of hyperbenthic animals in marine food webs is briefly touched upon. Chapter 2 : describes the hyperbenthic communities of the <b>Voordelta.</b> Twelve locations were sampled monthly at two depths between August 1988 and July 1989. ' Three subareas were covered: the ebb-tidal deltas of the Oosterschelde and the Grevelingen, and the more seaward Banjaard area in between. High densities of a variety of animals were found to be present in the lower metre of the water column. Hyperbenthic community structure was strongly dominated by seasonal fluctuations due to the sequential appearance, high abundance and disappearance of the different species of temporary hyperbenthic species. In winter and early spring, when the community was dominated by its permanent residents, spatial patterns emerged. Averaged over the year these spatial patterns were consistent with the hydrodynamical regime in the system. The geomorphological changes, following the closure of the Grevelingen estuary, in its ebb-tidal delta seem to have created a sheltered area with low current velocities. The hydrodynamical properties of the area are favourable towards the sedimentation of silt and detritus and possibly concentrate fish eggs. Decapod larvae, probably from offshore origin, occur in high densities in the area and macrobenthic larvae find favourable conditions for settlement. This richness and a high primary productivity probably attracts mobile animals (e. g. mysids and fish). In comparison, the equally sheltered ebb-tidal delta of the Oosterschelde is much poorer. Most probably higher current velocities there do not allow sedimentation of silt and, detritus and are not conducive to the entrapment of neutrally buoyant animals. Chapter 3 : gives the results of a pilot study on estuarine hyperbenthos conducted in December 1988. 41 stations in the Westerschelde and Oosterschelde estuaries, and in part of the neighbouring shallow coastal area, the <b>Voordelta,</b> were sampled quasi-simultaneously. Winter was chosen as the sampling period to avoid the presence of temporary hyperbenthic species. The dominant components of the hyperbenthic communities were identified. Their spatial distribution, the geographical variation in species composition, density and biomass were described and the observed patterns were related to some environmental variables. Using multivariate analysis all sites sampled could be grouped into 7 geographically coherent clusters corresponding to 7 species assemblages. Mysids dominated the winter hyperbenthos in all communities. Species distributions in the Westerschelde seemed to be primarily determined by a salinity-turbidity-dissolved oxygen gradient. Hyperbenthic animals, mainly the mysid Neomysis integer, reached high densities in the brackish part whereas the more seaward stations were characterized by lower densities but a higher number of species. In the benthic filter-feeder dominated Oosterschelde, the total density of the hyper benthos was very low. The shallow coastal area was characterized by intermediate densities. Chapter 4 : describes the hyperbenthos of the Westerschelde, both in space and time. Samples were taken in spring, summer and winter of 1990 at 14 stations along the salinity gradient. Temporal patterns are further described from year cycles of monthly and forthnightly samples taken from April 1990 to December 1991. Mysids dominated the hyperbenthos in each season. Other important species, either permanently (e. g. amphipods and isopods) or temporarily (e. g. fish larvae and decapod larvae) hyperbenthic, belonged to a variety of faunistic groups. Spatial structure was stable through time: the estuary could be divided in the same geographically defined zones in each season. Each zone had a characteristic fauna. Throughout the year, the hyperbenthic community of the mouth region of the estuary was markedly {{different from that of the}} upstream brackish area, both in terms of density and species composition. Gradients in salinity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity correlate strongly with the observed variation in community structure. The spatial patterns dominate over the temporal patterns, especially in the brackish part of the estuary. In the marine part, seasonal differences in the communities were more pronounced due to the recruitment, maximal abundance and subsequent disappearance of a series of temporary hyperbenthic species. In the brackish zone seasonal patterns were less obvious. Still, spring was characterized by the presence of postlarval flounder and clupeoids, while other seasonal differences seemed to be mainly due to natural mortality and to migration of permanent hyperbenthic species in and out of the area. In each season, the upstream (brackish) communities were characterized by few species occurring in very high numbers, whereas the downstream (marine) communities were composed of many species but at lower densities. Chapter 5 : gives a detailed account on the species of Mysidacea and the one species of Euphausiacea encountered in the preceding chapters. The hyperbenthic mysids and euphausiids of the shallow coastal waters and the Westerschelde were regularly sampled between 1988 and 1991 (see above). These data were supplemented with monthly samples from two salt marshes in the brackish part of the estuary. Eight mysid species and one euphausiid species were identified. The spatial and seasonal distribution patterns of all species were described. The most abundant species in the coastal area was Schistomysis spiritus, followed by Mesopodopsis slabberi, Schistomysis kervillei, and Gastrosaccus spinifer. In the marine part of the Westerschelde the same four species were dominant but densities were generally higher than in the coastal area. Only Siriella armata and the euphausiid Nyctiphanes couchi never entered the estuary. Highest mysid densities, mainly M. slabberi and the estuarine endemic Neomysis integer, were found in the brackish part of the Westerschelde. Praunus flexuosus is a euryhaline species with a preference for the intertidal areas. The estuarine populations of N. integer, M. slabberi, P. flexuosus, and - to a lesser extent - S. spiritus seem to utilise the salt marshes during periods of reproduction. Chapter 6 : compares the hyperbenthos of the Westerschelde with that of two other, less polluted European estuaries: the Eems (north of the Westerschelde) and the Gironde (south of the Westerschelde). The three estuaries were sampled at regularly spaced stations covering the entire salinity gradient from marine conditions at the mouth to nearly freshwater conditions upstream within a 15 day period in summer 1991. The diversity of the samples and the distribution of the species along the main estuarine gradients were assessed. Again, hyperbenthic communities were identified using different multivariate statistical techniques. The species composition and the density and biomass of the dominant species of each community were compared among communities. Spatial patterns in density, biomass and diversity of the hyperbenthos were similar in the three estuaries: diversity was highest in the marine zone where density and biomass were lowest. Diversity decreased upstream and was lowest in the brackish part where density and biomass reached maximal values. In the Eems and the Gironde there was a slight increase in diversity towards the freshwater zone. Within each estuary two (Westerschelde) or three (Eems and Gironde) communities could be distinguished and their position along the unidirectional salinity-turbidity temperature gradient was similar: a marine community in the high salinity zone, a brackish water community in the middle reaches and a third community (absent in the Westerschelde) in the stations with the lowest salinities. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the corresponding hyperbenthic communities among estuaries were evident. Some species were restricted to one or two of the estuaries studied, while others, especially the abundant species in the brackish part, were common to all three. Still, these differences were marginal compared to the overriding similarity of the hyperbenthos in the three estuaries. The distribution of single species in the estuaries varied to some extent but the among estuary differences in density and biomass in comparable salinity zones rarely exceeded an order of magnitude. In the Westerschelde, the low salinity hyperbenthic community was completely absent. Upstream of the 10 psu isohaline the dissolved oxygen concentration dropped to a critical threshold value for hyperbenthic life. The populations of a number of species, which in Gironde and Eems reached highest density and biomass in this zone, seem to have (almost) disappeared from the Westerschelde (e. g. Gammarus zaddachi and Palaemon longirostris). Other brackish water species did not occur in their "normal" salinity range and their populations have shifted to higher, atypical salinity zones (e. g. Neomysis integer, Mesopodopsis slabberi, Pomatoschistus microps and Gammarus salinus). The addendum to this chapter concerns an oddity, namely the discovery of a hitherto unreported isopod species in the Gironde estuary. Synidotea laevidorsalis, new for the European fauna, is a nonendemic shallow-water species which was probably introduced into the Gironde from Asia. In the salinity range of 1 to 10 psu of the Gironde the species constitutes an important component of the brackish-water hyperbenthic community. Chapter 7 : concerns the population dynamics of the key species of the Westerschelde hyperbenthos: the mysid Neomysis integer. The population was sampled on a fortnightly basis from November 1990 to December 1991. Density, biomass, population structure and brood size were recorded. The Bhattacharya method was applied to the length-frequency data for the detection and separation of cohorts. Growth is described both by a generalised von Bertalanffy function and by a von Bertalanffy function incorporating seasonal oscillations in growth. Secondary production was estimated for each cohort using four approaches. The seasonal pattern in density and biomass showed three peaks: a relatively small, yet distinct, peak in early March and two main peaks in late spring and in summer. Throughout winter, Neomysis density remained low. Three periods of increased reproductive activity and subsequent input of juveniles were found. This suggests that three cohorts were produced per year. The overwintering generation lived from autumn until the following spring. The spring generation was born in early spring and lived for about three months, while the summer generation lived from summer until early winter. The three cohorts showed marked differences in their biology. The overwintering generation showed seasonal growth oscillations, larger brood size, and a larger size at maturity. Individuals belonging to the other two cohorts generally grew faster, produced less young per female, and attained maturity at a smaller size. Within each cohort, both sexes exhibited different growth characteristics: the females generally lived longer, grew faster and consequently became larger than the males. The size-frequency, growth summation and removal summation methods yielded comparable production estimates. The annual production was 0. 3 g AFDW m-² yr- 1 with an annual P/B ratio of 6. The average cohort P/B was 3. The size-frequency method gave similar results only when applied to the three cohorts and to both sexes separately. The spring cohort accounted for almost half of the annual production. Despite the longer life span of the overwintering generation, it generated only a quarter of the annual production. An independent estimate of production using the mortality rate of the different cohorts, resulted in values comparable to those obtained by the other methods for the overwintering cohort, while the production of the other two cohorts was overestimated. The addendum to this chapter reports on intersexuality in the mysid Neomysis integer collected in the 3 estuaries mentioned above, supplemented with samples from the Elbe (Germany). Individuals which had an irregularly shaped or nearly symmetrically rounded, rather than a typically truncated, telson were also recorded from the four populations studied. A culture experiment with, damaged specimens revealed that every type of abnormal telson morphology found in the field can result from regeneration of damaged parts. It is concluded that both intersexuality and aberrant telson morphology are widespread phenomena among estuarine Neomysis populations. Both abnormalities were found to be rare in the other dominant mysid species in the study area...|$|E
