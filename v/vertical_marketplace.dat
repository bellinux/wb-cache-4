40|$|This letter {{provides}} an overview of our recent work studying the impacts of price competition and congestion in the cloud marketplace. Specifically, we discuss a three-tier market model that studies a <b>vertical</b> <b>marketplace</b> where users purchase services from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers, which in turn purchase computing resources from either Provider-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers...|$|E
40|$|Though B 2 B-marketplaces {{are still}} in the early phase of their existing, they had been subject of various adjustments. We can even {{identify}} several evolution steps in their development during the past few years. One of the most important developments is the integration of logistic services and the focus on the achievement of new business value through combined strategies involving e-business and Supply Chain Management (SCM). In particular for small and medium sized enterprises (SME) linking forces using B 2 B-marketplaces with supply chain optimization functionalities opens new horizons to improve inter-organizational processes. In this paper we outline the relationship between B 2 B-marketplaces and SCM and we argue that both concepts converge within modern models of B 2 B exchanges. A case study undertaken at a <b>vertical</b> <b>marketplace</b> in the furniture industry illustrates the results achieved through the integration of SCM functionalities with this marketplace...|$|E

Marketplaces is a self-serve, real-time bidding platform for the insurance, home services, and education <b>verticals.</b> <b>Marketplaces</b> joins together high-traffic publishers with popular, household-name advertisers. It gives advertisers the power to pay what they want, when they want, and how they want, for the exact consumers they want. This is achieved through giving the advertiser the power to control {{how they want to}} engage with the customer, and vice versa, through either clicks, calls, or leads.|$|R
40|$|A <b>vertical</b> {{electronic}} <b>marketplace</b> (EM) is an inter-organizational intermediary {{within a}} single industry that enables participating buyers and sellers to exchange information about price and product offerings and to cooperate on commodity exchange. Using a Relational View (RV) per-spective, this paper develops theoretical arguments that explain the impact of ownership on the likelihood of vEM survival. With a survival analysis, this paper provides empirical support for the theoretical arguments using data collected on 159 vEMs across six industries. The paper found that EM ownerships with industry ties will have higher survival rates than those without. Key words: B 2 B electronic marketplace, ownership model, relational vie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Given {{the central}} role of space in {{political}} and economic decisions, geographic information (GI) should have a high market potential. But in reality, market growth does not seem to achieve this potential. Some impediments are inappropriate products, old-fashioned business models, and high transaction costs. Often, user segments have very specific needs for GI that are not met by the generally available digital maps. This paper will identify the demand for GI products of financial service providers, testing how their needs are currently fulfilled. The test results will show that most internet providers of GI do not offer an appropriate access to GI products to potential customers of this vertical segment: The offer mostly consists of geographic data while the demand mostly targets GI services applicated on geographic data and software. For better GI market growth, we suggest to realize <b>vertical</b> GI <b>marketplaces</b> as parts of NSDIâ€™s, designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific market segments. ...|$|R
