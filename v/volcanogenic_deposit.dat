40|$|ABSTRACT: The mineralogy, {{petrology}} {{and trace}} dement geochemistry of volcanogenic glauconites and smectite-rich lays are described {{and related to}} clay assemblages in Lower and Upper Cretaceous ediments of southern England and Northern Ireland. Volcanogenic glauconite grains represent argillized lava particles of predominantly marie composition a d may have been derived from submarine basaltic magmatism; they occur in all the sediments examined (Aptian-Senonian), and are particularly abundant in the Cenomanian-Campanian Hibernian Greensand of Antrim. The smectite-rich lays in southern England have developed by the argillization of predominantly acid or alkaline ash during early diagenesis. Three types of <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposit</b> are recognized. Primary bentonites are thin ash-falls deposited in quiet, brackish and marine waters (Speeton Clay, Ryazanian; Weald Clay, Barremian). Secondary bentonites are local accumulations of ash transported into the Cretaceous seas by rivers draining ash-blanketed, local land areas (London Platform, Portsdown Axis). These deposits are well-developed in the Sandgate Beds, Folkestone Beds and their contiguous deposits, and {{the lower part of}} the Gault (Upper Aptian-Middle Albian). The ash originated from penecon-temporaneous, subaerial vulcanism located in the southern part of the North Sea. The mos...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Restatement of Aims: To {{investigate}} the geological and geochemical {{controls on the}} distribution of precious metals within volcanic-hosted massive sulphide deposits, with the objective of developing exploration models useful for the discovery of further precious metal-rich deposits. Background: Due to the high concentration of gold and silver in the Western Tasmanian <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits,</b> the project has initially concentrated on the documentation and study of gold-silver accumulation along the Mt. Read Volcanic Arc. A four-pronged approach has been adopted on the Tasmnanian deposits: 1) Detailed studies of precious metal geology and geochemistry at Rosebery and Que River, the two richest deposits. 2) Geology and geochemistry of a barren sulphide system, Lake Selina, to evaluate why some volcanic hydrothermal systems are devoid of precious and base metals. 3) A study of gold mineralisation along the Henty Fault Zone, a major structure which dislocates the Mt. Read Volcanic Arc and {{has been the focus of}} hydrothermal activity. 4) Research into the chemistry of the Mt. Read Volcanics to determine whether there is a relationship between gold mineralisation and volcanic rock chemistry (either primary or alteration chemistry). To complement the Tasmanian studies, three Western Australian Archean <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits</b> (Gossan Hill, Scuddles, and Teutonic Bore), and a Queensland deposit (Balcooma) have been included in the project for comparative purposes. This Report: This second major report marks 15 months of research since commencement of the project in August 1985. The first report (April 1986) dealt mainly with research on: - geology, structure, and metal distribution of the PQ lens and P-north lens at Que River. - a chemical data base for the Mt. Read Volcanics. This report covers further research developments on the Tasmanian deposits plus a comprehensive section on the Archean massive sulphides.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Restatement of Aims To {{investigate}} the geological and geochemical {{controls on the}} distribution of precious metals within volcanic hosted massive sulphide deposits, with the objective of developing exploration models useful for the discovery of further precious metal-rich deposits. Progress 1985 - 1988 This is the fourth and final report on the results of this research project. Our progress and results this year have been very satisfying and I can confidently report that we have achieved the aims and objectives outlined in our original proposal at the commencement of this project in 1985. During the three years of this research program we have made major advances in our understanding of the controls on precious metals in volcanogenic hydrothermal systems, which have application in the future exploration and mining of volcanogenic gold, silver and base metal deposits. In particular, the following has been achieved: 1. Detailed documentation of the geology, mineralogy and zonation of precious metals within a number of Australian massive sulphide deposits (Rosebery, Que River and Hercules in Tasmania, Balcooma and Mt. Chalmers in Queensland, and Scuddles and Teutonic Bore in Western Australia) has led to the recognition of two major gold associations; the Au-Zn (-Pb-Ag-ba) association and the Au-Cu association. Compilation of a tonnage-grade data base for similar precious metal-rich <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits</b> in Japan and the Canadian Archean has confirmed these two associations. 2. Research into the chemistry of gold transport and deposition has {{led to the development of}} a geologic-thermodynamic model which can account for (and predict) the concentration and location of gold within volcanogenic systems under a variety of hydrothermal solution conditions. This model has major implications for gold transport and deposition in other geological environments (eg. epithermal or porphyry systems). 3. Geochemical studies of the Cambrian volcanics which comprise the Mt. Read Volcanic archave increased our understanding of the volcanic processes involved, their relationship to the tectonic setting and the interplay between volcanic processes, hydrothermal processes, alteration and mineralisation. 4. Research into the primary gold content of the Cambrian volcanics and sediments of western Tasmania has identified the probable source rocks for gold. This work has significant exploration implications. 5. A series of exploration models for gold-bearing <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits</b> have been developed which facilitate the transfer of research technology developed in this program to mining company sponsors...|$|R

40|$|The Greater Antilles host {{some of the}} world’s most {{important}} deposits of bauxite and lateritic nickel as well as significant resources of gold and silver, copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt and chromium. Beginning in Jurassic time, sedimentary exhalative base metal deposits accumulated in marine sedimentary rift basins as North and South America drifted apart. With the onset of intraoceanic subduction during the Early Cretaceous, a primitive (tholeiitic) island arc formed above a southwesterly-dipping subduction zone.

40|$|<b>Volcanogenic</b> massive {{sulphide}} <b>deposits</b> {{are important}} sources of base metals throughout the world. The Canadian Cu-Zn-(Au, Ag) deposits of Archaean age occur in greenstone terrains within the Canadian Shield. These deposits are {{closely associated with}} volcanic vents developed along zones of rifting within mobile belts. The vents are manifested by coarse felsic pyroclastics and/or rhyolitic domes. The Japanese Pb-Zn-Cu-Ba(Ag) deposits, generally known as Kuroko deposits, are of Miocene age, and although also associated with volcanic vents, are developed above zones of subduction. Mineralization in <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits</b> {{is a result of}} submarine exhalation of metalliferous hydrothermal solutions derived from fractionation of predominantly calc-alkaline magmas. The deposits are characterized by certain geological features that result from the interaction of specific physical and chemical conditions during deposition. Primary features include massive and stringer sulphide bodies, alteration zones, mineralogical and metal zoning, and certain depositional textures and structures. These features are commonly modified by subsequent metamorphism and deformation which impart secondary ore textures and affect metal distribution and shape. The disparity in age between Canadian and Japanese deposits allows the entire spectrum of geological features to be studied; from the completely unaltered to the high deformed and recrystallized. The characteristic geological features are the prime factors which control the metal distribution and concentration, and {{the size and shape of}} the deposits, thereby influencing the viability of the respective ore bodies. A knowledge of these factors and the physico-chemical parameters which control them are thus fundamental in the "understanding" of these deposits. They ultimately control the geological interpretations and predictions made during ore body delineation, ore reserve estimation, mining and ore beneficiation...|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Johannesburg, December, 2013. The Palaeoproterozoic southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt of northeast Burkina Faso represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence {{is based on a}} conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat, chondrite-normalised REE patterns suggest dominantly N-MORB compositions, with the occasional elevated Th and Al 2 O 3 values, suggestive of arc basalts. Depleted chondrite-normalised concentrations of phosphorus (0. 5 - 0. 03 times lower than chondrite) and Ti (1 - 5 times chondrite) as well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80 - 120 times greater) are characteristic of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The volcanic rocks are intercalated with a succession of <b>volcanogenic</b> manganese <b>deposits,</b> siltstone, volcaniclastite, <b>volcanogenic</b> greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed of lapilli- to bomb-sized volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. The volcanic facies were established through field and petrographic interpretations. The subaqueous facies architecture consists of proximal, coherent and autoclastic basaltic flow units containing porphyritic, aphyric, amygdaloidal and hyaloclastic textures as well as pillowed, jointed and flow-banded basaltic lithofacies. Proximal to distal <b>volcanogenic</b> manganese <b>deposits</b> intercalated with basalt flows indicate a syn-volcanic genesis. A discrete pyroclastic interbed (300 m thick) within a volcanogenic, marginal marine to offshore greywacke succession occupies a distal facies relative to the volcanic source and indicates a bimodal source of volcanism, i. e., mafic and intermediate. <b>Volcanogenic</b> manganese <b>deposits</b> are characterized by quartz-ankerite stockwork breccia, a braunite-ilmenite-magnetite-chalcopyrite-pyrite-(gold) mineral assemblage and increased Ba concentrations, indicating syn-volcanic seafloor-related hydrothermal activity.

In this work, I focus on four notable examples of such an association: (1) West Keivy, Kola Peninsula, Russia, (2) Saint-Ludger-de-Milot, Quebec, (3) Lac Sairs, Quebec, and (4) Morefield, Virginia. A fifth locality, the Broken Hill metamorphosed exhalative-type <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits</b> in Australia, is an unusual type of amazonitic K-feldspar formed in an ore environment. A total of nineteen samples of amazonitic K-feldspar were characterized geochemically and mineralogically {{on the basis of}} X-ray diffraction, electron-microprobe and laser-ablation ICP-MS analyses. Lead, as an essential requirement for formation of the blue-green amazonitic color, has received particular attention. In every case, the analytical data show elevated amounts of Pb and rare alkalis, which strongly partition into the K-rich phase of the perthite intergrowth. Unusual micrometric grains, highly enriched in Pb, are found in cracks in the material from West Keivy. Some of the grains represent a new mineral species, a Pb-dominant feldspar. The presence of amazonitic K-feldspar in a granitic pegmatite is more than a curiosity.

40|$|The {{main steps}} of the {{sedimentary}} evolution of the west Lombardian South Alpine foredeep between the Eocene and the Early Miocene are described. The oldest is a Bartonian carbonate decrease in hemipelagic sediments linked {{with an increase in}} terrigenous input, possibly related to a rainfall increase in the Alps. Between the Middle Eocene and the early Chattian, a volcanoclastic input is associated with an extensional tectonic regime, coeval with magma emplacement in the southern-central Alps, and with <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits</b> of the European foredeep and Apennines, suggesting a regional extensional tectonic phase leading to the ascent of magma. During Late Eocene to Early Oligocene, two periods of coarse clastic sedimentation occured, probably controlled by eustasy.

In the Chattian, a strong increase in coarse supply records the massive erosion of Central Alps, coupled with a structures growth phase in the subsurface; it was followed by an Aquitanian rearrangement of the Alpine drainage systems suggested by both petrography of clastic sediments and retreat of depositional systems, while subsurface sheet-like geometry of Aquitanian turbidites marks a strong decrease in tectonic activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Mistaken Point and Trepassey {{formations}} (Conception and St. John’s groups, respectively) {{comprise a}} terminal Neoproterozoic, deep-marine succession of fine-grained turbidites and <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits</b> {{that are part}} of the Avalonian Terrane. Debris-flow beds, slumped units, the low dispersion of turbidity-current paleoflow directions, and the absence of wave-generated structures together indicate that the sediment was deposited on a deep-water, southeast-facing slope. Channels were not present in the study area. The upward increase in the abundance of slump structures suggests that these units represent toe-of-slope and mid-slope environments, respectively. These units prograded over basin-floor deposits of the Drook and Briscal formations, which have (axial) paleocurrent directions that are orthogonal to the inferred downslope flow that characterized the overlying deposits. Within the Mistaken Point and Trepassey formations, a diverse assemblage of soft-bodied, non-phototrophic Ediacaran organisms is preserved beneath volcanic ash layers on more than one hundred surfaces. Individual fossiliferous surfaces can be correlated up to several kilometres. The felling orientations of frondose fossils indicate that contour currents, as well as up- and downslope currents of tidal and (or) wind-forced origin, influenced the sea floor in the intervals between event beds when the organisms lived. The contour currents may have been responsible for sustaining the organisms in this deep-water setting. The current-produced inclination of the frondose organisms at the time of ash deposition allowed their preservation by preventing the accumulation of ash beneath them...|$|R

In particular our study of the PQ - P north lens system at Que River {{has led to an}} exciting re-evaluation of the geological structure of the mine and allowed a simple reconstruction of the prefolding geology and metal distribution. Based on this new interpretation of Que River, and the previous findings at Rosebery, outlined in the accompanying report by Huston and Large (1986), many similarities in metal distribution and geometry are now obvious between the two deposits. The regional studies to characterise the geochemistry and geological setting of the Mt Read Volcanics have concentrated on the silicate and trace element chemistry of a range of lava and intrusive types. Tony Crawford has compiled a considerable data base, which leads us towards a far greater understanding of the primary chemical variations of volcanics in the arc, and has enabled some simple and interesting comparisons with more recent volcanic environments around the world.

40|$|Comparison of the 100 Zn/(Zn + Pb) ratio ("zinc number") {{of various}} styles of {{mineralization}} in the Mt.

The {{consistency of the}} zinc number, along with the Pb vs. Zn plots, suggests that zinc and lead were saturated in the metal deficient (mΣmetal< mH 2 S) hydrothermal fluids that deposited Rosebery and Hellyer. Trends in the zinc number between massive sulfides in the Mt. Read Volcanics indicate that concentrations of zinc and lead in the footwall volcanic source rocks did not control the zinc number of the deposits. The saturation of zinc and lead in mineralizing fluids may control the zinc number of most Phanerozoic <b>volcanogenic</b> massive sulfide <b>deposits,</b> but low concentrations of lead in the footwall volcanics of Cu-Zn type massive sulfide deposits probably control the zinc number for this class. The low means and high standard deviations of Cambrian vein deposits in the Mt.

40|$|From Introduction: For {{at least}} two centuries and a {{corresponding}} number of generations of geologists and miners there has been active argument concerning the origin of certain types of carbonate hosted mineral deposit. The characterization of the type itself {{was and still is}} debatable. Objections have been raised to grouping several examples under one heading because each has its individually distinctive features. ·This is especially applicable to the carbonate hosted lead-zinc "sedimentary" deposits. The type that will be discussed in the text to follow is composed chiefly of galena, sphalerite, barite and fluorite, with pyrite, marcasite and chalcopyrite as conspicuous accessory ore minerals. Exceptions to this general copper deficient characteristic displayed by the sedimentary carbonate-hosted lead-zinc deposits are the deposits at Tsumeb and Kombat, Namibia. These deposits are hosted by the carbonate sequence of the Otavi Shelf sediments, and copper, in the form of tennantite, chalcopyrite and bornite, is the major ore constituent. Calcite, aragonite, dolomite and quartz are the commonest nonmetallic gangue minerals but siderite and silica may also be present. In contrast with other lead and zinc sulphide (<b>volcanogenic)</b> <b>deposits,</b> those to be considered here seldom carry noteworthy amounts of silver or any other precious metals. Commonly the country rock is a carbonate; limestone or dolomite, but deposits in. sandstone, shale and conglomerate are not unknown. Characteristic features are ore bodies that extend parallel or nearly so with the bedding although many such deposits are partly, or completely developed along crosscutting fissures and breccias.

Gold is probably transported as chloride complexes at temperatures greater than about 300 °C. At lower temperatures it is probably transported with other metals as sulphide and thio-sulphide complexes. The precipitation of gold from the transporting medium is brought about by changes in the physico-chemical conditions within that medium. Decrease in pressure is probably not a major cause of precipitation in volcanogenic environments. The geology of volcanogenic iron-formations is described and discussed, relative to the development of greenstone belts. Oxide facies iron-formations were formed in shallow oxidizing environments. They are associated with volcanogenic and clastic sediments. Sulphide facies iron-formations were precipitated in the deeper parts of geosynclinal structures. They are associated with mafic and ultramafic rocks similar to modern oceanic volcanic assemblages. Carbonate facies iron-formations were deposited in the regions between oxide facies and sulphide facies. Other banded iron-formations are found associated with base metal massive sulphide deposits related to arctype volcanic centres. These deposits are found in the regions where carbonate facies iron-formations were formed. Exploration for and exploitation of gold deposits in Archaean iron-formations are discussed. Geochemical exploration programmes are aided by the association of gold with trace amounts of base metals. Geophysical exploration methods that can be employed include magnetometer, I. P. and E. M. surveys. The metallurgical treatment of the ores should include "roasting" because {{a large proportion of the}} gold occurs as submicroscopic grains within sulphide mineral crystals. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Carboniferous Bowland Shale in England, and its correlatives in Ireland, contain anomalously high {{concentrations}} of trace elements, including selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo) and arsenic (As). High levels of these elements reflect high sulphur contents as these elements occur as trace constituents of pyrite. Anomalous Se in particular may have a volcanic provenance, from contemporary volcanic activity and/or drainage from Ordovician <b>volcanogenic</b> sulphide <b>deposits.</b> Following concern over the release of Se and As into groundwater during shale gas extraction in the US, the potential fate of Se and As during any future shale gas extraction from the Bowland Shale merits attention. It is at least an environmental issue that must be managed, but at best {{it could be an}} opportunity for extraction of Se in an environmentally sensitive manner...|$|R
5000|$|Gold was {{discovered}} {{in the area in}} 1923. The name of the town is French for [...] "Valley of Gold." [...] While gold is still mined in the area today, base metals, such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) have become increasingly important resources. The ore is usually found in volcanic rocks that were deposited on the sea floor over 2.7 billion years ago. They are referred to as volcanic-hosted (or <b>volcanogenic)</b> massive sulphide <b>deposits</b> (VMS).|$|R

Group I, which is host to greater {{than half of}} the <b>volcanogenic</b> mas-sive sulfide <b>deposits</b> by tonnage and which comprises only • 10 percent by area of volcanic terranes, is composed of bimodal, tholeiitic basalt-basaltic andesitc, and high silica rhyolite. The basaltic andesites and high silica rhyolites are characterized by high high field strength element and heavy rare earth element (REE) contents, low light to heavy REE ratios (most with LaN/YbN [...] 0. 8 - 3), and strong negative Eu anomalies. The Kamiskotia, Matagami, and Chibougamau (Lower cycle) volcanogenic massive sulfide areas, all of which are also under-lain by large, synvolcanic gabbroic omplexes, are associated with group I volcanic se-quences. The Kidd Creek, Potter, Normetal, and Horne deposits are also included in this category.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 I {{interpret}} sedimentary facies and depositional environments {{from the}} Albian-Cenomanian Nanushuk Formation of Alaska's North Slope from sedimentary structures observed in core samples and in outcrop in the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPRA) and surrounding areas, and support these interpretations with supplemental analyses of {{geophysical well logs}} and ������Ar/�_��_Ar dating of <b>volcanogenic</b> <b>deposits.</b> The results have implications for the reservoir characterization of a shallow, frozen oil field at Umiat, Alaska, and for interpretations of the Colville foreland basin. In the central Brooks Range foothills the Nanushuk Formation comprises shallow marine and non-marine fades associations that can be grouped into marine-distributive and river-distributive systems. In wells at Umiat, Alaska, shoreface and wave-influenced deltaic sandstones (marine-distributive systems) occur {{at the base of}} the Nanushuk Formation, followed by a marine transgression and subsequent progradation of a delta complex (river-distributive system). The shift from marine-distributive to river-distributive systems is related to shelf building processes during the Albian-Cenomanian. Marine-distributive systems occurred at or near the shelf edge in a high-energy coastal environment, whereas river-distributive systems rapidly prograded over the shallow Nanushuk shelf following transgression. Marine-distributive conditions resumed when rapidly progradational river-distributive systems reached the shelf edge. This pattern occurs in the Umiat, Wolf Creek, and Grandstand No. 1 subsurface wells. The reservoir quality of the Nanushuk Formation varies strongly with facies. Well-sorted sandstones at the top of upward-coarsening successions in both marine- and river-distributive units have the highest permeabilities within the Nanushuk Formation. Marine-distributive units have low permeability anisotropy in contrast to river-distributive units due to better sorting in wave-influenced environments and the higher frequency of impermeable lamination surfaces in deltaic sandstones. Despite coarser grain size and similar depositional environments as lower Nanushuk Formation sandstones, transgressive units at the top of the Nanushuk Formation have low permeability, probably due to the presence of calcite cement. These results suggest hat the highest quality Nanushuk Formation reservoirs most likely occur in time transgressive, regionally extensive marine-distributive sandstones of the lower Nanushuk Formation...|$|R
