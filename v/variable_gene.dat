The microarray analysis resulted in an estimate of the core genome for S. uberis, consisting of 1530 ORFs, among 1855 tested, representing 82. 5 % of the S. uberis 0140 J genome.

The genomic sequence data available currently was obtained using only isolates from human or chicken hosts. In order to identify <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> present in isolates from alternative host species, five subtractions between C. jejuni isolates from different sources (rabbit, cattle, wild bird) were carried out, designed to assess genomic variability within and between common multilocus sequence type (MLST) clonal complexes (ST- 21, ST- 42, ST- 45 and ST- 61). Results The vast majority (97 %) of the 195 subtracted sequences identified had a best BLASTX match with a Campylobacter protein. However, there was considerable variation within and between the four clonal complexes included in the subtractions. The distributions of eight variable sequences, including four with putative roles in the use of alternative terminal electron acceptors, amongst a panel of C. jejuni isolates representing diverse sources and STs, were determined. Conclusion There was a clear correlation between clonal complex and the distribution of the metabolic genes. In contrast, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that the distribution of such genes may be related to host preference. The other <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> studied were also generally distributed according to MLST type.

We propose that they are likely to perform important binding functions responsible for protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, or protein–small molecule interactions.

Given that the ends of the stable gene deserts have particularly high levels of GC contents, these sequences must be extremely conserved. This conservation may in turn cause the flanking genes to also have higher conservation rates. Thus, stable genes should be directly linked to at least one of their flanking genes and cannot be separated from coding sequences by recombination events. Most gene deserts appear to cluster in pairs around a small number of genes. This clustering creates long loci that have very low gene density; small regions with high numbers of genes are surrounded by long stretches of gene deserts, creating a low gene average. Therefore, the minimized probability of recombination events in these long loci creates syntenic blocks that are inherited together over time.

We studied 42 isolates and found 1, 319 genes present in all isolates, while 341 (20. 5 %) were <b>variable</b> <b>genes.</b> Among the <b>variable</b> <b>genes,</b> 127 (37 %) were distributed within plasticity zones (PZs). The overall number of <b>variable</b> <b>genes</b> present in a given isolate was significantly lower for gastric cancer isolates. Thirty genes {{were significantly associated with}} nonatrophic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, or gastric cancer, 14 (46. 6 %) of which were within PZs and the cag PAI. Two genes (HP 0674 and JHP 0940) were absent in all gastric cancer isolates. Many of the disease-associated genes outside the PZs formed clusters, and some of these genes are regulated in response to acid or other environmental conditions. Validation of candidate genes identified by aCGH in a second patient cohort allowed the identification of novel H. pylori genes associated with gastric cancer or duodenal ulcer. These disease-associated genes may serve as biomarkers of the risk for severe gastroduodenal diseases...|$|R
