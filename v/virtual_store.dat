50|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>store</b> {{research}} {{is an extension}} of the traditional methods of marketing research. While marketing research employs techniques like focus groups, surveys and observation to better understand consumer decision-making, <b>virtual</b> <b>store</b> research uses these standard research techniques within a simulated store setting, delivered via computer. <b>Virtual</b> <b>store</b> research utilizes 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional computer simulation technology to create retail contexts that are as close to the real shopping experience as possible. This allows test consumers within the virtual environment to interact with store merchandise and make purchase decisions in a way that closely resembles real in-store behavior.|$|E
40|$|The {{acceptance}} of e-commerce among consumers has stimulated {{the rise of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>stores.</b> Increasing traditional retailers or {{people who do not}} have sufficient capital for maintaining a brick-and-mortar store have considered using <b>virtual</b> <b>stores</b> to reach global market. In the e-commerce literature, there has been rich research evidence concerning consumers’ {{acceptance of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>stores.</b> However, rigorous academic research on retailers’ acceptance of <b>virtual</b> <b>stores</b> is relatively scarce today. This study draws upon the theory of planned behavior and information richness theory to propose an integrated theoretical model. A field survey is used to collect data from e-tailers. The data are analyzed to examine the six relationships posited in the research model. Findings of this study provide a further research avenue for e-commerce, and implications for those who are managing or considering using <b>virtual</b> <b>stores...</b>|$|R

30|$|Another {{challenge}} arose when developing {{products to}} be placed inside the <b>virtual</b> <b>stores</b> because SketchUp was not specifically designed for developing fashion retail stores.

Therefore, the product and item development was time-consuming and labor intensive.|$|R
50|$|Founded by Simon Barton as <b>Virtual</b> <b>Stores</b> (NZ), Ltd. in 1999, {{the company}} began by selling {{computer}} and video games under the GameZone brand.

In 2008 the company relaunched as Mighty Ape and began selling books and toys.|$|R
30|$|First of all, {{the results}} showed that the {{immersive}} experience of VR was positively related with important shopping outcomes such as pleasure, attitude toward <b>virtual</b> <b>stores,</b> and purchase intention. This signifies that VR {{can be used as a}} new shopping method to enhance consumers’ experience and engagement. For example, <b>virtual</b> reality <b>stores</b> can enable consumers to be better informed about the upcoming or current products and services beyond two-dimensional photos or videos. These realistic visual presentations of products and services will generate more positive emotions and attitudes toward the store, and eventually prompt more purchases. Therefore, fashion marketers should take advantages of virtual reality to provide consumers with memorable, distinctive experiences and realistic experiences of products or stores without physical locations.|$|R

50|$|However, Burke was {{a decade}} early with his article. In a 2008 survey of researchers, only 3.7% of {{respondents}} reported using virtual testing techniques. The {{reason for the}} slow initial adoption of <b>virtual</b> <b>store</b> research is that these tests were still performed in remote labs, requiring consumers to come to specific locations. Early adopter Kimberly-Clark was featured {{on the front page}} of The Wall Street Journal in 2007 for its use of <b>virtual</b> <b>store</b> technology in marketing research, but mainstream market penetration remained low.|$|E

Consumer product companies could then test multiple variables within the full <b>virtual</b> <b>store</b> environment. The company established a network of more than 60 on-site test centers to field research studies utilising eye tracking technology alongside virtual aisles where respondents interacted with touch screens to examine products. Red Dot Square Solutions was acquired by WPP in 2009.|$|E

30|$|VR {{has already}} proven its {{effectiveness}} and usefulness {{as a research}} tool in several fields. For example, VR {{has been used to}} treat patients with phobias and anxiety disorders (e.g., Rothbaum et al. 1995), to control pain (Hoffman et al. 2001), and to teach skills (Padgett et al. 2005). The realistic rendering of simulated environments in VR and the efficiency of creating such environments are very attractive to researchers in an applied field. Although retail researchers have not used VR much yet, VR can be an extremely attractive tool for researchers who are interested in investigating in-store experiences of consumers because VR can create and modify <b>virtual</b> <b>stores</b> very easily.|$|R
