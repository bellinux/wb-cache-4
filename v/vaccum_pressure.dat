40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>vaccum</b> <b>pressure</b> on quality {{and number of}} recovered oocytes aspirated from ovarian follicles of swine and cows The aim {{of the present study}} was stating the {{influence of}} the value of <b>vaccum</b> <b>pressure</b> on the percentage of oocytes aspirated from follicles, as well as their quality in heifers, cows, HF, sows and gilts crossbred Landrace. Follicles of> 2 mm diameter were aspirated. The follicle liquid was obtained with application of the pressure equal to respectively – 150,- 100,- 70,- 50,- 30 mm Hg respectively. Mean number of recovered oocytes in heifers and cows was respectively 13. 3 and 8. 4, while sows and gilts 27. 5 and 16. 3. An average number of the obtained oocytes in heifers and cows reached 61. 42 % and 48. 9 % and was not dependent on the size of the flow. The <b>vaccum</b> <b>pressure</b> value did significantly influence the number of aspirated oocytes of very good, sufficient and insufficient quality in heifers, as well as oocytes of sufficient and insufficient quality in cows. Alongside with an increase of <b>vaccum</b> <b>pressure</b> above 50 and 70 mm Hg in correspondingly heifers and cows, the percentage of insufficient quality oocytes increased while the percentage of very good quality oocytes decreased. An average percentage of recovered oocytes of gilts and sows equalled to 79. 1 and 85. 2 % and did not depend o...|$|E
