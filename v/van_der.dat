5|$|Although <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's {{name is not}} {{recorded}} {{in any of the}} early inventories, the style of her dress has been used to place the picture very late in <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (<b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden died in 1464).|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot was {{transferred}} to Challapalca prison in the mountainous South of Peru, where circumstances are harsh due to the location's altitude. Two months later, a Dutch online news service claimed that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot was stabbed and critically injured by fellow prisoners in Peru. Although <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot's wife's claim of a stabbing is contested by Peruvian authorities, photos have been published showing <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot as suffering from multiple stab wounds from two separate attacks.|$|E

In 1990, his family moved from Arnhem to Aruba, where he was an honor student at the International School of Aruba.

5|$|On 3 June 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot with {{extortion}} {{and wire}} fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance issued {{an arrest warrant}} through Interpol to have <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot prosecuted in the United States. On 4 June, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Justice Department, Dutch authorities raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot and claimed knowledge of his criminal activities. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Aruba's Solicitor-General said they would not seek <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot's extradition to Aruba. On 30 June, a federal grand jury formally indicted <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot of the two charges.

5|$|Peruvian {{officials}} named <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot as {{the lone}} {{suspect in the}} homicide investigation.

He said that he called a friend, who told <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot {{to go home and}} who disposed of the body. An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot's account, indicating that he was then in Rotterdam at school.|$|E

5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Goes's is the {{earliest}} extant autographed version, {{and one of}} the most important. This panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost, and was probably made for a guild. Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe, draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint, and wears a melancholy expression. Building on <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden's theme of the role, practice and craft of an artist, <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Goes places pieces of charcoal, a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint. The similarities to the <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden are many and striking, and include the painting utensils, red robes, physician's cap and blue mantle. The figure has the same middle-aged facial type and his pose, kneeling on a green cushion, although reversed compared to <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden's, is the same. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Goes's adaption both increased <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Weyden's standing in the eyes of the later artist's followers, and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because she wanted to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe were driving away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot home. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E
5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot was interested in talking about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

50|$|None of {{the works}} {{attributed}} to Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger are authographed. A {{large part of the}} oeuvre was catalogued in Klaus Ertz and Christa Nitze-Ertz, Die Maler Jan van Kessel : Jan <b>van</b> Kessel <b>der</b> Ältere 1626-1679 : Jan <b>van</b> Kessel <b>der</b> Jüngere 1654-1708 : Jan <b>van</b> Kessel <b>der</b> 'Andere' ca. 1620-ca. 1661: kritische Kataloge der Gemälde, Lingen : De Luca, 2012 as the work of Jan van Kessel the Younger. However, Jan van Kessel the Younger's small known authentic oeuvre is different in style and execution and substantially higher in quality than the works, which have now been attributed to Pseudo Jan van Kessel the Younger. For the sake of convenience, the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) catalogued paintings by Pseudo-Jan van Kessel II previously (until 2017) as 'studio of Jan van Kessel the Elder'.|$|R

5|$|On 10 May, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru.
