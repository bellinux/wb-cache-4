Here were found two water-pits in a well-defined valley; the nearer some ten miles south-west of the Jebel el-Abyaz, the other about two miles further to the north-west; making a total of twelve. About the latter there was, however, no level ground for tents. A mile and a half walking almost due north led to a <b>veinlet</b> of copper 30 metres long by 0.30 thick, with an east-west strike, and a dip of 45 degrees south.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Ultramafic xenoliths {{enclosed}} in Plio-Quaternary alkali basalts from Tallante near Cartagne (southern Spain) are composed mainly of spinel herzo-lites which are probably upper mantle residues. In many xenoliths, the spinel herzolite is cut by pyroxenite or gabbroic anorthosite <b>veinlets</b> generally 0. 2 - 3 cm thick. The clinopyroxenite <b>veinlets</b> were formed by high-pressure crystal-liquid segregation from alkali basalt magmas formed {{earlier than the}} host basalts, whereas mantle metasomatism {{played a role in}} the genesis of gabbroic anorthosites. Close to the contact with the <b>veinlets,</b> the spinel lherzolites are enriched in Ca, Fe, and some incompatible elements including light REE due to the migration of a fluid from the <b>veinlets</b> into the surrounding lherzolites.

Studies of the 3 D geometry, ´ ´ compositions of fluid inclusions, and mineral paragenesis {{have been carried out}} to determine P–V–T–X conditions of ore fluid migration. Ore deposition resulted from the superimposition of three main stages of fluid migration through a series of. dense and regular sets of extensional structures <b>veinlets</b> and microfissures. Pre-ore stage is characterised by the formation of thick quartz veins and brines of probable magmatic origin, and is. followed by moderate ductile deformation.

Most of these pores were oriented parallel to (010) and (001) and had been produced by earlier fracturing and/or congruent dissolution. In the second stage, the subset of <b>veinlets</b> that were oriented parallel to (001) was widened accompanying the replacement of forsterite by Mg-Fe serpentine. This reaction proceeded most rapidly parallel to [001], and crystallographic controls on the trajectory of retreating vein walls created fine-scale serrations.
