50|$|The courts became quickly unpopular. This was {{not only}} because of the express {{prohibition}} of jury trials or the fact that vice-admiralty judges tended to believe that common law courts did not have superior status. It was also because a whole range of technical issues confused the legal system. It was often not clear whether <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> had jurisdiction over creeks or bays, or whether the governor could create <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> through vice-regal powers, or whether or not there was a clear method of separating the jurisdictions and procedures of vice-admiralty and common law jurisdiction.

50|$|The <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> <b>Courts</b> {{were met}} with {{extensive}} protest from the colonies, and it became {{an important factor in}} motivating colonists to sever the political ties with their mother country. Many felt as though their right to be tried by their peers, a right which was seen as being part of the privilege of being an English subject, was being denied to them. From 1764 to 1768, it was often complained that it was unjust for a merchant, whose ship may be seized in Georgia, to travel 1,500 miles from Georgia to the court in Halifax to defend his property. Further criticisms was that the owner of the ship or maritime goods seized had to post a large bond before allowing to defend himself. Additionally, even if his trial ended in acquittal, he would still be required to pay costs.|$|R

50|$|In the 1700s, the British {{passed a}} variety of laws aimed at combating illegal {{smuggling}} in the American colonies. Americans had developed trade relationships with places such as southern Europe, the Netherlands and the West Indies, {{despite the fact that}} the Navigation Acts intended to give Great Britain a trade monopoly with its American colonies. The Molasses Act of 1733 had tried to tax molasses and non-British sugar, though it was largely unsuccessful. Shipowners who imported manufactured goods from the Netherlands smuggled these products in absolute secrecy, with Crown officials estimating that the annual value of manufactured goods smuggled equaled £500,000. British admiralty prepared commissions to authorize governors to erect <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> throughout the American colonies. In 1701, William Atwood was dispatched to preside as judge of the Admiralty for New Hampshire and the Jerseys. Due to firm colonial opposition, however, the task was practically impossible so he retired only a few years later. Other vice-admiralty judges in Pennsylvania and southern colonies faced similar difficulties as locally elected authorities strongly opposed the work they were sent to do.|$|R

50|$|The statute then {{proceeds}} {{to explain what}} is required for these admiralty court sessions to function, how they will run, and what powers that statute grants to the commissioners.

In addition, these courts shall consist of at least seven people who “are known merchants, factors, or planters, or such as are captains, lieutenants, or warrant officers” and who are “fitting and voting in the said court”. The statute also grants the commissioners of these <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> with “full power and authority” to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and “to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony”. The statute then moves to instruct the commissioners on {{the proceedings of the}} courts in a significant amount of detail ranging from the oath {{that the president of the}} court must take, what actions were to be taken upon pleas of guilty or not guilty, and how to examine witnesses and give sentence.|$|R
2500|$|Bradley Nutting {{makes the}} {{argument}} {{that it was the}} early Golden Age pirates raping and pillaging of several Muslim pilgrims in 1695 that was initially responsible for the flood of legislation in the early eighteenth century. [...] Following Henry Avery's capture of the mogul ship quote, the East India Company petitioned the Privy Council in 1696 to issue a proclamation of arrest. A reward of fifty pounds was offered for Avery's crew, while five-hundred pounds was offered for Avery himself. Those incidences lead to the Piracy Act of 1700. The legislation took two years to pass after repeated pressures from the East India Company and the Board of Trade. There was now authorization to set up <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> throughout the colonies with legal authority to carry out sentencing. The first notable pirate to be brought to trial with this new set of laws was Captain Kidd. Kidd was denied an adequate defense, as well as the ability to review documents he claimed would exonerate him. Ironically, he was acquitted of piracy, but convicted of murder. Regardless, he was executed and his body was hung in chains over the River Thames for years.|$|R

2500|$|Whilst the British {{admiralty}} court had jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed upon the high seas, {{the jurisdiction of}} the court was rarely invoked. [...] The civil law was well suited to dealing with commercial transactions. [...] However, it could not cope adequately with criminal offenses. [...] The court needed to rely upon the old Roman civil law to establish any breaches. [...] Former Chief Justice Frederick Jordan noted that criminal cases often fell through because sailors weren’t available to give evidence (whether by malice or design). [...] A sentence of death could only not be imposed unless two witnesses could be produced. [...] To deal with this problem, the British Parliament passed the Piracy Act 1698 (UK). [...] This enabled the Crown to appoint seven commissioners to try offenses of piracy under that Act. [...] Whilst that latter court was often called a <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>court,</b> Australian legal historian John Bennett has shown that that court {{should not be confused with}} the present court.

50|$|American {{maritime}} activity {{had been}} primarily self-regulated {{in the early}} to mid-1600s. Smaller maritime issues were settled at court in local jurisdictions, prior to the establishment of courts to specialize in admiralty. In the colony of Massachusetts Bay, for instance, a maritime code to specialize in maritime legislation was created and in 1674 the Court of Assistants was established to determine all cases of admiralty. Typically the courts were presided over by a judge, unless it was deemed more suitable to be presided over by a jury. This was similar in Maryland, where a so-called 'Court of Admiralty' heard cases of maritime issues including sailor's wages, the carriage of goods and piracy. Originally these courts dealt primarily with commercial matters, and the judges which presided over them were appointed by the local population and were paid from the colonial treasuries. Their jurisdiction expanded, however, during the French and Indian War, to the condemnation of enemy ships including disposing of their possessions. It was not until the passage and the later stricter enforcement of the Navigation Acts by the British parliament from the 1650s through to the 1770s that the British government were granted more power over American maritime issues, as <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> began to enforce customs and hear criminal trials for smuggling.|$|R

2500|$|England {{began to}} {{strongly}} turn against piracy {{at the turn}} of the 18th century, as it was increasingly damaging to the country's economic and commercial prospects in the region. The Piracy Act of 1698 for the [...] "more effectual suppression of Piracy" [...] made it easier to capture, try and convict pirates by lawfully enabling acts of piracy to be [...] "examined, inquired of, tried, heard and determined, and adjudged in any place at sea, or upon the land, in any of his Majesty's islands, plantations, colonies, dominions, forts, or factories." [...] This effectively enabled admirals to hold a court session to hear the trials of pirates in any place they deemed necessary, rather than requiring that the trial be held in England. Commissioners of these <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>courts</b> were also vested with [...] "full power and authority" [...] to issue warrants, summon the necessary witnesses, and [...] "to do all thing necessary for the hearing and final determination of any case of piracy, robbery, or felony." [...] These new and faster trials provided no legal representation for the pirates; and ultimately led in this era to the execution of 600 pirates, which represented approximately 10 percent of the pirates active at the time in the Caribbean region. Being an accessory to piracy was also criminalised under the statute.|$|R
