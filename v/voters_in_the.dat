5|$|A {{pattern of}} {{irregularities}} {{has been discovered}} concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to a half-million <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> registry should not be included.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of media criticism was directed at the Pistons fans and 46% of the <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ESPN SportsNation poll believed that the fans were {{to blame for the}} incident. Other commentators said that Artest and the other players involved were to blame.|$|E

5|$|The 1995 Quebec {{referendum}} was {{the second}} referendum to ask <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Canadian French-speaking province of Quebec whether Quebec should proclaim national sovereignty and become an independent country, with the condition precedent of offering a political and economic agreement to Canada.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP {{of the ruling}} party vacates his or her seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

5|$|In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy {{remained}} the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English. English was removed {{as an official}} language from the constitution approved by <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> November 2010 referendum. The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition, who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness {{in the way the}} election was organized by the High Transitional Authority.|$|E
5|$|The Emancipation Proclamation, {{issued on}} September 22, 1862, {{and put into}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing {{the army and the}} nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans campaigned {{heavily on}} the tariff issue, turning out {{protectionist}} <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> important industrial states of the North. Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B. Hill, weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state. A letter from the British ambassador supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.|$|E

50|$|California's voters granted women's {{suffrage}} in 1911, {{when they}} adopted Proposition 4.

50|$|If {{a person}} moves his/ her {{residence}} to another assembly constituency {{then he does}} not remain a valid voter of previous constituency. The person has to register afresh as <b>voter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new assembly constituency. Hence the new card is issued and old card becomes invalid.|$|R
5|$|The {{candidates}} {{were divided into}} two groups - one officially supported by the party and the 'independents' (broadly following the communist party line but not declared members of the party). The latter would be only considered if over half of the registered <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district voted against the official candidates; otherwise all seats from the district (on average between 3 and 6) would be awarded to the official candidates.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} ultimately {{compromised by}} loosening suffrage requirements. It also {{reduced the number}} of delegates and senators to the Virginia General Assembly. The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western part of the state ended up voting against it. Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed later.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} and dissolution of municipalities {{is governed by}} Chapter 165 of the Florida Statutes.

5|$|United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, most black <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South were effectively disenfranchised by new state constitutions and state laws incorporating such obstacles as poll taxes and discriminatory literacy tests, from which white male voters were exempted by grandfather clauses. A system of whites-only primaries and violent intimidation by white groups also suppressed black participation.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Beach gained {{status as}} an {{independent}} city in 1952, although ties remained between it and Princess Anne County. In 1963, after <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two jurisdictions passed a supporting referendum, and {{with the approval of}} the Virginia General Assembly, the two political subdivisions were consolidated as a new, much larger independent city, retaining the better-known name of the Virginia Beach resort.|$|E
5|$|Despite Auburn's {{victory and}} undefeated season, {{they were not}} named {{national}} champions. That honor went to the University of Southern California, which defeated Oklahoma in the 2005 national championship game, 55–19. Three <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final Associated Press poll of the season voted Auburn the number one team in the country, but their votes were not enough to deny USC a national championship, as voted {{by members of the}} Associated Press and Coaches' polls. Several players from each team were selected in the 2005 NFL Draft and went on to careers in the National Football League.|$|E

5|$|Having {{previously}} gained {{political control}} of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's followers, who were based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|In balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame {{following}} his retirement, Ruffing often received votes from approximately 50% of the <b>voters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Baseball Writers' Association of America, {{short of the}} 75% required for induction. Bob Feller wrote an article in The Saturday Evening Post in 1962, calling Ruffing, Satchel Paige, and Luke Appling the three most deserving players who {{had yet to be}} elected. The balloting of 1967 was Ruffing's final year of eligibility, as he had retired twenty years prior. Ruffing finished with 212 votes, tied with Joe Medwick for the highest vote count, but was seven votes short of the 219 required for induction. However, a runoff election held the next month saw Ruffing into the Hall of Fame the next month.|$|E
5|$|The Liberal {{government}} introduced five-member block voting constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1921, {{and briefly}} made Medicine Hat a double-member district. Because each <b>voter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities was given five votes, the Liberal party was defeated despite winning a higher {{total number of}} votes than the United Farmers, who had much higher support <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural single-member districts.|$|R
