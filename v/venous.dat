5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted <b>venous</b> drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes <b>venous</b> narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in <b>venous</b> hypertension (raised <b>venous</b> pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} <b>venous</b> system, empty into the dural <b>venous</b> sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus thrombosis, blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the <b>venous</b> sinuses. The thrombosis of the veins themselves causes <b>venous</b> infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. Thrombosis of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Venous</b> sinus stenoses {{leading to}} <b>venous</b> {{hypertension}} appear {{to play a}} significant part in relation to raised ICP, and stenting of a transverse sinus may resolve <b>venous</b> hypertension, leading to improved CSF resorption, decreased ICP, cure of papilloedema and other symptoms of IIH.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central <b>venous</b> pressure (which requires the insertion of a central <b>venous</b> catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of <b>venous</b> sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles are {{normally}} {{produced in the}} vascular bed and transported by the <b>venous</b> system to heart, then to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural <b>venous</b> sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the <b>venous</b> sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, German {{physician}} and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published what {{is referred to}} as Virchow's triad, the three major causes of thrombosis. The triad provides the theoretical framework for the current explanation of <b>venous</b> thrombosis, although it was focused on the effect of a foreign body in the <b>venous</b> system and the conditions required for clot propagation.|$|E
5|$|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a {{very large}} and {{dangerous}} type of DVT. It is characterized by an acute and almost total <b>venous</b> occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the iliac and femoral veins. The leg is usually painful, tinged blue in color, and swollen, which may result in <b>venous</b> gangrene.|$|E
5|$|The {{inability}} to compress the vein {{is one of}} the more reliable indications of <b>venous</b> thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause <b>venous</b> thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of <b>venous</b> thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of <b>venous</b> thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in <b>venous</b> clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of <b>venous</b> clots.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic <b>venous</b> insufficiency, which results in chronic <b>venous</b> disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic <b>venous</b> insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies <b>venous</b> insufficiency, the vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination is to see how the veins drain. In this way, <b>venous</b> ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge of this subject.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, <b>venous</b> stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing <b>venous</b> stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay {{the healing of}} skin wounds. Aspirin may however help heal <b>venous</b> leg ulcers that have not healed {{following}} usual treatment.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural <b>venous</b> sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the <b>venous</b> sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and <b>venous</b> sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are associated}} with a slightly increased risk of <b>venous</b> and arterial blood clots. <b>Venous</b> clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the increased risk they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep <b>venous</b> thrombosis (DVT), is {{the formation}} of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as <b>venous</b> thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|From 1976, {{decompression}} sickness testing sensitivity was improved by ultrasonic methods that can detect mobile <b>venous</b> bubbles before symptoms of DCS become apparent.|$|E
5|$|Hemodynamic study {{began in}} France in 1985, when Claude Franceschi, first {{described}} the conservative treatment for <b>venous</b> insufficiency, known as CHIVA.|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus thrombosis in life were made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E
5|$|In {{children}} with CVST {{the risk of}} death is high. Poor outcome is more likely if a child with CVST develops seizures or has evidence of <b>venous</b> infarction on imaging.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot <b>venous</b> network around 10% drains to the dorsal <b>venous</b> arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the <b>venous</b> system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of <b>venous</b> ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on <b>venous</b> mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|Specialized {{training}} in <b>venous</b> ultrasonography is not undertaken in some countries, which undermines best practice, mainly when varicose veins {{need to be}} examined.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified <b>venous</b> (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by <b>venous</b> blood passing from the left ventricle to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery {{to the left side}} of the heart and created arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|The Huggins tables {{have not}} been officially tested, but are more {{conservative}} than the 1956 US Navy tables. They have been calculated from limits which would theoretically produce <b>venous</b> bubbles 10 to 20% of the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or <b>venous</b> thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. <b>Venous</b> thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E
5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral <b>venous</b> blood flow, leading to ischemia of {{structures such as}} the hippocampus {{that are involved in}} memory.|$|E
5|$|Valsalva {{maneuver}} – {{when the}} patient performs this maneuver, he or she, increases intra-abdominal <b>venous</b> pressure. If the great saphenous valve at the sapheno-femoral junction is incompetent, a reflux will appear.|$|E
5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such as the use of central <b>venous</b> catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.|$|E
5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a central <b>venous</b> catheter {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Some {{other studies}} have {{proposed}} that issues with the spinal <b>venous</b> drainage system may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low pressure in the epidural space due to outflow to the heart through the inferior vena cava vein.|$|E
5|$|The free oxygen partial {{pressure}} {{in the body of}} a living vertebrate organism is highest in the respiratory system, and decreases along any arterial system, peripheral tissues, and <b>venous</b> system, respectively. Partial pressure is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the <b>venous</b> supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.|$|E
