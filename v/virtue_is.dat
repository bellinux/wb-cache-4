5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> {{at the core}} of citizenship. However, her notion of <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are neither}} victims of {{deceitful}} men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who {{can choose to}} 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful {{in the hands of}} a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
50|$|The seven Christian <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> {{from two}} sets of virtues. The four {{cardinal}} <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> Prudence, Justice, Restraint (or Temperance), and Courage (or Fortitude). The cardinal <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. The three theological <b>virtues,</b> <b>are</b> Faith, Hope, and Love (or Charity).|$|R
5000|$|Now {{the object}} of the {{theological}} <b>virtues</b> <b>is</b> God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of our reason. On the other hand, {{the object of}} the intellectual and moral <b>virtues</b> <b>is</b> something comprehensible to human reason. Wherefore the theological <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> specifically distinct from the moral and intellectual virtues.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of the Buddha, {{according}} to Martin Wiltshire, the pre-Buddhist traditions of Brahma-loka, meditation and these four <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> evidenced in both early Buddhist and non-Buddhist literature. The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these <b>virtues</b> <b>were</b> earlier incarnations of the Buddha. Post-Buddha, these same <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the Yoga Sutras of Patañjali.|$|R
25|$|Meno now beseeches Socrates {{to return}} to the {{original}} question, how <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> acquired, and in particular, {{whether or not it is}} acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> teachable. They turn to the question of whether <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but there are none.|$|E
25|$|Dogen's {{perspective}} of <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> {{discussed in the}} Shōbōgenzō text as something to be practiced inwardly {{so that it will}} manifest itself on the outside. In other words, <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> {{the desire for}} good things {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> one thing or many.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{different}} Chinese communities have already undergone industrialization and urbanization, Confucian <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> still regarded as developmental ideals in Chinese culture. Unfortunately, while Confucian <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> commonly discussed under Chinese philosophies, they are rarely examined {{in the context of}} developmental research. In this paper, several key Confucian <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> discussed, including loyalty ("zhong"), filial piety ("xiao"), benevolence ("ren"), affection ("ai"), trustworthiness ("xin"), righteousness ("yi"), harmony ("he"), peace ("ping"), propriety ("li"), wisdom ("zhi"), integrity ("lian") and shame ("chi"). These Chinese traditional <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> also linked to the concepts of character strengths and positive youth development constructs highlighted in Western culture. It is argued that Confucian virtues provide an indigenous conceptual framework to understand character strengths and positive youth development in Chinese culture. Furthermore, when service leadership is considered in Chinese contexts, these <b>virtues</b> should <b>be</b> regarded as important cornerstones. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
50|$|Civic <b>virtues</b> <b>were</b> {{especially}} important during the 19th and 20th century.

25|$|Of {{the first}} three, <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> the highest goal, a secure life {{the second and}} {{pleasure}} the least important. When motives conflict, the higher ideal is to be followed. Thus, in making money virtue must not be compromised, but earning a living should take precedence over pleasure, but there are exceptions.|$|E
25|$|As with DeathSpank, the {{gameplay}} {{world of}} DeathSpank: Thongs of <b>Virtue</b> <b>is</b> cylinder-shaped and is rendered without load screens as the player explores its unique goings-on. Gameplay {{is similar to}} Diablo, featuring hundreds of pieces of armor and weapons. Advanced dialog options, similar to LucasArts' Monkey Island series, also play a large part in unfolding the game's story.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> one or many things, himself claiming that all <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E
5000|$|The moral <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> attitudes, dispositions, {{and good}} habits that govern one's actions, passions, and conduct {{according}} to reason; and are acquired by human effort. Immanuel Kant said, [...] "Virtue {{is the moral}} strength of the will in obeying the dictates of duty". The cardinal <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.|$|R
5000|$|Theological <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> <b>virtues</b> {{associated}} in Christian {{theology and}} philosophy with salvation {{resulting from the}} grace of God. [...] <b>Virtues</b> <b>are</b> traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally they have been named faith, hope, and charity, and can trace their importance in Christian theology to Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 13, who also pointed out charity is the most important.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extended}} prolepsis {{in favor of}} epistemic situationism, the thesis that epistemic <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> not sufficiently widely distributed for a virtue-theoretic constraint on knowledge to apply without leading to skepticism. It deals with four objections to epistemic situation: 1) that virtuous dispositions are not required for knowledge, 2) that the Big Five or Big Six personality model proves that intellectual <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> a reasonable ideal, 3) that the cognitive-affective personality system framework proves that intellectual <b>virtues</b> <b>are</b> a reasonable ideal, and 4) that weakening the reliability requirement through epistemic dependence or abilism means that common inferential strategies really <b>are</b> <b>virtues.</b> The paper concludes with reflections on the replication crisis in psychological science...|$|R
25|$|First of all, if {{you take}} the virtue of a man, it is easily stated that a man's <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> this—that he be {{competent}} to manage the affairs of his city, and to manage them so as to benefit his friends and harm his enemies, and to take care to avoid suffering harm himself. Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband.|$|E

25|$|In Ultima, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the Avatar, who embodies eight virtues. First {{introduced}} in , the Three Principles and the Eight Virtues marked a reinvention of the game focus from a traditional role-playing model into an ethically framed one. Each <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> associated with a party member, one of Britannia's cities, and one of the eight other planets in Britannia's solar system. Each virtue also has a mantra and each principle a word of power that the player must learn. The Eight Virtues explored in Ultima are Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility. These Eight Virtues are based on the Three Principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Principles are derived from the One True Axiom, the combination of all Truth, all Love, and all Courage, which is Infinity.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if <b>virtue</b> <b>is</b> teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

500|$|The {{first major}} philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was Francis Hutcheson, {{who held the}} Chair of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow from 1729 to 1746.

Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his proteges David Hume and Adam Smith.|$|E
