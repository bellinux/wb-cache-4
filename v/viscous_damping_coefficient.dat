Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 57 - 59). Modern turbomachinery design directs towards the ographics. generation or utilization of increasing amounts of power with the minimum engine weight. High performance turbomachinery requires of appropriate means to ensure structural isolation of components and rotor vibration limits with tolerance to sudden imbalance loads due to blade loss events, shock, and maneuver actions. Squeeze film dampers (SFDS) are an effective mean to reduce vibrations and to suppress instabilities in high performance aeroengine systems. The recently developed integral squeeze film dampers (ISFDS) offer several advantages over conventional SFDS such as reduced overall weight and length of the damper structure with less number of parts, accuracy of positioning (centering), and a split segment construction allowing easier assembly, inspection, and retrofit than with any other type of damper. The objective of the experimental program is the identification of the <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> of sealed ISFDS from measurements of the imbalance response of a massive rotor supported on two (identical) integral dampers. Experiments are conducted on dampers with end plate seals of known clearance. The amplitudes of synchronous rotor response at the first critical speed, for increasing levels of imbalance, allow the determination of system amplification factors and the Measurements of oil flow rates, impact tests and imbalance response tests demonstrate that end gap seals render a substantial increase in the ISFD <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> and with only a small reduction on the flow through the dampers. The sealed integral dampers genemte <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> larger than two times the test values obtained earlier for open ended dampers. Conventional (cylindrical) sealed SFDS restrict substantially the lubricant through flow and determine minimal increments in the <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> because the lubricant viscosity decreases as the operating film temperature raises. The experiments further demonstrate that the amplitudes of rotor synchronous response at the first and second critical speeds are proportional to the imbalance displacements. No subsynchronous frequencies or (nonlinear) jump phenomenon are ever observed in any of the tests.

40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) {{with low}} levels of {{external}} pressurization and poor end sealing are prone to air entrapment, thus reducing the damping capability. Furthermore, existing predictive models are too restrictive. Single frequency, unidirectional load and centered circular orbit experiments were conducted on a revamped SFD test rig. The damper journal is 1 " in length and 5 " in diameter, with nominal clearance of 5 mils (0. 127 mm). The SFD feed end is flooded with oil, while the discharge end contains a recirculation groove and four orifice discharge ports to prevent air ingestion. The discharge end is fully sealed with a wave-spring that pushes a seal ring into contact with the SFD journal.

40|$|Metal mesh foil {{bearings}} (MMFBs) are {{a promising}} low cost gas bearing technology for support of high speed oil-free microturbomachinery. Elimination of complex oil lubrication and sealing system by installing MMFBs in oil free rotating machinery offer distinctive advantages such as reduced system overall weight, enhanced reliability at high rotational speeds and extreme temperatures, and extended maintenance intervals compared to conventional turbo machines. MMFBs for oil-free turbomachinery must demonstrate adequate load capacity, reliable rotordynamic performance, and low frictional losses {{in a high}} temperature environment. The thesis presents the measurements of MMFB break-away torque, rotor lift off and touchdown speeds, temperature at increasing static load conditions, and identified stiffness and equivalent <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The experiments, conducted in a test rig driven by an automotive turbocharger turbine, demonstrate the airborne operation (hydrodynamic gas film) of the floating test MMFB with little frictional loses at increasing loads. The measured drag torque peaks when the rotor starts and stops, and drops significantly once the bearing is airborne. The estimated rotor speed for lift-off increases linearly with increasing applied loads. During continuous operation, the MMFB temperature measured {{at one end of}} the back surface of the top foil increases both with rotor speed and static load. Nonetheless, the temperature rise is only nominal ensuring reliable bearing performance. Application of a sacrificial layer of solid lubricant on the top foil surface aids to reduce the rotor break-away torque. The measurements give confidence on this simple bearing technology for ready application into oil-free turbomachinery. Impact loads delivered (with a soft tip) to the test bearing, while resting on the (stationary) drive shaft, evidence a system with large damping and a structural stiffness that increases with frequency (max. 200 Hz). The system equivalent <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> ratio decreases from ~ 0. 7 to 0. 2 as the frequency increases. In general, the <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> in a metal mesh structure is of structural type and inversely proportional to the frequency and amplitude of bearing motion relative to the shaft. Impact load tests, conducted while the shaft rotates at 50 krpm, show that the bearing direct stiffness is lower (~ 25 % at 200 Hz) than the bearing structural stiffness identified from impact load tests without shaft rotation. However, the identified equivalent <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> from tests with and without shaft rotation are nearly identical. The orbits of bearing motion relative to the rotating shaft show subsynchronous motion amplitudes and also backward synchronous whirl. The subsynchronous vibration amplitudes are locked at a frequency, nearly identical to a rotor natural frequency.

40|$|AbstractJoints and {{fasteners}} {{often have}} a significant effect on the dynamical behaviour of assembled mechanical structures and the analytical prediction of structural responses therefore depends upon the accuracy of joint modelling. Detailed constitutive models that fully describe the behaviour of frictional interfaces are often unduly complicated; in which case simpler phenomenological models having parameters identified from vibration tests may be preferable. Unfortunately the direct measurement of forces transmitted between two contacting surfaces and their relative displacements are not possible in practice and it is therefore necessary to rely on measurements remote from joints. In this paper, the parameters of an assumed nonlinear joint model are identified by force-state mapping from time-domain acceleration records in response to single-frequency excitation close to the first natural frequency. The problem of lack of accessibility for measurement at the joint is overcome by casting the governing equation of the system in modal coordinates so that modal parameters are identified to represent the nonlinear behaviour of the joint. A particular result from the experimental programme is the identification of <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> dependent upon displacement amplitude.

40|$|The {{quasi-static}} {{mechanical behaviour}} of the aortic valve (AV) is highly non-linear and anisotropic {{in nature and}} reflects the complex collagen fibre kinematics in response to applied loading. However, {{little is known about}} the viscoelastic behaviour of the AV. The aim of this study was to investigate porcine AV tissue under uniaxial tensile deformation, in order to establish the directional dependence of its viscoelastic behaviour. Rate dependency associated with different mechanical properties was investigated, and a new viscoelastic model incorporating rate effects developed, based on the Kelvin-Voigt model. Even at low applied loads, experimental results showed rate dependency in the stress-strain response, and also hysteresis and dissipation effects. Furthermore, corresponding values of each parameter depended on the loading direction. The model successfully predicted the experimental data and indicated a 'shear-thinning' behaviour.

40|$|The {{oscillating}} droplet {{technique is}} an experimental technique {{that is used}} to measure the surface tension and <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients</b> of a liquid droplet. This technique {{has been the subject of}} much analysis; theoretical, numerical, and experimental with a number of different external forces used to confine the droplet. These external forces are found to modify the oscillation frequency and damping rates, which need to be quantified in order for the measurement technique to be used. The dynamics of the droplet are three-dimensional but previous numerical work has largely focused on axisymmetric cases. This work uses numerical techniques to extend the previous analysis to include the full three-dimensional effects. In this work a three-dimensional numerical model is designed, developed and applied to study the dynamics of a liquid droplet both in free space and with a high DC magnetic field used to balance gravitational forces. The numerical model is a grid point formulation of the pseudo-spectral collocation method discretised in a spherical coordinate system with the implicit Euler method used to advance the solution in time. A coordinate transformation method is used to ensure the direct surface tracking required for modelling the surface shape oscillations. The study covers the laminar fluid flow regime within a droplet exhibiting translational and surface shape oscillations providing a greater understanding of the physical behaviour of the droplet along with a qualitative and quantitative comparison with theoretical results. Initially a droplet oscillating in free space is considered, with a range of surface oscillation modes used to demonstrate the three-dimensional dynamics. Then the influence of electromagnetic forces on a diamagnetic droplet is studied, this includes the field from a solenoid magnet used to levitate a diamagnetic droplet. Finally the dynamics of an electrically conducting droplet in an external static magnetic field are modelled. In each case a number of methods are used to analyse the surface displacement in order to determine the surface tension and <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The numerical study of a freely oscillating droplet shows good agreement with the low order theoretical results for droplets in the limit of low viscosity. The high accuracy of the surface tracking method allows the non-linear effects of mode coupling and frequency shift with amplitude to be observed. There is good agreement with the theoretical values available for inviscid axisymmetric oscillations and the numerical study provides the opportunity to determine these effects for three-dimensional viscous oscillations. The magnetic field from a solenoid is used to study the levitation of a diamagnetic droplet and the oscillation frequencies of the droplet are compared with a theoretical model. The magnetic field is analysed and the accuracy of the field calculation used when determining the modification to the oscillation frequencies is considered with the use of a theoretical model. Analysis is made into the splitting of the frequency spectrum due to the magnetic field. The theoretical model that is available for an electrically conducting droplet in a static magnetic field predicts different fluid flow within the droplet and oscillation frequency and damping rate changes. These changes are compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the numerical model results with good agreement...|$|R
