30|$|Blood vessel calcifications and its {{treatment}} procedures {{are linked to}} the management of the discovered bone and mineral metabolism. In the clinical practice, there are many potential therapy procedures that directly focus to the calcification process [2, 3, 15]. Regarding efficacy and complete safety, two important issues can affect respective therapeutic procedure of the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>calcification.</b> First, we have to consider whether a treatment is preventive or it can serve for reverse calcifications. Second, can blood <b>vessel</b> <b>calcification</b> be treated without adversely affecting calcification in normal sites, such as bone and teeth? [8, 16]. The objectification and quantification of the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>calcification</b> is clinically complicated due to lack of reliable methods to quantify it. Furthermore, the sensitivity and precision of commonly used imaging modalities that are clinically used are relatively poor {{especially in the case of}} early calcifications. Lastly, none of the methods can reliably distinguish between atherosclerotic and medial calcification and, therefore, measure the combined changes in two different pathophysiological processes [4, 7]. On the base on the above stated reasons, the mathematical models which are able to autonomously detect and quantify of an amount of the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>calcification</b> are substantially important for the clinical practice.|$|E

40|$|This work aims to {{evaluate}} the application of Dual-Energy (DE) computed tomography in the angiographic assessment of lower-extremity arteries (Run-off CTA) for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAOD). Firstly, in a retrospective clinical study Run-off CTA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which served as a goldstandard, were compared to assess the relation between cardiovascular risk factors and the probability of severe <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications</b> which impair the diagnostic image quality. In a second project comprising an experimental and a retrospective clinical study {{the reliability of the}} recently developed automatic DE-based postprocessing algorithm for the creation of luminograms from CTA, that are comparable to DSA was investigated and compared to current manual and semi-automatic algorithms Results: Compared to DSA the Run-off CTA is an equivalent imaging modality for the lower-extremity arteries of patients with PAOD as long as no severe <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications</b> occur. Among the cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes and dialysis are the strongest predictors for the occurrence of severe <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications.</b> The DE-based postprocessing improves the image quality significantly and reduces the time for the creation of luminograms. However, the further developed automatic DE-based plaque subtraction technique is still limited to high luminal contrast in pelvic and thigh arteries. Conclusion: Run-off CTA is a highly reliable imaging modality for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. Because of still existing limitations in the diagnostic image quality, in particular for the calf arteries with severe <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications,</b> patients with diabetes or dialysis who are likely to show critical <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications</b> should be diagnosed using different imaging modalities. The Dual-Energy Run-off CTA as a relatively new method already significantly improves the image reconstruction due to additional spectral information. However, until now, the automatic DE-based plaque subtraction is still limited to the larger vessels with high luminal enhancement...|$|R

40|$|CTA {{could be}} {{improved}} by reducing the impact of <b>vessel</b> wall <b>calcifications</b> on image interpretation. With a 16 -slice or recently introduced 64 -slice MDCT scanner a higher resolution can be obtained compared to a 4 -slice MDCT. This may result in less blooming of calcifications, which will improve image interpretation. However, the potential for radiation dose reduction with the 16 - and 64 -slice MDCT scanners, due to the differences in gantry geometry compared to a 4 -slice MDCT, is lost when we obtain higher resolution images using thinner slices and lower pitch. Subtraction CTA is another approach to minimize the burden of <b>vessel</b> wall <b>calcifications</b> on image interpretation (55). However, this technique requires {{a high level of}} patient collaboration, is not feasible in 20 % of the patients in spite of good collaboration, generates two times more images, and increases the radiation exposure. The possible solution for the calcification problem may be found in post-processing software or more likely in hardware improvements. A complete different solution lies not in the technique, but in selecting patients for whom CTA is contra-indicated due to extensive <b>vessel</b> wall <b>calcifications.</b> In this thesis we performed an initial evaluation of clinical predictors of <b>vessel</b> wall <b>calcifications</b> on CTA. A future study is needed to develop and validate a clinical prediction rule for this problem. The results from our study can help design such a future study and restrict the data collection to the most relevant variables. In summary, CTA is the optimal non-invasive imaging test for the initial evaluation of patients with PAD. In elderly patients, patients with diabetes mellitus, and those with cardiac disease a CTA is contra-indicated due to decreased clinical utility. In these patients a MRA should be considered as initial imaging test. With the current knowledge of the DIPAD trial it is not useful to perform another study on the costs and effects of non-invasive imaging test for PAD...|$|R

The calcifications and other blood vessel diseases affecting the blood vessel permeability are commonly assessed by medical imaging modalities, {{such as the}} CT angiography. CT is capable to provide good images where physiological areas of the blood vessels are distinguished from the calcifications under great contrast. Nevertheless, commonly used clinical SW allows for only imaging of the blood vessel system and some basic image adjustment such as contrast or brightness transformations. Thus, such systems lack of procedures which would allow for autonomous modeling and objectification of the calcification amount which would predict further disease development.|$|E

This objective evaluation serves as an effective feedback representing effectivity of the segmentation procedure. On the other hand, we are aware that manual segmentation might be affected by the subjective error depending on the experience of the respective clinical expert. Furthermore, we have to take advantage the image noise influence may influence the pixels distribution.|$|E

In this work, we have proposed a fully automatic software environment (BloodVessCalc) for processing the blood vessel images acquired by the CT (computer tomography). The main function of the SW is the multiregional image segmentation allowing for an extraction of the physiological blood vessel location from the calcification spots. This model offers the calcium score calculation in a form of amount of the calcification. In the last part of our analysis, the predictive intervals of the average value and median for calcium score are calculated.|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive {{coronary}} {{computed tomography}} angiography (CCTA) {{has become an}} important tool for visualisation of coronary arteries since the introduction of 64 -channel detector CCTA in 2004. It has been proved to be especially beneficial for ruling out coronary artery disease (CAD) in selected patient populations, due to the high negative predictive value (NPV). The aim of this thesis was to study {{some aspects of the}} introduction, establishment and development of a new method, retrospectively ECG-gated CCTA with 64 -channel detector, to evaluate coronary arteries. In study I the diagnostic capacity and limitation of CCTA was compared to that of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in a newly established CCTA team. CCTA had a very high NPV but the number of non-diagnostic scans was also high. The main limitations were motion artifacts and <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications,</b> while short experience in reading CCTA did not affect image interpretation. Study II described the learning-curve effect of the interpretation of 100 CCTA and also compared the diagnostic accuracy of both radiologists and radiographers, after a common introduction. The review time for novices was approximately halved during the first 100 cases, with maintained diagnostic accuracy. There was a learning-curve effect in positive predictive value (PPV) for radiologists, but not for the radiographers. However, the diagnostic accuracy of dedicated radiographers indicated that they might be considered as part of the evaluation team. Study III compared the radiation exposure in retrospectively ECG-gated CCTA and ICA in the same population. Both mean estimated effective dose (ED) and organ doses (skin, breast, lung and oesophagus) were higher in CCTA when compared to ICA. The relatively high radiation dose to breast indicates that bismuth shielding should be used in women when performing CCTA. When using the updated tissue weighting factors provided in ICRP 103 the calculated ED from CCTA were significantly higher than those obtained using outdated ICRP 60. In study IV the image quality and radiation doses were compared when decreasing X-ray tube peak kilovoltage (kVp) from 120 to 100 kVp in patients undergoing CCTA. By reduction of tube voltage the radiation dose was almost halved while the diagnostic image quality was kept at a clinically acceptable level. In conclusion, CCTA is increasingly available throughout the world as an alternative to gold standard ICA, especially due to the excellent capability to rule out CAD. Still, retrospectively ECG-gated 64 -channel detector CCTA has limitations such as motion artifacts and <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications.</b> Another limitation is the high radiation doses required for CCTA compared to ICA. By lowering the kVp from traditionally 120 kVp to 100 kVp the radiation dose is halved while retaining diagnostic accuracy. There is a learning curve effect (regarded PPV and review time) of the interpretation of CCTA. However, more than 100 reviewed CCTA cases are necessary to reach a diagnostic accuracy that is acceptable...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge that liver tumours {{preferentially}} {{take their}} blood supply from the arterial blood supply {{rather than the}} portal venous system {{can be used for}} local delivery of treatment or for embolisation to cut off the blood supply to tumours. AIMS: To present histological evaluation of malignant and non-malignant hepatic tissue of one such therapy, selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium- 90 microspheres, to decipher its principal mechanism of action. METHODS: The HandE stained sections of hepatic resection specimens from three patients with liver metastases from colorectal (CRC) cancer, who underwent hepatic surgery 4 - 9 months following SIRT, were examined and the pathological changes documented. RESULTS: Resin microspheres were identified in the vascular tumour bed and vessels within the portal tracts of the background liver parenchyma. Microspheres were usually associated with giant cell reaction or histiocytes. In the tumour bed, tumour necrosis, mucinous alteration, collections of foamy histiocytes, ectatic <b>vessels,</b> <b>calcification</b> and fibrosis were observed. There was minimal cellular inflammatory response observed, suggestive of direct radiation injury as a non-immune mediated process. CONCLUSIONS: We describe in detail the spectrum of histopathological changes in malignant tissue and liver parenchyma in patients with metastatic CRC treated with SIRT. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the principal mechanism of action of SIRT appears to be via arterially directed delivery of highly radioactive microspheres in and around the vascular tumour bed rather than by micro-arterial embolisation...|$|R

The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of incidental coronary artery calcifications during thoracic CT examinations and to correlate them with cardiac risk factors. Materials and Methods: Thoracic CT scans obtained over a pereiod of 6 months from 113 patients (72 male and 41 female) {{with a mean age}} of 62, 7 (31 - 92 years) were retrospectively evaluated. The thoracic scans were performed using standard 9 mm consecutive slices from the apex to the base of the thorax, using a standard thoracic protocol, on a Siemens 16 channel multislice CT scanner. Coronary arteries were evaluated for calcifications. Results: Thirty-seven patients (32. 7 %) had coronary calcifications. 18 patients (15. 9 %) had one, 9 patients (7. 9 %) had two, 7 patients (6. 2 %) had three, and 3 patients (2. 6 %) had four with <b>vessel</b> <b>calcifications.</b> The frequency of coronary calcifications was correlated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, nicotine abuse, and cardiomegaly. Diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cardiomegaly and male gender were significantly associated with coronary calcifications (p< 0. 05).

Since physicians in the clinical practice are focused on a permeability level of the respective blood vessels, we have selected features quantifying an amount of the calcification.

Seven {{percent of the women}} showed VC at both upper and lower distal extremities based on pQCT images. Women who had VC were then compared with their age-matched non-VC counterparts.

Compared with the control group, the VC group showed a significantly higher body mass index (25. 2 vs. 23. 2, pÂ <Â  0. 01), lower BMC at the spine (27. 4 Â g vs. 31. 3 Â g, pÂ <Â  0. 05), and lower BMC (1. 8 Â g vs. 2. 0 Â g, pÂ <Â  0. 05) and bone mineral density (0. 57 Â g/cm 2 vs. 0. 66 Â g/cm 2, pÂ <Â  0. 05) at the hip as measured by DXA. The diagnosis of VC in the distal extremities by pQCT increased the diagnosis sensitivity of osteoporosis by 50 %.

Vessel clarity and calcification beam-hardening artefacts of the abdominal aorta, celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, inferior mesenteric artery, renal arteries, and iliac arteries were assessed using a 5 -point grading scale by two blinded radiologists randomly. Results: Cohen&# 8217;s Kappa test indicated that on average, there was substantial agreement among reviewers for vessel wall clarity and calcification artefact grading. Mann-Whitney test showed {{that there was a}} significant difference between the two groups, with FFSS performing significantly better for vessel clarity (U, 6481. 50; p&# 8201;<&# 8201; 0. 001; r, 0. 73) and calcification artefact reduction (U, 1916; p&# 8201;<&# 8201; 0. 001; r, 0. 77). Conclusion: Fine focus CT angiography produces images with better vessel wall clarity and less <b>vessel</b> <b>calcification</b> beam-hardening artefact...|$|E
40|$|Low {{levels of}} 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 (OH) D) are {{associated}} with cardiovascular diseases. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency could be a causal factor in atherosclerotic vascular changes and vascular calcification. Aortic root sections of vitamin D receptor knockout (VDR 2 / 2) mice that were stained for vascular calcification and immunostained for osteoblastic differentiation factors showed more calcified areas and a higher expression of the osteogenic key factors Msx 2, Bmp 2, and Runx 2 than the wild-type mice (P, 0. 01). Data from LDL receptor knockout (LDLR 2 / 2) mice that were fed western diet with either low (50 IU/kg), recommended (1, 000 IU/kg), or high (10, 000 IU/kg) amounts of vitamin D 3 over 16 weeks revealed increasing plasma concentrations of 25 (OH) D (P, 0. 001) with increasing intake of vitamin D, whereas levels of calcium and phosphorus in plasma and femur were not influenced by the dietary treatment. Mice treated with the low vitamin D diet had more calcified lesions and a higher expression of Msx 2, Bmp 2, and Runx 2 in aortic roots than mice fed recommended or high amounts of vitamin D (P, 0. 001). Taken together, these findings indicate vitamin D deficiency as {{a risk factor for}} aortic valve and aortic <b>vessel</b> <b>calcification</b> and a stimulator of osteogenic key factor expression in thes...|$|E
40|$|Many animal {{models have}} been {{developed}} to study the causes and treatments of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in humans, an insidious disease resulting from kidney injury and characterised by persistent functional decline for more than 3 months, with or without evidence of structural deficit. The eventual outcome of CKD may be end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), where patients need dialysis or transplantation to survive. Cardiovascular disease is accelerated in patients with CKD and contributes to increased mortality, with the relationship between CKD and cardiovascular disease being bi-directional. Most animal models do not mimic the complexity of the human disease as many do not develop CKD-associated cardiovascular disease. The adenine diet model of CKD in rodents is an exception. The original adenine diet model produced rapid-onset kidney disease with extensive tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, crystal formation and marked <b>vessel</b> <b>calcification.</b> Since then, lower adenine intake in rats has been found to induce slowly progressive kidney damage and cardiovascular disease. These chronic adenine diet models allow the characterisation of relatively stable kidney and cardiovascular disease, similar to CKD in humans. In addition, interventions for reversal can be tested. Here the key features of the adenine diet model of CKD are noted, along with some limitations of other available models. In summary, the data presented here support use of chronic low-dose adenine diet in rats as an easy and effective model for understanding human CKD, especially the links with cardiovascular disease, and developing potential therapeutic interventions...|$|E
40|$|The stylohyoid {{process is}} a {{cylindrical}} bony structure surrounded by important anatomical structures including <b>vessels</b> and nerves. <b>Calcification</b> and elongation of the stylohyoid ligament complex over 30 mm {{may be associated with}} neck and facial pain, known as Eagle's syndrome. However, a bilateral ossified and elongated stylohyoid complex may be devoid of symptoms. We report a 79 -year-old symptom-free female who presented on a routine conventional dental radiographic exam an 80. 96 mm psendoarticulated stylohyoid complex in the left side and an 75. 85 mm on the other. On CAT scan, both processes were calcified...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{idiopathic}} generalized arterial calcification in infancy are described. The {{changes in the}} <b>vessels</b> consist of <b>calcification</b> {{in relation to the}} internal elastic lamina, with secondary subintimal proliferation of fibrous tissue and, occasionally, extension into the media. They are usually most marked in the coronary arteries, with resulting myocardial disease, and acute congestive cardiac failure is the most common presentation and cause of death. The histological picture resembles closely the arterial changes that may occur in severe renal disease, hyperparathyroidism, primary bone disease, hypervitaminosis D, and occasional cases of congenital heart disease...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{endovascular}} {{treatment of}} abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR - EndoVascular Aneurism Repair) {{has become an}} alternative therapy to conventional open surgery. The objective of Angiovision project was {{to contribute to the}} improvement of EVAR procedures in terms of accuracy and customization of the interventional strategy. Our approach was mainly based on the use of patient-specific data, computer-aided endovascular navigation and numerical simulation. We proposed a new FEM-based patient-specific simulation solution to estimate the deformations caused by the introduction of stiff endovascular devices. We developed and implemented an original endovascular navigation system to augment the intraoperative fluoroscopy with the visualization of deformed preoperative aorto-iliac structure, and related information concerning <b>vessel</b> wall (<b>calcifications),</b> as well as stent-graft virtual deployment. The proposed solution, that requires only lightweight computer equipment, {{can be used in a}} standard operating room in order to optimize device placement (from a single angle of incidence).
