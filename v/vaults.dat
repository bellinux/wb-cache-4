5|$|This new {{constructional}} technique allowed Gaudí {{to achieve}} his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid <b>vaults</b> have their centre where Gothic <b>vaults</b> had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between <b>vaults,</b> where Gothic <b>vaults</b> have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaudí employed {{to give the impression}} of a starry sky.|$|E
5|$|Over ten Han-era {{underground}} tombs {{have been}} found, {{many of them}} featuring archways, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground <b>vaults</b> and domes did not require buttress supports since they were {{held in place by}} earthen pits. The use of brick <b>vaults</b> and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The semicircular apse fits {{naturally}} {{with the}} other <b>vaults</b> of the rotunda despite being larger, and features <b>vaults</b> on its north and south walls. The marble ambon was situated {{in the middle of}} the circle of columns and of the whole rotunda, directly under the dome's centre, as evidenced by a mortar padding. Stairs from the east and west, aligned with the apse, used to lead up to the ambon. The bishop's throne or cathedra probably lay near one of the south <b>vaults,</b> which was likely enlarged for the purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} a single-subject study on the top-elite vaulter in the world. This study was purposed to compare {{kinematic}} differences between Yang Hak-Seon <b>vault</b> (Yang- 1) and Tsukahara 1260 <b>vault</b> (Yang- 2) performed by Yang Hak-Seon. Fourteen high-speed cameras were used to capture a whole body segment motion of Yang- 2 <b>vault</b> during the practice session. Yang- 1 <b>vault</b> showed faster CM vertical velocity until the <b>vault</b> table takeoff and faster CM horizontal velocity prior to the <b>vault</b> table touchdown. However, the trunk rotation angle and its angular velocity of Yang- 2 <b>vault</b> exceeded Yang- 1 <b>vault</b> significantly. This {{might be due to}} a half turn off the springboard onto the <b>vault</b> table of Yang- 2 <b>vault,</b> which resulted in larger initial angular momentum at the <b>vault</b> table touchdown and further increase in angular velocity during the <b>vault</b> table contact...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Vault</b> Dweller {{explores the}} Cathedral of the Children {{and finds a}} {{prototype}} <b>Vault</b> beneath it where the Master commands his army. Disguised {{as one of the}} Children, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller infiltrates the <b>Vault</b> and destroys the Master. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller travels north to a military base, where the Master was using a mutagen called the Forced Evolutionary Virus to mutate humans into his Super Mutants. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller destroys the base, stopping the creation of more Super Mutants and splintering their army. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller returns to the <b>Vault</b> and is greeted at the entrance by the Overseer. The Overseer is happy that the <b>Vault's</b> safety is secured, but fears the <b>Vault</b> Dweller's adventure has changed them, and that hero worship of them in the <b>Vault</b> may encourage others to leave. For the greater good of the <b>Vault</b> and to preserve its isolation, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller is exiled into the Wasteland.|$|R
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Bristol Cathedral is the {{vaulting}} of its various medieval spaces. The {{work that was}} carried out under Abbot Knowle is unique in this regard, with not one, but three unique <b>vaults.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with their tendency towards extreme length, the <b>vaults</b> of English cathedrals are low compared {{with many of}} those found in other countries. The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood. The majority of English cathedrals have <b>vaults</b> ranging in height from 20–26 metres (65–86feet). These {{contrast with}} cathedrals such as Beauvais, Amiens and Cologne with internal heights of over 42 metres (140ft).|$|E

5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the ascent of Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel <b>vaults,</b> cruciform piers supporting <b>vaults,</b> and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{comparison}} to other <b>vaulting</b> techniques, the barrel <b>vault</b> is inherently a weaker design {{compared to the}} more complex groin <b>vault.</b> The barrel <b>vault</b> structure must rest on long walls creating less stable lateral stress, whereas the groin <b>vault</b> design can direct stresses almost purely vertically on the apexes.|$|R
5|$|The Castle Doctrine is a 2014 {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Jason Rohrer for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux via Valve Corporation's Steam platform. The game was released on January 29, 2014 for all platforms and is available as public domain software on sourceforge.

50|$|The <b>Vault</b> Dweller {{travels to}} <b>Vault</b> 15, the closest known <b>Vault</b> {{that may be}} able to provide help, but finds it {{collapsed}} into ruins and abandoned. The survivors of <b>Vault</b> 15 have founded a town named Shady Sands, and the <b>Vault</b> Dweller is given the option to defend them from the Khans, a group of raiders that attack the town, and radscorpions, mutated scorpions that plague the town's herds. The <b>Vault</b> Dweller then travels south to Junktown, where they can help the mayor, Killian Darkwater, bring the corrupt casino head Gizmo to justice, or help Gizmo assassinate Killian to take over the town. Further south the <b>Vault</b> Dweller finds The Hub, a bustling merchant city, where the <b>Vault</b> Dweller has the option to hire water caravans to aid <b>Vault</b> 13 and extend their estimated survival by 100 days. With clues from the Hub, the <b>Vault</b> Dweller travels to Necropolis, a city of mutated humans called ghouls. Under the city the <b>Vault</b> Dweller finds <b>Vault</b> 12 and recovers a water chip.|$|R

5|$|The {{bridge is}} now part of the Route {{nationale}} 10 which runs between Hendaye and Paris. Both viaducts to the bridge date from 1839 and each measures approximately 250m.

5|$|The {{church has}} a single {{elongated}} nave. It is surmounted by a dome and finishes with a single apse in its eastern part.

To the west of it is the sanctuary which features three <b>vaults</b> which hosted the bema, the prothesis and the diaconicon. The sanctuary was separated {{from the rest of the}} nave via two pillars. Three buttresses support the south wall and the apse. The entrance to the church is on the south wall. The church has a total of 16 windows: three on the apse, one on the south wall, four on the north wall and one on the narthex.|$|E
