5|$|Genetics is {{the study}} of genes, genetic <b>variation,</b> <b>and</b> {{heredity}} in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles. Sex usually increases genetic <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{scaling of}} MOSFET causes various process <b>variations</b> <b>and</b> defects which result in {{increasing}} performance loss of nanoscale integrated circuits. Major sources of process <b>variations</b> <b>and</b> defects in nanometer CMOS technology are studied. Then, {{their impact on}} MOSFET characteristics and on VCO circuit performances is analyzed. Finally, the paper proposes a novel self-healing circuit structure for VCO, which is able to work robustly against process variations.

50|$|Johann Sebastian Bach and {{his contemporaries}} {{incorporated}} traditional chorale melodies into numerous of their major works in such genres as the cantata, chorale prelude, chorale fantasia, chorale fugue, chorale motet, chorale <b>variations,</b> oratorio, <b>and</b> Passion. Like composers before them, Johannes Brahms and Max Reger composed variations on themes taken from earlier composers (e.g., Brahms's <b>Variations</b> <b>and</b> Fugue on a Theme by Handel, op. 24, <b>and</b> <b>Variations</b> on a Theme by Haydn, op. 56a; <b>and</b> Reger's <b>Variations</b> <b>and</b> Fugue on a Theme by Bach, op. 81, <b>and</b> <b>Variations</b> <b>and</b> Fugue on a Theme by Mozart, op. 132). Stravinsky derived {{much of the}} musical material for his Pulcinella {{from the work of}} various 18th-century composers.|$|R
5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern {{synthesis of the}} early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and <b>variation,</b> <b>and</b> Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{apiculture}} {{has adopted}} simple breeding programs for uniform desired traits, and seasonal transportation of colonies over vast distances causes increased infectious exposures from mixing of these domestic and residual displaced wild populations. Brood incubation conditions may be stressful {{with respect to}} deficient nutrition, temperature and other basics. This combination of ecological factors, especially the host factor of loss of genetic <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> hybrid vigor, {{may account for the}} apparent multifactorial environmental 'causes' of CCD including concurrent infections.|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E

5|$|Results of an mtDNA {{analysis}} of 55 jungle cats from various biogeographic zones in India indicate a high genetic <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> {{a relatively low}} differentiation between populations. It appears that the central Indian F. c. kutas population separates the Thar F. c. prateri populations from the rest and also the south Indian F. c. kelaarti populations from the north Indian F. c. affinis ones. The central Indian populations are genetically closer to the southern than to the northern populations.|$|E

Individuals from northern India (ssp. albirictus) are larger than those from the Sri Lankan population minor while those from the peninsular India (nominate subspecies) are intermediate in size. Race cathoecus is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This race has a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race thai is resident, but overlaps with wintering cathoecus. Race javanus is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race harterti found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.|$|E

5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white <b>variation,</b> <b>and</b> the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E

5|$|All post-1638 depictions {{appear to}} be based on earlier images, around the time reports {{mentioning}} dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led authors such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal <b>variation,</b> <b>and</b> even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Dodo specialist Julian Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the Gelderland, Cornelis Saftleven, Crocker Art Gallery, and Ustad Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.|$|E

5|$|As is {{the case}} with the major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, there is some <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|Columbia University's Jesup Lectures {{were the}} {{starting}} point for many of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveriesthe units of evolution (genes) with selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. In 1941, Edgar Anderson (whose work on hybridization in the genus Iris had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and Ernst Mayr co-presented the lecture series and Mayr later published his lectures as Systematics and the Origin of Species. In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, systematics, cytology, and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as <b>Variation</b> <b>and</b> Evolution in Plants, which proved {{to be one of the}} most important books in 20th-century botany. The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of the canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.|$|E
5|$|French ornithologist Émile Oustalet {{described}} a specimen from Branco {{as a separate}} species Passer brancoensis in 1883, which was recognised as the subspecies Passer iagoensis brancoensis by W. R. P. Bourne, who claimed to observe differences between Iago sparrows from different islands. According to Bourne, birds of Passer iagoensis iagoensis on more wooded islands in the south are darker and larger, and also behave more like house or Spanish sparrows, competing with them better in human-altered habitats. He later wrote that the variations he saw comprised two clinal trends, of increasing darkness towards the south, and of smaller size further from the continental coast. Charles Vaurie, examining differences in plumage and measurements of specimens in major museums, {{did not find any}} significant <b>variation,</b> <b>and</b> neither Vaurie nor Summers-Smith recognised any subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Later {{authors have}} used the term in a {{different}} sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques. Thus, Ernst Mayr in 1968 defined beta taxonomy as the classification of ranks higher than species.An understanding of the biological meaning of <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> of the evolutionary origin of groups of related species {{is even more important}} for the second stage of taxonomic activity, the sorting of species into groups of relatives ("taxa") and their arrangement in a hierarchy of higher categories. This activity is what the term classification denotes; it is also referred to as beta taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|Litorea aurea {{is equally}} and most {{closely related to}} Li. castanes and L. ranaformis. A microcomplement {{fixation}} technique using serum albumins has indicated the species closest to L. aurea is L. ranifomis. Albumin immunological distance data suggest no differentiation between the two, and the green and golden bell frog evolutionally separated from the other two species about 1.1 million years ago. A 1995 study of protein variations showed four of 19 protein systems had <b>variation</b> <b>and</b> only two had differentiation. Scientists believe the different species can still hybridise, as their distribution areas still overlap, and both L. raniformis and L. aurea have been seen sharing ponds in the Gippsland area of Victoria. However, little evidence of hybridisation actually occurring has been found. Although {{there have been reports}} of frogs of mixed appearance in Gippsland, analysis of proteins and sera of the frogs showed two distinct species. Samples in other area of distribution have shown no evidence of hybridisation in spite of cohabitation.|$|E
