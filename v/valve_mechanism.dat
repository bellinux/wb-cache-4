5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder <b>valve</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E

25|$|A similar effect {{occurs with}} the second stage. Air which has already {{expanded}} and cooled through the first stage expands again and cools further at the demand valve of the second stage.

25|$|Both four-door {{sedan and}} five-door station wagon {{variants}} were available as before, although trim levels {{were limited to}} SLX and GS. The SLX was aimed at fleet markets, fitted with power steering, a radio cassette player, a remote boot and fuel cap release, and electric side-view mirrors. The sedan-only SLX V6 added four-wheel disc brakes over the 2.2 model's front-disc, rear-drum layout, with anti-lock brakes (ABS) on the V6 available as an option. Wagons without ABS fitted made do with a load-sensing <b>valve</b> <b>mechanism</b> to control rear brake lock-up. The higher GS trim built on the SLX level, adding 60/40 split-fold rear seats, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, tachometer, central locking and a more luxurious interior upholstery style.|$|E
2500|$|With Roadmaster being a {{completely}} new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, {{one might have expected}} only modest changes for 1937. But that was not the case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up {{with the rest of the}} GM marques. [...] For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by [...] without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead <b>valve</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.|$|E
2500|$|Most modern demand valves use a {{downstream}} {{rather than}} an upstream <b>valve</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In a downstream valve, the moving part of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the actuating lever goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which crosses the regulator body and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a spring tension adjustment screw may be fitted for limited diver control of the cracking pressure. This arrangement also allows relatively simple pressure balancing of the second stage.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The article {{describes}} the method of reliability improvement of the valveactiating gear of the cylinder block head. Materials and Methods: The method of the dimensional analysis was used for definition of the possible travel of hydro compensator <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the new and used cylinder heads of ZMZ 406 motor. The method is based on micrometer research and precise calculations. Results: The hydro compensator travel in the <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of new motor cylinder heads of ZMZ- 406 engine is 2. 3 mm with maximum deviations of Â± 0. 15 mm. An estimation of dimensional chain was calculated for the rational methods of recovery. The limit values of surface wear were used as the limits of component links. The values were obtained using micrometer researches of used heads of cylinder blocks. When the best combination of wear, possible hydrocompensator travel is 1. 98 mm, and when the worst one minus is 0. 74 mm, that is, the hydrocompensator travel {{is not enough to}} compensate for the wear of component parts. Discussion and Conclusions: The authors of the article propose four ways to improve efficiency of <b>valve</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> As a criterion for selecting a method of repair is proposed to use the total value of the valve. Sinkage for the proposed methods, hydrocompensator travel after repair is from 1. 57 to 2. 36 mm, which corresponds to the hydrocompensator travel of the new motor cylinder heads...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an original continuously variable intake <b>valve</b> lift <b>mechanism</b> {{designed for the}} automotive spark ignition engines. The paper first presents the analytical kinematic synthesis of the variable intake <b>valve</b> lift <b>mechanism,</b> which consists in finding out the required intake cam profile starting from an imposed intake valve lift law. Then, by using the obtained cam profile, a computer-aided kinematic analysis of the variable intake <b>valve</b> lift <b>mechanism</b> is performed using commercial CAD software. The accuracy of the motion conversion performed with CAD software is validated by checking the degree of correlation between the resulted intake valve lift law and the imposed law used when performing the analytical synthesis. The goals of the kinematic analysis are first to find the partial laws of the intake valve lift, corresponding to the engine part loads and second, to find the transfer functions of the elements used to command the mechanism, i. e. the dependency between these elements and the intake valve lift law. The designed variable intake <b>valve</b> lift <b>mechanism</b> is successfully operated on an engine prototype and proved its energetic improvement potential...|$|R

Some are thought of commonly in terms of 2 -way flow (laryngeal cords, lips, nasal turbinates) while most are thought of as being associated with 1 -way flow (iris, external nares, cricopharyngeal or upper esophageal sphincter, all the heart valves, venous valves, pylorus, sphincter of Oddi, ileo-caecal valve, urethral sphincters).

Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral horn and the tuba.
