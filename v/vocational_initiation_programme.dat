However {{data on the}} relationship between CD 4 count at ART initiation and loss to follow-up (LTFU) are limited and conflicting. METHODS We conducted a cohort analysis including all adults initiating ART (2008 - 2012) at three public sector sites in South Africa. LTFU was defined as no visit in the 6  months before database closure. The Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox's proportional hazards models examined the relationship between CD 4 count at ART initiation and 24 -month LTFU. Final models were adjusted for demographics, year of ART <b>initiation,</b> <b>programme</b> expansion and corrected for unascertained mortality. RESULTS Among 17   038 patients, the median CD 4 at initiation increased from 119 (IQR 54 - 180) in 2008 to 257 (IQR 175 - 318) in 2012. In unadjusted models, observed LTFU was associated with both CD 4 counts < 100 cells/μL and CD 4 counts ≥ 300 cells/μL.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of a Scientific <b>Initiation</b> <b>Programme</b> (SIP) on the professional profile of new doctors from a Brazilian university. Aim and methods: Evaluate fifty-two new doctors divided into two groups matched by sex, age and academic performance and differing only in participation in the SIP. Professional and socioeconomic data were collected, including schooling of parents; average income before, during and after the medical course; current professional situation; results of exams for civil servant recruitment; and titles and degrees obtained after graduation. Results: Significant differences were found only in civil servant recruitment exam results (p= 0. 0098) and in income after graduation (p= 0. 02), which were both higher in the non-SIP group. Only one doctor got a M. Sc. degree after graduation, but many of them in both groups obtained technical titles, and had papers presented at congresses or published. Conclusions: Apparently, taking part in a SIP led to lower income and worse civil servant recruitment exam results. However, this may only reflect a transient phase in a long-term process. New research currently under way will answer this remaining question, now that more time has elapsed since graduation. Rev Port Pneumol 2010; XVI (5) : 797 - 80...|$|R

MethodsWe conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study. We performed logistic regression analyses {{to examine the relationship}} between ethnic background and HPV vaccine (HPVV) <b>programme</b> <b>initiation.</b> ResultsThe free <b>programme</b> increased the vaccination uptake from 16 % to 75 %. Descendants (Denmark-born women with both parents of foreign origin) and immigrants in Denmark for more than 5 years were less likely to initiate the free HPVV programme than Denmark-born women ((aOR= 0. 56; 95 % CI: 0. 54 – 0. 59) and (aOR= 0. 39; 95 % CI: 0. 38 – 0. 40), respectively).

The School of Medicine at Universidade Federal Fluminense pioneered on optional SIP in 1995. This study aims to compare scientific output of professors who engaged in SIP disciplines (SIP group) with that of professors who did not (non-SIP group). Methods: Data on the scientific output of both groups was collected from a period that began 4 years before and ended 4 years after the SIP’s inception. The average number of papers published or presented in medical meetings in both groups was compared. Results: The scientific output of the SIP group was larger {{than that of the}} non SIP group (p= 0. 0017), except for M. Sc. professors (p= 0. 8362). This result did not change when the scientific production of Ph. D. professors was analysed according to the periods before (p= 0. 0003) and after (p= 0. 0001) SIP’s inception. Scientific output of M. Sc. professors of both group were similar in both periods, i. e., before (p= 1. 0) and after (p= 0. 67) SIP’s inception. When scientific output in the periods before and after SIP’s inception is compared, it was found that it increased in both groups, SIP (p= 0. 0001) and non SIP (p= 0. 0086) alike. Conclusions: After the inception of SIP, all professors had an increase in their scientific output; however, this occurred independently of their engagement in SIP disciplines.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} is increasing {{at an alarming rate}} in developing countries. However, glycaemia control remains suboptimal and insulin use is low. One important barrier is the lack of an efficient and effective insulin initiation delivery approach. This study aimed to document the strategies used and proposed by healthcare professionals to improve insulin initiation in the Malaysian dual-sector (public–private) health system. Methods In depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted in Klang Valley and Seremban, Malaysia in 2010 – 11. Healthcare professionals consisting of general practitioners (n[*]=[*] 11), medical officers (n[*]=[*] 8), diabetes educators (n[*]=[*] 3), government policy makers (n[*]=[*] 4), family medicine specialists (n[*]=[*] 10) and endocrinologists (n[*]=[*] 2) were interviewed. We used a topic guide to facilitate the interviews, which were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic approach. Results Three main themes emerged from the interviews. Firstly, {{there was a lack of}} collaboration between the private and public sectors in diabetes care. The general practitioners in the private sector proposed an integrated system for them to refer patients to the public health services for insulin <b>initiation</b> <b>programmes.</b> There could be shared care between the two sectors and this would reduce the disproportionately heavy workload at the public sector. Secondly, besides the support from the government health authority, the healthcare professionals wanted greater involvement of non-government organisations, media and pharmaceutical industry in facilitating insulin initiation in both the public and private sectors. The support included: training of healthcare professionals; developing and disseminating patient education materials; service provision by diabetes education teams; organising programmes for patients’ peer group sessions; increasing awareness and demystifying insulin via public campaigns; and subsidising glucose monitoring equipment. Finally, the healthcare professionals proposed the establishment of multidisciplinary teams as a strategy to increase the rate of insulin initiation. Having team members from different ethnic backgrounds would help to overcome language and cultural differences when communicating with patients. Conclusion The challenges faced by a dual-sector health system in delivering insulin initiation may be addressed by greater collaborations between the private and public sectors and governmental and non-government organisations, and among different healthcare professionals. </p...|$|R

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. Of 250 GPs approached, 192 completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding pathology, key history points, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of asthma. Results: Overall, 28. 6 % of GPs had adequate knowledge of the core concepts of asthma, while only 10. 4 % had adequate practice in asthma management. About 78 % of GPs had inadequate knowledge of pathology, about 90 % had inadequate knowledge of medications to be used, and 63 % had inadequate knowledge regarding diet restrictions. Knowledge regarding symptoms not usually associated with asthma was adequate, as was knowledge regarding non-pharmacological management (79 % each).

In 1984, there was a record number of Std 8s, 234 in all, who were divided into 9 classes, and total enrolments reached 885, an annual increase of 130. Four additional prefab classrooms had to be erected quickly. Numbers continued to rise {{over the next few years}} and had reached 935 by 1988, with a staff team of 54 as well as a lab assistant, three secretaries, a media assistant, a caretaker and six ground staff. 1984 also saw the completion of long-awaited extensions and renovations to the school: Victoria Park now boasted the finest facilities in the country and was arguably the fastest growing school in S.A. However, the year was a sad one with the passing of the school's founder, Mr Herby Arnott. After 1982 there were many administrative changes: the introduction of the Standard Head system, a [...] "Gifted Child' Extended Learning Programme, conversational Xhosa, as well as a formal valedictory ceremony for school leavers and an <b>initiation</b> <b>programme</b> for newcomers. In 1985 a grand piano was purchased as well as a TV set for the Media Centre. Additional prefabs were erected and the new sports field was named the Wright Field. By 1988 Xhosa had become a full subject and Home Economics and Business Economics were offered at the Higher Grade. The re-established P.T.A. introduced the 100 Club, which is still flourishing. The computer age became a reality in 1986 when seven I.B.M. computers were installed, with another eight the following year. This was also the year of [...] "Stage-struck”, a memorable revue produced by Mr Michiel de Beer. Another development was the nine-day school calendar. A successful series of staff development seminars placed V.P. in the forefront of staff development programmes in the Eastern Cape. In 1987 a second TV was bought, the [...] "Quarterly Review" [...] was published for the first time and the Botanical Reserve was established as a problem-solving project. Athletics were held at the Westbourne Oval and a swimming gala at Newton Park Baths, 1988 brought yet more changes. A senior Deputy, two Deputy Principals and 14 Heads of Department joined the Principal in running the school. A computer for school administration was installed in the secretaries' office. It brought computerised reports and a fully computensed marks system. The last two years of the eighties saw a stabilization in enrolment and a large number of pupils following University Exemption Courses. A key area of the school programme that flourished was in the arts. The standard of drama had risen considerably with both the One-Act Plays and an annual full-length production. Art was thriving and there was a major growth in interest in music, with a brass band of more than 20 players performing regularly. By the dawn of the Nineties, with its large staff, fine facilities, up-to-date technology and commitment to a balanced educational programme, V.P. had advanced considerably from its humble beginnings, and in its 50th year, the school served the community effectively and was proud of being amongst S.A.'s best high schools.|$|R
