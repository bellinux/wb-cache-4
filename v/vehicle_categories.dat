Switzerland has, however, {{generally}} adopted much of the harmonised EU legislation with regard to driving licences. Swiss licences can be exchanged in most EEA countries.

25|$|Until 2013, the Croatian {{driving licence}} had a pink booklet format, which was common in Europe at the time. A {{separate}} booklet {{was required for}} each vehicle category endorsement. This was before the European Parliament adopted the Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Commission, which mandated {{the creation of a}} single European driving licence. Since 2013, Croatian driving licences are issued in a EU-standard, credit-card-style format. Only one card is required per licence holder as it contains information on all <b>vehicle</b> <b>categories</b> that the holder is allowed to operate. Old (pre-2013) licences remain to be valid until their expiry, or until year 2033, whichever comes sooner.|$|E
