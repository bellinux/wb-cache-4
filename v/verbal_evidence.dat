In his packet Mr. Prendergast sent copies of documents and of <b>verbal</b> <b>evidence</b> which he had managed to obtain; but with the actual details of these it is not necessary that I should trouble those who are following me in this story. In this letter Mr. Prendergast also recommended that some intercourse should be had with Owen Fitzgerald. It was expedient, he said, that all the parties concerned should recognise Owen's position as the heir presumptive to the title and estate; and as he, he said, had found Mr. Fitzgerald of Hap House to be forbearing, generous, and high-spirited, he thought that this intercourse might be conducted without enmity or ill blood. And then he suggested that Mr. Somers should see Owen Fitzgerald.|$|E

Apparently, this is also the rule with you [...] Christians. And we know when a man has his power from a god by the [...] fact that he does things which he could not do, as a man, with the [...] mere powers of a man. Plainly, this is the Christian's way also, of [...] knowing when a man is working by a god's power and not by his own. [...] You saw that there was a supernatural property in the hair of [...] Samson; for you perceived that when his hair was gone he was as [...] other men. It is our way, as I have said. There are many nations [...] in the world, and each group of nations has its own gods, and will [...] pay no worship to the gods of the others. Each group believes its [...] own gods to be strongest, and it will not exchange them except for [...] gods that shall be proven to be their superiors in power. Man is [...] but a weak creature, and needs the help of gods--he cannot do [...] without it. Shall he place his fate in the hands of weak gods when [...] there may be stronger ones to be found? That would be foolish. No, [...] if he hear of gods that are stronger than his own, he should not [...] turn a deaf ear, for it is not a light matter that is at stake. How [...] then shall he determine which gods are the stronger, his own or [...] those that preside over the concerns of other nations? By comparing [...] the known works of his own gods with the works of those others; [...] there is no other way. Now, when we make this comparison, we are [...] not drawn towards the gods of any other nation. Our gods are shown [...] by their works to be the strongest, the most powerful. The [...] Christians have but few gods, and they are new--new, and not strong; [...] as it seems to us. They will increase in number, it is true, for [...] this has happened with all gods, but that time is far away, many [...] ages and decades of ages away, for gods multiply slowly, as is meet [...] for beings to whom a thousand years is but a single moment. Our own [...] gods have been born millions of years apart. The process is slow, [...] the gathering of strength and power is similarly slow. In the slow [...] lapse of the ages the steadily accumulating power of our gods has at [...] last become prodigious. We have a thousand proofs of this in the [...] colossal character of their personal acts and the acts of ordinary [...] men to whom they have given supernatural qualities. To your Samson [...] was given supernatural power, and when he broke the withes, and slew [...] the thousands with the jawbone of an ass, and carried away the [...] gate's of the city upon his shoulders, you were amazed--and also [...] awed, for you recognized the divine source of his strength. But it [...] could not profit to place these things before your Hindoo [...] congregation and invite their wonder; for they would compare them [...] with the deed done by Hanuman, when our gods infused their divine [...] strength into his muscles; and they would be indifferent to them--as [...] you saw. In the old, old times, ages and ages gone by, when our god [...] Rama was warring with the demon god of Ceylon, Rama bethought him to [...] bridge the sea and connect Ceylon with India, so that his armies [...] might pass easily over; and he sent his general, Hanuman, inspired [...] like your own Samson with divine strength, to bring the materials [...] for the bridge. In two days Hanuman strode fifteen hundred miles, [...] to the Himalayas, and took upon his shoulder a range of those lofty [...] mountains two hundred miles long, and started with it toward Ceylon. [...] It was in the night; and, as he passed along the plain, the people [...] of Govardhun heard the thunder of his tread and felt the earth [...] rocking under it, and they ran out, and there, with their snowy [...] summits piled to heaven, they saw the Himalayas passing by. And as [...] this huge continent swept along overshadowing the earth, upon its [...] slopes they discerned the twinkling lights of a thousand sleeping [...] villages, {{and it was as if}} the constellations were filing in [...] procession through the sky. While they were looking, Hanuman [...] stumbled, and a small ridge of red sandstone twenty miles long was [...] jolted loose and fell. Half of its length has wasted away in the [...] course of the ages, but the other ten miles of it remain in the [...] plain by Govardhun to this day as proof of the might of the [...] inspiration of our gods. You must know, yourself, that Hanuman [...] could not have carried those mountains to Ceylon except by the [...] strength of the gods. You know that it was not done by his own [...] strength, therefore, you know that it was done by the strength of [...] the gods, just as you know that Samson carried the gates by the [...] divine strength and not by his own. I think you must concede two [...] things: First, That in carrying the gates of the city upon his [...] shoulders, Samson did not establish the superiority of his gods over [...] ours; secondly, That his feat is not supported by any but verbal [...] evidence, while Hanuman's is not only supported by <b>verbal</b> <b>evidence,</b> [...] but this evidence is confirmed, established, proven, by visible, [...] tangible evidence, which is the strongest of all testimony. We have [...] the sandstone ridge, and while it remains we cannot doubt, and shall [...] not. Have you the gates?'" ...|$|E

40|$|Debris flow {{is one of}} the {{shattering}} natural disasters, mostly ensuing in mountainous areas. Rational {{estimation of}} debris flow velocity {{is one of the}} key issues in debris hazard mitigation. Among the various procedures, back-calculation of debris flow velocity is a widely used approach. Back-calculation procedure includes determinations of super-elevation and channel properties, and velocities are calculated using the forced-vortex equation (??=√gRΔ?/kb). A debris mass, when travels through a curved flume, leaves the highest flow mark on the outer bend, and the difference between the flow depths of outer and inner bends is referred to as ‘super-elevation’. However, in a post-flow field investigation, only the highest flow marks on both inner and outer bends are visible, which does not portray the actual maximum super-elevation that must have been reached in the unsteady flow event, and eventually leads to a misjudgment of the real velocity. Another important parameter of forced vortex equation is the channel radius of curvature. Any natural channel has hardly been a circle, rather it has varying curvature. How the curve is approximated can affect velocity estimation. Considering the unsteady nature of debris flows, this research work aims to figure out a coherent way of estimating debris flow velocities. Therefore, a series of numerical curved flume tests using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are carried out to check the aptness of the mud-marks derived velocities. Estimated velocities from flow marks underestimate the actual velocities near the source, while they converge on the actual velocities as the distance to source increases. Based on the simulations, a best fit curve is proposed to adjust the mud-marks derived velocities. Law of similarity allows to apply the findings from these small scale simulations to the real debris flow problems. Three debris flow events in Japan are taken for the validation of the proposed procedure and adjusted velocities are proven to be consistent with <b>verbal</b> <b>evidences</b> and previous analyses...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} individuals with dyslexia rely on explicit visuospatial representations for syllogistic reasoning while most non-dyslexics opt for an abstract verbal strategy. This paper investigates the role of visual processes in relational reasoning amongst dyslexic reasoners. Expt 1 presents written and <b>verbal</b> protocol <b>evidence</b> to suggest that reasoners with dyslexia generate detailed representations of relational properties and use these to make a visual comparison of objects. Non-dyslexics use a linear array of objects to make a simple transitive inference. Expt 2 examined evidence for the visual-impedance effect which suggests that visual information detracts from reasoning leading to longer latencies and reduced accuracy. While non-dyslexics showed the impedance effects predicted, dyslexics showed only reduced accuracy on problems designed specifically to elicit imagery. Expt 3 presented problems with less semantically and visually rich content. The non-dyslexic group again showed impedance effects, but dyslexics did not. Furthermore, in both studies, visual memory predicted reasoning accuracy for dyslexic participants, but not for non-dyslexics, particularly on problems with highly visual content. The findings are discussed in terms of the importance of visual and semantic processes in reasoning for individuals with dyslexia, and we argue that these processes play a compensatory role, offsetting phonological and verbal memory deficits. 20 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the sufferings the epistle's addressees were experiencing were social in nature, specifically {{in the form of}} <b>verbal</b> derision.

It is significant to him that the author notes that “your brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering” (5:9), indicating suffering that is worldwide in scope. Elliott sees this as grounds to reject the idea that the epistle refers to official persecution, because the first worldwide persecution of Christians officially meted by Rome did not occur until the persecution initiated by Decius in AD 250.|$|R

40|$|Rationale: Dyspnoea is a {{debilitating}} and distressing symptom that {{is reflected in}} different <b>verbal</b> descriptors. <b>Evidence</b> suggests that dyspnoea, like pain perception, consists of sensory quality and affective components. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop an instrument that measures overall dyspnoea severity using descriptors that reflect its different aspects. Methods: 81 dyspnoea descriptors were administered to 123 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 129 with interstitial lung disease and 106 with chronic heart failure. These were reduced to 34 items using hierarchical methods. Rasch analysis informed decisions regarding further item removal and fit to the unidimensional model. Principal component analysis (PCA) explored the underlying structure of the final item set. Validity and reliability of the new instrument were further assessed in a separate group of 53 patients with COPD. Results: After removal of items with hierarchical methods (n= 47) and items that failed to fit the Rasch model (n= 22), 12 were retained. The ‘‘Dyspnoea- 12 ’’ had good internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha= 0. 9) and fit to the Rasch model (x 2 p= 0. 08). Items patterned into two groups called ‘‘physical’’(n= 7) and ‘‘affective’’(n= 5). In the separate validation study, Dyspnoea- 12 correlated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety r= 0. 51; depression r= 0. 44, p, 0. 001, respectively), 6 -minute walk distance (r= 20. 38, p, 0. 01) and MRC (Medical Research Council) grade (r= 0. 48, p, 0. 01), and had good stability over time (intraclass correlation coefficient= 0. 9, p, 0. 001). Conclusion: Dyspnoea- 12 fulfills modern psychometric requirements for measurement.

Aims This review assesses research evidence addressing the effectiveness of written and/or verbal information for adult patients or their relatives upon discharge from {{critical care}} to identify the factors likely to influence its impact on physical and psychological outcomes. Methods We undertook a narrative critical review of published research. Medline, Embase, PyschInfo, Web of Science, The British Nursing Index and the Cochrane Library as well as key web sites and reference lists were searched for relevant research published between 1990 - 2011,which explored the impact of written or verbal critical care discharge information. Methodological appraisal of studies was undertaken using tools provided by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Results We found eight publications reporting four independent studies: one multi-centre randomised controlled trial, two quasi-experimental studies and a descriptive qualitative study. In total 133 patients, 193 relatives and 33 nurses were studied. Results showed beneficial physical effects for patients from using a self-help manual, and improved knowledge and increased satisfaction for relatives for combined written and <b>verbal</b> information. <b>Evidence</b> on anxiety was mixed and the value of a written booklet alone was unclear. However the evidence base was of low overall quality. Implications for practice Critical care discharge information should: •	Combine written and verbal information •	Take account of physical and psychological vulnerabilities •	Be individualized and flexible •	Incorporate opportunities for user participation and reflection Conclusions Current evidence suggests that individualised information incorporating user participation and opportunities for reflection may improve the psycho-social well-being of both patients and relatives.

Here we sought to identify non-verbal measures of the sense of agency, particularly testing the relevance of physiological activity such as skin conductance and heart rate. Manipulating the visual feedback to an executed movement, we investigated how well physiological activity and other movement parameters differed between real and false feedback (i. e., between actual agency and non-agency), and how they related to accuracy of agency judgments. Skin conductance and heart rate did not differ between agency and non-agency situations; neither did they inform agency judgments. In contrast, movement onsets – particularly, discrepancies between feedback and movement onsets – were related to agency judgments. Overall, our results indicate weak visceral–somatic associations with the sense of agency. Thus, physiological activity did not prove to be an empirical indicator for the feeling of agency...|$|R
40|$|This {{symposium}} explores potential {{methods that}} can be used to improve the accuracy of eyewitness and visual evidence. Several types of evidence are considered, including eyewitness identification <b>evidence,</b> visual and <b>verbal</b> descriptions, and <b>evidence</b> obtained through repeated exposure to existing visual evidence. As well as several types of evidence, a variety of sources are also explored, such as: adult eyewitnesses; eyewitnesses with mild learning disabilities; officers who view visual evidence; and members of the public who respond to information publicised about an investigation. The four papers follow the acquisition of evidence in an investigation from obtaining visual and verbal descriptions, to presenting facial composites, to viewing visual evidence to testing the eyewitness in an identification procedure. At each stage the paper concerned looks either at a method that could be used to improve the accuracy of the information obtained, or at whether existing methods employed to enhance the accuracy of identification evidence really do succeed in improving it. The symposium will conclude with a discussion section that looks across the range of different visual identification evidence and methods {{that can be}} gathered in modern police investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis examines the influence that both geometric and extrageometric factors have on children's spatial language production. Over the years it has widely been assumed that spatial prepositions identif' where objects are in the world (geometric factors) {{and that this is}} reflected in the semantic representations of these words. More recently, researchers investigating the lexical semantics of spatial prepositions have begun to question this assumption by demonstrating that what objects are and how they are interacting can also affect the way we describe where they are in the world (extra-geometric factors). Following on from research conducted with adults that has demonstrated the importance of both of these factors on spatial language, the main aim of this thesis was to ascertain for the first time whether these factors also influenced children's spatial language production, and if so, when they became important in children's development of spatial expressions. Additionally, due to the paucity of {{research in}}vestigating the production of spatial terms, the Experiments reported in this theis set out to redress the balance. The {{research in this}} thesis demonstrated {{for the first time that}} both geometric and extra geometric factors influence the production of children's spatial expressions from an early age. In doing so, however, the Experiments reported here were not necessarily revealing as to the nature of the semantic representation of spatial terms, rather they highlighted a different issue; how people make distinctions during a <b>verbal</b> interaction. <b>Evidence</b> is presented that suggests a level of agreement between people regarding the nonconventional use of words. In order to distinguish between functional and non-functional situations, both adults and children used different types of spatial terms to locate an object even when they had a limited number of words in their lexicon. An approach to the whole process of prepositional production is suggested rather than concentrating on what is represented in an individual's lexicon...|$|R
