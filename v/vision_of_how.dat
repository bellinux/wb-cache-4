5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{drive to}} the park for a picnic but {{discover}} {{that it has been}} overrun by mosquitoes. While heading home, the family finds an Indian casino. Bart is turned away because of his age but is able to sneak in by hiding in ventriloquist Arthur Crandall's dummy case. During Crandall's performance at the casino, Bart bursts out of the case and gets caught by casino guards. He is sent to the casino manager's office, where the Native American manager shows him a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> his future will turn out if he does not change his ways. Thirty years into the future, Bart is a 40-year-old beer-drinking slacker trying to launch his music career after dropping out of the DeVry Institute, and has resorted to mooching off his parents and their neighbor Ned Flanders. The only gig Bart can get is at a beach bar owned by Nelson Muntz, and even then, Bart is only paid in popcorn shrimp. Bart lives with Ralph Wiggum in a beach cottage by the shore, from which Bart finds out that he has been evicted after his disastrous concert at Nelson's bar. Meanwhile, 38-year-old Lisa is the first straight female President of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Metaverse, {{a phrase}} coined by Stephenson as a {{successor}} to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> a virtual reality-based Internet might evolve in the near future. Resembling a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), the Metaverse is populated by user-controlled avatars as well as system daemons. Although there are public-access Metaverse terminals in Reality, using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse denizens, {{in part because of}} the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality avatars. Status in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one's avatar.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Sharif {{announced}} that it would open unconditional talks with the Taliban, declaring them stakeholders rather than terrorists. The PML-N's conservative hardliners also chose to blame the US and NATO for causing terrorism in Pakistan. The peace effort was encountering problems before it had ever really begun. The Pakistani Taliban's Supreme Council released demands for a cease-fire, to also include the release of all its imprisoned militants and the withdrawal of the Pakistani military from all tribal regions. Former and current government officials criticised Sharif for not yet laying out a clear <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the country should handle its more than 40 militant groups, many of them made up of violent Islamic extremists.|$|E
25|$|About 10% of the {{population}} of Saskatchewan during 1850–1930 were Irish-born or of Irish origin. Cottrell (1999) examines the social, economic, political, religious, and ideological impact of the Irish diaspora on pioneer society and suggests that both individually and collectively, the Irish were a relatively privileged group. The most visible manifestations of intergenerational Irish ethnicity - the Catholic Church and the Orange Order - served as vehicles for recreating Irish culture on the prairies and as forums for ethnic fusion, which integrated people of Irish origin with settlers of other nationalities. The Irish were thus a vital force for cohesion in an ethnically diverse frontier society, but also a source of major tension with elements that did not share their <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the province of Saskatchewan should evolve.|$|E
25|$|During {{a sumptuous}} feast on the Isle of Love, Tethys, {{who is now}} the lover of da Gama, prophecies the future of Portuguese {{exploration}} and conquest. She tells of Duarte Pacheco Pereira's defense of Cochin (Battle of Cochin); the Battle of Diu fought by Francisco de Almeida and his son Lourenço de Almeida against combined Gujarati-Egyptian fleets; the deeds of Tristão da Cunha, Pedro de Mascarenhas, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio and Nuno da Cunha; and battles fought by Martim Afonso de Sousa and João de Castro. Tethys then guides da Gama to a summit and reveals to him a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the (Ptolemaic) universe operates. The tour continues with glimpses of the lands of Africa and Asia. The legend of the martyrdom of the apostle St. Thomas in India is told at this point. Finally, Tethys relates the voyage of Magellan. The epic concludes with more advice to young King Sebastião.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Andrew's {{politics}} had moderated. [...] In late 1865, {{he expressed}} support for the Reconstruction policies of President Andrew Johnson, resulting in a split with his longtime political ally Charles Sumner. [...] The party split was such that Andrew was considered as a potential candidate for Sumner's Senate seat, but he rejected the possibility. [...] With the war at an end in 1865, he decided not to run for reelection. [...] In his final speech to the state legislature in January 1866 he outlined his <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Reconstruction should proceed, significantly diverging from the Radical agenda by not making black suffrage a prerequisite for the readmission of rebel state legislators to Congress. [...] He had in part acted on private efforts to aid in the reconstruction of the south in 1865, forming a land agency as a clearing house for Northerners seeking to invest in the southern properties.|$|E

The unicorn that digs a hole from the garden of Eden was portrayed by Tress MacNeille. The second segment {{was written by}} Doyle. The episode's third segment was written by Selman. When writing segments for trilogy episodes, the writing staff usually follow the stories they are based on, while putting The Simpsons characters in the original characters' place.

500|$|While noting Yellow Submarines {{status as}} the Beatles' only [...] "inessential" [...] album, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic {{describes}} [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] as [...] "an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments". Referring to the revelations offered in the song, Unterberger adds: [...] "they present Harrison's <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> music and recording sounded, from the inside-out and the outside-in, during the psychedelic era – the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967." [...] Writing for Billboard in 2001, Bill Holland grouped [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] with the Byrds' [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] and early-1970s releases by the Kinks and Joni Mitchell, as songs that constitute {{the first wave of}} musical statements in which artists [...] "accuse or indict their industry's business policies". Inglis views [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] as the Beatles' [...] "first 'postmodern' song", due to the [...] "deliberate ironic intent" [...] evident in the subject matter and in the use of tape effects and scattered conversation.|$|E

[...] Although {{it is impossible to}} precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, Francis Ronalds stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the world could be transformed by electricity. Over 50 years later, he joined the new Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to be renamed the Institution of Electrical Engineers) where he was regarded by other members as the first of their cohort. By the end of the 19th century, the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by the engineering development of land-lines, submarine cables, and, from about 1890, wireless telegraphy.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} Bosnian Muslims construct their identity {{through the lens}} of rebuilt or newly built mosques following the systematic destruction of religious architecture during the 1992 - 1995 War.

By examining different identity formation processes on three scales (the building process, the regional, and the global scale), the dissertation argues that, aside from its religious functions, the contemporary mosque has become the primary locus where the emerging Bosniak nation can visually and symbolically shape and express its <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> itself...|$|R

2500|$|Some modern {{productions}} {{explore the}} justification of Shylock's thirst for vengeance. For instance, in the 2004 film adaptation directed by Michael Radford and starring Al Pacino as Shylock, the film begins with text and {{a montage of}} how the Jewish community is abused by the Christian population of the city. One of the last shots of the film also highlights that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish community in Venice, no longer allowed {{to live in the}} ghetto. But he would likely not have been fully accepted by the Christians, as they would remember his Jewish birth. Another interpretation of Shylock and a <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> [...] "must he be acted" [...] appears {{at the conclusion of the}} autobiography of Alexander Granach, a noted Jewish stage and film actor in Weimar Germany (and later in Hollywood and on Broadway).|$|E

2500|$|In 1793, {{while the}} French Revolution {{was in full}} swing, Godwin {{published}} his great work on political science, Enquiry concerning Political Justice, and its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness. The {{first part of this}} book was largely a recap of Edmund Burke's A Vindication of Natural Society – an anarchist critique of the state. Godwin acknowledged the influence of Burke for this portion. The rest of the book is Godwin's positive <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> an anarchist (or minarchist) society might work. Political Justice was extremely influential in its time: after the writings of Burke and Paine, Godwin's was the most popular written response to the French Revolution. Godwin's work was seen by many as illuminating a middle way between the fiery extremes of Burke and Paine. Prime Minister William Pitt famously said that {{there was no need to}} censor it, because at over £1 it was too costly for the average Briton to buy. However, as was the practice at the time, numerous [...] "corresponding societies" [...] took up Political Justice, either sharing it or having it read to the illiterate members. Eventually, it sold over 4000 copies and brought literary fame to Godwin.|$|E
