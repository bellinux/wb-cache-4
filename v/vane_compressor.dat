5000|$|In 1951 GM {{incorporated}} {{several small}} body, mechanical and electrical improvements into the model, {{enough to warrant}} the change once again of the model number to PD-4103. The easiest spotting features of a PD-4103 over the rare PD-4102 are that the later model included a rear luggage bay door {{on the left side}} that did not appear on either the PD-4101 or PD-4102, as well as an improved refrigeration system, using the same Ingersoll-Rand rotary <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> as previous models, but with a larger evaporator coil using a better expansion valve and a larger supply fan located over the rear passengers' seats. To further improve air circulation and fresh air intake, exhaust fans were incorporated into the soffit at the head of each interior luggage rack, which operated from the same rheostat that controlled the main blower. Also included was a new, higher rated Delco generator and an improved voltage regulator, a redesigned reverse gear solenoid on the transmission, various evolutionary improvements to the 6-71 GM Diesel (tougher alloy exhaust valves and improved S-55 injectors as standard) and other miscellaneous minor improvements, including the addition of a [...] "black light" [...] instrument panel, in which the instruments had radium painted figures, very similar to what Ford introduced on their 1950 Ford passenger cars. Production of this bus totaled 1,501 with Greyhound Lines buying a substantial quantity. Many also operated for Trailways and other operators. Trailways sorely needed the GM Diesels, as the Hall-Scott 190-powered IC41 Brills had notoriously heavy fuel consumption, often achieving only 1.5 to 2 miles per gallon on a route on which a PD-4103 could easily get 7 on cheaper #1 Diesel fuel. The Brills, however, were far more powerful, and much faster than the PD-4103s on the flat. The PD-4103 was the first GM Coach offered with an optional restroom, or with facilities for an optional food buffet, a feature used on many cars ordered by Trailways. The PD-4103 restroom was problematic, as the overhead for the refrigeration unit and engine air intake severely restricted headroom. This problem was rectified in the successor PD-4104, which set the pattern for bus restrooms for all manufacturers for the next 50 years.|$|E
5000|$|The GM Truck and Coach PD-4103 was {{the last}} {{in a series of}} low-budget [...] "conversion" [...] parlor coach models which were, in actuality, based upon the basic Yellow Coach/GM Truck and Coach transit bus models which first {{appeared}} in 1940. Favored GM customer Greyhound Lines had already been given a near monopoly on the PDA-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Old Silversides" [...] models, which were in part designed by Greyhound themselves. In order to answer complaints from arch competitor Trailways and other independent operators about being locked out from purchasing the PD-3751 model, GM simply took their existing 96" [...] wide, 35' long suburban transit model, added more luggage bay space underneath, added sliding highway-style side windows, added reclining seating, and shortened the overhung portion of the front end by moving the front axle forward using a new front end from the wartime Yellow Coach [...] "Victory Cruiser" [...] model. This was the PD-4101, which appeared shortly after the end of World War II. GM created the model PD-4102 by restyling its PD-4101 in 1950 using a distinctive new front end with the destination sign below the windshield and a new, restyled rear end which used a full-width engine access door, an aluminum alloy bumper to match that on the front and a [...] "post-less" [...] picture window in the rear which used biradial curved glass (a new development by GM supplier, Libbey-Owens-Ford), replacing the divided flat transit bus-type rear windows found on the PD-4101. The front end styling job on the PD-4102 was reactionary, as it closely mimicked the striking styling of the IC41 intercity bus built by ACF-Brill Corporation in 1947-1954, a model bought in large quantities by Trailways to compete with Greyhound Lines' successful and much more efficient PD-3701/PD-3751 [...] "Silversides" [...] models. Mechanically and electrically, however, the PD-4102 was mostly a carry-over model from the PD-4101, including the optional refrigeration unit for air conditioning which used a four cylinder Continental [...] "pony motor" [...] driving an Ingersoll-Rand [...] "oil-less" [...] rotary <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> rated at five tons, a unit identical to that used by the PDA-3501/PD-3751 for Greyhound Lines.

However, it used to require larger compressor size due to the lower fluid density compared with conventional refrigerants such as R 410 A.

40|$|Heat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular, but poor electricity generating efficiency limits the potential energy savings of electrically powered units. Thus the work reported in this thesis concerns {{the development of a}} range of gas engine driven heat pumps for industrial and commercial heating applications, which recover heat from the prime mover, normally rejected to waste. Despite the convenience of using proprietary engine heat recovery packages, investigations have highlighted the necessity to ensure the engine and the heat recovery equipment are compatible. A problem common •to all air source heat pumps is the formation of frost on the evaporator, which must be removed periodically, with the expenditure of energy, to ensure the continued operation of the plant. An original fluidised bed defrosting mechanism is proposed, which prevents the build-up of this frost, and also improves system performance. Criticisms have been levelled against the rotary sliding <b>vane</b> <b>compressor,</b> in particular the effects of lubrication, which is essential. This thesis compares the rotary sliding <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> with other machines, and concludes that many of these criticisms are unfounded.

This methodology was subsequently tested on an industrial <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> comparing the results of oil free and oil injected simulations set up in the ANSYS CFX solver.

40|$|Frequently, the {{dynamics}} of a compressor’s mechanism can be simplified and better understood by analyzing compressor’s equivalent linkage. Although the equivalent linkage of a reciprocating piston compressor is well known, the equivalent linkages {{of other types of}} compressors are not. For example, it is not well understood that the equivalent linkage of a rolling piston compressor is also the same slider-crank mechanism as the one of a reciprocating piston compressor. The difference between reciprocating piston compressor and the rolling piston compressor is that it is the connecting rod that compresses gas in the cylindrical chamber. If the contact between the rolling piston and the vane is flat, the equivalent linkage is the Scotch-Yoke mechanism. The difference between the two equivalent linkages of the same type of compressor is in the type of contact between the vane and the rolling piston. The equivalent linkage of a rotary <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> is the rocker arm mechanism. The equivalent linkage of a scroll compressor has two degrees of freedom and it has Oldham Ring. The equivalent linkages of other types of compressor mechanisms can be readily found by using approach presented in the paper.

40|$|AbstractThe {{current work}} {{presents}} an experimental characterization of a pressure swirl nozzle {{that is used}} to spray the lubricant in positive displacement vane compressors such that the overall convective heat transfer between oil droplets and air is able to lower the specific energy consumption of the machine, bringing the closed volume compression phase towards an isothermal transformation. An experimental test bench was designed and built to reproduce the compressor operating conditions. Tests at different injection pressures and temperatures allowed to estimate some macroscopic features of the spray, namely break-up length and cone spray angle. In particular, measurements showed that while break-up length decreased at high pressure and temperature up to 3. 1 mm at 65 °C and 10 barg, the cone aperture tended to diverge from the nominal value of 80 ° up to 106 °. Furthermore, measurements with a laser diffractometric particle size analyzer allowed to retrieve the droplet size distribution and to estimate a key parameter for the heat transfer capabilities of the spray, namely the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD). At 55 °C and 9 barg the droplet size distribution fitted a Rosin Rammler function with shape parameter of 1. 87 and scale parameter of 228 μm while the spray SMD was 122 μm. In these operating conditions, a series of nozzles equally distributed along the closed volume compression phase of a mid-size industrial <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> would lead to specific power savings up to 0. 3 kW/(m 3 /min), that corresponds to 20 - 25 % of the saving potential achievable considering an isothermal compression.

However, the oil injection could produce an additional effect during the compression phase with a great saving potential from the energetic point of view. Being the air inside the cell at a higher temperature than the oil injected, a cooling effect could be achieved so decreasing the mechanical power required for the compression. At the moment, the oil is introduced inside the compressor vanes through a series of simple holes that are only able to produce solid jets. In this way any effective heat transfer is prevented, as demonstrated by p-V measurements inside the cells during the compression phase. In the current study, a theoretical model of a sprayed oil injection technology was developed and further experimentally validated. The oil was injected along the axial length of the compressor through a number of pressure swirl atomizers which produced a very fine spray. The conservation equations, solved with a Lagrangian approach, allowed to track the droplets evolution from the injection until the impingement onto the metallic surfaces of the vanes. The theoretical approach assessed the cooling effect due to the high surface to volume ratio of the droplets and a reduction of the indicated power was predicted. The model validation was carried out through a test campaign on an mid-size sliding <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> equipped with a series of pressure swirl injectors. The reconstruction of the indicator diagram as well as the direct measurements of torque and revolution speed revealed a reduction of the mechanical power absorbed close to 7 % using an injection pressure of 20 bar. The model is in a satisfactory agreement with the tests and it also confirms the experimental trends available in the literature. A parametric analysis on the injection pressure and temperature and on the cone spray angle was eventually carried out in order to identify an optimal set of operating injection parameters...|$|E

The increasing demand to reduce fuel burn, hence CO 2 emissions, from the gas turbine requires efficient diffusion to reduce the system pressure loss in the combustor. However, interactions between prediffuser and combustor can {{have a significant effect on}} diffuser performance. For example, the consequence of increased fuel injector flow at a dump gap set using conventional design guidelines has been shown (Walker, A. D., Carrotte, J. F., and McGuirk, J. J., 2007. “Compressor/Diffuser/Combustor Aerodynamic Interactions in Lean Module Combustors,” ASME Turbo Expo 2007 —Power for Land Sea and Air, Paper No. GT 2007 - 27872) to introduce a destabilizing interaction between fuel injector and upstream components. The present paper concentrates on examining the effects of increased dump gap. Dump gap ratios of 0. 8, 1. 2, and 1. 6 were employed, with each test utilizing the same inlet guide <b>vane,</b> <b>compressor</b> rotor, integrated outlet guide vane (OGV) /prediffuser, and dump geometry. The flow fraction of compressor efflux entering the combustor cowl was set to be representative of lean combustors (50 – 70 %). Measurements were made on a fully annular rig using a generic flame tube with metered cowl and inner/outer annulus flows. The results demonstrate that, with fixed cowl flow, as the dump gap increases, component interactions decrease. At a dump gap ratio of 0. 8, the proximity of the flame tube influences the prediffuser providing a beneficial blockage effect. However, if increased to 1. 2, this beneficial effect is weakened and the prediffuser flow deteriorates. With further increase to 1. 6, the prediffuser shows strong evidence of separation. Hence, at the dump gaps probably required for lean module injectors, it is unlikely the prediffuser will be influenced beneficially by the flame tube blockage; this must be taken into account in the design. Furthermore, with small dump gaps and high cowl flow fraction, the circumferential variation in cowl flow can feed upstream and cause OGV/rotor forcing. At larger dump gaps, the circumferential variation does not penetrate upstream to the OGV, and the rotor is unaffected. The optimum dump gap and prediffuser design for best overall aerodynamic system performance from rotor through to feed annuli is a compromise between taking maximum advantage of upstream blockage effects and minimizing any 3 D upstream forcing...|$|E

The compressor consisted of seventeen stages of blading, eight carried on the inner drum, rotating at full engine speed, and nine on the outer drum which rotated {{in the opposite direction}} at 0.5:1 engine speed. Although extremely complicated mechanically, a compressor efficiency of 80% was expected with a very credible pressure ratio of 8:1. For comparison, typical engines of the era offered pressure ratios on the order of 3.5:1.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{initially}} a private venture put {{forward for the}} English Electric Canberra. Originally known as the AJ.65 for Axial Jet, 6,500 lbf the engine {{was based on an}} initial project concept by Alan Arnold Griffith. which combined an axial compressor with a combustion system and single-stage turbine using principles proven in the Rolls-Royce Nene engine. The Avon design team was initially headed by Stanley Hooker assisted by Geoff Wilde until the development of the engine was moved from Barnoldswick to Derby in 1948 and Hooker subsequently left the company, moving to Bristol Engines. Design had started in 1945 and the first engine ran on March 25, 1947, with a 12-stage compressor. The engine was difficult to start, would not accelerate and broke first-stage blades. Two-position inlet guide <b>vanes</b> and <b>compressor</b> bleed were among the design changes which allowed the engine, as the RA.2, to run a 25-hour test and fly in the two outboard positions on the converted Avro Lancastrian military serial VM732, from Hucknall on August 15, 1948.|$|R
