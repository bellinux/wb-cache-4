Athletes can be included in this population, in particular cyclists who {{are exposed to}} vibration due to the irregularity of the road. This nuisance depends of the duration of exposure and the range of vibrations. While the worker is mostly directly excited by a vibrating system, the cyclist is indirectly subjected to it. He undergoes the vibrations of an excited sub-structure which is the bicycle. So the bicycle plays the role of a <b>vibration</b> <b>filter</b> or amplifier. In this paper we propose to (i) study the transmission of vibrations to the cyclist after excitation on a paving road, (ii) calculate the limit time of exposure to this type of excitation rate by the use of the standard ISO 5349 and the European directive 2002 / 44 /EC, and (iii) compare the weighting curve of the standard with a vibrations transmissibility curve obtained between the collarbone and the stem. For this particular case of an excited sub-structure, a weighting curve is proposed by considering the first modal frequency of the bicycle...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} {{experiments on}} the control of a helicopter gearbox hybrid electromagnetic suspension. As {{the new generation of}} helicopters includes variable engine revolutions per minute (RPMs) during flight, it becomes relevant to add active control to their suspension systems. Most active system performance derives directly from the controller construction, its optimization to the system controlled, and the disturbances expected. An investigation on a feedback and feedforward filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) control applied to an active DAVI suspension has been made to optimize it in terms of narrow-band disturbance rejection. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of a new hybrid active suspension by combining the advantages of two different approaches in vibration control: resonant absorbers and active suspensions. Here, a hybrid active suspension based on the passive <b>vibration</b> <b>filter</b> called DAVI is developed. The objective {{of this paper is to}} prove the relevancy of coupling a resonant vibration absorber with a control actuator in order to create an active suspension with larger bandwidth efficiency and low energy consumption.

40|$|Objective: Proximal and whole-body {{vibrations}} {{are well}} studied in seismocardiography and ballistocardiography, yet distal vibrations are still poorly understood. In this paper we develop two methods to measure aortic valve opening (AVO) and closing (AVC) from distal vibrations. Methods: AVO and AVC were detected for each heartbeat with accelerometers {{on the upper}} arm (A), wrist (W), and knee (K) of 22 consenting adults following isometric exercise. Exercise-induced changes were recorded with impedance cardiography, and nine-beat ensemble averaging was applied. Our first method, FilterBCG, detects peaks in distal <b>vibrations</b> after <b>filtering</b> with individually-tuned bandpass filters while RidgeBCG uses ridge regression to estimate AVO and AVC without peaks. Pseudocode is provided. Results: In agreement with recent studies, {{we did not find}} peaks at AVO and AVC in distal vibrations, and the conventional R-J interval method from the literature also correlated poorly with AVO (r 2 = 0. 22 A, 0. 14 W, 0. 12 K). Interestingly, distal <b>vibrations</b> <b>filtered</b> with FilterBCG resembled seismocardiogram signals and yielded reliable peaks at AVO (r 2 = 0. 95 A, 0. 94 W, 0. 77 K) and AVC (r 2 = 0. 92 A, 0. 89 W, 0. 68 K). Conclusion: FilterBCG measures AVO and AVC accurately from arm, wrist, and knee vibrations, and it outperforms R-J intervals and RidgeBCG. Significance: To our knowledge, this study is the first to measure AVC accurately from distal vibrations.

When such reference velocity is positive, the stiffness is reduced; when it is negative, the stiffness is increased.

Mostly the problems faced by them are physical problems. One of the main physical problems faced by them is a Tremor Disease. A Tremor {{is a type of}} shaking movement of one or more parts of the body. Many Tremors don???t have any cure. Treatment for Tremor depends upon the accurate diagnosis of the cause. Some of the tremors will respond to the treatment in the underlying condition. In the psychogenic tremor case while treating the patients can cause the tremor to disappear. Several forms of tremors can be treated by a symptomatic drug therapy. Tremor patients have difficulties in performing the most common, daily tasks. Tremor is one of the mostly found ???Common abnormal involuntary movements??? and can affect any part of the body like hands, legs, arms, vocal cords, trunk, head and face. But tremors could mostly occur in the hands. The Vibration Pen Tracer is a devise which is used to scan the hand written characters and patterns of Tremor patients.

40|$|The {{presence}} of structural discreteness and periodicity {{can affect the}} propagation of phonons, sound, and other mechanical waves. A fundamental property {{of many of the}} periodic structures and materials designed for this purpose is the {{presence of}} complete band gaps in their dispersion relation. Waves with frequencies in the band gap cannot propagate and are reflected by the material. Like the concept of a band gap, the functionality of these periodic structures has historically been based on concepts from linear dynamics. Nonlinear systems can offer increased flexibility over linear systems including new ways to localize energy, convert energy between frequencies, and tune the response of the system. Granular crystals are arrays of elastic particles that interact nonlinearly via Hertzian contact, and are a type of nonlinear periodic structure whose response to dynamic excitations can be tuned to encompass linear, weakly nonlinear, and strongly nonlinear regimes. Drawing on ideas from condensed matter physics and nonlinear science, this thesis focuses on how the nonlinearity and structural discreteness of granular crystals can be used to control mechanical energy. The dynamic response of one-dimensional granular crystals composed of compressed elastic spheres (or cylinders) is studied using a combination of experimental, numerical, and analytical techniques. The discovery of fundamental physical phenomena occurring in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes is described, along with how such phenomena can be used to create new ways to control the propagation of mechanical wave energy. The specific mechanisms investigated include tunable frequency band gaps, discrete breathers, nonlinear localized defect modes, and bifurcations. These mechanisms are utilized to create novel devices for tunable <b>vibration</b> <b>filtering,</b> energy harvesting and conversion, and tunable acoustic rectification...|$|R

These elements consist often of siliceous bonded coarse grained silicon carbide. A stable long term operation of the filter elements leads to the demands on good resistance towards thermal, mechanical and chemical loading. The structure of ceramic filter elements consists usually of a highly porous support which ensures the mechanical strength and a layer which operates as the functional part for the particle removal. Thereby the lifetime of the whole element is mainly determined by the lifetime of the support material and not by the functional layer. The durability of the support is limited in principal by materials degradations leading to a decrease of mechanical properties.
