5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
