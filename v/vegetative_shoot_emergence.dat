40|$|A Russian {{knapweed}} (Acroptilon repens) shoot culture system, initiated from shoot tip culture, {{was used}} to generate a source of host plant tissue for the rearing of the nematode Subanguina picridis, a biocontrol agent for Russian knapweed. Young shoots growing on solid B 5 G medium in petri dishes developed galls on leaves, petioles, and shoot tips 7 days after release of 50 nematodes {{onto the surface of}} the medium. After 3 months of culturing, each petri dish yielded 7, 000 - 10, 000 nematodes. In vitro cultured Subanguina picridis were virulent on greenhouse-grown Russian knapweed plants. Galls were first found on seedlings 12 days after infestation; after 2 months, 90 % of seedlings were galled on leaves, petioles, and shoot tips, with 1 - 6 galls per seedling.

For persistent supercooling of certain plant parts ice barriers {{are necessary to}} prevent the entry of ice from already frozen tissues. The reproductive shoot of Calluna vulgaris is able to supercool down to below - 22 °C throughout all developmental stages (shoot elongation, flowering, fruiting) despite an established xylem conductivity. After localization of the persistent ice barrier between the reproductive and <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> {{at the base of}} the pedicel by infrared differential thermal analysis, the currently unknown structural features of the ice barrier tissue were anatomically analyzed on cross and longitudinal sections. The ice barrier tissue was recognized as a 250 μm long constriction zone {{at the base of the}} pedicel that lacked pith tissue and intercellular spaces. Most cell walls in this region were thickened and contained hydrophobic substances (lignin, suberin, and cutin). A few cell walls had what appeared to be thicker cellulose inclusions. In the ice barrier tissue, the area of the xylem was as much as 5. 7 times smaller than in <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots</b> and consisted of tracheids only. The mean number of conducting units in the xylem per cross section was reduced to 3. 5 % of that in <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots.</b> Diameter of conducting units and tracheid length were 70 % and 60 % (respectively) of that in <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots.</b> From <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots</b> water transport into the ice barrier must pass pit membranes that are likely impermeable to ice. Pit apertures were about 1. 9 μm x 0. 7 μm, which was significantly smaller than in the <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot.</b> The peculiar anatomical features of the xylem at the base of the pedicel suggest that the diameter of pores in pit membranes could be the critical constriction for ice propagation into the persistently supercooled reproductive shoots of C. vulgaris...|$|R

Our study {{describes}} the changes in vertical distribution of shoot density, leaf area index (LAI) and biomass of Z. caulescens from summer (flowering season) to autumn (preparing for overwintering) in Funakoshi Bay. The samples were collected from a 0. 5 × 0. 5 m quadrat at depths of 4. 4 m, 10. 9 m, 13. 3 m, 14. 3 m and 15. 3 m in July, and, for October, at 5. 4 m, 7. 4 m, 9. 2 m, 12. 9 m, and 15. 7 m. Above- and below-ground biomass, and flowering and <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> densities decreased with increasing bottom depth in both summer and autumn seasons except at the shallowest sampling depth, while the maximum above-ground biomass in both seasons was 187. 3 gDW/m^ 2 at the depth of 7. 4 m and 213. 5 gDW/m^ 2 at the depth of 10. 9 m, respectively. Densities of <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots</b> were greater than those of flowering shoots at each sampling depth in both seasons except a bottom depth of 15. 3 m in July. The maximum length of flowering shoots in autumn (737 cm) was greater than in summer (546 cm), {{and the range of}} shoot lengths in autumn was wider than in summer. Biomass and densities of <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots</b> at different depths in autumn were higher than those in summer, and Leaf Area Indices (LAI) of flowering and <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots</b> at different depths in summer were higher than those in autumn.

40|$|International audienceAbstract• Key messageClimate {{change will}} affect regeneration. Assisted {{migration}} is a {{climate change adaptation}} strategy {{that is associated with}} risks regarding transfer distance. Thermal time models can provide information about the synchronization of regeneration with seasons and the implications for assisted migration. • ContextClimate change may prevent trees from adapting or migrating fast enough to track their climatic envelopes. Assisted migration facilitates gene flow by sourcing pre-adapted provenances usually from southerly regions representative of future climates. • AimThe aims were to develop thermal time models for the germination and <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence</b> of two provenances of Quercus robur and to predict the impact of assisted migration on the synchronization of regeneration with seasons. • MethodsUsing cumulative germination (radicle <b>emergence)</b> and <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence</b> data from a laboratory experiment, thermal time models were developed for the seedling emergence of Q. robur. Thermal time parameters were then used with climatic data to predict the timing of germination and <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence</b> for English and Italian provenances in southern England. • ResultsThe thermal time parameters were lower for germination than <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence,</b> resulting in their temporal separation. For Italian acorns, base temperature was lower, but thermal time required was higher for germination and <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence</b> compared to English acorns indicating local adaptation. Predictions suggest little difference in the timing of germination and <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence</b> for the two provenances in the future climate of southern England (2080 s). • ConclusionsQ. robur has a robust regeneration mechanism where the thermal time parameters constrain germination and <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence</b> to safe windows and thereby ensure synchronization with seasons...|$|R
40|$|Potted lychee trees (cv.

Heating roots respective to shoots accelerated bud-break and <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence,</b> but reduced {{the level of}} floral initiation in emergent shoots. At 18 / 13 °C, root temperatures of 20 and 25 °C decreased the period of shoot dormancy from 9 weeks to 5 and 3 weeks, respectively. A root temperature of 20 °C also increased the proportion of both leafy and stunted panicles to normal leafless panicles, and {{reduced the number of}} axillary panicles accompanying each terminal panicle. A root temperature of 25 °C produced only <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots.</b> At 23 / 18 °C, heating roots increased the proportion of <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoots</b> and partially emerged buds to leafy and stunted panicles as well as accelerating bud-break. Cooling of roots in relation to the shoot resulted in non-emergence of buds at both 28 / 23 and 23 / 18 °C.

40|$|Thin layer explants {{taken from}} the pedicels and peduncles of {{flowering}} tomato plants yielded calli with great organogenetic potential. Of the 15 cultivars tested, 7 regenerated roots, shoots and eventually entire fruit-bearing plants. Calli grown on modified Murashige-Skoog medium responded to varied auxins and cytokinins with different morphogenetic patterns. Thus, naphthaleneacetic acid yielded root-producing calli, while the auxin precursor isatin (indole 2, 3 -dione) caused the production of calli with <b>vegetative</b> and floral <b>shoots,</b> rarely yielding roots. This {{may be related to}} isatin's slow, steady conversion to an active auxin (Plant Physiol 41 : 1485 - 1488, 1966) in contrast with naphthaleneacetic acid's immediate presentation of a high level of active auxin.

The Ca 2 +-dependent "egg-box" conformation {{is required for}} their activity, and polyamines may prevent them from adopting this conformation. Although OGs are known to inhibit auxin-induced growth processes, their effect on cytokinin-induced ones requires investigation. In the present work OGs were shown to promote cytokinin (benzyladenine, BA) -induced <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> formation from tobacco leaf explants, independent {{of the presence of}} CaCl 2 in the medium and of auxin (indoleacetic acid, IAA) supply. The effect of polyamines, putrescine (PU) and spermidine (SD) supplied with/without their biosynthetic inhibitors (DFMO, CHA) was also investigated, and showed that spermidine enhanced adventitious <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> formation, but only on medium containing Ca 2 + and IAA. Treatments with inhibitors blocked this promotive effect. OGs did not alter free polyamine concentrations, but caused a moderate increase of conjugated ones, and exhibited an early inhibitory effect on polyamine biosynthetic gene expression. OGs, but not SD, caused long-term changes in calcium-associated epifluorescent signals in the cell walls, and, later, inside the cells of specific tissues.

This was in spite of much higher irradiances beneath the thinned canopies, which transmitted 73 per cent more light than the unthinned stand during the summer months. Irradiances beneath the thinned stands were increased by only 13 per cent in the period during the spring when the epicormic shoots emerged from the bole of the trees, preceding expansion of the leaf canopy. When, using artificial shading, the intensity of light incident on the bole of trees in a thinned stand was reduced by 80 per cent, without affecting bark tempertures, the numbers of epicormic shoots which emerged {{was similar to that}} on unshaded trees. Epicormic <b>shoot</b> <b>emergence</b> from the boles of thinned trees was completely prevented by excluding light from the bole with aluminium foil, which also reduced bark temperatures.

The decrease in J(max) was the result of decreases in the amount of foliar nitrogen per unit leaf area, and may have been triggered by a decrease in sink activity as indicated by the increase in the hexose:sucrose ratio.

The effects of clam harvesting on the {{sexual reproduction}} of Z. noltii were investigated using both descriptive and experimental approaches. Meadows disturbed by clam harvesting were compared with undisturbed meadows in 2 sectors of the lagoon. In both sectors, disturbed meadows showed significantly lower <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> density and significantly higher reproductive effort. The reproductive effort in the western disturbed meadows was 2 -fold higher than in undisturbed meadows, whereas in eastern disturbed meadows it was 4 -fold higher. In disturbed meadows, early maturation stages were found {{until the end of}} the flowering season and higher seed production was observed. Both the negative effect of clam harvesting on Z. noltii density and the positive effect on its reproductive effort were confirmed by manipulative field experiments. Plots that were experimentally harvested during the fertile season showed significantly lower <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> density and higher reproductive effort than unharvested plots. Results suggest that Z. noltii responds to clam harvesting disturbance by both increasing its reproductive effort and extending its fertile season...|$|R
50|$|Bessey {{believed}} in the strobiloid theory of plant evolution that postulated that the Angiospermae (flowering plants) originated from Cycadophyta, and that flowers originated from a primitive <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> that developed into a structure with perianth, stamens and carpels. From this arose two lines, the Strobiloideae (or Ranalian line) with connation of like parts and the Cotyloideae (or Rosalian line) with connation of unlike parts, which he assigned as the two subclasses of monocots (called Alternifoliae by Bessey), but also of dicots (called Oppositifoliae by Bessey).|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{anatomy of}} the <b>vegetative</b> <b>shoot</b> apex, internode and node of 16 indigenous southern African Pavetta species were studied. The glandular hairs occurring in the shoot apex are described {{and the presence of}} fully developed stomata, observed in the shoot apex, pointed out. A periderm is formed in the cortex of the stem. Crystal idioblasts occur among the primary phloem fibres and sometimes in the pith of the stem. The node is unilacunar. Branches from the leaf trace supply the stipules with vascular tissue...|$|R
