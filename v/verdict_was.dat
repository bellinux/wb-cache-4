50|$|A {{narrative}} <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> a <b>verdict</b> {{available to}} coroners in England and Wales following an inquest. In such a verdict {{the circumstances of}} a death are recorded without attributing the cause to a named individual. Narrative <b>verdicts</b> <b>were</b> introduced in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The open <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> {{an option}} {{open to a}} coroner's jury at an inquest {{in the legal system}} of England and Wales. The verdict means the jury {{confirms}} the death is suspicious, but is unable to reach any other verdicts open to them. Mortality studies consider it likely that the majority of open <b>verdicts</b> <b>are</b> recorded in cases of suicide where the intent of the deceased could not be proved, although the <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> recorded in many other circumstances.|$|R
5|$|Burton {{asked that}} the jury be polled, and each stated that the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> his own. Burton moved for a new trial. Judge Adams {{indicated}} that he would accept a supersedeas bond of $5,000, and Burton was not sentenced. Burton became the first defendant ever convicted under § 1782, more than 40 years after its enactment.|$|E
5|$|Due process {{prohibits the}} {{prosecution}} from knowingly using falsehood to convict the defendant, and requires reversal {{if there is}} a reasonable likelihood that the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> affectedwhether the falsehood is inculpatory or goes the credibility of a witness.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo and its licensees filed counterclaims against Universal. On May 20, 1985, Judge Sweet awarded Nintendo $1.8 {{million for}} legal fees, lost revenues, and other expenses. However, he denied Nintendo's claim of damages from those licensees who had paid {{royalties}} to both Nintendo and Universal. Both parties appealed this judgment, but the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> upheld on July 15, 1986.|$|E

5|$|On 12 December 1997, the World Motorsport Council {{ruled that}} the mayor of Jerez, Pedro Pacheco, {{disrupted}} the podium ceremony. Originally, the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> that no further Formula One races would occur at the track. However, when Mr Pacheco appeared before the WMSC, this ruling was rescinded.|$|E
5|$|The judge, Fray Domingo de Soto, {{summarised}} the arguments. Sepúlveda addressed Las Casas's {{arguments with}} twelve refutations, which were again countered by Las Casas. The judges then deliberated on the arguments presented {{for several months}} before coming to a verdict. The <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> inconclusive, and both debaters claimed that they had won.|$|E
5|$|A letter dated 26 September 1985 {{from the}} {{assistant}} director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Bamber suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and for a further offence of selling cannabis. She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E

5|$|Amid the {{continuing}} uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. The Royal Commission {{concluded that the}} guilty <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against {{the handling of the}} matter—including Dunstan—thought that Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration, while bringing much publicity to Dunstan.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> read.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1987, Wood {{was convicted}} on {{two counts of}} murder, one of {{attempted}} murder and one of theft, after a week-long trial. He had {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder of Danielle, instead submitting a manslaughter plea claiming he killed her to complete a suicide pact. An appeal against the guilty <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> filed a month later and rejected in 1989. The case impacted upon British firearms policy, especially the manner in which regional police forces communicate over firearm ownership.|$|E
50|$|The coroner's former {{power to}} name {{a suspect in the}} inquest verdict and commit then for trial has been abolished. The coroner's <b>verdict</b> {{sometimes}} <b>is</b> persuasive for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, but normally proceedings in the coroner's court are suspended until after the final outcome of any criminal case is known. More usually, a coroner's <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> also relied upon in civil proceedings and insurance claims. The coroner commonly tells the jury which <b>verdicts</b> <b>are</b> lawfully available in a particular case.|$|R

5000|$|A general <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> one {{in which}} the jury makes a {{complete}} finding and single conclusion on all issues presented to it.

5|$|On August 26, the {{day after}} the guilty <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> reached by the jury, Judge Roan brought counsel into private {{chambers}} and sentenced Leo Frank to death by hanging with the date set to October 10. The defense team issued a public protest, alleging that public opinion unconsciously influenced the jury to the prejudice of Frank. This argument was carried forward throughout the appeal process.|$|E
5|$|Sweet {{ruled that}} Universal had acted in bad faith by {{threatening}} Nintendo's licensees {{and that it}} had no right over the name King Kong or the characters and story. He further held that there was no possibility for consumers to confuse Nintendo's game and characters with the King Kong films and their characters. Universal appealed the case, but the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> upheld.|$|E
5|$|Winchester was {{the only}} {{defendant}} to face trial on the charges. Winchester's lawyer argued that Smith was guilty of verbal assault against the defendant, and Winchester was found not guilty.

40|$|I ask if, in {{a dynamic}} general {{equilibrium}} setting, {{one can make}} sense of the so-called "Austrian Theory of Money and Credit". The <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous.

Also in this case, the <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous...|$|R
5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty verdict on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, were sentenced {{to a total of}} 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. The jury had been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a piece of glass in the Court when the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> delivered.|$|E
5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} {{repeated}} calls for reform, most arguing for a move to only two <b>verdicts.</b> However, there <b>are</b> several issues and no consensus. Some of the arguments against the third <b>verdict</b> <b>are</b> ...|$|R
