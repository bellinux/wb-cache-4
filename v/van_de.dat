5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings of dhows {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner. The genre of marine art became especially important in the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, with works showing the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess. Artists such as Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Jan <b>van</b> <b>de</b> Cappelle, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem <b>van</b> <b>de</b> Velde the Elder and his son, Ludolf Bakhuizen and Reinier Nooms created maritime paintings {{in a wide variety of}} styles. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa showing the destructive force of the sea at the same time as its ever-changing beauty. The 19th century Romantic artist Ivan Aivazovsky created some 6,000 paintings, the majority of which depict the sea.|$|E

5|$|Borobudur {{attracted}} {{attention in}} 1885, when Yzerman, the Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about the hidden foot. Photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot {{were made in}} 1890–1891. The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government {{to take steps to}} safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an art historian, Theodoor van Erp, a Dutch army engineer officer, and <b>Van</b> <b>de</b> Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.|$|E
5|$|Certain diamond {{enhancement}} {{techniques are}} commonly used to artificially produce an array of colors, including blue, green, yellow, red, and black. Color enhancement techniques usually involve irradiation, including proton bombardment via cyclotrons; neutron bombardment in the piles of nuclear reactors; and electron bombardment by <b>Van</b> <b>de</b> Graaff generators. These high-energy particles physically alter the diamond's crystal lattice, knocking carbon atoms out of place and producing color centers. The depth of color penetration depends on the technique and its duration, {{and in some cases}} the diamond may be left radioactive to some degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Hendrik <b>van</b> <b>de</b> Hulst {{predicted}} that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is {{not affected by}} dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift {{can be used to}} map the motion of the gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.|$|E
