The <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> <b>carburettor</b> reportedly has some problems, especially in the earlier models, such as a too rich mixture, which is caused by the too thin Teflon coating of the fuel-metering needle, which erodes over time due to friction. It also has had problems with the compensator (choke device), which can also cause overly rich mixture when not working properly.|$|E

5000|$|The Ford Fiesta Mk2 {{appeared}} {{towards the}} end of summer 1983, with a revised front end and interior; the most notable change involved the new wraparound headlights. The engine compartment was also wider, so as to accommodate a five-speed transmission and new engines. The front track accordingly increased by 33 mm (the rear track remained as on the Mk1), while the brakes and steering were also altered. At launch, the Mk2 Fiesta was only available with the familiar 957cc and 1117cc Kent Crossflow-based [...] "Valencia" [...] engine options, although they now featured <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> <b>carburettors</b> for improved fuel consumption. The more bulbous bonnet line of the Mk2 was created largely due to the need to package the taller Ford CVH engine, a 1.3 L version of which followed in 1984, and this model also featured a five-speed manual transmission for the first time. The 1.0 was only offered with the four-speed at first, while the five-speed was available as an option in the 1.1.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{in this thesis}} are to present {{a model of a}} <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> in an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system located in a heavy duty diesel engine. A new legislation called EURO~ 4 will come into force in 2005 which affects truck development and it will require an On-Board Diagnostic system in the truck. If model based diagnostic systems are to be used, one of the advantages is that the system performance will increase if a model of a <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> is used. Three models with different complexity are compared in ten different experiments. The experiments are performed in a steady flow rig at different percentage of EGR gases and venturi areas. The model predicts the mass flow through the venturi. The results show that the first model with fewer simplifications performs better and has fewer errors than the other two models. The simplifications that differ between the models are initial velocity before the venturi and the assumption of incompressible flow. The model that shows the best result is not proposed by known literature in this area of knowledge and technology. This thesis shows that further studies and work on this model, the model with fewer simplifications, can be advantageous...|$|R
5000|$|Variable-Venturi: {{in which}} the fuel jet opening is varied by the slide (which {{simultaneously}} alters air flow). In [...] "constant depression" [...] carburetors, this is done by a vacuum operated piston connected to a tapered needle which slides inside the fuel jet. A simpler version exists, most commonly found on small motorcycles and dirt bikes, where the slide and needle is directly controlled by the throttle position. The most common <b>variable</b> <b>Venturi</b> (constant depression) type carburetor is the sidedraft SU carburetor and similar models from Hitachi, Zenith-Stromberg and other makers. The UK location of the SU and Zenith-Stromberg companies helped these carburetors rise {{to a position of}} domination in the UK car market, though such carburetors were also very widely used on Volvos and other non-UK makes. Other similar designs have been used on some European and a few Japanese automobiles. These carburetors are also referred to as [...] "constant velocity" [...] or [...] "constant vacuum" [...] carburetors. An interesting variation was Ford's VV (<b>Variable</b> <b>Venturi)</b> carburetor, which was essentially a fixed Venturi carburetor with one side of the Venturi hinged and movable to give a narrow throat at low rpm and a wider throat at high rpm. This was designed to provide good mixing and airflow over a range of engine speeds, though the VV carburetor proved problematic in service.|$|R
50|$|The EEC-II {{controlled}} {{air-fuel ratio}} via the Ford proprietary model 7200 <b>Variable</b> <b>Venturi</b> (VV) Carburetor. This {{was the last}} carburetor designed and built by Ford US. It {{was considered to be}} the pinnacle of carburetor design. Air-fuel ratio was controlled by a stepper motor that operated a rack which moved a pintle that opened and closed the float bowl vent. When closed, no air could enter the bowl, causing the fuel mixture to be lean. When open, the fuel mixture was rich. While this carburetor worked well, it was extremely expensive to manufacture. Each carburetor was hand-calibrated in a pressure controlled room.|$|R

50|$|In 1986, Toyota {{introduced}} the slightly larger third generation Tercel {{with a new}} 12-valve engine which featured a <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> carburetor, and later models with EFI. From this generation on, the engine is mounted transversely, with the transmission mounted {{on the right side}} of the engine in a layout developed by Dante Giacosa and earlier popularised in such vehicles as the Fiat 128 and Volkswagen Golf. Other improvements included revised rack-and-pinion steering and a newly designed, fully independent suspension. The Tercel continued in North America as Toyota's least expensive vehicle, while it was no longer offered in Europe. In other markets, the smaller Starlet was also offered.|$|R
50|$|The Quadrajet {{carburetor}} {{was actually}} a derivative of a <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> carburetor called the DOVE (diaphragm operated variable entrance) which {{was developed in the}} 1961-63 time frame at Rochester Products. Testing at the GM test facility in Arizona uncovered a hot engine percolation problem which resulted in hot start difficulties because of flooded engines. Production of the DOVE, which was underway in 1963 when the hot start problem was identified, was suspended and a crash project was initiated to fix the problem. Simultaneously a second crash project was initiated to develop a modified DOVE which became the Quadrajet. Prototype Quadrajet carburetors were in test at Rochester Products by the Fall of 1963. The DOVE hot-start problem was corrected but not in a timely enough manner; the production DOVEs were destroyed and the Quadrajet took its place.|$|R
50|$|In European style systems, {{the size}} and shape of the <b>venturi</b> of the <b>carburettor</b> is {{designed}} to match the converter.

In both cases, the components are matched by the manufacturers and only basic adjustments are needed during installation and tuning.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{were taken}} by {{surprise}} when the downsized GM cars {{proved to be an}} enormous sales success and along with the event of CAFE regulations, they were forced to follow suit. Unlike the Chrysler R platform, the Ford Panther platform was completely new from the ground up. The LTD and Marquis lost nearly 15 inches in length and some 400 pounds of curb weight without a significant loss of interior space over the old 1969-vintage platform. Like GM's [...] "downsized" [...] 1977 big cars, the new 1979 LTD featured a trimmer body profile, more nimble handling due to its smaller size, and better fuel economy. Big-block engines were gone and the small 302 V8 became standard, with the bigger 351 V8 being optional (standard on station wagons). However, due to CAFE requirements, the 351 was dropped in 1981 except for police vehicles. For 1981 and 1982, to further improve fuel economy (while avoiding diesel or 6-cylinder engines), Ford introduced a 255 cuin L variant of the Windsor V8. The 255 proved an unreliable and unpopular choice; at 115 hp, its output was ill-suited for the LTD's two-ton curb weight. In 1979-81, LTDs were available with an <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> carburetor, but they proved unreliable and were quickly dropped. Despite teething troubles with Ford's engine induction systems, the redesigned LTD was a sales success for both passenger and fleet sales.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{incorporating}} a newly designed mixer into the existing carburetor of conventional motorcycle {{is the main}} objective {{of the development of}} natural gas motorcycle fuel system. In a bi-fuel motorcycle, the carburetor still plays a vital role in switching from fuel gas to petrol mode operation and vice-versa. The carburetor is {{the most important part of}} the fuel system of a motorcycle. All motorcycle engines carry <b>variable</b> <b>venturi</b> jet carburetors. The basic operation of the carburetor mainly depends on the restriction barrel called the venturi. When airflows through the venturi, its speed increases and its pressure decreases. Gasoline in its liquid state does not burn readily in the combustion chamber; only gas does. That is where the carburetor plays its part by atomizing the gasoline into mist in the air stream in order to burn efficiently in the combustion chamber. The decisive advantage of the prototype mixer now under development is that it does not require any atomizing process as the inlet fuel is in gas form. The main challenge focuses on designing a mixing device which mixes the supplied gas with the incoming air at an optimum ratio. In order to surmount the identified problems, the way fuel gas and air flow in the mixer have to be analyzed. In this case, the Computational Fluid Dynamics or CFD approach is applied in the design of the prototype mixer. The present work is aimed at further understanding of the air and fuel flow structure by performing CFD studies using a commercially available FLUENT code...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} selection of the engine for Formula SAE car. This dissertation also documents the design and testing of the intake manifold, exhaust system, carburettor and the intake restrictor for the USQ Motorsport Formula SAE engine. Before selecting the engine thorough research into all types of engines and designs was carried out. Once the type of engine that was suitable for the Formula SAE competition was determined, all of the parameters that impacted on {{the selection of}} the engine were analysed. To accurately predict which engine was the 'optimum engine' a model of the Formula SAE car's acceleration performance was created and the calculations were undertaken using Matlab. The engine that was purchased for the Formula SAE car was sourced from a 600 cc water-cooled motorcycle. Once the engine had been purchased it was possible to design the fuelling system for the Formula SAE car. In this project the fuelling system incorporated the method of aspiration, fuel mixture preparation system, the intake manifold, the intake restrictor and the exhaust system. A feasibility study that encompassed forced air induction systems for the Formula SAE car was carried out and the utilisation of multi-point fuel injection was also examined. However due to budgetary restraints neither of these systems were feasible. Therefore it was decided that the engine would be naturally aspirated and carburetted. The merits of fixed <b>venturi</b> <b>carburettors</b> and constant velocity carburettors were explored in order to select the most suitable type of carburettor for the Formula SAE engine. Research was carried out in order to find the intake manifold configuration that best suited the Formula SAE car. The USQ workshop was also liased with during the initial design period {{in order to ensure that}} the machining capabilities at the USQ could produce the required design. In order to determine if the final design of the intake manifold was feasible a prototype manifold was constructed. In order to design the restrictor various standards that are used to design flow measurement devices were incorporated. Several prototype restrictors were constructed and tested using an airflow bench. The design of the exhaust system was also investigated. It was found that the best solution in regards to the exhaust system was to retain the original exhaust manifold and purchase an aftermarket muffler. As the project developed it became clear that cooling requirements of the engine were a concern. For this reason experimental procedures were devised to determine if the original motorcycle radiator would be sufficient. Because all of the components that were designed or specified in this project are part of a system they were tested together, on the engine. Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain any meaningful test results. The reason for this was that the rest of the car was not at a stage of completion that would allow testing on dynamometer. For this reason, at the time of writing, it is uncertain whether the systems that were designed in this project matches the design criteria, which are outlined in chapter 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” Modern {{passenger}} vehicles with gasoline engines {{are provided with}} different compensating devices for fuel air mixture supply.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate and compare the performance and emission characteristics of the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) -fuelled engine generator and the conventional gasoline-fuelled engine generator. The approach involves converting a gasoline engine generator, commonly used in Malaysian night markets to generate electricity, to the LPG engine generator. A four-stroke SI single-cylinder engine is equipped with an LPG injection system with minor modifications and then tested with both LPG and gasoline fuels. A <b>venturi</b> mixer (<b>carburettor)</b> was designed and in house constructed and then installed to deliver a proper A/F ratio to the combustion chamber. The commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT was used for simulation of air flow inside the mixer. The converted engine was tested at constant speed for its brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), efficiency, exhaust temperature, and exhaust gas emissions. The results show that the performance and emission characteristics of the LPG-fuelled engine are well suited for use in night markets. Average BSFC and average efficiency for the LPG engine over a range of loads were quite similar to those for the gasoline engine: the average BSFC was 0. 95 kg/kWh for the LPG engine and 1 kg/kWh for the gasoline engine. The lower energy content of LPG causes only a slight reduction in efficiency as 17 per cent reduction in average efficiency was recorded over the entire load range; however, the LPG engine fared better at higher loads than the gasoline engine for which only as low as 4 per cent reduction was recorded at high loads. Emission testsseemto verify the minimal pollution products; there are significant reductions in the emission concentration results when LPG is used. Average decreases of 32 per cent for nitrogen oxide, 10 per cent for carbon dioxide, and 40 per cent for carbon monoxide were recorded. However, higher values of hydrocarbon were recorded, but as high as 50 per cent reduction in HC was found for loads higher than 700 W. The study verified the more favourable features ofLPGcompared to gasoline as it is one of the best alternative fuels to gasoline for spark-ignition engine generators to solve the air pollution problem in night markets...|$|R
