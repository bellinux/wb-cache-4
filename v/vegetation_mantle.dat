40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the effects of wild land fires on the vegetation cover, the physicochemical properties and the seed-bank of the soil in Albaja area, White Nile state. The area lies between latitudes 31 ° 36 ́ – 14 ° 10 ́ N and longitudes 31 ° 45 ́ - 32 ° 23 ́ E, and is subjected to large scale wild land fires (40 % of the total area burns annually). The area was divided into eight sectors according to the number of fire burning frequencies through the analysis of satellite imagery (MODIS). Accordingly, the area was delineated into 8 burning frequency plots (zero-, one-, two-, three-, four-, five-, six- and seven-times burn). Forty soil samples were taken at 30 cm depth, 5 samples in each sector. Eight soil profiles were dug and described in each sector. Vegetation index data were collected during the field work from 10 to 17 May 2007. The soils in Albaja area are infertile sandy loams (Aridisol). Their texture is mainly composed of sand particles (> 68 %) which make them easily workable even by simple hand made implements. Albeit, the soils possess good physical characteristics, yet their chemistry is too poor to support the growth of dense <b>vegetation</b> <b>mantle.</b> Thus the vegetation consists of sparse trees with intervening thin cover of seasonal grasses. The seasonally recurring wildfires have no IX pronounced effects on the soils; this is true for both their physicochemical characteristics and the seed-bank. No {{significant differences were found between}} the plots of different burning frequencies. The seed bank content of the soil is considerable, the amount of the seeds ranged between 445. 2 and 1049. 4 million seeds/ha; among which the sound seeds ranged between 95. 4 and 477 million seeds/ha and the dead seeds ranged between 349. 8 and 572. 4 million seeds/ha. Very little germination of the seeds in the nursery and the laboratory conditions was obtained, which might be due to the failure to break the seed dormancy under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation discusses the sedimentology and dynamics of selected, modern and ancient clastic depositional systems (alluvial fans and colluvial aprons) at continental basin margins. The focus on single depositional systems gave {{the opportunity to}} devote particular attention to sedimentary processes and interactions {{on the basis of}} detailed field observations. The recent emphasis on modelling, remote sensing and basin-scale analysis in sedimentary geology provides large amounts of raw and conceptual data, but to the cost of gradually losing touch with the complexity of real natural processes. In view of the many long-standing misconceptions and generalizations in the literature on terrestrial proximal depositional systems, the work presented herein demonstrates that a field-based approach is the most reliable answer to still open questions. The Neogene intermontane Teruel Basin (central Spain) was chosen to investigate ancient alluvial-fan successions because of its exceptional outcrops, the complete preservation of sedimentary events in an endorheic setting, and the high-resolution chronologies and paleoclimatic context available from previous cyclostratigraphic research on mudflat and ephemeral lacustrine deposits. Detailed correlations between these and alluvial-fan strata sourced by the adjacent basin margin show that orbitally forced climate change could regulate sedimentation not only in low-energy basinal settings, but also in a high-energy, high-gradient alluvial fan. Phase relationships between interfingering fan-mudflat strata and insolation curves demonstrate that, during the last stages of fan development, debris-flow events with the highest sediment loads took place during transitions from relatively arid to humid climate. Such events were probably related to adjustments in catchment hydrology and sediment yield under increasing seasonality and precipitation, which destabilized highland slopes but before the widespread establishment of a <b>vegetation</b> <b>mantle.</b> However, facies analysis of the entire extent of the fan succession shows a longer-term control of basement geology on processes and architecture. In particular, the availability of carbonate versus clay-rich clastic source rocks in the catchment was fundamental in determining the dominance of hyperconcentrated sheetfloods or cohesive debris-flows during different phases of fan aggradation. Analysis of an extensive colluvial depositional system along the coast of the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) shows an even stronger dependence of processes and depositional architectures on the morphology and geographic orientation of different piedmont sectors. However, the strike-oriented variability in the relative importance of different mass-flow processes and the influence of aeolian deposition over active slope surfaces are not always perfectly reflected in the corresponding stratigraphic products, because the preservation of local colluvium is strongly tied to the surface hydrology of the slopes, which also varies with piedmont morphology. General stratigraphic models of proximal deposystems in terrestrial settings have not yet been satisfactorily developed, probably owing to the extraordinary spatial and especially temporal variability of basement and catchment controls exerted on sedimentary processes and architectural evolution. Nonetheless, it is clear that prediction of subsurface stratigraphic patterns in the rock record, and geohazard prediction in modern settings, can be significantly enhanced by careful consideration of the geologic context in which these depositional systems form...|$|E
40|$|Gerald W. Williams CollectionThe {{boreal forest}} of North America is {{especially}} liable to destruction by fires. It is a region in which forest fires {{have been extremely}} common and wide spreading. Lightning {{is certainly one of}} the causes of fires but man, both aboriginal and white, has been an even more prolific source. The general attitude of aboriginal man toward fire was that of carelessness. Campfires were in general use and the evidence is that they were not carefully extinguished but frequently started forest fires. Use of fire in signaling was widespread and must have been a major source of forest fires. Wherever the birch bark canoe was used, frequent gumming of sewn seams was necessary along with repairs of cracks or tears in the bark. This necessitated making a fire for heating and applying the gum; the evidence is that this use of fire at least occasionally lead to fires in the forest. Fires were at times used in hunting but this practice probably was not an important source of forest burning. On some occasions, at least, aboriginal man seems to have employed fire in warfare but evidence on this use is scanty. In his efforts to combat mosquitoes and gnats, aboriginal man generally employed fire and smoke and this led to frequent forest fires. Of the miscellaneous uses of fire by aboriginal man that occasionally must have led to forest burning the following seem most worthy oi mention: clearing away of forest growth, cutting down trees, cutting up of trunks of fallen, or felled trees and killing trees for a supply of dry fuel. It seems certain that even prior to contact with white man, aboriginal man was responsible for frequent and widespread fires in the boreal forest. White man was, without doubt, the cause of even more fires in the boreal forest than was aboriginal man. He was generally careless and possessed easier means of striking fire. Campfires left without being extinguished resulted in a tremendous amount of forest burning. The frequent practice of setting fires to provide a supply of dry fuelwood likewise led to much forest destruction. Fires set to combat the mosquito pest were so frequently a cause of forest burning that it was commonly said that "mosquitoes cause more fires than any other one thing. " Use of fire in signaling was not confined to the natives; the practice was also employed by white man and is known to have resulted in extensive forest fires. White man also adopted, at least occasionally, the practice of using fire in hunting. He burned off the forest to promote the growth of grass for his livestock, and he employed fire in clearing land. Prospectors were known to burn the forest to remove the <b>vegetation</b> <b>mantle</b> and expose the surface rock. Incredible as it may be, white man is also known to have set the forest afire just to see it burn or "for fun. " In the boreal forest there were many fires whose causes are unknown. Some of these must have resulted from lightning but it is likely that most of them were caused by man, either aboriginal or white. It is probable that there have been fires in the northern forests ever since there were forests to burn. Destruction of timber and other values has been enormous but the boreal forest has generally shown a remarkable capacity to recover, to rise again, phoenix-like, from its own ashes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the forest}} margins a mantle {{community}} grows, composed of many climbing plants and broad-leaved shrubs. 13 associations and 8 communities of <b>mantle</b> <b>vegetation</b> are recognized in central Honshu, and among these 18 vegetation units are classified into 3 alliances; Viti ficifoliae-Clematidion terniflorae, Clematido apiifoliae-Rubion palmati and Actinidio-Vition colgnetiae. The Viti ficifoliae-Clematidion terniflorae grows in sunny {{places in the}} coastal lowlands. The Clematido apiifoliae-Rubion palmati occurs in the semi-shaded forest margins in the lower mountains. The Actinidio-Vition coignetiae grows in true mountain areas （Fagetea crenatae region）. Three different growth forms are recognized in species of the mantle communities, the Rubus-form（ex. Rubus palmatus var. coptophyllus, Kerria japonica）, the erect form (ex. Deutzia crenata, Sambucus sieboldiana), and the climbing form (ex. Vitis cognetiae, Actinidia polygama). Both the Vitificifoliae-Clematidion terniflorae and the Actinidio-Vitioncoignetiae include communities with all three types of dominant growth form, and the growth form spectra of these communities are variable. On the other hand, the Clematido apiifoliae-Rubion palmati includes two types lacking the community dominated by the erect form, and the growth form spectra are constant...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{infrared}} spectra from both laboratory and remote sensing instruments {{were used to}} distinguish different age lava flows with varying amounts of surficial modification at Cima and Lunar Crater volcanic fields. The modification processes affecting the lava flows cause spectral differences {{that can be seen}} in remotely sensed emittance spectra from the thermal infrared multispectral scanner. Important influences on the thermal {{infrared spectra}} include aeolian <b>mantling,</b> <b>vegetation,</b> lave flow roughness, and rock varnish. Laboratory thermal infrared reflectance spectra of the subaerially exposed surfaces of 1 - 15 cm basalt fragments at Cima volcanic field show a feature attributable to rock varnish on the younger flows (0. 14 - 0. 75 m. y.) that is lacking on the older flows (greater than 0. 8 m. y.). This suggests that rock varnish is thinner on the older flows at Cima volcanic field. Scanning electron microscope images and thin sections of the different age flows at Cima volcanic field support the conclusion that rock varnish is thinner and may be eroding on the older flow surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Established {{mangrove}} forests {{along the}} coastal {{area of the}} Arabian Peninsula and African side of the Red Sea are uniquely different from mangrove forests {{in other parts of}} the world because of their low biodiversity and harsh habitat of arid and highly saline conditions. Therefore mangrove forests in this area appear in patchy and scattered patterns at mouths of wadi or in sheltered lagoons with rare and irregular flooding. Most of them are pure forests of Avicennia marina, occasionally mixed with Rhizophora mucronata in the southern part of the Red Sea. In this study, we analyze the forest structure of A. marina and discuss the regeneration strategy and the forest dynamics of this unique mangrove species. Three experimental plots of 1000 to 2000 trees/ha were selected from north to south along the Red Sea coast. The highest tree size (6. 8 m) suggested severe effects of the high salinity of the Red Sea (3. 2 to 4. 9 %) on tree growth. Dense <b>mantle</b> <b>vegetation</b> had developed at the forest edge facing the open sea to protect the forest interior against strong waves and wind. Tree growth was also prevented by severe drought on the landside edge of the forest. All the forests had a dense seedling bank throughout the forest floor, with a very high rate of turnover and regeneration, which seldom occurred in other forests...|$|R
40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{attempts}} to reconstruct vegetation and sequences of climatic change from pollen samples derived from archaeological deposits {{is the effect of}} human activity {{in the vicinity of the}} site on vegetation, and hence on the pollen rain. This problem is examined in the Cedar Mesa area of southeast Utah, region sporadicallyoccupied by Anasazi horticulturalists 700 to 1800 years ago. Pollen spectra obtained from modern soils, sediments and archaeological deposits of the region provide evidence of vegetation change in the past. Three models to explain the change in the pollen spectra and various methods to correct for possible anthropogenic disturbance representedin the pollen spectra from archaeological deposits proposed by previous investigators are examined in light of the Cedar Mesa data. The modern pollen rain of the Cedar Mesa area is a reflection of the modern-day vegetation. Differential anthesis of various species accounts for most of the seasonalvariation noted in the pollen spectra over a 4 year period. The relationship of the ratio of pine to juniper pollen (P/J) as a function of elevation was found to be not as strong as the tree ratio to elevation, but P/J averages based on plant communities suggest a stronger relationship. Absolute abundance of pollen appears to be a function of elevation in the Cedar Mesa area, butin areas of disturbed vegetation the absolute abundance of pollen varies independently of elevation. Pollen grains derived from chenopods and amaranths are relatively and in some cases absolutely most abundant in disturbed areas. The pollen of these two genera dispersesignificantly differently than arboreal pollen in that their distribution is more localized. Therefore, when interpreting pollen spectra derived from archaeologicaldeposits, they are not reliable as indicators of regional changes in the environment which might be expected to occur as the result of climatic change. An abundance of chenopod and amaranth seeds derived from archaeological contexts on Cedar Mesa and other nearby areas suggestsa heavy reliance on these genera for subsistance, further emphasizing the point that the utilization of their variation in the pollen record as regional environmentalindicators is questionable. By analyzing P/J pollen ratios and double-fixed pollen sums from archaeologically derived pollen data, itis suggested that the climate and potential vegetation of the region was not significantly different from today's. The pollen evidence does not suggest secular changes in the bi-seasonal rainfall pattern as suggested by earlier workers in the southwest. It is further inferred that the pollen profiles derived from archaeological deposits represent forest successionfollowing disturbance and abandonment by prehistoric Anasazi populations. It is quite probable that the Anasazi had a significant impact on their environment and may have upset the delicate balance between <b>vegetation,</b> soil <b>mantle</b> and runoff.
