50|$|The 1100 {{series of}} phones was {{originally}} manufactured in 2008 as an {{evolution of the}} 2004 IP phone series phones from Nortel. As such {{it began as a}} UNIStim only phone which meant that the phone was primarily supported with only Nortel manufactured <b>voice</b> <b>PBX</b> systems.|$|E
5000|$|... "9Pass": a {{multiservice}} offer targeting {{small businesses}} (3-20 employees) using customer-premises equipment to deliver basic IP <b>PBX</b> <b>voice</b> features, LAN and Internet services, managed by Neuf Cegetel or a partner.|$|R
5000|$|EoC {{is usually}} {{delivered}} as an [...] "internet facing" [...] service. EoC {{can also be}} delivered other ways. It can interface with private networking (i.e., an existing WAN, MPLS, or VPN network). Can also support SIP, PRI, analog, and hosted <b>PBX</b> <b>voice</b> services as well.|$|R
50|$|WarVOX is a {{software}} suite for exploring, classifying, and auditing telephone systems. Unlike normal wardialing tools, WarVOX processes the raw audio from each call {{and does not}} use a modem directly. This model allows WarVOX to find and classify {{a wide range of}} interesting lines, including modems, faxes, <b>voice</b> mail boxes, <b>PBXs,</b> loops, dial tones, IVRs, and forwarders using signal processing techniques.|$|R
50|$|If {{the person}} {{does not provide}} the {{necessary}} approval within a designated period of time then the business process would invoke a UC service such as “notify and respond” from an IP <b>PBX,</b> <b>voice</b> portal/IVR, conferencing application, etc. These embedded UC services would “notify” the person {{that they need to}} do something. If the person does not “respond” to the notification then it can be escalated to a manager in the same manner.|$|R
50|$|Two {{significant}} developments {{during the}} 1990s led to {{new types of}} PBX systems. One was the massive growth of data networks and increased public understanding of packet switching. Companies needed packet-switched networks for data, so using them for telephone calls proved tempting, {{and the availability of}} the Internet as a global delivery system made packet-switched communications even more attractive. These factors {{led to the development of}} the <b>voice</b> over IP <b>PBX,</b> or IP-PBX.|$|R
50|$|APC Symmetra LX {{is a line}} of {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} products, aimed at network and server applications. Symmetras come in power configurations ranging from 4 kVA to 16 kVA. Symmetras are built {{for use in a}} data center, (in a 19-inch rack for example). They include features such as integrated manageability, hot-swappability, user replaceable power, battery and intelligence modules. Typical applications include web and other application servers, IP based and traditional <b>PBX</b> <b>voice</b> solutions, and enterprise type network switches.|$|R
50|$|Lines patched as data ports into {{a network}} switch require simple straight-through patch cables {{at each end}} to connect a computer. <b>Voice</b> patches to <b>PBXs</b> in most {{countries}} require an adapter at the remote end to translate the configuration on 8P8C modular connectors into the local standard telephone wall socket. No adapter is needed in the U.S. as the 6P2C and 6P4C plugs most commonly used with RJ11 and RJ14 telephone connections are physically and electrically compatible with the larger 8P8C socket. RJ25 and RJ61 connections are physically but not electrically compatible, and cannot be used. In the UK, an adapter must be present at the remote end as the 6-pin BT socket is physically incompatible with 8P8C.|$|R
