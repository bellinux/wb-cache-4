40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to create a}} <b>viable</b> <b>income</b> for stay-at-home mothers and wives in Atenas, Costa Rica, by organizing a cooperative which could market their handicraft products in formal markets. Before the start of this project, these women had been selling their products in informal markets to earn supplemental income for their families. The husband is typically the principle household earner, but many men are not earning enough money in their jobs to adequately provide for their families. Many women would like to earn a <b>viable</b> <b>income</b> to help provide for their families but either lack the necessary skills to work outside the home or are unable to do so due to their household and childcare responsibilities. In response, women in Atenas have been addressing this issue by sewing, painting, and making handicrafts that are sold to friends and neighbors to earn money. Supplemental income earned from these handicrafts is often insubstantial however, averaging at around 5 % of the family monthly income. This project assisted 20 women in organizing into a cooperative which is acting as a mechanism to market their products on the local and international markets as well as seek funding and obtain small business loans. The cooperative structure also acts as a social network for community involvement and greater voice in local politics. The cooperative project has enabled these women to transform their lives through bringing about economic, social, and political change. To date these women have succeeded in forming the cooperative structure which enables them to make their products from home while attending weekly meetings that consist of skills training, information, and networking. Under the cooperative name, these women have been able to add value to their products by marketing them as a social investment in the women of the community and their families. This marketing strategy has allowed these women to reach niche international handicraft and artisan markets. The cooperative {{is in the process of}} partnering with several key US based organizations to sell their products abroad, as well as tapping into existing markets in Costa Rica.

40|$|This paper explores {{assumptions}} about the drivers of forest cover change in a Payments for Environmental Services (PES) and Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) context in the Lam Dong Province in Vietnam. In policy discourses, deforestation is often linked to ‘poor’ and ‘ethnic minority’ households and their unsustainable practices such as the expansion of coffee production (and other agricultural activities) into forest areas. This paper applies a livelihood framework to discuss the links between livelihoods and land use amongst small-scale farmers in two communities. The findings of the livelihood survey demonstrate no clear linkages between poverty levels and unsustainable practices. In fact, the poorest segments were found to deforest the least. The ways in which current PES and REDD+ approaches are designed, do not provide appropriate solutions to address the underlying dimensions of issues at stake. The paper criticizes one-dimensional perspectives of the drivers behind deforestation and forest degradation often found in public policies and discourses. We suggest more comprehensive analyses of underlying factors encompassing the entire coffee production and land use system in this region. Addressing issues of land tenure and the scarcity of productive lands, and generating <b>viable</b> off-farm <b>income</b> alternatives seem to be crucial. Sustainable approaches for reducing deforestation and degradation could be possible through engaging with multiple stakeholders, including the business-oriented households {{in control of the}} coffee trade and of land transaction...|$|R

Career and technical education (CTE) programs can provide means for students to achieve starting salaries commensurate with those students who attend 2 -year or baccalaureate programs. Not all CTE programs will result in positions with high salaries; however, many of the programs dominated by men have considerably higher salaries than those programs customarily held by women. Along with higher salaries, these positions often have more options for growth. Occupational segregation has secured male dominance in many of the higher-paying vocational fields, while women largely participate in unpaid domestic services within the family (Bagilhole, 2002) or careers composed of low-mobility, low wage, and low-skilled jobs (Mastracci, 2004).

40|$|In {{the context}} of South Africa's {{pervasive}} poverty and mass unemployment, households provide an important private safety net for the unemployed. Using new South African Labour Force Survey panel data, I investigate how households cope with job separations and the resulting loss of earned income. Unsurprisingly, I find no evidence of an added worker effect among either men or women. Neither increases in employment or labor market attachment in the year following a household job separation. Instead, households rely on remittances and, to a lesser extent, savings {{in the wake of}} a job separation. I find some evidence that households are worse off after a job separation: households reduce expenditures (even in the absence of household composition changes), hold fewer financial assets and are more likely to report frequent food insecurity. Households have <b>viable</b> <b>income</b> replacement strategies to cope with the loss of earned income in the short run, but over the long run job separations are likely to strain these strategies.

Career development is ground-ed in career theory, including Super’s (1957) life-span career theory. Applied to {{career development}}, the significance of Super’s (1957) theory is that it emphasizes career development as an ongoing process that continues throughout an individual’s life. Career development programs and services can assist to “improve individual career awareness, exploration, choice, preparation, and management ” (Williams, Bragg, & Makela, 2008, p. 7; see also Herr & Cramer, 1996).

50|$|Waste-to-energy {{is one way}} {{to dispose}} of all {{combustible}} waste in which recycling alone is not economically <b>viable.</b> As <b>income</b> levels rise in the southern region of Brazil, citizens are urging officials to improve waste management systems. However, the results are limited as no commercial facilities are currently being constructed. Even though citizens and officials are beginning to understand the harm of landfills and the importance of waste management, most do not understand waste-to-energy systems. On the other hand, waste-to-energy industry leaders do not understand the current waste condition in Brazil. In order to provide specific solutions to problems in Brazil, the Waste to Energy Research Technology Counsel in Brazil is developing a hybrid municipal solid waste (MSW)/natural gas cycle. This system burns a small amount of natural gas that is 45% efficient and 80% of the energy that is produced by MSW is 34% efficient. Their patented system takes a small gas turbine and mixes it with preheated air. Another benefit of using low amounts of natural gas is the possibility of replacing it with landfill gas, ethanol, or renewable fuels. Another benefit is that this system does not change current incinerator technology, which allows it to use components that already exist in other waste-to-energy plants. Private sector involvement in the waste-to-energy industry includes companies such as Siemens, CNIM, Keppel-Seghers, Hitachi Zosen Inova, Sener, Pöyry, Fisia-Babcock, Malcolm Pirnie and others who are already established in Brazil and developing waste-to-energy projects. Some cities currently considering such projects are Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, São José dos Campos, São Bernardo do Campo and others.Clean development mechanism projects are also beginning to develop at some Brazilian landfills. These projects are established to collect gases produced on-site and convert them into energy. For example, at a landfill in Nova Iguaçu (Rio de Janeiro area), methane is being collected and converted into electricity. This process is expected to eliminate 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2012.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{identified}} factors, non-traditional collateral secured loans can be <b>viable</b> to low <b>income</b> borrowers {{in developing}} markets. By being innovative and adjusting the typical banking business model, these loans can provide funding {{to people who}} otherwise {{would not have been}} able to get funding through the formalised banking system. A large number of individuals, at the bottom of the pyramid in developing countries, do not have access to property rights (property is usually used as collateral in secured loans). The purpose of this study is to determine if non-traditional collateral secured loans can be provided to individuals, SME’s and entrepreneurs at the bottom of the pyramid in developing markets. A qualitative study was conducted from interviews with Heads of Credit, Chief Risk Officers and Secured Lending Heads in financial institutions that provide secured lending offerings in developing markets. The study indicates that specific behavioural trends are associated with secured loan repayments that indicate favourable for lending institutions. Economies of scale in collateral evaluation and monitoring, is a critical factor to this lending approach to enable cost reduction. Being entrenched in the market and pro-active management in a market where very little infrastructure exist is a key factor to success.
