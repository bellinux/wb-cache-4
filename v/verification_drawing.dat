40|$|In {{this article}} my {{main concern is}} the {{linguistic}} evidence for the view that metaphor is conceptual in nature. Since {{the fact that there}} is a great diversity of linguistic evidence for patterns of metaphorical thought has been, by and large, not emphasized enough, I overview a variety of such evidence, which can be derived from the study of different aspects of meaning within a particular language, crosslinguistically, and at a metalinguistic level. However, in itself the variety of linguistic evidence, even though it speaks very strongly for the idea that metaphor is conceptual in nature, is not sufficient to justify it. Therefore, recognizing the fact that claims about our conceptual system which are based on linguistic analyses alone remain within the “language – thought – language” circle, the article discusses also some kinds of nonlinguistic evidence for conceptual metaphors. Psycholinguistic research on metaphorical reasoning is presented as a major source of such nonlinguistic <b>verifications.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on Daniel Barenboim’s BBC Reith lectures of 2006, it is also argued that convergent evidence from language and music may serve to break open the “language – thought – language” circle...|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes process spaces, {{a simple}} and unified {{treatment}} for concurrency issues such as parallel composition, refinement, deadlock, livelock, and starvation. Processes are modeled as contracts over which executions may occur. The main innovation is that executions are abstract; {{this leads to a}} very general model. For trace-based executions, process spaces relate closely to trace theory and CSP, except that we do not attach alphabets or connectivity restrictions to processes. We revise several algebraic properties of process compositions and comparisons that are commonly known from concurrency theory. A novel transform reveals symmetries among usual process operations. For finite-trace processes, we have a tool that uses a public-domain BDD library.
